"Wow, I was in Baltimore towards the end of this.  My mom grew up in Silver Spring, MD which is a suburb of Baltimore and my brother happened to move there for a residency at UMM, met a nurse, fell in love, and started a life there.  My brother got married May 3 of that year.  They have some photos of him and his wife in a garden with national guard surrounding them because they hadn't been pulled out yet.  But for the week prior to the wedding things were pretty much fine, I mean I'm not trying to pretend like I was in the thick of the riots, or whatever, we were staying in an area that was more like in the inner harbor area, certainly not the 'ghetto' but there was the Friday night May 2 where a group of protestors walked through as we were leaving a restaurant and walking back toward our hotel the group walked down the street chanting something.  It wasn't scary or anything, I think that protest was done really well actually, they had cars driving slowly at the front of it and they slowed down to allow us to get across the street (I had my kids who were pretty small at the time, so I was thankful because it was about bedtime and if we had been trapped on the other side I wouldn't have felt right walking through a protest march) my daughter was 6 and thought it was some kind of party she wanted to chant and march with them, my son was 4 and didn't really know what was going on, but it's one of those memories that will stick with me, because in the end, this was about a man, a real human person with a family who died due to being arrested by 6 police officers for what?  Being black.  Being out in his own neighborhood.  What if that was my brother or someone in my family?  What if that was me?  What if I wasn't white and my family wasn't what I think of as middle class but actually isn't near wealthy enough to be actual middle class?  What if, what if, what if?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"After watching the video I still don't think it's fair on the institutions to call it racism.  It seems to me a more accurate description would be a discrimination against a certain culture in localised areas that has arisen due to a racist past. This 'systemic racism' as you call it is the system deadlocking itself in to a pattern of behaviour in response to a pattern of behaviour displayed by certain inhabitants. Probably due to the housing problems and lead poisoning you mentioned caused by past racist laws.  If the system does not itself mean to be racist, can you call it racist? I suppose that depends on your definition but unless someone can come up with a good anecdote to explain their point I think it has to intend to be racist to be labelled as one.  I think that's why you had all these comments saying racism is not a thing anymore (edit: for laws anyway), their definition differs from yours on a fundamental level.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Is giving a group of people they dislike a hard time really worth all this trouble? Since when has carrying a spring-loaded knife been an arrest-worthy offense anyway? It's not like he was brandishing it. I also hope that oppressed minorities realize that while this was indeed provoked, that doesn't automatically make any/all forms of retaliation justified. Their issue was with the misconduct of the police, considerably more of the city than just the police got caught up in the splash damage of their wrath.

"'The reasons behind everything' seem to be unknown to most people, right or left. Whenever I've seen defenses of riots in the past, it always feels emotional or statistical, both arguments that annoy me. On one hand, as a person with no criminal history (AFAIK) in my family, I always find it difficult to sympathize with criminals (but also understand that 'place' is important to someone's development, for better or worse), and furthermore as someone with cops in my family I understand that it's NOT EASY being a cop, not that it excuses everything. It seriously feels not like 'black and white' morality at times, but 'black and black', all around messy stuff, and frankly, I end up not caring because it has almost nothing to do with me. I share a skin color, but not a history. I'm basically just on the outside looking in at chaos and thinking of it as ALL on ALL sides over-reactionary.  This video is a really great thing because it gets across a truth that no one reports or cares about really, and again, when I say no one cares, I mean it seems like all sides. I'd like it if this kind of focused 'look, the system itself is seriously fucked up' motive was outwardly the ethos of movements like BLM but it's always felt to me like less 'We need to cause political change' and more 'I'm upset because a criminal I did not know was killed in an ambiguous situation'. No not all the victims are criminals, not every act is just, and cruelty such as what Gray is completely unacceptable, but I'm just not reactionary. I've never been able to look at a messed up situation and just take a side, especially not for a flimsy reason like 'we're the same color'. I'm also not saying I'm enlightened though, just unmoved by a lot of the issues of society because I myself have been subject to none of the problems, and don't feel like it has anything to do with me. I'll be honest that it's an almost 0% chance that I will *ever* do anything political myself, just wanted to say in a rambling comment that I appreciate efforts like this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Yes the Baltimore Ravens are a very good sports team, but football relies upon eleven players executing the intelligence supplied by a coach.  Baltimore needs an intelligent coach that supplies jobs that 'not so smart' resident can execute.

If anyone finds this like-for-like treatment a little shocking, perhaps try to imagine whether people in the local community would enjoy seeing disabled cops.   Probably not, actually.

"I also want to add that because many black people were forced into ghettos, they had little to no property taxes, which meant that their schools had little to no funding. This is why inner city schools are horrible. And poverty has a direct correlation to lack of education. Having good schools and education could be one of the biggest things that can help black communities. I'm a black woman, (People always assume I'm a white male online because of my diction lol.) and I try to talk about racism educationally. People immediately become defensive and angry, even though I used much of the same facts that you bring up in your video. I try to speak factually, rather than emotionally. But it doesn't matter, because as soon as people see me, they assume that I'm just an angry black women, despite the fact that I'm educated and am simply discussing history. Frustrating enough, usually people who become defensive are the reactionary ones.  This is why we need white people to be educated and speak up on racial issues. Despite the fact that I'm educated and  make it a point to speak from empirical observation rather than emotions, I'll only be seen as an angry black women. But if a white speaks on this issue, other white people just might listen. Thanks for using your platform to talk about other issues that might not directly effect you!

"Great Video, Thanks for sharing. People need to be aware violence is usually started at peaceful protests by World Governments using 'Agent Provocateurs', to justify using Gestapo jackboot thug tactics, for TV consumption to re-frame public sympathy and to justify violence to put down peaceful mass social movements by jailing and demonizing dissidents.. That's how everything from Occupy to Ferguson played out. And yes, evidence exists.

"I know this is a couple of years old, but the 'it brings attention' argument isn't just about it being on CNN. It's about the fact that once CNN starts talking about it, so do other people. CNN's coverage wasn't the end of the discussion.  That certainly doesn't make it an easy question to answer - you can't just assume that CNN showing burning cars will turn out to be a net good because the negative attention at the start might do more harm than any subsequent discussion it leads to. But the reverse assumption here, the one that casts it as an easy question to answer from the other direction, seems just as wrong, framing it as a choice between relative inattention (as you point out re the housing crisis for instance) and CNN's negative attention.  The choice is between relative inattention and a complex mix of attention: some of it is going to be negative and some of it will be positive, and there will be waves of responses that are positive and negative. How that calculus will shake out in a given scenario is hard to predict before it happens, and even before you see the character and reach of the waves of responses. The only thing that's pretty easy to answer is what happens without the community's violent reaction: it won't be discussed much at all.  Would this video even exist if the rioting had been less dramatic?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"On pretty much any riot, my view remains the same: it was appropriate to send the Army of the Potomac to shoot white rioters in New York City until they stopped lynching blacks, burning orphanages for black kids, and rioting. This put an end to that nonsense very quickly, and the next time the draft officers came through poor white neighborhoods volunteering them into the war effort, things were really nice and quiet. Different year, still humans, still respond to the same stimuli, same thing would work roughly the same way.  We can understand the poor little rioters, go into history justifying 'uprisings', and do all those other nice friendly compassionate gentle things that defenders of this nonsense want, but it doesn't change anything: the howling mob is for blood-soaked _sans culottes_ and third-world shitholes with wildly corrupt kleptocracies stuffing their face on live television while the little people starve. Whoever is out there rioting, no matter whether they're self-righteous white liberals blocking ICE facilities and shitting where they stand so a city is stuck with a $20,000 cleanup bill, or a mob of black people burning and looting because 'muh systemic racism,' you get more of the same unless you make it clear that that bullshit is unacceptable and that there will be consequences. Painful consequences, perhaps fatal consequences, but severe consequences nonetheless.  Those self-righteous anti-ICE prigs can freely assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances; that's explicitly their right. But they don't have the right to block a thoroughfare, and if they damage property, they should be sent a repair bill. Same thing with the poor oppressed blacks in black neighborhoods with black city government: assemble and petition, but when you break windows, the police get to break you. This treads on no one's freedoms, for there is no right to destroy property and be exempt from making recompense.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"he was a drug dealer with multiple related charges, caught in the act of distribution, swallowed his own drugs and ran. Had a drug-induced episode and acted violently and in a self-harming way. Stop trying to paint him as an innocent man who will killed by cops because he was a black man running  And don't give the bullshit excuse he was the victim of paint poisoning that made him act violent. He is a grown man who swallowed his own drugs and hallucinated. He is a victim of his own actions.  On April 12, 2015, officers working in a high-crime, drug sales area of Baltimore observed Freddie Gray, 25, involved in the possible hand-to-hand sales of drugs. As police approached, Gray fled on foot and was pursued by the officers who captured him. When the officers searched Gray, they found him in possession of a spring-assisted knife, which they believed to be illegal. Gray was arrested, handcuffed, and placed into the rear of a transportation van but was not secured in a seat belt.  During transportation to the Western District police station, Gray became agitated and subsequently suffered a serious medical emergency. He was comatose and hospitalized for a serious spinal cord injury and later died on April 19th.  After only a 24-hour investigation by state investigators, six Baltimore officers involved in Freddie Gray's arrest and transportation were charged with several crimes, including second-degree murder in connection with Gray's death.  A leaked medical examiner's report of Freddie Gray's autopsy and toxicology reports showed that Gray suffered a devastating spinal cord injury after his head slammed into a wall in the back of the police van. The Medical Examiner who authored the report found no evidence that Gray's spinal injury was caused by any use of police force during his arrest. The forensic medical evidence indicates that Gray broke his neck and that the wound to his head matched an extended metal bolt in the back of the van. The autopsy found no other evidence of trauma that would be consistent with force-related injuries on Gray's body. No police were riding in the back of the van with Gray during his transportation.  Well-known forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht has opined that Gray's manner of death was consistent with a 'rough ride' in the police transportation van. However, my colleague, the eminent forensic pathologist Dr. Vincent DiMaio, who has worked scores of high-profile death cases, has suggested that Gray's manner of death should actually be more accurately classified as 'accidental or undetermined.' As a Certified Medical Investigator myself, I tend to agree with Dr. DiMaio's opinion at this point.  Another prisoner in the van, identified as Donta Allen, initially told Baltimore investigators and a Washington Post reporter that Gray had been agitated, screaming, and banging around in the van during transportation. Allen told police and the media that he thought Gray was 'intentionally trying to hurt himself.' He later recanted this statement. A search warrant application describes Gray during transportation as 'irate' and that he 'continued to be combative in the police wagon.'  Freddie Gray's toxicology report showed that he was under the influence of significant levels of cannabinoids and opium at the time he was hospitalized. This finding would be forensically consistent with the possibility of Gray swallowing the drugs he was attempting to sell in order to destroy evidence. The presence of drugs in Gray's system would also support his past criminal history as a drug dealer. In the past eight years, Gray had been arrested on no less than 14 occasions for felony possession of controlled substances and possession with intent to distribute. Again, Freddie Gray was only 25 at the time of his death.  The narrative presented by activists, including members of the BLM movement, is that the Baltimore officers involved in this incident murdered Freddie Gray. There are no forensic evidence or witness statements to date that support this assertion. The autopsy report detailing Gray's traumatic injuries and drug influence--and prisoner Allen's initial statements to police and the media--are far more favorable to the defendant officers than to the prosecution's theory of criminality. Therefore, the BLM movement's assertion that Baltimore police 'murdered' Freddie Gray is unsubstantiated at this time. No officers have been convicted of any alleged criminal acts, and the trials for the six officers are still in progress after a mistrial in one case","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"These are all good points as to why black people still experience high amounts of poverty but not the rise of violence. You can't attribute nation wide violent black gangs to lead poisoning. The reason why police are so aggressive is the war on drugs. Older generations bemoan how their community has degenerated, they experienced poverty, extreme discrimination, but they used to leave their houses unlocked. Families who had a radio or tv let the neighborhood kids come and go so they could enjoy a program. Despite the fact that more black families enjoy owning TVs they have to lock up their possesions or move out, like some famous rappers had to after violent robberies. You really need to add decriminalizing drugs on your list of solutions, and then lastly blacks need to repair the family. Only they can do that our only responsibility is to promote an environment for those conditions to flourish.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

However I work in a very large housing authority in Dublin and a very great many of the types of problems described in this video equally apply to vast tracts of the administrative area covered by my beat. And it ain't racism mate because it is 90% white here,  Lots of endemic poverty true enough. But the way welfare is structured is very debilitating to a community when most of the community members are welfare recipients (NB: I AM NOT ADVOCATING AGAINST WELFARE, I just think how it is structured , accessed and maintained needs to be looked at).  And one massive and inescapable fact (be it West Dublin in Ireland or the 'hood in USA) is that baby daddy being so often absent is a big big problem we are facing.  This here certainly is an area where the communities themselves can begin a revolution by changing that one socio-cultural norm right there.  Anyway thats my two cents.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"16:40 They're not wrong about that bit though.  If they weren't even born yet, etc.. then they aren't responsible for it.  I'm not saying that it isn't good for them to be informed and get out of their bubble per se, but there are often better ways to remedy an issue than to do so specifically by race.  For instance, one of the rights favorite topics is affirmative action, with the most legitimate criticism being that there do indeed exist white people that are in equally bad socio-economic conditions.  If socio-economic factors were used only, excluding race, these programs would still help almost all the same people as they do now and wouldn't be open to this this kind of attack that actually does have some merit.  Also, that stings the most for other groups that are non-white caucasians, like arabs.  They will be subject to the same kinds of racist shit, but are classified as caucasian and are excluded from things like 'diversity hires.'  Unless one thinks these should go particular to black people as some sort of reparations for the slavery by the white people.... but then you need to deal with issues like, how far back do you want to go?  And why should more recent black immigrants receive those benefits?  It's a thorny topic.  Overall a great video though.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh, I see. The lead poisoning is what causes blacks to misbehave, apprehended by cops, which can instigate rioting. The lead poisoning is due to racist policies of the past. There is no mention of the time-table these policies ended, what took their place, and the direction things have gone since then, but who care about that?  - White people evil policies exist - policies lead to lead poising in blacks  - blacks riot  Ok, now I understand why blacks riot more than whites, Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans and every other ethnic group in the US. Oppression, oppression oppression.  The only thing I don't understand is why black people today riot so much more than white people did a few decades ago despite black elevated lead level rates are so much lower now than they were for whites a few decades ago.

"I still think if anything the riots were not big and impactful enough. If anything this should have turned into an outright uprising, it is fucking outrageous and unacceptable when the authorities not only protect police who through willful neglect and contempt for the safety and life of those in their charge, when those in charge let these cops get away with murdering the people they're supposed to protect in the most cold and psychopathic fashion, but then have the gall to use military tactics against the rightfully outraged populace demanding justice. It was a clear indication that they consider themselves hostile occupiers whose purpose is to suppress any and all dissent and that they don't give a single shit about anything but brutally enforcing their quasi-military dictatorship where they get to herd, cull and control the population at will.

I have lived in Baltimore county almost my entire life, so Baltimore is my 'haunt' but I lived in the northern Cockeysville/Timonium area, in relatively affluent suburbs so I never really was part of the city, more a neighbor.  I live a lot closer now, and I see the sort of dilapidation almost daily. I also worked as a Lyft driver and ended up driving through the city many times, and let me tell you, it is one thing to hear about poverty and urban decay, it is another thing to see a full street where most of the houses are boarded up with plywood, or the windows are gone, the paint all falling out, and even sometimes missing a roof. Some even had freaking trees and vines growing through them. It reminded me of Dishonored 2 where witches grew vines and trees through houses on purpose, but this was real.  And yet, 3 or 4 blocks down, suddenly you're in better neighborhoods, or school districts and you wouldn't even know that there is such stuff a mere few thousand feet away.

"Ahhh tl;dr shitty comment on old video that's unnecessary, uninformed, and will be an object of shame in my future by how ignorant it is  I feel like focusing on the lead poisoning argument is kind of tertiary to a lot of the other examples of racism in the US. I get that you want to give an example as to why Freddy would potentially have been more violent, but by spending so much time on that you ignore how because a disproportionately small number of teachers are black and many of the white teachers (particularly in elementary school) will consciously or subconsciously give preference to white students, that may also have an affect on black children dropping out at a higher rate. This is especially problematic with gender stereotypes like 'girls are good at writing and boys are good at math,' because if teacher favoritism by gender is already well-established and often consciously spoken about as if factual in public schools (it was in my public school anyway) that further encourages favoritism by race. Obviously you picked the lead poisoning argument because it's much more concrete and easily measurable than this, but I just don't see the lead poisoning part as being such a big deal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Okay. I really enjoy the content you produce but I feel compelled to be frank with you. You need to stop tone policing people who choose to take direct action against capitalist property. CVS has a huge history of racial profiling and discrimination. If people of color want to destroy a store run by a multi billion dollar corporation that both harasses and discriminate against POC you don't get to tell them how to appropriately resist.  I hate to say it but being 'anti-riot' is just peak white liberalism.  I usually love your videos, but when you poopoo rioters you sound like the peak liberals that snitched on my comrades who took an active stance against the racist police, capitalism and fascists. My comrades were doxxed by neo Nazi because liberals that were concerned about the 'violent protestors' ratted them out to the pigs.   My comrades who were arrested, who were people of color and trans people who were taking direct action to fight against capitalism and the police and because liberalism values private property over the right of the oppressed to fight against their oppressors.  Being an advocate for 'peaceful protest only' is counter-revolutionary because marching in circles won't overthrow the bourgeois.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Its a stupid perspective too because it sees law just as the most basic official side of it and ignores everything else in society as individuals and private business that it assumes is free for all, when really this unoffical side of social interactions and systems is often the most significant (like the UK should by law be a theocracy but it is far more secular than the US with a secular constitution). But the tricky part is once a community is really fucked over, the problems come from within too so this is really hard to adress without placing blame either side which Black Lives Matter seems a bit eager to do as well as the alt-righters.

"Idk, man. How is it on white people to get informed? Why should not everybody get informed? Also, while I do get your line of argument, it seems to me to be much less about race than about poverty. You mention people being cheated out of their payments, but my question is this: What do you suggest? Either these people have the mental capacity to deal with contracts or they don't. Now if they do, then it is fine and dandy for them to lose everything because they made a bad decision. If, on the other hand, they do not have that mental capacity and thus have to be protected from this predatory behavior, it would stand to reason that they do also not have the mental capacity necessary to make a whole bunch of other decisions (especially those that effect others or shape government) Finally, if somebody commits a crime against me, I don't give a single fuck whether they had an entire bar of lead for breakfast... I want that cunt dead.  Telling people that in that case, they just have to have more sympathy and give a little more money to the perpetrator, is simply not a winning line of argument.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The real solution to this is to make the unofficial segregation of America official. Let Black police officers police Black neighborhoods exclusively. That way when a prisoner is killed via police negligence it won't cause the tribal backlash of ' *they* killed one of *us*'!  The worse thing that could happen would be in your naive ideas were enacted. You'd embolden criminals, hamstring the police and the result of that would be an explosion in violent crime.

"I feel very much the same in regards to wanting to educate myself on the situation of why there is such strong racial tension, especially considering what you've just brought up with the evidence of what, to me, is clearly a very sneaky way for racists to have kept their power and abuse minorities and at the same time have it being perfectly legal which is vile. Sadly most of the people who enacted many of those laws and more than likely dead and profited from that, however if this were signal-boosted then we may see more of a change and I always do my part to keep an open mind.  What's worse is I have spent years unemployed and on benefits where many white people were complaining how benefits system (our version of Welfare) is skewed towards minorities or anyone who comes into the country, but I do not follow that line 100%, especially as many of the people who say this fail to properly prepare for interviews or put much effort into job searching since, I believe, many of them have given up already and simply go on these courses supplied by both the DWP and charity organisations to just go through the motions.  We have had quite a race eruption over here after the Brexit vote, but overseas in the media it looked far worse than what was really going on where some cases made it look like there was some-kind of purge going on every street of the country. That being said, white supremacists were showing up more and they did threaten to march where I was about to join the anti-supremacist march against them, but they cancelled so luckily Southampton didn't look like the most racist city in England, but I heard there were places that they did march, but not for too long. That being said, I'm ashamed of their existence at all.  Nowadays however, people are so sick of the whole Brexit situation and whenever it comes up in the papers everyone groans or rolls their eyes due to complex political motions on the situations and many not understanding what Brexit really meant to begin with is just leading to a lot of frustration that, sadly, people take out on minorities or anyone from outside the country. The current trend is hate against Muslims and the Polish, the latter which hits me personally as my Grandfather was Polish and fought in WW2 and stayed in Whales because, due to Poland still being under Russian control and Churchill not wanting to start another war with the Russians, many Polish citizens who returns were killed so he had no choice. When I explain that, most people had no idea that's what happened as usually what any education on WW2 focuses on is Hitler, his treatment of the Jews and as there was no additional information taught on the subject I and many other people assumed after his death everything was cleaned up, when clearly that's not the case.  I hope to continue to spread information so people think twice about their hatred. Many are focuses hatred on the people who flee Syria, but clearly don't ask them WHY they are fleeing their home as many believe it's because they can sponge off our benefit system which is often supported by the outrageous stories in right-wing media sources that focus on when they're being abused by minorities.

"Martin Luther King Jr. on riots:  'Urban riots must now be recognized as durable social phenomena. They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community. They are a distorted form of social protest. The looting which is their principal feature serves many functions. It enables the most enraged and deprived Negro to take hold of consumer goods with the ease the white man does by using his purse. Often the Negro does not even want what he takes; he wants the experience of taking. But most of all, alienated from society and knowing that this society cherishes property above people, he is shocking it by abusing property rights. There are thus elements of emotional catharsis in the violent act. This may explain why most cities in which riots have occurred have not had a repetition, even though the causative conditions remain. It is also noteworthy that the amount of physical harm done to white people other than police is infinitesimal and in Detroit whites and Negroes looted in unity.'

"I absolutely love this video! It's informative and hard hitting and very funny at the perfect moments. I'd love to see more content like this. I would like to contribute to this conversation about solutions and respond to a few things you said because I have a few disagreements that I hope you'll listen to. 1. You stated in the video that you don't think riots are good because they get the wrong attention. While I cannot condone the indiscriminate destruction of stores and esspecially the burning of a FUCKING SENIORS HOME IN CONSTRUCTION (seriously like who the fuck does that) I do think that constructive riots and violent push back against police is necessary. Now I should state that we probably have different goals in mind. You said you want to see reform (which I want to see as well in the time being) but I see a better solution to communities and humanity as a whole to be the abolition of police and prisons and instead advocating for different solutions to crime. I do not have time to explain everything in the prison abolition movement or all of my political beliefs but I'm more than happy to explain if asked. But back to my point. I do not think that my goals can come from action through the state because of how dependant upon prisons the state is and the fact that I doubt it would be taken seriously in the first place. Instead I think actions like what the Black Panther Party took is far more effective in achieving these ends in a constructive and productive manner. In fact most of what the BPP did is what I have in mind as a solution though I would like to mention that I do not fully endorse them as many were Leninists and Maoists while I am an Anarcho-communist (once again don't have time to explain but gladly will if asked). 2. You also talk about non-discriminatory home loans which I also believe is not a good enough solution. This being that it relies upon the market which cannot be a solution to things because it justifies only helping people if there is a profit involved. While I know that is clearly not what you are advocating I do think it is an inevitable outcome of market solutions. It also relies on old systems of loaning which is open to exploitation by real estate agencies, lawyers, banks, and I guarantee many others which I can't even imagine. Instead I see direct action methods like squatting in unused buildings and general/tenant strikes as a better solution as it give the people direct control over their housing which they've been denied for so long and would continue to be denied under reformist solutions.  3. And lastly you talk about education reform which is pretty much just a repeat of what I said before. Rather than asking for state help, teachers can take direct action to take over schools and others can join then in making a good learning environment that actually focuses of making learning interesting. There are incredible textbooks that are free online and far better methods of schooling (like democratic schooling) along with many organisations which will help to take this action. It would need to be a community effort to teach kids that would have to be handled on a case by case basis as no set-in-stone solution can ever work for everyone. These are just some of the points I felt I could add and I hope you look into them or if you have any disagreements to respond. I may have even just misunderstood what you meant by reform and commented for no reason. Thank you for reading this all the way through!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As an 'Anti-SJW', I have my opinions about the whole mess, but lots of respect to you for digging through the whole thing to find root causes and highlight them in, honestly, a very well edited video.  I learned a few things I didn't know, so that's always good.  A lot of the argument and shitstorm that came from this whole thing was the two extremes bickering with one-another; and I will concede that nuance was thrown out the window.  Before even watching this I already held the view that predatory lending should be illegalized, this more or less affirmed it. Structured payment plans from the government should also not be allowed to be sold, or at least Freddie should have been forced to seek a financial review of some kind so he wouldn'tve gotten screwed so bad.  (My problems with this video are mostly based on semantics, which I don't think will resolve any issues if debated; so you're welcome to ignore this paragraph, just know that a lot is my own opinion.) However, this does steer back to 'Everything is systemic racism' argument being flawed; the systems that caused these problems seems to have been thoroughly dismantled, to the point were financial restitution is being paid. Saying that noone thinks Black lives actually matter is moderately disingenuous for a video that had been really solid thus far.  I understand it's speculation and you're entitled to your opinion, I just simply disagree. I'm also not a racist for disagreeing with arguments or segments of arguments from Black Lives Matter, regardless of perspective. Mostly just throwing that in there as a preemptive means of getting it out there that I don't think Black people should be executed in the streets or some such nonsense I'm sure would be spewed at me. Also as a white person living in a community that doesn't suffer these kinds of extreme problems, I don't see how I bear any personal blame or responsibility for: A) My ancestors B) My government C) Someone else's ancestors (especially in another city where noone in my family tree has lived in) just because they have similar skin color to me The GOVERNMENT DOES, however, owe it to the people they've wronged to reasonably rectify aforementioned fuck ups.  As a moral human being I feel compelled to help those in need, and as such I do things like donate to charities and speak out against things I feel that are worth speaking out against. However this does nothing to say of the scum of the Earth assholes preying on people like Freddie who seem incapable of making sound logical decisions, or are at least in a state of mind that can be taken advantage of. I also don't take trolls in YouTube comments or twitter very seriously. I don't see why it's as much of an issue as it is interpreted as. Very minute percentages of views end up with comments at all, much less vitriolic ones like the horrible shit you saw and see.  As far as what value Black Lives Matter holds? I think it has had and does have well-intentioned and good people in the movement that simply wish to see change to a system that has been cast in poor light as of late. However there are several (even some in leadership positions) that hold distasteful positions that would tank any organization that hold them. BLM does not have the luxury of being a coherent organization and as such the unquantifiable 'rotten apples' so to speak can't just be cast away as the immoral bigots that they are. You know the ones, supporting riots, holding extreme contempt for all police officers, etc. 'Pigs in a Blanket, Fry 'em Like Bacon'  Despite the good of a system that is very effective overall, as the total number of people in general killed by police in general are far outnumbered by victims of homicides committed by regular citizens by several multitudes, there should be efforts made to rectify wrongs and seek justice. There are obviously flaws in the Criminal Justice system, BUT not enough so to warrant vilifying the entire organization nationwide.    Nuance is needed indeed. Something many people lack overall, not just DEM EVIL ANTI-SJW SUBSCRIBERZ  I hope this contributes to a healthy discussion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Some of the logical tenets of this video are shaky. I think its important to understand the legacy of slavery and segregation and the vestiges it still holds rooted in poverty. You really aren't presenting anything new to the equation that ironically Sargon and Dave Rubin haven't talked about. Both are for Educational reform and Police reform and have heard them talk about it as such.  I think this constant line and divide on race is mostly because of SJWS when the reality most people get that about poverty and how it disproportionately effects minorities due to American legacies. This isn't a point of contention..but a old hat Democratic idea that I've and I assume most have been behind for ages. I think you forgo the enemy as racist, or indifferent when the reality most have been on the same bus with you the entire time.  You going on about SJWs and BLM and so on bring a certain irony to me when you cut along the lines of SJWs and non ones..no one ever disagreed with reforming education, reforming the police..and so on. This is a pretty basic point and it tickles me that the sum of this video comes down to a conclusion that isn't anything new but something the people you seem to separate from BLM and SJWs have come to ages ago. The race baiting nonsense of the BLM and SJWs is so laughable because of shit like this.  The little Trump shot also is very telling. You key in on his 'law and order' meme which i disagree with but totally forget him talking about the root of the problem. The issues in Urban areas and how we need to support and help them. Like It's very easy to paint a one sided look instead of seeing Trump as a little more complicated cluster fuck of a person. Him meeting with black leaders, people and discussing the issue already should tell you something that he is aware of the problem and cares to a degree. But dog whistling to fellow SJWs about racism while ignoring this fact for a proponent of a hierarchy of racism is well pretty pathetic. It makes me wonder if you care about fixing the problem or you care more about the racial issues involved.   That needs to be addressed sure which you did greatly(Very informative and interesting)..but you seem to fail to talk about a equally..and more important problem. The wealth distribution and other far worse issues with poverty then lead paint. Without addressing the issue of poverty you aren't fixing anything but trying to put forth haphazard solutions with meme words like education, racist laws, and police (Not to say these don't desperately need fixed and addressed.). Just that these are aliments of a bigger problem of the cycle of poverty and crime. If we can fix the issues of poverty we can fix the vast majority of issues within groups suffering from the vestiges of slavery and segregation. But you'll never fix these by memeing away aliments that most rational people already agree on. Fighting poverty in these communities and bringing healthy jobs to these communities should be the center line of a discussion like this. I know this is a specific interference to a situation but you seem to speak and broaden it without talking about the elephant in the room. It leaves me feeling like the video itself is a bit racist and racy to me. Painting a layer of race over a issue doesn't make the issue go away.  Class conflict is still a huge part of this problem.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is your best video. However, there are two issues.   First (14:50), you linked the acquittal of the six officers involved in Freddie Gray's death to institutional issues with police. The fact is that the prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, withheld evidence which caused the charges to be dropped.   Second, I feel like you could have made a stronger case by not using racist youtube comments to show that there's still work to be done - this place can be a cesspool on any topic. The contention from those opposed to that notion has never been that racists don't exist, it is that there is not enough evidence that public institutions are currently racist. This video alludes to the fact that many of the policies that were racist have been reformed or removed and we're observing residual effects.   How these effects should be dealt with is another set of complex issues. It would be (has been) unproductive and simplistic to divide people into the oppressed and their allies on one side versus the dumb racists who just don't get it on the other. For example education reform can be sliced several ways - parents' rights to school choice, privatisation and the scope of government involvement, the content of curricula etc - that have nothing to do with race but can appear racial.  Many on the anti-sjw side believe that society in its haste to implement social justice politically (instead of letting it arise naturally) will lead to harmful consequences (unintended or otherwise). An oft cited example of social engineering going awry is the deleterious effect of welfare on the black american family.  I felt like it would have been more persuasive to make the positive case for enacting social justice policies rather than smearing the opposition.  Anyways, cheers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This doesn't even *touch* us (I mean we did go to Mondawmin sometimes but it was pretty easy to say 'Mmmmm maybe not *right now*'.  I remember shooting a video that day from Homewood campus showing how calm and nice out it was; you could barely hear any helicopters.   This was after everyone at work was told to go home early. My office was over the front atrium so I could hear all these white people telling each other to stay safe or whatever. And each time I'm like, 'Hey I know you lady and I know where you live. You're just gonna go university to Falls Rd. and then buck it the fuck outta here to your McMansion in the county. Fuck your 'stay safe''.

"I think that riots _do_ have a positive effect, even if it doesn't seem like it. I've said it before, but even Ferguson's police chief agreed that they changed the city's representative make up. It worked. It's not about the media attention from the country at large, it's about what changes in the local. There's a reason MLK didn't condemn them, and called them 'the voice of the oppressed'. That said, I do think riots could be _more_ effective if they weren't disjointed catharsis. Don't burn nascent old people homes or pharmacies. Also frankly I'm surprised there wasn't more rioting sooner, if they're imprisoning students and firing on them. Fuck that, that's not even systemic oppression, that's direct.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You make a lot of good points here. I think the overarching point is that we shouldn't hold up racial disparities as an indictment of being black or 'the black race.' That's a  horrible thing to do. Every one of these horrible incidents is a human tragedy. Freddy Gray wasn't a 'bad person,' he was a human being with terrible life circumstances. There's a basic empathy we need to have.  But, I think you're being a bit misleading by seeming to claim it's either 'black people are innately terrible' OR it's a discrete set of present-day environmental and legal problems imposed on black people. There's a real question, what is 'racism' versus what is a 'racial disparity?' It strikes me as a very complicated question.  On a practical level, white people are never going to show up and cure racial disparities to the point they would be in if not for racism/slavery/segregation. And, we can be non-judgmental of the individuals and still think the 'conservative' concerns about black people, crime, drug use, family structure and culture matter. The same can be said for the poverty stricken communities of coal country, none of these concerns are just a black and white issue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The situation in America is unique and very different to many other countries. For instance when Britain ended slavery.. the slaves lived elsewhere.. we didnt have to develop this hatred of the 'other'. Its strange tho, cos I think it was Washington? married a black girl, (or several) and had plans to basically send coloured women out to the frontiers to marry the single white men to make the country coffee coloured. Southerners had a different plan tho.  Its a very long, and very complicated story, and a lot of americans would rather look the other way.

"I always thought the riot was a police tactic.  Until I became exposed to the Internet's largely ignorant masses, I had grown up in primitive, activists circles and thought it common knowledge protests of a particularly threatening nature would be subverted by paid instigators setting fires or smashing windows, thus garnering the excuse for a 'police riot'.  MFW i find the majority of internet peeps think the __protesters__ are the ones rioting.  imo, the riots were unjustifiable because they did not focus on the precinct or the courthouses, the sources of public outrage, and instead became suspiciously cannibalistic against the very communities from which the protesters were rooted.  I remember hearing reports from Baltimore organizers complaining about protesters coming from all over the country and, in some cases, assuming positions of leadership within the movement.  I do not wish to cast suspicion or paranoia, I really think there is a need for demonstrators and organizers to accept 'traveling activists' who feel solidarity for the cause, but do so with the knowledge that for every protest-turned-riot there presents an opportunity for defense contractors to showcase and advertise the latest in crowd suppression technology and doctrine.  It's not paranoid, but practical to assume, any established radical group can become the target for a law enforcement agency intent on subverting and engineering tactics;  the cause of these instigators are not to deescalate.  We are all becoming victims of the Riot-Police Industrial Complex.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And yes, here in Germany the things I heard about Baltimore were: 'There are riots, something with black people and police brutality....' And that's it (Though to be fair we had/have our own set of problems here, like far right groups setting refugee homes on fire in Saxonia). So I'm finally more educated on this subject, and atleast got a very detailed analysis about it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Best video I've seen on this topic to date. It's really refreshing to get the whole historical picture on this that formulates a thesis on a empirical basis, not emotional reaction.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know it's not the usual way of doing things to make a video about events from a year and a half ago. But I find it's hard to say anything very worthwhile about current events. You never know the whole story yet, and you haven't had any time to think about it. So what you end up doing is 'reacting,' i.e. spewing your first-pass gut feelings. And that's what a lot of YouTube commentary is: 'reactions.'  Maybe a better way to talk about current events is to look at recent history. You can get a fuller story, and you have some retrospective distance. That's what I'm trying to do in this video: not just to tell the history of the Baltimore uprising but also to better understand similar uprisings that are likely to occur in the years ahead.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
