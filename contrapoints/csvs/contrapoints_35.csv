"Violence—it's fun! Is that bad?  This video goes to dark places so please take the content warning seriously. <3"
"I still feel upset when committing senseless violence in video games."
"God those cocktails look great"
"Wow I did not see a reference to one of the worst events in my country's history coming"
"was this before antifa?"
"This is definitely my favorite contrapoints film"
"Can't have fundamentalism without 'fun'!"
"There's a line in that movie The Fog of War that sticks with me: 'Proportionality should be a guideline in war.' I think what it means is that you shouldn't commit any more violence than is necessary to meet your objective. Punching wanna-be nazis for the lulz is definitely not necessary to meet our objective. If they were to become an actual mortal threat then obviously that changes things."
"I'm sure everyone who's played Sims has at least at one time taken the ladder out of the pool."
"Huurrrr! My side gud. YOur sIde Baadddd! Why am I even trying?"
"I like it when contrapoints videos conclude with 'fuck, I don't know, what do you fucking want from me?'   At least she's honest and just as confused as all of us."
"0:36    i should've been warned that i would be hungry watching this"
"An action gains it's moral frequency through intent."
"What's the name of the classical baroque music durin the breakfast scene in the opening?"
"I think violence is only entertaining because it amounts to drama - which is entertainment when it's not at your expense."
"Louis CK did nothing wrong"
"This is an American thing, you can enjoy violence as long as the people getting hurt are 'villains' and there is some sort of Judaic old testament revenge violence involved. That's why the world thinks American films are retarded and pathetic"
"Oh i admit to thinking about the enjoyment of violence but i don't enjoy the consequences of violence. Like i enjoy the thought about sex but the act gives me a panic attack.  This does indeed bring an interesting subject to light. Violence is OK if it's the right violence morally. But it's still violence. And the morals change all the time."
"that's the british airways song"
"The thought of you and Lindsay Ellis being friends gives me life."
"Tabby dancing is the best thing ever."
"when tabby opened the door I audibly cheered and shook my fist in the air enthusiastically. Why has tabby replaced my brain? Why do all my brain cells have little cat ears and bats. Why did contra, in trying to create a satire of far left inability to provide a good image, create our literal mascot?"
"K I know I'm a weirdo for this but I just legit love to have your videos going on a playlist while I'm going about my daily life on a very loud Bluetooth speaker (so I can hear you over the sounds of me doing dishes mostly) and have gotten more than a few raised eyebrows and questions like 'what on Earth are you listening to?' From my mother lol but I just love the way you approach these incredibly complex topics so much that I'm happy to rewatch years old videos I've already seen and heard because tbh you're basically my conscience lol ok that's all I guess, the four shots of vodka I did in the last hour just really love you lol but seriously you're a goddess please never leave my life kthanxbyeeee"
"Righteous Sadism is definitely a thing with serial killers. They are called Missionary Killers. People with flimsy moral beliefs that think what they are doing is cleansing the world. *Insert eye roll*"
"Violence is part of life, what really suck is that some old fart is propting it and will never face the consequences, or suffer any sort of violence in return"
"Me: Aww... What do I do now that i have watched all of Contra's videos? Myself: You could always... re-watch them...? I: Wait a minute, that's a great idea! Gosh I love myself..."
"I love that you showed a clip of the pepper spray incident at UC Davis! I was in that area that day, and usually walk where it happened on my way to work, but avoided it that day only because there was too much going on there. The next day/that night I figured out why. FB blew up, and then a lengthy process and investigation started. I had actually met the cop that did the spraying once at work, he seemed nice. Perceptions can be quite deceiving sometimes"
"MICHAEL FOOKOLT I'm dead 😂"
"Vote for BERNIE #2020"
"Love, love, love the Courtney Love cosplay!"
"now that's one hell of a content warning"
"GTA is prob my fave game franchise, i just like running people at the sidewalk over with my car/motorcycle"
"OMG I fucking love Boney M!"
"Dom nat😩😍"
"Kill Bill is fucking wild and I love it so much"
"'So now 'woke' ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny. I personally drowned several of my babies and it was very traumatic for me—'  ContraPoints: 'Why did I become an SJW again?' 😂😂😂  Best joke in the whole video."
"Incredible and thought provoking video. I may never be able to fall on a side because of the pure existential pain of one person suffering unspeakable terror, for no good reason. It just makes you think there’s just no point. That casualty that is arguably necessary for justice and progress is its own singular apocalypse. One mind enduring unfathomable pain for no other reason than to justify the means just gets to me. Life is cruel and just blind chance though. How does one find the hope to care about their fellow people knowing that everything is temporary and ultimately meaningless? Sorry for this rant. Moral responsibility of revolution is a very tough issue."
"I was doing the laundry and drinking wine when you put on the Alex costume. Way to challenge me straightness."
"The scene in a Clockwork Orange where they beat up the homeless man was filmed in my home town because the town's brutalist, dystopian architecture suited the tone of the film. I did not enjoy growing up there."
"Nobody: Natalie: *putting clothes in the dishwasher*"
"The bit with Tabby getting tipsy on that weird drink and dancing adds a nice 'breather' touch to an otherwise dark and morbid video."
"Confused"
"The truth is that I think humans do (and in an evolutionary sense have to) enjoy violence. However, this enjoyment is inhibited by empathy with the victims and social norms. I would describe myself as a very non-violent person, but as soon as there is no real victim (as in movies/videogames/martial arts/paintball), I really enjoy it"
"Officially want 20 minutes of Tabby dancing to 'Rasputin.'"
"Content Warning: this video depicts a very intelligent discussion which will make you feel dumb in comparison"
"I'm an old dude. These  ContraPoints have reminded me the reason I'm a liberal.  Since 2016 I kinda checked out, and the concerns of SJWs really weren't my own.  But the brain fuel of these videoa, with the absolutely hilarious presentation. Natalie, thanks for these.  You're getting the spark relit."
"Fuck, that egg moment tho..."
"When I finally seize the means of production 12:11"
"Catgirls of the world unite!"
"'Revolutionaries didn't choose armed struggle as the best path; it's the path that oppressors imposed on the people. So the people only have two choices, to suffer or to fight.' - Castro   'The lesson I took away from the end of the campaign was that, we had no alternative to violence and armed resistance. Time and time again we used all nonviolent weapons in our arsenal, speeches, deputations, marches and strikes... all to no avail and met by the iron fist. A freedom fighter learns the hard way that the oppressor defines the nature of the struggle, and the oppressed is left with no recourse but to mirror the tactics of the oppressor.' - Mandela"
"honestly i didn't like a clockwork orange because it was weird"
"you should make a horror movie"
"Sometimes I feel there is more to disproportionate force than just some kinda sadism....in case of a more powerful aggressor, it is to keep the powerless in 'their place'. So for seemingly innocuous things (often things that are not even crimes...like how in many Indian villages the upper castes have attacked and murdered the 'lower castes' for 'daring' to wear fashionable clothes/walk without taking off their footwear before the village headman's house, marrying an uppercaste girl, etc etc. They are mainly done to keep the fear, and to pacify their own fear of the social order changing.  On the other end, if we are the powerless and we get the rare chances to get back at the powerful who screw us generally, sometimes a disproportionate response is with an intent to also, send the message that their shit will not be tolerated (ironic how 'don't tread on me' is used by the wrong group, lol), and to think twice of consequences before screwing with someone (something which previously had no consequence).  The only difference is that when people from the oppressive group do it, they are pretty much safe and more powerful afterward, and the oppressed group actually face a much more disproportionate backlash/swift punishments etc, unless they actually planned their offensive to keep themselves and their community protected afterward."
"5:04 you made me spit my drink out"
"I am Tabi in this vid irl"
"I waited for the Anita shout-out when you talked about misogynistic gaming"
"Never been big on cooking meat with eggs in the same pan"
"What about violence outside a state, like when humans were roaming the lands punching things to eat."
"I highly enjoy violence, but those damn morals... ;) Those videos are just so artsy and your Alex looks fabulous"
"Is it wrong that I want to see 'Curious George Kills The Rapist'?"
"I don't want to sound [insert neutrally non-offensive term that might be synonymous with gay] or nothin', butt I sorta wish I wear outfits like that.  #fatpower #mefirst #LustIsJustADenserFormOfHope #HopeQueerHope"
"You don't promote yourself to one who needs a Bloody Mary to get out of bed. Who's going too want to hire you for a job. Such a dimwit."
"You talking about patriarchy like you don't know what male privilege actually looks like. Those are misandrists influenced views"
"This is it. This is my favorite video of the leftube."
"Love this."
"Why is no one talking about 'Curious George Kills the Rapist'?"
"with violence is the logic of pleasures to follow? moderation because none will lead to too much and too much just leads to nothing??? does the prohibition of violence make it more desirable??? is that temptation of the forbidden sufficiently adressed in fiction or does everybody need some real violence every now an then to keep the greater hunger in check?? hmmm"
"you look _unspeakably_ attractive as Alex o k"
"God, I love you."
"Anyone else furious at the lack of seasoning on that steak?"
"So many ponts that I have struggled for years, in vain, to convince my 'liberal' friends to understand."
"I think that violent revolutions are so unlikely to end with whatever you want the new social and political system to look like that it's practically pressing a 'Randomize Society' button (except that instead of pressing a button obviously you beat and kill people) so if you want to reliably improve anything you're just going to have to start with what we have even though a lot of it is shit."
"As a fat baby of colour, I’m offended by your portrayal of infanticide"
"Tabby dancing to Rasputin works on so many levels!"
"what is up with her and milk?"
"RIP Muckrake9000"
"I never see violence in real life as enjoyable. Even when it's punching a nazi, or beating up a child rapist. Because Libertarian Free Will does not exist. So I only see it as an unfortunate situation all 'round. Not something to enjoy. The perpetrator is a victim of his environmental circumstances since before birth. There is no free Libertarian choice in anything this perpetrator has ever done. So we should steer away from retribution, and focus on rehabilitation. Or at least do it for the sake of society, since it actually works, unlike the retributive prison system.  As far as non-real life... fiction games and movies... there is absolutely cross-over. To a large extent. But less so if the characters are like.. animations without much in the way of human emotions. Then they're just like.. non-conscious avatars."
"Tabby is my favorite!"
"Go Vegan"
"have to say I found this video pretty weak. i dont see why decrying sadistic behaviour eapecially in regards to violence is anything to feel ashamed about. hypocrasy is another thing entirely but you shouldnt make people feel bad about hating violent psychos aka sick fucks"

"In my sims game, I had a special building for burning sims that I didn't make. My towns were almost entirely populated by families I made myself so if I saw any that weren't 'mine' I'd lure them into that house. In the basment, there was a setup of a room lined with cheap fireplaces. I used to burn them alive in there."

"The waters were muddied by the French Revolution by the fact that Robespierre was a sexist piece of shit."
"It's Mishel Foucault, not Michael Foucault. Alain Badiou is pronounced OK though."
"I mean my side are the good guys, so obvious the violence we commit is good."
"Loved the video except where you called Michel Foucault Michael Fucult"
"funny games by michael haneke is a superb movie on violence. it takes a stand against glorification and aestheticization of violence in movies. it makes you feel uncomfortable to watch and at the same time blames you, the viewer, also for it."
"not gonna lie. that scene in Brad Pitt's Fury where the US soldier submachine guns down that SS officer does things for me."
"I wish Lindsay Ellis would follow me around and make excuses for me whenever I was about to say something that could get me in trouble."
"Before I transitioned to male, I had heard of it but literally never felt schadenfruede, or specifically, pleasure at witnessing another person's pain. Within months of starting testosterone, I knew what it feels like.  But I only feel it when the other person's suffering Really justified, or I'm feeling REALLY irritable..."

"there should've be a content warning that i'd see a bread knife used to cut steak"
"Lol the remix of Ode to Joy is epic."
"I often think how much I'd like to punch certain people in the face, how cathartic it would be, how satisfying, how it would satiate my seemingly instinctual need for casual sadism.  Because that person was bad, they did a bad thing, said a bad thing, or acted in a bad way, but though I might enjoy it, the end result would not be my victim discovering the error of their ways, it would not be them offering me gratitude for my violence because it helped them see the pain caused by their actions.  Instead, it would just be that person wondering what they did to deserve it, or nodding to themselves about how that kind of thing was to be expected when you spoke the truth.  It would only make them go further into their ideologies, and help them garner support when they turned to their fellows and became a living martyr.  Then again some people will never let go of their bigotry and those people could do with two fewer kneecaps..."

"This might be pedantic but might not be, but when I first saw “Act of Killing” it occurred to me that Anwar Congo’s rationale of being inspired by violence in American films doesn’t necessarily check out- most of the films he cited by name (like “The Godfather”) were released almost a decade after the killings he admitted to, and at the time of his murders American films were still produced under the Breen Code. Violence is definitely alluded to in many American films of the era and there’s a lot of shooting but graphic depictions of, say, a garroting or blood were unheard of. “Bonnie and Clyde” wasn’t until ‘68 and even that is relatively tame compared to what Congo was accused to have done.  I think he still perhaps got some ideas from movies, though they may have been French, or Japanese, or locally-produced films. I do also suspect that he may have rationalized his violence post hoc into the ethical framework of 70s and 80s American gangster/Death Wish/revenge movies because, as @ContraPoints points out, these films morally justify the violence, and the violence in these films is much more graphic and detailed."
"Humans espashaly male humans are build with an in built capacity for violents . this is inherently part of ower biology. That being said there need to be a place in ower society for voilents. To me voilents most be reserved for preventing greater harm in the moment or only when absolutely necessary."
"Personally I prefer the the funk overload version of rasputin."
"1:55 had me in stitches. Love the subversion of the milk."
"A Clockwork Orange is my all time favorite movie. I love it so much, it literally changed my life and made me want to be a filmmaker."

"Check out Undertale... lots of clever writing, some great lgbt metaphors, and it subtly teaches empathy...  Also, it never forgets anything you do.  Anything."
"I've been watching ContraPoints stuff all afternoon, and this video got me thinking about the nature of violence and violent acts more than violent people.   Like, if you widen the borders of your definition of violence to include nonlethal and even mundane acts, then violence is inherent to sports such as football, soccer, and of course, martial arts. As someone who used to take Tae Kwon Do, I feel semi-qualified to bring up one of the key tenets of the martial art--defense. We don't learn how to kick and punch stuff as a practice for picking fights with other people, it's meant to be done in preparation for a reaction to someone else's violent actions towards us. I think violence can be compared to a lot of things that aren't inherently good or bad, including alcohol and candy.   This leads me to conclude that violence can be enjoyed without huge moral consequences if it's a) regulated to a non-lethal extent, and b) in moderation. Regulated violence (like sports) can just be a contract between the teams that any injuries that come out of it are a challenging side effect, and not the goal, of a game.   Part of what makes the violence in sports so socially acceptable is that we as a species enjoy it when a struggle is met with a payoff (e.g. the soccer player whose nose gets broken scores the winning goal), and I think that's a really big reason why writers are violent towards our characters when creating their backstories--we not only want to garner sympathy for them; we enjoy the thrill of stacking the odds against them, causing them needless pain and suffering, *because* we intend to balance it out at the end of the story with rewards that make said suffering 'all worthwhile.'   That's just my two cents, though! I'm happy to hear any other opinions!"
"You whip like a girl, start whipping like you mean it!"
"I'm kinda annoyed that you dodged the most pressing question in this video..."
"In the original book of clockwork orange, the main character changes his mind about violence in the end. He has a moment of self reflection when he sees his old gang member with his family.  I think it is really important to know that, since the movie suggests that bad people will stay bad when in reality, just like Focault often states in his books, they just need to be socialised and treated with empathy so they are able to conncet with their own empathy again."

"Non-violence is not an option if your enemy lacks a conscience."
"fucking pleb broke your yolk lol"
"personally I just really really don't enjoy violence. Not because of any morality, rather because of empathy. If I see someone's nose smashed, I feel like my nose was hit. And if I see someone die, I just feel my own mortality. And if I see someone get disfigured, I feel their loss like my loss. It's simply NOT fun..."
"Horrified to see you fry a steak in a non-stick pan 😱"
"1:49 Ahhhhhhh! 'With Lindsay Ellis'! 😀"
"'violence is fun'. How does anyone take this shit seriously?  If all you do is approach serious philosophical issues with irony and humour don't be surprised when you  come to comical conclusions.

"I revisited this video because I am seeing lately a sharp rise in a call to violence from people I watch. I have always found you to be one of the last bastions in a left community which seems to be going off the rails. Today I saw a new vid from Bad Mouse where in one breath he said saying hurtful things to marginalized groups hurts them and to stop it, and in the next breath mentioned lies and violence are fine to get the job done. So I asked him and his viewers how to reconcile that, don’t hurt people’s feelings but physically murder the ones you don’t agree with. Seems to me to be a hard circle to square.   Now some people may take issue with the above but I want you to really think about it. Contra you most of all as you have much more wisdom than most. I am a combat veteran who has killed men for having a viewpoint that wanted to kill my people. But I assure you there was no joy in it for me I have a permanent drinking problem and have disconnected from friends and family as an outcome of my anguish so there was no sadistic pleasure in it for me. And that’s why I want to ask the question, how can we ask people not to hurt others feelings, but at the same time kill them for their feelings. Admittedly I hate the things they say and do, but there is no way to justify that until they reach the point where it is necessary. But if we start killing people or punching them down how are we any better than them?   Trust me when it gets bad enough….which it may, you will find I and others like me who unlike the crying Nazi are quite comfortable doing what needs to be done no matter the cost. My concern is we are nowhere near that and smart people like Bad Mouse are talking about taking arms. This is not at all OK. I see this emerging in several parts of the left, and I get it because shortly after Trump was elected I bought 2 new guns in preparation. But this seed planting of drawing blood is not the fantasy people imagine it is. My kills were justified and I can’t sleep at night, imagine how it feels to kill your neighbor. The people I am referring to are the ones who think communism will be a paradise…which history says otherwise in a big way, and they are going down the same path as before. Most of America does not want to be communist, and to force that down their necks at the point of a gun would be what? Fascism is the answer. We can win with words, we have been winning for decades. If we go down that road then we will be the scum we hate."

"0:49 Most adorable burp in human history?"
"Senseless violence against others doesn't bother me in the slightest; Beheadings, hangings, bring it on! What does bother me is self mutilation like, say, Lloyd's lunchbox, Salad Fingers (sometimes), or gifs of kids cutting themselves really deep [coming from someone who was, and sometimes still is, a self harmer who loves morbid/taboo shit]  It's not vomit-inducing, manic screaming discomfort... It's like a time lapse of something decaying/swarming with maggots discomfort; Maybe it's because one is kinda random and quick whereas the other is more psychological and slow-moving"
"*sees content warning* *scrolls down* *sees comment to take content warning seriously* Damn it contra I wanna watch your videos... Will be back in a couple years I guess."
"I disagree with quite a few of your opinions contrapoints however I love watching your videos and I think your very creative and  entertaining so I’m going to sub🙃"
"Men* cant stop killing each other, and think violence is fun. Its called testosterone? Violence is not fun to me at all, like I reeeeeally cannot relate. I feel guilty for killing monsters in video games. I am personally annoyed they cant stop the warring YET. We are still funding wars. If every man hunted for his meat instead of buying it at the store maybe they wouldn't feel the need to kill people in other countries..."
"Too bad you didn't mention pacifist ideology such as Ghandi, I would be interested in your opinion on that.  I like that you acknowledge the conundrum of leftist violence, on how can it be more righteous than right wing violence.  I consider myself an anarchist but find it difficult to rationalize the use of violence."

"You inspire me so much 🌺🌺🌺"
"Been thinking about this a lot recently, and finally got here in my rewatch. I'm just tired and frustrated I guess. The thing that keeps running through my mind is the likelihood that any sort of violent revolution will disproportionately affect the people who are facing the most insidious systemic violence anyway. I don't WANT a revolution that sacrifices more poor people, minorities, disabled people, etc in the name of maybe getting something better. The people at the top can just fuck off in their private jets the moment something starts to happen."
"He"
"violence is bad. It always has been and always will be. Unfortunately we do live in a violent world with violent people. And sometimes violence is necessary to prevent violence, or abuse in non-violent ways. And unfortunately we live in a world with lies and deceit and greed and egos and manipulation. So it's hard to tell when violence is being used in clear defense against violence and abuse. And b/c violence in itself is bad, even using it in a justified way will corrupt and desensitize the user, skewing their sense of right and wrong.    I wish you could prevent things like greed and lies and manipulation and violence just by avoiding them and loving it all away. I wish I could even just believe you can. But I am convinced that these 'bad' characteristics are not just learned behaviors, even though they often are, but are born into human nature, even 'good' people. Like psychopathy, it's more prevalent in some than others.    I think that we just have to keep doing the best that we can do, not get complacent, and watch vigilantly for corruption in our authority figures, as well as protect our rights as citizens, and also our independence and ability to make decisions for and act for and defend for ourselves. Also to be vigilant with ourselves, constantly questioning our own morality and influencers, even if you believe yourself to be a 'good' person. History has shown us that there are few things more dangerous than an unyielding belief in one's own righteousness and moral high ground."

"I didnt like the movie, because I did not enjoy that kind of violence.  I am hardwired to identify with the protagonist, so I basically felt like being the bad guy in a clockwork orange and I hated that.  Also I emphazised very much with the victims of the violence. I actually used to watch alot of law&order SVU, mainly because I hated myself and hated sex and that was a good way to explore my destructive mindset. I totally felt the rapists and murderers in the show to be terrible people and the cops to be on the good side, and at the same time I felt some kind of resemblance to the bad guys, like my sexuality and was as bad and disgusting as theirs and would cause the same kind of harm and I phantasized about the good guys telling me that I´m a disgusting monster, who deserves to be beaten to death, while at the same time wishing and hoping for some kind of empathy from them. and the funny part is: looking back I´d totally get why you´d feel that way being gay or bi, or whatever, because the outside world tends to give you that kinda feeling about yourself, but actually I am a CiS straight men, and everything in the outside world should make me feel perfectly normal and normaly perfect - I guess.  anyway, I´m glad to be long past this period in my life"

"Hi. This video made me think about an experience of the student movement in Colombia last year (UNEES). In one of the great demonstrations in Bogotá, the ESMAD (the squadron in charge of suppressing social protest in Colombia, characterized by being brutally violent) repressed a part of the march in which some pacifist comrades were present, throwing stun bombs, rubber bullets with pepper and cans of tear gas. The students began to shout their slogan 'without violence, without violence' and to raise their hands in peace symbol, but the ESMAD attacked them anyway. So they stopped shouting 'without violence' and started shouting insults. That night there were more than 90 people arrested and several injured."
""
"The event was recorded and spread on Facebook, it seemed so funny that it was viral and used for propaganda against the ESMAD within the movement, and against the comrades who promoted the nonviolent faction, we (the radical faction) share it with comments like 'until there came your no violence ' or ' you already understood why you have to be prepared?' and finally the most radical part won the dispute, quite thanks to the video. Even many of us went on to say that 'they needed an explosion' between laughs.  And all that happened even though we understood that the comrades had been unfairly and illegally attacked..."

"Re: 1430 - A better question than 'what's to stop your movement from becoming X?' is 'what kind of precedent are you setting for a 'better' society by executing judgements on suspects without a trial based on personal suspicions?' Because acting in this way leaves few options. Either you remain open to a truly democratic society in which at some point an unsympathetic majority may cite your very precedent in assaulting you, or you exercise a totalitarian power that excludes any other political viewpoint from exercising the same rights you have exercised. Sure, you could pretend that even after thus oppressing your political opponents, they might eventually be convinced not to similarly oppress you in retaliation, but I think that a very brief examination of the records of human politics might dissuade you from the notion that any such 'middle ground' approach could be realistically expected to succeed in any permanently sustainable way.  Love your rants - keep it up; you're a sharp MF (or w/e you please). Just don't advocate using violence against *untried suspects* on the basis that they've been popularly identified as an unwanted political minority (e.g. Nazis) until you've contemplated the probable natural outcomes of that course.  Based on the hours of your videos I've watched, I'm aware that you perceive the *threateningly violent* social pressure of AntiFa and other factions to comply with their opinions, and I believe that you are aware both that tyrants take many forms and that black propaganda exists... and I can see that you're no coward... so don't take the soft path. Sensible people need to stand up for good sense within their own movements as well as within the greater society.  Peace."

Having a good life is lucky and Im thankful for what I have.   But, that doesnt mean Im not violent. My violence manifests in my daydreams. I fantasize about murdering everyone around me who mildy upsets me, and have fantasies of power where I often murder people with authority over me, or people who I believe contribute nothing to society. Like people who deny climate change while owning large oil businesses. Because of those I dont feel like I need to be violent elsewhere i guess?"

"Conservatives have been shooting Representatives, shooting up Synagogues, murdering Sikhs because they can't tell them apart from Muslims, driving cars into crowds of human beings, indulging in a massive spike in hate crimes since the 2016 elections, and oh yeah, the whole 'active shooter' thing.  I think we can agree this is massively more violence than punching a Nazi, breaking a few windows, and setting a trash can on fire.  After all of this, what penalty has the conservative political movement suffered as a result of this massive number of murders? How has the optics of a large number of murders affected the conservative or libertarian political movements in any way, shape or form? Because the only thing I see is the mainstream media excusing all of those murders with an endless parade of 'both sides' arguments.  What possible 'optics' problem is introduced by punching a Nazi if conservatives have suffered zero negative effects from the optics of a rather large number of murders?  I could understand if you argued that it's wrong on purely moral grounds, but I don't get the optics argument at all. If the media tries to make a big deal out of punching a Nazi, just howl 'Both sides! Both sides!' until they stop.  Maybe my views are a little skewed because I got drunk with some Anti-Racist Action (who back then were exactly what conservatives think antifa is now) guys back in the 1990s."

"When you talk about violence moraly justified it reminds me of somethings I pondered a while back.  Have you ever seen 1000 ways to die? They show... ways to die. But what's relevant is that most of the story of every case is about how this people were dicks in 'real life'.  You could think that it was how the story went, but they tackled some deaths that went on the media and were quite known so you know they weren't doing anything moraly wrong before they die. An explanation for this is that it's a known way to tell such uncomfortable stories. So people don't empathize as much as they would if they were regultar poeple dying random unfair deaths and you don't end up thinking 'What did I just watched, that could've happended to me' but 'This couldn't happen to me, I'm not a dick'."

"I kind of like that youtube tends to forget I liked videos because it means I get to like them multiple times"
"Meh. I didn't enjoy this video as much. There's too much to unpack, but I'm just gonna point out that most people who like the video of Richard Spencer getting punched would not themselves actually punch him, and if they did they likely wouldn't enjoy it. Rather than finding it 'fun' they would probably spend the time leading up to, during, and after the event in a palpable state of stress, anger, fear, etc.   Violence is not fun. We have an intrigue with things that are taboo, mysterious, or macabre. But while the line between fantasy and action are occasionally skewed, and not all fantasies are healthy, this does not alter the fact that human beings are predominantly non-violent, and are made greatly distraught by participation in violence, even including violence that is morally or socially justified."

"I'll point out the gun culture in the US not only finds shooting in 'self defence' acceptable, but is actively encouraged. If you ever talk to a pro-gun person about gun control, they sooner or later will say that they 'are happy to' or 'will gladly' shoot a stranger who breaks into their house. I take their wording very seriously here. Using violence in self defence should NEVER be a point of pride or something to brag about. If you hurt or kill somebody, even for completely justifiable reasons, you should never feel good about it. I mean if you enjoyed doing it, was it really self defence?  Especially in cases where the 'victim' could have easily avoided conflict entirely. Something tells me that many of these kinds of people (including cops) are subconsciously looking for an excuse to use their gun and expect to be lauded as a hero. Not to say all of them are like this, there are many sensible people who take pride in gun safety and responsibility. But there are too many careless twats who are still legally allowed to own firearms. This is, in my mind, contributing to the massive gun problem America has."

"Violance is bad, but sometimes necessary. It's a matter of deciding personally what final outcome is most important to you.  Should we let biased men and their complacent consenting property (wives and daughters) keep ruleing and force us to live in fear, or shall we rise up, use their own threats and tactics on them for enough time to show them that we can be just as scary as they are, thereby freeing us from their tyrannical death grip on our country? We don't have to be violent forever. Just long enough for them to think twice about deciding to take away other people's rights.  A tool is a tool. What makes you good or bad is how long you want to keep using a inherently negative tool.  The fascist alt-right wants to use it forever.  I want to use it to free myself, and all others who are harmed by the patriarchy and bias in general.  Once that is accomplished, and they look at us the way we look at them, (should I confront that guy shouting racist things in the street? Or should I walk on by and pretend I don't see him... I should probably pretend I don't see him I don't want to get hurt.)  Then we can stop being violent and just make good laws to stop people who commit hate crimes (and honestly all kinds of crimes doesn't matter if your in any sort of group if you commit a crime you should go to jail) from getting away with it and enforce them. Then we can be peaceful again and just blow up people in video games."

"When your opponents are using violence against you - not metaphorically, not in hypothetically in the future, but actually beating up (or worse) people here and now - I think you have to respond with violence also. Sticking strictly to the legal definition of self defense in that case handicaps you too much and puts to much faith in the police and justice system that it usually does not deserve. You need to strike back choosing the time and place yourself. Otherwise, I generally don´t believe much in violence or property destruction in the social and political situation we have in the West today."

"In the end you can't blame the victim for their circumstances. I pick optimism in this circumstance. And it doesn't have much to do with human nature as it does with observations.  Statistically life is going well. We have less poor now, less starve, we have more warm houses and food, less drug abuse, less violent crime, youth are coming to have more maturity in general as compared to previous generations. Intelligence seems to be on an uptrend, and we're all getting richer, our technology is getting more efficient. Though; inequity of riches is increasing, the bottom line is actually much better and is still improving.  Our inequity and pains are shifting from the more salient fear of getting frost bite in winter, to fear that we may be perceived with less social status than someone else. As if the harms are now more social and or spiritual in nature than what they were before.  So there is a reason to be optimistic. And here's why I think I'm rite in a meaningful way, my dudes.  The cause of these changes is technology. The better technology we have the closer we are to that albeit impossibly distant, still worthy utopia of post scarcity.  And who do you hedge your bets in when you're advocating for more technological progress? Conservatives? I'm sorry dude, it's mostly people with liberal ideas, who actually know how the world works. I picked life."
"We can only do what's possible.  And we can't blame ourselves for not doing the impossible.  This is why I have a fondness for moments in many pieces of art where a character goes back to a scene where their ideological 'enemy' was killed. They crossed the point that they knew could, and would happen. All these discussions beforehand seem so infantile in comparison, because they weren't enough to prevent it.  His / her enemy is dead. Could they have done it differently? Is it worth trying to find out the reasons it happened, to stop it happening again? Are they to blame for their own powerlessness to stop this fate?  No. They only did what was possible. Even if something inside them might complain, or scream. This is what it means to be limited, to merely be human."
"The amoral joy of violence is the joy of play. Cute."
"I think that the pleasure of violence is tied to the enjoyment of power.  When you destroy something else you get this sense that your destruction can be applied elsewhere (rationalization or thought after the act). But what you described isn't violence for the sake of violence (sadism).  You described vindictiveness. Which will allow us pleasure when we destroy something to survive.  That is quite different from pleasure purely at someone else's expense (taking power from the world makes this possible too).  If you're of the assumption that the world is evil. Then destroying the world and exercising violent power within it helps to act as a restorative to your esteem. You become more powerful and less helpless in the face of insurmountable odds. This isn't evil. This is self-defence.  But things can get awry when people have delusions. If you are schizophrenic, for example. You may come to the conclusion that harm is being done to you, where none actually exists - you attack things which are unrelated to the pain because you see something causing pain to you inside of them.  In that way you can sort of cause schizophrenia through abuse. If you are abused and gaslit enough, you can become delusional about a straw enemy. You know exactly what this is. I'm going to bring you out of your comfort zone though by suggesting that the invisible fascist is that delusional enemy (for a reason).  I want to demonstrate an innate bias.  I don't know if that truly exists in everyone, but I think it is likely in some.  And now the more 'tasty' example. The straw feminist. The woman who is out to get money and abuse the system to take men's kids away because she's evil, and feminism is what she invented to try to hide and justify her torture of you.   If you're aware of the dichotomy of a sadist and a masochist at some point a previous absurdity becomes apparent. A masochist is completely incompatible with a true sadist. A sadist will only cause 'pleasure' to a masochist. This is not what gives a sadist pleasure. A sadist finds pleasure in inflicting real pain, not pleasure.  This is why the most preferred victim for a sadist is someone who openly says they are not a masochist. A rapist.  But people identify as sadists, and frankly 'play' the idea. The grim reality of being a hot, badass sadist who fucks gud is a lot different from a fat, disgusting, disease ridden scabby skinhead with flesh rotting off them that only exists to use you at your own expense.  This person is an angel by comparison.  I guess that has its utility as well. Because I can be an angel, where you can not. There are painful ways to interpret everything. And I hope that learning through observation is applicable here. I want to live in a better world, than that."
"'What do we need to enjoy violence. What is the romantic candlelight.'  The belief that it is special and detached from everything else in the world."
"I want to pull out a sound from this video for discussion because it's present in a lot of my own 'style' or personality, it's something I've heard and tried to emulate a lot before this point. And what's wonderful about technology but the increasing ability to be precise?  1:51 - 1:53 This part. It's like the instrument sounds like misery.  It sounds similar to that thing I get in my head when I ask, 'what is the world like?' And see needless pain. It just reminds me of people who are just deeply flawed, just like reality is. Misery of being unable to do anything about that? Or me just asking, what if there is something else?  But I ask, what if someone reads this and 'figures me out'. What if there's no mystery, to me, anymore? And they lie back, intent to move on to their next lover, trying to find some excitement. And this sound is the sound that plays when they think.

I personally find them very difficult to watch, and feel really concerned whether that person got seriously hurt, but a person falling headfirst down the stairs apparently provokes laughter from a lot of people. Even the pastel sweater of a show 'America's Funniest Home Videos' had segments devoted to accidents. In the decade of moral panic, the dark impulse of taking glee in the misfortune and pain of others was socially acceptable and hosted by Bob Saget. Weird shit happens."

"I think animals tend to be very cruel, but humans are slowly going away from violence."
"My thought is that in human context, violence is a buzzword used to describe physically forced change. The universe, on every level, runs on violence of some sort, weather it's a supernova, or a lion, an asteroid impact or an inquisition, violence is everywhere all the time. As living beings that want to keep on living, we understand this and go to lengths to prevent too much violence from happening to us, or things/people we care about.   So to me it comes down to your society decides what violence is acceptable for surface level viewing/participation and what violence is not acceptable, but on some level violence is part of the world and who we are. That doesn't mean black people shot by police are just SOL and need to learn to live with it. Indeed, as a society we are physically able to bear witness and make adjustments as needed.  So I think violence being right or wrong is not the right question to ask. It's never right or wrong, it simply is. We decide if we want it around or not, and which kinds we will allow (Romans after all had a continent spanning entertainment business built on torturing and killing people). I think the question to ask should be 'Why is this violence occurring, do we want this particular violence to occur, and why or why not?'"

"What movie clip is used at 5:09?"
"While watching this video, I am creating sims to lock in my basement."
"With violence in my observation thus far is not so much that it is 'fun' as causing a authentic sense of joy but another distraction from internal pain and/or discomfort. Generally people are to some varying degree seeking to turn away from turning inward to their own varying levels of existential pain. This can be done by means of positive or maladaptive coping mechanisms. Projection, transference in self-hate emcourage violence towards the other for either overly separating oneself from others as you detach from the pain and over stimulation of emotions or lose boundaries to the point there is very little difference between the other and oneself. Violence depending on one's temperament and the environment they were cultivated is, an outlet and simultaneously a distraction strong enough to harness strong emotion siphoning this way from the self but also trigger the dopamine reward center if this temporarily resolves discomfort of very presently experiencing your own emotions singularly inward. Observing it is a distraction to the viewer from self-reflection on the face of it but also as you once referenced, I may erroneously believe, it may be Jungian shadow self starring into the abyss of our own darkness through another from a 'safe' distance with reasonable deniability. I could be off base but thanks for getting me thinking about this microcosm of the emotional experience."

"Okay so the video game thing I was a little bit disappointed in as someone who is constantly learning about the industry. Violence is a common mechanic but far from being representative of them (which is a fairly unrelated point). I would like to bring up that violence is actually a very important concept to be represented in video games and other mediums. Especially video games because it allows the player to explore they discomforts and morals without actually hurting anyone. A lot of the violence in games is meant to make the player uncomfortable and sometimes even contemplative. I know this want the topic of the video but I think this realization has some worth as a side point."

"It seems the common thread is a moral imperative to remain on the defensive. To me the grey area is whether there’s a point at which psychological and cultural assault piles up high enough to merit physical assault in return. If so, what is that point? Punching Nazis seems to be okay because the psychological and cultural violence of them making their ideological assertions is, for some, enough to equal a physical retaliation. If cultural infractions were measurable, it seems we’d be able to extrapolate an exchange rate from this case and answer this question once and for all.   This is, after all, a question that other cultures have already answered. In the Wild West, at least as it’s romanticized, an insult to one’s honor equaled a gun duel. In the Bible, any number of cultural infractions are equal in value to stoning or beating. Here in Camp Liberal, we started off with the seeds of nonviolent resistance, asserting that no amount of oppression or psychological harm merits physical retaliation. It even went so far in many cases as to require that physical assault itself not be returned in kind.   What I wonder is whether this idea is just us trying to beat neofascism at its own game by its own rules. The power dynamic between abuser and abused is that the abused is supposed to quietly take it, responding only through channels that the abuser dictates acceptable, if at all. One way abusers try to hide their abuse is keeping it in the social/psychological arena, making sure the taboo of physical violence is never broken and keeping the abuse in the space of plausible deniability. So if the alt right is our psychologically manipulative & controlling boyfriend, constantly telling us we’re worthless and unlovable, laughing in the face of our petitions for mutual respect, and warning us that all the claims we’ve made will be dismissed if we make the wrong moves, are we refraining from throwing him off the balcony because that would be wrong, or because if he survived it would give him a reason to punish us?"
"Is there some symbolism of the laundry in the dishwasher or is this just a practice I’ve never encountered"
"I find so many ethical quandaries result from the impulse to find and rely on a principle. My simple utilitarian view is that violence is good when it will have objectively good results. (Well, it's a little more complex than that, but that's a gesture in the right direction.) So, there's no simple rule to follow when deciding whether to use violence. Every situation has to be evaluated independently."
"Violence is not fun under any circumstances. If you like it then you have mental issues and you need a psychologist. It is that simple. I think that the biggest problem of our modern days is this constant need to over-intellectualize the simplest things. It is the way how both the left and the right and everybody in the middle (so everyone?) try to rationalize those of their beliefs that are harmful. It is nothing else but an attempt to avoid guilt or the feeling of being out of line(morally) so that there is no need for change."

"I look at violence as something innate to life.  Have you ever noticed how animals play by chasing each other or fight each other for mates?  The first is preparing them for running, either for chasing food or away from predators.  The second is to prove they are healthy to the opposite sex by comparing themselves to others.  Why would we, at our most base, be any different?  We're animals, too.  It's that primal instinct that allows people to enjoy violent media, even if they know that real life violence is horrifying.  What makes us different than most other animals is that we can understand the consequences of violence, both to ourselves and to the people we would commit acts of violence.  Empathy, foresight, and self-preservation allow us to understand that, while violence may have some benefits, it's rarely worth it."

"In addition to being free from the consequences of violence in video games, might the fun also be due to the fact that most people don't experience violence firsthand in real life? Or perhaps due to the violent images resembling nothing from reality? I think most games focus on violence because it's an easy concept to base a computer program on. There's a clear objective with measurable milestones and well-understood methods and factors, like velocity, surface area, and organ failure. Immediate threats to one's life are also very motivating, so you can be sure the player is engaged. At least, I'd like to think that's the reason most modern titles merely rehash the concept of physical competition as a game (sometimes annually). I like slaying monsters as much as other people like putting the sports ball in the score spot, but what would it be like to have a game that communicates the satisfying feeling of learning an instrument, or a language, or a humanitarian discipline, or courting a sweetheart? So there are some games that try to do that, but can it be done without watering the experience down? A lot of the time, violent games are the only ones where I feel satisfied with accomplishing a difficult and worthwhile task that was more complex than pushing the right color button at the right time, or picking correctly from the two or three dialogue choices. I know I'm still working within a system so limited that choice is an illusion, but at least the illusion is more convincing. None of this matters and nobody will care to read it, but I still have to wonder."

"A little disappointed here. I feel like you backed down from pushing your ideas any further whenever your internal dialogue started to get conflicted.  I can't say I blame you - I don't know anybody who has a totally clear framework for political violence that I agree with. However, I disdain fervent radical left support for political violence. Practically, it just scares the moderate right toward the fringe, and is at best useless and at worst counterproductive towards restricting the reach of the radical right, sometimes even amplifying radical right wing voices.  Every political establishment and movement uses violence to ensure it's survival or facilitate its expansion - but that doesn't make it moral, or all forms of political violence equivalent (yes I know you addressed both these points in your video, but I don't think you explored them any deeper than their acknowledgement and a vague and seemingly halfhearted defense of the left on based on its moral high ground in terms of its care for marginalized people and victims of political violence perpetrated by the current political powerstructure). I think some distinctions between instances of political violence that are important to me are the end-goals of the violence, and the time frame of the violence.   If the end-goals are blurry or unknown (as they were in Iraq), or worse, unachievable (also as they were in Iraq), the violence is guaranteed to persist for a long time. If a political group which universally agrees that violence is justified in pursuit of its aims (communists) achieves power - that is, a movement that doesn't delude itself that it isn't violent, or that the violence is appropriate for a temporary period of time, but one that acknowledges its violence as necessary to its cause until utopia has been achieved - that movement will find itself justified in killing those who dissent from its cause long after it has seized power.  This is also true of mass incarceration, which inflicts violence on people of color without any time-frame or end goal, justifying the need for its violence (that is, the need for more police and more arrests) by its violence (the number of arrests, and, by their proxy, the number of 'crimes').  Just like nuclear fusion has been promising that it will be a 'commercially viable energy source in a decade' every decade since the 70's, it seems to me that communist utopia always is, and always will be, just a few hundred thousand reactionary bodies away from being achieved.  So, I guess I'm disappointed that you didn't dig deeper into the different justifications for political violence, and their results and nonresults. It seems to me you were trying not to alienate your leftist viewers, whom you wanted to engage."

"Hello! Indonesian here, born after 1965 -- so I was fortunate to not deal personally with the trauma of mass killing half a million people would do to your psyche (it's kind of a 'banned' episode of history even until now -- and you're guaranteed to find resistance if you are that determined to find out any shred of truth of that event). In fact, most of my generation lived their life without any thought of those killed during that time.  However, all older members of my extended family had their own stories of what happened during that time, including one who remembered organizing 'ronda malam' (some kind of night patrol) to deter killers from entering local homes and villages. Several of my friends had worse stories, including forced disappearances of their relatives, etc.  Here's what I thought as an Indonesian: Anwar Congo is a rather kooky, insane guy. He is the kind of guy who would actually enjoy killing for its purely aesthetic value. However, you did saw in the Oppenheimer film that he had to constantly justify his actions -- to us, yes, but to his own self as well -- it's as if he still had a shred of humanity that he's fighting not to lose. In the end of the film, you'd actually see him retching in the place where he used to execute his victims, as if bearing the weight of all that violence. To be fair, Indonesia then was a very strange place where a 'communist' label (or even a suspicion of being one) would be enough to warrant violent death by self-confessed 'paramilitary force'. It was a place where all rules of civility were suddenly suspended, and where social prejudices and a shred of state power gives you enough power to kill."

"I'll offer an explanation that's based on physics. First define the human act of violence in physical terms in order to deduce exactly what is happening at the moment of violence. You'll note that the brain is involved in this act, sometimes the brain has certain characteristics which are out of the norm when these acts are performed - for example, logical reasoning centres are under-active whilst fight or flight ones are hyperactively firing, priming the body for conflict and so on. The main issue here is that the human is being given the benefit of a doubt as to their self-control over these violent acts in the first place.  I can't tell you the exact thing that happens in the brain as to understand this requires neuroscientific mapping of basically everything. You need to understand for example the information in the scene. Let's say that someone doing the violent act here is responding to a physical phenomena of another human being who is for this example; a bald, relatively tall male, maybe they have a tattoo on the back of their head of a devil, or a hate symbol, etc. This physical element of the human being's environment is identified, the occipital lobe processes the information in a few fractions of a second, that information is sent to be considered by the prefrontal cortex(?) which then asks for any memories pertaining to the bald man in question. The human mind immediately recalls a violent memory of that person's past, engaging in a fight reflex.  The person does this because they were, for example, sexually molested as a child and it was by a man with a tattoo similar on the back of their head, who bears a striking resemblance to the victim in this scenario. The brain, which requires more immediate mobilization of resources to a threat, uses the amygdala and some other areas to produce adrenaline, noadrenaline, etc, essentially roiding this dude or girl for conflict, at which point their anger and distinct lack of reasoning over the situation causes them to begin punching the shit out of this bystander. Hence violence occurs.  And all violence occurs as a result of something occurring within the brain of another human being.  1. A threat is deemed to exist. 2. A response to this threat is considered and, 3. The violent response is deemed fit for purpose as the self-assessment of the organism's capabilities are either deemed adequate to approach the threat or some other motivation (saving social standing) is deemed so important that the violence will go forward even if a loss may ensue.  It's also important to define the type of violence being committed because in this example it is violence as caused by being triggered, basically, by a previous traumatic event. Violence which is about exerting power over another human being could be seen as beneficial to the organism who is performing it, in the case of slavery. The slaver may or may not have any activity in the brain related to morality, this isn't always necessary, but it all must go on inside the skull before any action is performed.  Then what I propose to fully answer 'what causes violence' is to look at the brain in that moment as the primary structure for determining its cause. It contains all of the person's thoughts, memories, ideals, propensity for conflict, any genetics that would make them more prone to violent outbursts, sadism, sociopathy, pain, etcetera. But typically, it always has a cause.  I think the idea that violence being fun is a poor rationale for explaining violence from an evolutionary point of view because ultimately violence is dangerous for the actor. The idea that you can freely abuse someone would usually lead to a much shorter life expectancy in the real world, as people retaliate. Have you heard of the saying 'Dictator is one of worst professions for life expectancy?' It has some merit to it. No, I think violence in terms of evolution is beneficial for the one performing it as either a survival strategy or to improve fitness.  There's also the rut to think about in nature too. The human species is one of a few that hasn't been observed to have a real mating season, women do have a menstrual cycle, but does a male have any displays of dominance that culminates in violent conflict? What's the use of being such a strong man if it is not used in true competition to test one's fitness? Maybe the stereotype of a bar fight to get the girl isn't a stereotype for no reason. That would be a pretty shitty existence."

"Revolutionizing a nation doesn't always lead to violence or extremes. Sometimes it just dissolves into 'we just want some middle ground'. I live in one of those places, where a dictatorship was deposed after a largely peaceful revolution which ended with exhile for the former leaders instead of mass executions. We also didn't turn immediately to the far left because it would be just as bad as what was there in the past. I suppose we were lucky the leaders of the military coup that fronted the revolution were honest people who didn't want power and simply stepped aside the moment there was a plan for democratic elections. They just wanted an end to a pointless war that was killing our youth and depleeting our already modest economy. It worked so well another two nations followed the model and made equally peaceful transitions to modern democracies. The stabilizing effect of foreign nations was purely diplomatic, with no actual boots on the ground, because it wasn't necessary (and we don't have any oil they could nick and stuff...).  Although... funny enough, but not at all, the non-white people we were at war with were left to their own devices and with no external stabilizing force it all devolved into an incredibly bloody war amongst themselves which resulted in millions dead. Now, where have I heard something like that before...? Too bad the western powers didn't know about the diamonds they have there. Or maybe that was a good thing."

You touched on empathy briefly, but I think it's a much bigger part of the equation than you make it, on a par with fear of retribution and/or the law in terms of what keeps us from violence day to day.  My reason for this is two-fold: first, when we look at examples of how people justify violence we see dehumanisation as a central tactic over and over. I'm sure I don't need to list examples to you. The idea being that if the victim is beneath you then they cannot be identified with.  Second, introspection. Here I can only speak for myself, but when I think about why I don't just solve all my problems with violence the very first roadblock my mind throws up is almost always 'but what if that person was me?'. This ties back into my first point, because when I do actually consider a violent course of action it's because I fail to empathise with the person I want to punch to such a degree that the answer is 'they are nothing like me and never will be'. Only then do considerations of repercussions come up, and by that point I'm already planning out various violent courses of action.  Even when it comes to that more subtle everyday violence that you mentioned towards the end of the video, I don't think the value of nurturing and bolstering feelings of empathy in ourselves and others can be overstated in the solution to these kinds of problems.   Thank you for all your effort with your wonderful channel. Please continue to entertain and educate us, and have a great day."

"My two cents is thus: sometimes there are gonna be people who are capable of doing anything becuase they dont have the moral or physiological blockers to do it. And those people must be put down before they put you down. No matter how many hugs you give assad he is gonna gas his own people, no matter how many smooches you give Baghdadi he is still gonna use a power drill to kill people. Sometime the only way the only practical way is to use violence to end violence. Our morals didnt end ww2 our tough choices did."

"The problem is that those doing the violence think that they are good and their cause is righteous irrespective of whether that's objectively true.  Also, violence is morally repugnant resulting in much suffering and death and should be an absolute last resort; no one is beyond redemption and peace is always a crucial goal."

"Violence is never an good option. Most violent revolutions just end in some other form of dictatorship, because most things that come to live with violence, can't stay alive without violence. The biggest problem is when someone reacts to peaceful demonstrations with violence (like for example in Syria) is it then justified to react on violence with violence? Mostly people become violent when they stop seeing the others as people. So the best way of staying peaceful is if both sides always reminde themself that they interact with people, not with some form of enemy."
"Am I missing the point, or is the rape-revenge bit in kill bill only a very minuscule part of the movie, and not even remotely important to the plot? The plot is tracking down her old team-mates who betrayed her, the rape-revenge part is like 5 minutes where she comes out of her coma and steals a dude's truck"
"All i know is that mutual combat between consenting adults is great"
"Kill Bill is (attempted) murder-revenge, not rape-revenge(okay, Buck does indeed rape her, but everyone else she targets either tried to kill her or is in her way, and the movies arent called Kill Buck, so yeah), it always annoys me when people label it as the latter(unless you count forced abortions/births as rape, which you really shouldnt). as for the actual video: violence is a tool, it can be employed regardless of purpose. the trick is finding when and to what extent its use is acceptable."

"I have a knee injury and broken glasses caused by the fascist and antisemitic Boston based group Resist Marxism. I have a shoulder injury from the Worcester, Massachusetts Police. Lately, I'm in pain a lot of the time.  I'm a 5 foot 1inch, fat, middle aged Jewish teacher. I really BELIEVE in using my white body as a meat shield so that people of color can be less targeted by the police, and less danger. I know that they may injure or imprison me, but they will deport or kill my brown or black comrades. Because of what I have been doing the last two years specifically, I think a lot about violence. About defensive violence versus violence of the state, about how to define violence, and about how to treat with and live with the i injuries I have. I am also a rape survivor, so I think about how that violence is similar and different to other kinds of violence I have inflicted and experienced. I was also a victim of physical and emotional bullying as a child because I have always been fat, and always been a nerd. Part of the mentality that kept me being bullied over and over again at different schools is the liberal ideology of turning the other cheek, 'going high', and 'being the bigger person'. I think that this liberal bullshit being shoved into my head also contributed to the sexual abuse and rape I experienced and my total lack of ability to deal with it. I really truly believe that violence is acceptable in preventing these neo fascist groups from gaining power and rallying in my city and to punish rapists."
"contra hits peak beautiful in this video"
"I don't know... I think fun in violence towards is just an expression of yourself coping with feelings of powerlessness. Fun in violence against a Sims character is just the shameless discovery of your own cruel and powerful side that you can playfully explore at inanimate objects of infinite resource, which you should intuitively know. The latter gives you in internal sense of your own capabilities. The difference in both is where the moral influence comes from (like from your empathy towards the victim on one side and the fear of being ostracized for your actions on the other side) and how it governs your actions. So people with no innate sense self and a learned sense of helplessness in life would experience fun in violence against real victims more than someone who feels more powerful over one's own life and sense of personality. Is that what you meant? I typed that comment mid video."
"Hehehehe =3"
"Except... I enjoy Kill Bill. Including the violence. I do see parts of it as esthetic (it's a choreography after all). _But_ I don't see The Bride's actions as justified. I don't feel like there's a moral excuse for that kind of violence. So in that case I think it's more the fantastical nature of the scenes that enables me to enjoy them. It all feels so unrealistic and stylized that it has little connection to real life violence in my (subconscious) mind."

Strangely enough that's not what really bothers me. As an adult I know for a fact that not everyone involved in my beatings wanted to be. Some even did try to help me. I often lay awake and wonder if these poor souls are out there somewhere in the world seeking forgiveness.  T_T"

If the tape machine itself is possessed and manifesting auditory phenomena, that's even better, as i can rely on it to regularly produce quality, class-a EVP.  i actually didn't think of that idea right away. i've got to go google if there are any possessed recording devices on ebay. pausing the video and we'll be right back aaaaaaand... well, we have quite a few fancy digital recorders but none of them have that sweet sweet phantasmic presence that I crave.

"Speaking as a woman who is very into Martial Arts, I have to admit that I  would really like to be able to be violent, I want to fight, that's one reason I do Martial Arts. But I haven't actually been in a fight in my whole adult life, not even in the last six years of seriously studying a specific style of Kung Fu. I could, I could take so many people, but I don't because it would be bad for them. I and many people who are into Martial Arts tend to go one a lot about the importance of being careful with their skills and not using them to abuse people because we know damn well it would be bad, but it is difficult even when you are seriously into practicing Martial Arts for anyone to admit they really want to fight people. It would be great if we could have some big fucking Fight Club where we could without any moral issue just beat the carp out of waeh other. Except we all need to carry on living and working etc.    I'm a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Sayer, and I am sure it is mainly because I can feel it is perfectly justified to just beat up and kill Vampires and other demons. And imagine having sex with them after a big fight. Yeah I love Spike. I would love it if there were real Vampires I could fight and kill, because I could do that without any stain on my conscience. Except that would mean people were being killed by Vampires, so there is a pay off there. I sort of like the way things are now, eve though it's really terrible, a lot of people are suffering and I personally do suffer a lot from the kind of institutionalised oppression that the state perpetrates on marginalised people. I very much enjoyed arguing with/winding up TERFs on Twitter, which I felt kind of bad about, because trans people are really very badly affected by TERF rhetoric. I had to stop that because I was getting into so many arguments with them that I was being kept awake until 5am on a regular basis, and I realised I kind of needed sleep.  In the past I was involved in a lot of political activism, mostly about environmental issues, but some to do with anti war and animal rights. So I've come across a bit of discussion about overthrow of the state. I used to think that violent revolution was automatically bad because it always seem to be one lot of bastards replacing another lot of bastards. I still think that it has many problems. I have tended to think that evolution is better than revolution. I still think that, but I feel now it is hard to believe that white supremacy is going to accept quiet evolution of our political and social systems to allow genuine equality. It looks like there may be a flash point where violent revolution could happen, because the push back from white patriarchy in particular is so great. The problem for the question you pose about where or not violent revolution is OK is that it may be something that we are left with no choice about, and is probably the reason for violent revolution in the past on the whole. Which will inevitably mean it will be messy. I'm just glad I started seriously leaning Martial Arts when I did so I'm ready to deal with it if it happens."

"I don't know if violence is fun or if it is just an essential part of the human psyche. We can certainly enjoy violence. But we can also enjoy having a shit. I think it's more of a need to kill rather than a enjoyment of killing. And certain circumstances can drive up that need. For me it is revenge. When something horrible is done to me, I usually fantasize about the most gruesome ways to take revenge. For other people it might be other things. But the point is I don't enjoy those fantasies they're just kinda there in the background. I think it's rather innate in us. A drive. Just like we have drives for other things.Like addictions. Sure you enjoy the thing you're addicted to. But it's also just a drive that drives you to do things. It's not as enjoyable as it is commanding."

"There was a village, that was hit by hard times. The farmers living in that village were starving, so they went to their lords home, who, every month had taken a cut of what they, with blood, sweat and tears had produced. They knew, the man and his family were well fed, warm and living in splendor, so they thought it only fair, that they share his food and drink with them in such hard times. But instead of a response, he had the guards throw stones at them. When his wife asked him, why he did that, he responded 'If I start giving in to the demands from commoners, I'd undermine the very foundation of monarchy itself.'. Meanwhile, the villagers, discussed what they should do. They were outraged, because some of them had been hurt by the stones. They decided, that just asking nicely was not going to be enough, so they got some weapons and torches from their farms. They returned the next day and this time, they didn't just ask for a few scraps but had decided to simply take what was theirs in the first place. The lord was terrified, this time, for he realized now, what kind of force he was dealing with. But as a politician, he was an expert in tactics and schemes, so he called a shaveling to his aid. 'I beg you, you have to help me! If I lose this battle, they will be coming for you next!' The priest saw the truth in the monarchs words, so he went out to meet the villagers. He reminded them, that murder was a mortal sin and that it was an act of blasphemy, trying to go against the natural, god-given order of the world. Some of the farmers got confused and started having doubts. They were not violent people and they only wanted to survive the winter. But one of the farmers wives shouted: 'What about my three dead children? One of them died in a struggle with mercenaries that the king hired for one of his wars. One of them was hung, because he hunted a rabbit in the lords forest. And a week ago my baby died from starvation, because I'm so weak, my body doesn't produce milk! Where was your concern for justice, when they died?' The priest was at a loss for words and the atmosphere in the camp shifted again, so he excused himself and left. After a long night of heated debate, the moderates won the argument and the villagers decided to ask the lord one last time to help them. Terrified at the prospect of losing everything he had his guards bring some sacks of grain, the sickliest hens from the pen and the oldest pigs from the sty. The villagers, who were all very decent, peaceful people, agreed to the terms and went home. They went about their daily lives, most even survived the winter. But as soon as spring came, a huge army came marching to their village. This army was paid for by the monarch and some of his high-born neighbors, who were all terrified of the idea, this could ever happen again and maybe, with a different outcome. The village was pillaged, and the main instigators were tortured, killed and their bodies displayed by the wayside  as a warning for all."

"I actually find violence like in Law and Order disgusting whereas something like GTA5 just is harmless fun to me. When Trevor does anything, it's absolutely unambiguous that his violence is unjustified and pretty much unforgivable. Trevor obviously is a horrible person because of his violence. However, in Law and Order, there is this overt implication that the violence is justified because the victims deserved it.   When it comes o the enjoyment of real life violence, the only experience I have was the fights I got in while I was in school. I must confess that it was fun, but that didn't involve seriously hurting anybody and it happened in self defense. The idea of punching Nazis doesn't appeal to me because I acknowledge that I'd be just as horrible as the policemen and soldiers you showed. Of course, those people thought that the victims deserved it. Even the idea of using a weapon or particularily nasty martial arts technique in self defense horrifies me - after all, this would destroy a person permanently. I do not know how I could live with that guilt.  I'd go so far as to say that the violence I committed is fundamentally different to the violence I dread to commit. The purpose wasn't to destroy a person, but to change the power configuration of the social setting. While I do not have the terms for that difference, I genuinelly believe that it is significant. I don't have a problem that the police detains criminals and if they defend themselves against violence. However, it is a very different thing if the same criminals are dehumanized in prison or if the police beats those people to 'punish' them.   While Foucault criticises the 'humane' system of punishment, I believe that the problem with that sort of violence isn't the methods, but rather that it affects areas of life which should be devoid of power structures. LGBT topics are the most obvious candidates. Let's take drugs as an example. What I do to my body should exclusively be up to me, there is no legitimate power in that field. Furthermore, it isn't legitimate to objectify my body for its productivity. The violence behind the power isn't the problem, the problem is that this field shouldn't have power to begin with.  On a different note: you make a great intellectual dominatrix."

"You could *read* A Clockwork Orange.  Or Blood Meridian...  Or The Killer Inside Me...  Or God is not Here...  Edit:  There is also the problem of who is going to enact violence.  There's a lot of talk of dudes being the ones to fight in wars, and women can't fight, blah blah, but that all is really nothing.  A lot of the talk of violence seems to stem from the idea that anyone can do it (or that the idea that men are SO BIG AND STRONG, GRR), and it can spiral out of control.  I don't think that's the case.  There's a book called 'Men Against Fire' that calls this into question.  It seems only a fraction of the population is able to do those sort of things, even just police work.  One of the reasons that that sort of work seems so jarring is that it is separate from our reality; you have a basic job to do, you have to do it fast, and it turns out the job is people.  That doesn't justify anything... or even condemn.  It just... is.  This is why I find the arguments against women in the military kind of hilarious, at least when the big and strong man crap gets involved.  If you read any SEAL memoir, you see that the SUPER TUFF AND BUFF dudes always washout first.  All that's left are the people who just get up and keep going.  And there is also the case of Carl Higby (the communications guy under Trump who got fired), who talked about how, when he was in middle school, he stabbed a kid in the leg with a screwdriver.  Because that was the tactical decision.  No, seriously, that's written in his own words in the book 'Enemies: Foreign and Domestic.'  That's also a very scary title...  My end point is that there was a lot of footage of actual violence, including Abu Gahrib, and those people probably were already predisposed to it.  It's not about becoming.  It's about... fulfilling, I guess.  Idk.  Waiting for the right moment.  The military has also been tearing its hair out for decades, trying to figure out how to make every soldier able to shoot to kill.  You never know how someone is going to act in a situation like that until they are in it, and it might have been a waste of time, money, and equipment to send somebody in.  Hence, the need for Hell Week.  And boot camps in general.  So you don't get that decorated goodie two shoes at Parkland.  Remember him?  Not the shooter.  The cop that didn't run inside...  And when they are forced to do it, they might end up like the guy who wrote God is not Here; somebody who suffered a severe moral injury, due to all the torture that occurred in his interrogation prison during the Iraq War.  I just don't think it's something lurking in everyone.  It's just certain people lurking out there, waiting for an excuse...  For the main mass of people to be violent, they need to follow someone who does it first.  That's why we like watching violence... it's an indulgence for us that we won't partake in.  Because we can't.  And not everyone in a riot throws a rock.  Not everyone goes sky diving.  But we've all watched a movie with it.  We like to think we can be violent, because violent people can be survivors.  I would even say that's why people watched executions... but tried not to get drafted into the military.  Also... you can always say no to the government.  Just don't get caught.  ' It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge.  War endures.  As well ask men what they think of stone. '"

That's why acting good is so valuable, you have to choose it often against your own self-interest.  Also there is video evidence of Antifa cretins behaving violently all over youtube"

"I tend to look at the Yugoslav war as an example on this topic where people who were neighbours, friends and lovers started brutally murdering each other. One could argue that the rise of nationalism and dehumanization and associated propaganda had the most to do with that. However, my little theory is that there is always a layer in society that would thrive under a violent society. In most late capitalist societies the norms for success are intellect, communication skills and diligence. Though, there is a big portion of society that still has the fighter/warrior values as their main trade or quality (it's no surprise that in let's say hooligan groups one's status grows as the person is more violent and ''brave'' in the face of the enemy.) And throughout history such men were respected a lot on the battle field. However, we now created  a system that condemns violence by private individuals. As long as this system is stable the ones who thrive under violence will be unheard and unseen, but once chaos emerges or a system that glorifies violence against whomever, they become the ones who thrive and take their chance to be on top.  Another question would be what makes a person of that breed?"
"Eating meat is degenerate"
"imo, yes violence is bad. it is always bad and is never justified. (even if it is 'punishment,' which is really just the winner's revenge tinged with a feeling of vindication.) BUT sometimes violence, while still unjustified, is the more moral choice than pacifism. So in the old fashioned 'either you shoot this one person or I'll shoot these five' philosophical conundrum, the action of shooting the one person is not a good action. you're doing harm. but letting the five die would also not be good. So the more moral, or at least kinder option would be to do one bad thing in the hope of preventing five bad things. there is the somewhat kantian element in my example, that whoever holds the gun to the head of those five people is responsible for those deaths whether you act or not. They made the decision to kill those people, and the sixth person that would be your doing. but while i think kant would argue that its better to keep your conscience clean and just let the threatener kill the five, I would personally rather do myself a disservice and take the burden of that one life. But I also tend to think of 'moral good' in terms of community, so the greater good of 5 lives appeals to me, while kant thinks on terms of the individual. (damn enlightment fucker)"
"I tried to watch clockwork orange once, but it ended up as one of the rare occasions where I don't finish a movie. I think it was a mix of the creepiness and slow-paced old movie boredom. I don't think I watched much more than perhaps a third, but I suspect even if I had, it would have ended up puzzled by the film's cult status and alleged high quality. sorta like with 2001: a space odyssey, which I find borderline cloud atlas style sleep-inducingly drawn out - even though the main plot is pretty cool as far as I know it, because that 'monolith' autonomous machine thing seems to be one of the most realistic possibilities for alien contact, because such (preferably somewhat self-replicating) fully robotic spacecraft theoretically have great potential to spread throughout massive areas of space, and build stuff or communicate with alien civilizations many lightyears away, way too far to have any sort of conversation via radio or laser transmission.  I feel like these 'smart' movies are meant to be viewed by pretentious hipsters who want to really put work in understanding what the fuck is going on, and through that they absolutely fail for normal movie watching, and are in my opinion therefor not good movies, but pretentious artsy art. I don't find it appropriate to make the enjoyability of a movie entirely contingent on doing research about the meaning of the movie beforehand. it's great if a layer of mystery is added on in such a way that makes it worth rewatching to really see what's going on this time (like westworld does), but it's simply not a good movie if it doesn't engage clueless viewers with some intelligible plot. it should be very enjoyable with moderate thinking and no background knowledge, and, if possible, even more enjoyable with background knowledge (such as when you're rewatching)."
"The baby community 😂😂"
"So... Here's my bit about violent revolution from a way more pragmatic than theoretical standpoint:  When a revolution goes wrong and fails, it's really bad. The faction which originally united to overthrow a despotic foreign ruler often fractures along ideological lines, and also along lines of who's too sadistic to be supported and who's not sadistic enough to be effective. The end result is a damaged infrastructure, a war weary population, and a government that is more or less fine to continue operating as they always have. Sometimes this leads to liberalization of policies to redress the grievances of the offending revolutionaries. Often it does not.  When a revolution goes right and succeeds it's often WORSE. The same fracturing of the revolutionary faction can either happen or not, but in this scenario the most sadistic element wins by most effective and merciless applications of violence. The dissenting voices are cleansed from within, and the monster cream floats to the top. In this scenario, the resulting government becomes paranoid that they will be overthrown by the same method they just used, and becomes even more militaristic and despotic than their predecessor, continuing the 'cleansing' of political ideologies and dissent from within their organization as well as without.  There is the third category where everything eventually works out okay, but there's a lot of turmoil and death in the middle there that could probably be avoided if there was redress of grievances through disruption of social order rather than its outright destruction. And even then, the successful and benevolent violent revolution is such a slim bet with such a high buy in that greater rational analysis usually renders it untenable in all but the most extremely oppressive regimes.  So I don't think violence as a political tool at this scale is a moral position in most cases. A few good riots every now and then have been shown to be effective in inspiring social change, but armed insurrection simply isn't a good tool for that job."

"Former paratrooper here. A practitioner of violence, and one convinced of its very occasional, and carefully considered necessity.  The problem of violence gets a bit clearer when you ask, 'violence for what, and how much?' There are times, the world being what it is, that violence is unavoidable. Virtue itself sometimes requires violence. All the persuasion and rationality in the world wasn't going to stop Tojo or Hitler. Nevertheless, while violence was necessary, killing every last civilian in Germany or Japan would NOT have been morally justifiable.  In order to justify violence we have to meet three criterion: 1) The end sought by the application of violence is so important, and the need so urgent, that no other means would have sufficed to prevent the evil we act against. 2) The violence used is carefully considered. As little violence as possible must be used. 3) It must be reasonable to think that the violent act will prevent the evil we act against.  Obviously, there is no room for sadism in such a calculus. And it requires an almost superhuman feat - the ability to act rationally and humanely in the most irrational and inhumane of circumstances. This requires discipline and training (and not the fun kind, sorry) of the body, and the mind. A righteous warrior must be empathetic, even towards the enemy. This is why I train martial artists - learning these lessons with your body allows them to become resident in your mind. A well-trained martial artist will not be a warmonger.  My problem with most of the violence currently used by the left (the violence of the right is of a different, overtly sadistic kind) is that it is not effective in preventing evil, nor justifiable on the ground of urgency. Punching a Nazi is no doubt satisfying (I admit, I smiled at Richard Spencer's misfortune - and then did 100 push-ups. Bad Sensei.) but I doubt if it accomplished anything. The world was rendered a little more violent to no useful end. Smashing a storefront at a rally doesn't really strike an effective blow at the oppression represented by late-stage, multinational capitalism.   It's one thing to intervene when you see someone taking a beating on the street if you have the skill and ability to do so. As long as you moderate your response to no more than necessary to stop the assault. But when you engage in violence that is unnecessary, excessive or ineffective you have damaged the social fabric at least as much as the originator of the violence. It isn't easy to get it right, but what's more important that considering a violent act with extreme care? Such consideration under such extreme circumstances requires careful thought, and training."

Actually committing violence feels so extremely different than the fun that the SpencerPunch video is...  2 cents on the 'is violence good or bad?' - the two arguments I've heard that come to mind are: 'violence is a tool,' therefore, can be used for good or bad, and 'there is no good or bad, only hindrances to goals,' which was always too galaxy brain for me anyways.

"The Indonesian Communist-Killers highlight the very thing that is the problem with the reactionary knee-jerk reaction to violent video games, movies, etc. (i.e. Tipper Gore, et al.). It's pretty obvious that the individual already had the desire and the capacity, all that was missing was the form, and that can be derived from any number of sources, not just video games.  On another point, if someone enjoys wrestling and doesn't realise it's fake, are they different from those that enjoy it by, at some level, suspending their awareness of the choreographed nature of the violence? It seems obvious that there is a difference, and that it is not especially fixed by the former being advised that the fights are choreographed, other than (possibly) reducing their enjoyment and (possibly) causing them to go find actual Fight Clubs (which at least has the benefit of causing them to have 'skin in the game', as it were, unless of course they enjoy both giving and receiving pain AND have an overwhelming desire to 'win')."

"Love the greyness of the points in this video. Violence is a tricky one, because undoubtedly it can be handy sometimes but it's also so easy to lose control of it. If nothing else, videos and think pieces like this one are necessary to recenter those who use violence to resist those who might harm others - if you're going to be violent use only when necessary, never let yourself do it for fun, keep your targets narrow and always always always second guess whether it's appropriate. Violence is something I feel a lot of discomfort with personally, and yet it was a little disturbing to realise the Spencer punch brought a smile to my face. He's a vile man who would have me dead if he had his way, so I guess that's a part of it, but it's really let me know that I need to channel that feeling into emotions of safety and just-ness rather than.... sadist pleasure. Sure, he had it coming, but satisfaction shouldn't be what I feel about it."

"The problem is that you are trying to solve logically a 'moral' question, and morality is inherently illogical. With this I don't mean the 'everything is moot, kill everything, viva la violence!' cheap cynicism of idiots in the internet that think they understand the world because they saw something or other in a movie. I mean that the question shouldn't be 'is it right or wrong', because you won't find an answer about violence - OR about anything else either - when we are talking moral scales.  It isn't even a matter of fun or not, it's an ego thing, I think - power fantasies are always less about 'power' itself and more about having power *over* someone or some people. Plus, power equals freedom. When you kill The Sims you probably draw fun from thinking you just broke the game, you 'broke free' from the limitations of the rules of the game... and where a bit naughty in doing so. Anyways, I think PopCultureDetective gives a better explanation about enjoyment of violence in his video analysis 'Wall-E as Sociological Storytelling'.  But back to my point. No, actually, 'violence' shouldn't be valuated in a social scale in itself because as any moral scale question... it's a moot point. The question should be one of, as you mentioned it: social contract.  What do we need to live in a group? Well, let's not kill each other, please. Except if you do, to stop you, you need to suffer consequences. So, the rule becomes: don't hurt another person if you don't want to be hurt. Henceforth you got 'justified violence'.  With a footnote here: the violence doesn't have to be physical. In the past, say a tribe system, you'd only be expelled from the community. If one of the pack is endangering everyone else, for suvival, we decide to kick the rouge out... of course, back at the time being left alone in the middle of the jungle was in itself a bit of a death sentence.  But that's the thing: we are 'pack' animals and we need to stick together to survive. That's why we *need* the social contract, and why we legitimize the use of violence when somebody is breaking the contract. But the contract aren't the written laws. It's the fact that some asshole is, say, taking the riches that are leaving thousands of us without enough to live.  The rule  of thumb is this: The offender is always the first one to do 'wrong' by others, by the pack. Because if you offend first, the following violence that 'results' from that first violence, is 'justified.' This includes all types. It's also the asshole hurting someone or pitting someone against another for no good reason that we cathartically celebrate when they get a deserve punch in the face. But, and here's the thing: these definitions can be twisted in another direction. If someone is saying the thief hurts the people he stole from, or literally did, they wouldn't be wrong. And then they'd justify the police breaking a piece of furniture in their heads. What this simplistic look at the rule 'don't hurt if you don't want to be hurt' misses is the antescedent. If we think we are allowed to hurt those who hurt us, and the poor are starving because we don't give them enough to eat, who is to say their violence, of theft, of assault, isn't to them the same 'justified violence' we use on them later? Most people look at an act of violence like it's on its own, its own thing that happens. But can anyone honestly say being poor and deprived has no influence on why they started hurting others by theft? Yes, it sounds like we are justifying the violence when we fault other people for judging something out of context... because we are. Remember? Only the 'resulting' violence is 'justified', so that means all theft that is the result of the violence of being poor (economical deprivation and social abandonment, etc), is.  Of course, with that same justification, there is a free pass for every asshole who think they 'need' to be selfish and hurt others to survive - say, more rich people saying they need to be asshole to their employees because if they are not doing the same shit as their rivals, they are at a disadvantage in the market. Isn't this a nice turd of a snake eating its own tail?  Not to mention you can access a freepass of violence via huge doses of paranoia that are thrown down people's throat, with the best example of this being: the red scare. It's like you put it: my justification is I'm the good guy, those are bad guys, they did bad things... that rarely anyone can even pin point. How many people died in every invasion war invented by the United State various governments, and how many died in the hands of evil North Korea dictator? You can use the same bit of paranoia discourse to talk about, homosexuals coming to wreck the traditional family, blacks being all criminals, Muslims being all terrorists, the Police being always 'right', the United State being always 'right', and every other bit of bullshit that are thrown down our throats over and over and over again.  ... OK. I rambled a lot more than I meant to. My point of order here is that violence... of course will always be amoral, but that moral imperative leaves us nowhere in terms of logical thought, so discussing how moral or 'justified' a violence isn't the issue. And for our own survival we need to identify the a priori violence/offenders - the true 'warlocks' the 'breakers of contracts', the 'original sinners', if you will. And stop them. And violence (physical or otherwise) is not necessarily the way... it's just 'justified'."

"Am I weird for actually feeling bad when I accidentally kill innocent NPC in video games? That I feel the urge to play as nice person as possible in every game that give you any choice at all? That I play stealth games like Hitman and Thief as pacifist as possible, and will (usually) restart a level if I fuck up rather than kill my way through the level? That unless I'm absolutely sure some NPC is inevitably hostile in a open world game; I will save and see if they really do kill me before reloading and stealth killing them?   Is it weird that I find fictional 'justified' violence in movies/tv-series more too revolting to watch anymore; while I can tolerate watching dramatized real violence in docu-dramas like Narcos somehow. My reasoning is that there is more than enough real suffering in the world; more than I actually can tolerate to consider (I don't watch tv-news anymore it makes me depressed), so I find making up fictional suffering to be perverse."

"I am a personally a pacifist.  I do not, and will not use violence.   In my opinion Violence is nether good nor bad, in the same way as a Fox killing a Hare is violent, but has no moral standing.  it is nether right no wrong.  This is, in-part why I view the concept of morally justified violence  is nothing more than a myth.  A story we tell ourselves to excuse what is otherwise abhorrent act.   But, then why establish that violence has no moral standing to begin with?   Because the violence is not what is abhorrent, but the inflicting of suffering upon another.  Take into consideration the muscle bound beefcakes of the WWE.  That is wrestling.  It's literally a sport OF violence.  Or the sport of Boxing, where the goal is literally to inflict physical damage via blunt force trauma!    The answer is because nether of these acts inflict SUFFERING.  not in the true sense. In both cases, individuals are willing participants, and genuinely enjoy the act of doing so.  The violence doesn't even need moral justification.  You don't need to see either wrestler as a bad guy (although everyone LOVES a good HEEL!) to enjoy a good match.  Like a violent, sweaty, manly ballet we enjoy the performance.   It is the question of do you want to inflict suffering upon someone.  That is what you need to justify.  And then the question of would you take their life.    And there is the biggest flaw with this video, in my opinion.  You did not separate the greater question of violence verses the moral question of killing.  Because is it much easier to justify violence BEFORE you have to confront the bloody result."

"I think it is likely that A Clockwork Orange was named to share initials with Oliver Cromwell,  who was a young thug and rapist before growing up to hold political power.   I believe this despite the explanation Anthony Burgess gave of the title representing the question of whether something organic made mechanical,  like an 'orange with the juice sucked out,' would still function enough like what it started out as to be considered the same thing in essence."

"My perspective on violence flipped upside down when, listening to a Radiolab podcast on the evolution of the AIDS virus, I learned that apes eat other monkeys as a staple food source.   Apes. Eat other monkeys. And humans, in the wild, would regularly hunt, kill, and eat monkeys that look extremely similar to us. And apparently there are cultures where people still eat monkeys.   The idea that there is this rock solid way we identify our own kind, which comes with an instinct of goodwill/protection, really crumbles in the context of this knowledge. Monkeys have faces and hands like ours and use similar emotional expressions. When they scream in terror/pain it sounds like a person. Smaller monkeys look adorable, like human children. This could explain how being bloodthirsty + non-empathic towards fellow humanoid creatures was an evolutionarily successful trait, now preserved particularly well in certain 'predatory' individuals. It's very interesting that we even use that word, 'predator', to describe non-cannibalistic humans who regularly attack other humans without intending to eat them. Why do we conflate violence with eating? I bet this is why.  Vice versa, other apes hunting and killing *us* may explain our fear/hatred towards otherness. This could potentially help explain racism (power/history/systems have never felt like quite enough to me). In the wild, how could our brain distinguish between our own kind, and similar apes who were likely either a) delicious or b) a predator threat? It may have been advantageous to have a low threshold for identifying otherness and reacting aggressively. Racism breaks down when racists develop close relationships with members of the race they hate. Maybe some individuals have to develop relationships with all shapes and sizes of other people to emotionally recognize that type of person as a member of the same species."
"that meal at the beginning was a months worth of cholesterol"
"Normal violence isn't fun unless you're a sociopath. We have empathy for others so we don't want to hurt them. I think that's why it's easier to shoot an animal than to beat it to death with your bare hands. Or easier to buy a burger than to kill and eat the animal yourself. The more distance we have from the violence the easier it is to indulge in it. People don't want to actually kill people because of empathy usually. But in media like movies or videogames. We enjoy violence because the connection is not so personal. They aren't a real person actually dying. The media either get's you to want them to die or detach you from empathy for them."

"I'd have to say violence is more satisfying than fun... that school yard bully in gradeschool who won't stop picking on you no matter what you say or which adults you tell? Getting him to stop saying things for even 3 minutes with a brief application of physical brutality? Solves nothing, but satisfying as hell.  Laptop having technical problems? Throw it out a window: it's even more broken now, but still satisfying. I would assume that violence is more often the result of frustration or anger, rather than hate. Which is why argumentum ad back-hand-ulum is as appealing as it is to those it appeals to... some people can argue in circles endlessly, which gets frustrating, so shutting 'em up with a smack in the gob is probably satisfying. You aren't right, but you sure feel better about it."

"Great work!  I wonder what your thoughts are on the acceptance of violence in mainstream media, in contrast to the general intolerance of explicit sexual content.   Ok, there is titillation everywhere, but naked genitals are a no-go, even though we all have them and they're less harmful than guns. For example, an image of a cock sliding into a pussy - probably one of the most normal and enjoyable things humans can do - is regarded as offensive or a lack of good taste (even in Europe). Yet, it is widely accepted to watch people being killed in the most gruesome ways, and the news occasionally shows images of dead bodies. The killings are usually justified by pointing out an antagonist, like terrorists or zombies.  This all puzzles me. Can you make a video about this?"

"The killer was right thought. The act of killing itself is not intrinsically wrong. It always depends on the context. Sometimes, when acting in defense an act of murder can be excused. Even legally. The same thing applies to wars. People kill other people in wars without being penalized. Quite to the contrary, we declare these people/murderers heroes. So yeah, it always depends on the context. The only reason why we declared the act of killing to be immoral is because you wouldn't want it to be the other way around. It's like a fail-safe."

"People enjoy violence when they stop empathizing with the victims of it. It's the same reason even you, a leftist trans woman with a philosophy background, can fry up steak and eggs with zero discomfort surrounding the animal agriculture industry (which hurts not only animals, but the largely undocumented workers who work at these plants, not to mention the planet). Those Indonesian war criminals see themselves as freedom fighters, they rationalize and justify the gruesome acts they commit in the same way that 90% of people rationalize and justify completely unnecessary animal enslavement, slaughter, and exploitation. We ask ourselves: is it normal, natural, or necessary? If we want to delude ourselves, we say yes to all sorts of insane and cruel acts of violence."

"Okay, so I think the premise of your analysis is flawed, and hence, the rest of your argument falls victim to that flaw. I don't think violence is inherently fun. I would love to discuss this in a civil manner. Also, being violent is fun is a statement I disagree with. I think your videos are mostly fantastic, but I think you seriously missed a point with this video, but I understand your view. I just don't agree with it."

"You know, I'm gonna say this- I'm super glad you made a visual point about BDSM and violence. I've practiced BDSM for years, had a few expertiences, met all kinds of people- mostly psychopaths-, and even though I wouldn't hurt a fly, I've been there, I've done it, I've asked for it, I've witnessed SO MUCH VIOLENCE, disguised as pleasure, as an implicit rule, and there was so much ABUSE and MANIPULATION, mostly psychological but not limited to physical and mental, even those that looked happy and claimed to be a healthy relationship. 24/7 is bullshit also, I mean just how lol. Even the cleverest, nicest person I've met around the BDSM arena, was entirely blinded about part of what she was experiencing. I think there's a lot of lying in the form of using different words and selling pleasure and acceptance to the violent that it can turn into a grey area in your head, where maybe if a submissive asks to be hit or choked into passing out then it's ok for someone to do so. It's jsut wrong. In any place someone asks to be hit, they may have a psychological issue, and even if they do it '''''safe''''' and within a relationship, it can still hurt beyond the flesh. It's playing with fire. And don't get me started on pornography... I hope you make a video on that if you haven't already. Peace."

"To notice that some people enjoy violence and that war is fun if you're winning isn't all that great a revelation. I think that's obvious to people. The question is why do so many people enjoy violence. Either it serves some adaptive evolutionary purpose or (less likely) it's a spandrel."
"What movie or character is she copying at 15:20?"
"Violence is a tool, a solution and a option, but never the only option and you are stupid if the it is the first option or if you never ever consider it as an option. For every Martin Luther King do you have a Malcolm X. It give the ruling elite 2 options reform or have a fight.   Dont feel bad about it for they love to give us 2 choices and we need to pick the lesser of 2 evils."
"I play A LOT of games, and for me, i can't even be guilt free evil in games where being good is a choice. Sure, let me play gta and i'll kill hookers and whatever fucking innocent crosses my path, but playing Fallout or Infamous where the games really directly asks you 'are you gonna be a fucking asshole, or a hero?', i simply can't choose the first option without feeling guilty at that time, and the ensuing results from it are hard to watch.  I had to do it for Infamous, kill a guy in front of his daughter because Im a goddamn trophy whore and i wanted the plantinum trophy and that meant I had to do the EVIL path and make basically everyone hate me, but i had to look away from the cutscene   it's an interesting dynamic really"

This mentally disturbed man can also become another shooter, this can be very dangerous. Will this man soon shoot up a Trump rally because he thinks they were plotting some evil fascist plans? He can't give fascist a platform by allowing them to live right."
"Contrapoints, while I share your deep worries about the far right I think worrying about the Weimar Republic and its transition to the Nazis is certainly motivating it may be a case of the Generals fighting the last war. An interesting historian of the 20th century has put our a series of four or five videos on how we are heading more down the road of Russia's oligarchical authoritarianism. I still think the far right is the problem but we have to know the model that is being foisted upon us is post-soviet Russia, not Nazi Germany. The historian is Timothy Snyder and I think it is worth looking at his take on where we are.  Here is a link to the first video of the series. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_D0YkDjy8"

"On violence in media. Is it made that way because it's what people like or is there another reason? Are video games violent because violent videos games are what people want the most? My opinion on the matter (as an indie game dev myself) is 'no'.  Under capitalism it seems as though the easiest thing to make is the thing that is made. That is - it's cheaper and quicker to make violent media. That gets advertised, normalized, and eventually it's what consumers expect out of habit. Violence in media, like in real life, is the easy way.  Longer discussion on video games ahead, be warned: In video games in particular, violence is quicker and easier to develop. Video games are limited by computers, which are very good at very specific things - namely physics simulations. Video games, as opposed to board games, track finite data points very quickly and can spit out simulations that approximate physical changes in the environment. The player then interacts with that environment - usually violently. In return, the environment interacts violently with the player. That's about all it can do because computers aren't very good at simulating discussions or emotions or other things that aren't reducible to mathematics (or in game physics). That's why there's so many violent video games and not nearly as many violent tabletop games. Tabletop games require the players to be running the simulation, and players are really bad at doing physics calculations on the fly. They're much better at discussions and emotions and other things that aren't reducible to mathematics. Sure, some games have some math (especially roleplaying game because those tend to actually be tactical war games with very little actual roleplaying), but many also rely on types of pattern recognition instead, an area video games lag behind in (and may never be as good as humans at processing - time will tell).  So I don't think violence is in media because it's what people like the most. I think it's in media because it's fast and cheap to produce and so produces the highest profit margins - the only thing that matters in a capitalist market."
"Honestly, I feel like the only reason why violence is so oft' used in games is because it's the easiest way to portray conflict.  Like, let's simplify it down to six stats. Strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. In storytelling, it's pretty easy to portray someone as strong, dexterous, or sturdy. However, portraying a character as intelligent isn't quite so easy. That requires the character to show some sort of deep understanding of a topic at hand, one where the answer isn't particularly clear. And you could, theoretically, just make it so that every other character is stupid and incapable of understanding what's right in front of them, but there's a good chance that that'll just backfire. You could say a character is wise, but then you'd also have to write that character as one who consistently makes good decisions and imparts good advice. You could say a character is charismatic, but then you'd actually have to know how to pull off that charm. Which is probably the most difficult conceivable thing in the world.   So it's pretty easy to write 'Person A punches person B in the face'. But detailing how person A solved person B's riddle is a task. Detailing how person A understood person B was bullshitting them is a task. Detailing how person A convinced person B is a challenge. If the riddle is easy, the adversary is a shitty liar, or the rube is extremely gullible, it's not really interesting. But if they're not, you have to craft legitimate answers to the questions posed. Which can likewise be exceptionally difficult."

"In the section on police violence, I think it's important to note that you are viewing this from an American perspective, and your police are fucking awful. I am British and while our police are not perfect (there are marked discrepancies between how they treat white and non-white people) they are not anywhere near as bad as American police. It is not generally considered normal for people to die in police custody, or to be shot by police. Some police violence is probably inevitable in any system which involves police, but I don't think the American police should be treated as an example of typical western policing. American policing is an example of how badly it is possible for policing to go in a supposedly liberal country, but it is not inevitably that bad. It would be interesting to examine how and why American policing is so much worse than British policing, and the factors that may have contributed to this. Maybe you could collaborate with Shaun and/or Ollie from PhilosophyTube?"
"From my perspective, an important aspect of what makes violence 'fun' (especially from things like video games and movies) is the catharsis inherent to the solution to one's problems being straight forward - just club your problems into submission. A lot of the problems we deal with on a day to day basis are beyond our control completely or otherwise very complicated and frustrating to resolve (or even wrap your head around). We're rarely given simple solutions to things, but we like ourselves some simple solutions. There is escapism and catharsis in being presented with a problem objectified into something your frustrations can just lay into with an emotional and physical outburst."

"If Richard Spencer agreed to fisticuffs with the individual that punched him there wouldn't have been articles discussing whether its okay to punch a nazi or not.

Owning a gun for protection from racist cops just perpetuates the fear of labeling all cops as violent, racists."

"Excellent video.   I think the key question isn't so much 'when is violence fun?' But more 'when is violence necessary, justified, acceptable, etc.'   The thing about sadism is there are very few genuine sadists, who actually enjoy inflicting violence on other people. Most of the time , any 'enjoyments' is really a coping mechanism, Or self justification .   For example, those gangsters in Jakarta. Given ordinary circumstances [or at least circumstances in most liberal Western societies] those guys wouldn't have done what they did. But In order to get to the point where they were murdering thousands and thousands of alleged communists a lot had to be going on. There's the familial bonds between the men; the idea is that your  'protecting' your buddies. The fact that you're social circle are also killing people, and encouraging you to do it, normalized the practice. On a wider scale, there is nationalist propaganda , making out that the country is under attack by revolutionary infiltrators, throwing up the spectre of Stalinist purges.   I'm a little disappointed that you bring up the postmodernist trope of 'everything is violence!' While technically correct, it doesn't really help us make any salient points about society. All it really does is let people say ' wow, this liberal democracy, with its independent judiciary, it's checks and balances, it's free press, And its capacity to reform and change for the greater public good. When you get right down to it this is clearly exactly as good as an authoritarian dictatorship run at the whims of one man (and it's always a man).'    Pretty sure Trump made that talking point when discussing Russian election interference. Hmmm .   In my opinion, violence can be justified as long as it's : Accountable, proportionate, And in pursuit of a specific and justified aim. which, funnily enough, means I agree with the states monopoly on violence,in principle. Although we're in agreement that the state often fails to live up to those principles in practice."

"Woohoo, getting the Foucault out.  You should try Richard Maxwell Brown for American violence though, and Richard Slotkin for how mythology (AKA popular media) plays a role in violence.  Oh, and my favorite - Santayana - but he's really just good for nice quotes.  In terms of the neoliberal interventionism mentioned at 14:00 - It is even more implicit than many realize.  The international relations philosophy which drives these interventions is called 'Wilsonianism,' and as the name implies, it is based on good old Woody Willey.  He also coined the term 'new liberties' as a campaign slogan, which is essentially the source of the term neoliberalism.  Hilariously enough, he also coined 'America first' as a campaign slogan.  Nothing escapes Wilson's pernicious influence."
"Interesting.  Well done.   Thanks for the laughs, too.  : )"

"I don't think you can get people on the far left to care about the moral hang ups of punching people that they think are Fascists. Just like the Indonesian gangsters do not care about killing Communists because in their minds they were doing what they thought was justified to stop the spread of an ideology that has been responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people, Antifa and the like feel they are doing the same to stop the spread of an ideology that has also killed millions. I think the question that should be asked is: Is 'punching Nazis' actually helpful? If the leftist's theory that punching anyone who they label a Nazi is actually effective (i.e. punching them will make these people crawl back into their holes and not express their ideas in public, it will 'make racists afraid again', etc) then why is it that after Richard Spencer got punched in the face for the whole internet to see, he is still openly and proudly advocating White Nationalism and the building of an ethno-state? Spencer was embarrassed by the punch, but it didn't make him change his mind on any of his ideas, it didn't make him apologize for or retract any of the things he said. He just ended up doubling down on his rhetoric.   Another concern is the fact that Antifa have appointed themselves the ultimate judge of who is a Fascist and who is not. Given that the majority of Antifa is staunchly pro-Communist, I don't exactly trust the judgement of people who also blindly support an authoritarian ideology that has killed millions of people. Antifa has a history of descending on right-wing protests that are not even White Nationalist or Fascist in nature and instigating violence. There's also the fact that many of them don't just condone violence against right-wingers (whether they're White Nationalists or not) but also condoning violence against Liberals (i.e. the nice catchphrase 'Liberals get the bullet too'). I think it's safe to say that even if you support the punching of Nazis, Antifa has stepped outside of their original mission of punching Nazis to stop the spread of Fascism, and now they are targeting and condoning violence against anyone who does not agree with their far-left ideology. Do people not see how this can get out of hand? Do people not see how it is already getting out of hand?  I think the saying 'You can't beat the hate out of someone' is true. And punching people who already justify their ideology by relying on a victim complex is not going to make any of these White Nationalists/Alt-Righters go away. As it stands right now, the White Nationalist movement is fringe but instigating violence against them will only make them grow in number. As abhorrent as I find the idea of ethno-nationalism to be, some of these people do have real concerns and I think it's better to focus on talking to and de-radicalizing them, try to convince them that yes, some of their concerns may be valid, but joining an extremist group is not going to help them and will only isolate them further. I would say the same for anyone who advocates for authoritarianism, be they far left or far right. It's not easy to talk to people you vehemently disagree with but it's better to start those hard discussions than pouring more fuel on the fire by perpetuating an endless cycle of violence against one another."
"Hey Contrapoints! I really like your videos, very well done! I don't really know how I would categorize myself politically, I grew up very conservative and agreed with roughly half of it and thought the rest was garbage. I try really hard to find the truth wherever I can find it. I especially like that you include so much philosophy in your videos. I only lasted one semester in college, but thankfully I was able to take a philosophy class. It changed my life!  Anyways, I voted for Trump and I figured you might like to hear my perspective on the recent election and my views on the current social/political environment of the U.S. I have been wanting to talk with you in the comments related to other videos but didn't think you would see it because they are older. So, it might not be related to this video but what the hell! Damn, why can't they just have a way to dm on YouTube like Reddit does."
"I personally hate violence. I hate the thought of other people's suffering.  I personally wish there was less violence in movies and video games. And I tend to avoid it, especially if it goes overboard and seems cruel. Unfortunately, that is very hard to do as video games are littered with it. You can bet I do play a lot of the non-violent games like Animal Crossing or non-violent aspects of games that do exist. I don't get the desire for violence at all.  On the other hand, I LOVE lolicon and loli related entertainment. Denpa music, J-Core, SoL anime, JRPGs, MMORPGs, MADs, fanart. All of it.   Because of this, I avoid and have absolutely no interest in violent and sadistic popular anime like Attack on Titan, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One Punch Man, or action or shounen anime in general. Instead, I watch what people often call as the thing 'plaguing anime', plot-less, violence-less slice of life comedy anime colliqually called 'moe' and 'cute girls doing cute things'. With 700 year old vampire lolis galore.  And I'm treated as a potential predator because of it. I tell people over and over that it's just a fetish, but people insist that I'm a pedophile, even though I'm not. People treat me much worse than people who like to consume violent media. People don't generally act as if violent media, even media that glorifies violence, will cause violence. But I am always hearing about how loli must be stopped because it will lead to sexual abuse, and 'normalizes' sexual abuse. People even talk about their violent fantasies about me. That if we have this fetish, we're all pedos and should just die. That they want to kill us horribly. I'm so sick and scared of hearing people' violent fantasies about me just because of what fictional characters I like and have feelings for. Feelings that aren't violent.  I don't understand why violent fantasies get a free pass, and get to be given a medal of moral superiority over those of us who like to bask in admiring the beauty of candy colored cute characters from Japan.  Why is violence and the glorification of it treated as so much better? Why is it okay to consume ultraviolent media, but not cute media?"

"Sadism is an evolutionary selected trait in some individuals because of the fact that when living in 'the old days' where violence was necessary to guarantee the propagation of your kin, the individual that derived pleasure from violence often had an advantage to those who didn't.  And why do you say that sadistic violence is not necessarily the worst that can happen to people and compare it to 'structural violence', 'low key sexual assault' and suicide because of work related stress... What an indefensible position, your estrogen is making you act like even more of a leftist degenerate."

"I dont like violence, even in movies seeing people get hurt (for example, if a rape scene is made or even implied) I start feeling like I want to cry. I did not enjoy the Nazi punching video at all. It was immature , and all it did was make that racist seem like a martyr to his followers. I do think that the psychology of rapists and murderers (not all) is different from regular people. Psychopaths, for example, do not have a moral or conscience. Although not all murderers are psychopaths and not all psychopaths are murderers."

"@12:30 - I think it helps to add to the dialog forms of passive violence. Such as walls, doors, velvet ropes, physical barriers. I like how you brought up frustration violence vs. organized violence, but a lot of human social systems evolve or rely on having space to cool down, physical organization. These can be organized to keep crowds safer when going to rock concert venues, or organized to make people go a bit crazy - such as free their money inhibitions at a shopping mall / Las Vegas."

What right man would have it any other way? he said. The good book does indeed count war an evil, said Irving. Yet there’s many a bloody tale of war inside it. It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way.'"

"This video doesn't do much for people who reject the premise that punching Richard Spencer was justified in the first place.   The benefits of punching Richard Spencer include creating a culture where Nazis fear displaying their true colors in public.  The costs of punching Richard Spencer include stepping onto a slippery slope of who we're allowed to punch. Spencer denies being a Nazi. He doesn't wear Nazi regalia. This slope is too slippery, it's not worth it.   And even if Spencer was an open Nazi wearing a swastika, we're still on a slippery slope. Many people would also be okay with punching fascists. Or communists. Or pedophiles. Who gets to decide where the line is? Fuck all of that, the line should be that none of it is okay. Don't punch anyone unless they've already started swinging at you."
"i hate communism with a passion, but beyond, still i am definitely not horrified about the 'breaking eggs argument'. it is not me who has to be horrified by it. if you know what i mean. and the same is with the issue with the extreme right. also, none of the 2 produce a social condition with minimal body count.  if you want condition with minimal body count you have to look out the window. its messy, sometimes unjust and sometimes plain stupid. but it kinda works. liberal capitalism is arguably the oldest and most robust social system which is able to sustain itself when applied to a group of beyond 50 people.  is violence bad? obviously, as long as you are vulnerable and/or empathetic. both of which lay at the core of human nature. however, violence is inevitable if there is no compromise or technical solution to a conflict. an educated western person should be more than capable of finding compromises and technical solutions. he can and should draw on thousands of years of experience (history).  as for the people who are not educated or western, well... it becomes more complicated. - education is a rather technical issue, there should be no problem with that (unless you have the IQ of a bacteria or Merkel) - the persuasion of the adoption of the western value system, on the other hand, implies ideological aggression, cultural stress, polarization,... both for the assimilated and the assimilating. ideally, at the end of the process a new culture should arrive where the best values are adopted from both cultures. - this is how basically western culture came to be in the first place.  figuring it out how to do that without bloodshed implies a lot of communication. without communication bloodshed, i am afraid, is the only option. there is inter-existence and co-existence. coexistence, in practical terms, can only work where oil, exotic metals, gas, workforce, ... does not dictate a 0-sum game.  i feel like the avoidance of the 0-sum games (although there is no such thing on existential questions) only delays the inevitable. thus my perfect world is completely void of white, black, asian, trans, gay, cis,... but contains people, y'know, homo fucking sapiens, no matter the cost"

But theres the riots at Berkeley and many other universities. theres a lot of left violence at Portland. Theres the church shooting at texas. Theres the attack on a republican ballgame. Possibly even the Vegas s shooting. Come on Contra, try to be honest.  But I see why you are trying to distort it because you want to justify such polictical violence and thats very dishonest. YOu cant just admit its wrong because if you admit its wrong then you have to admit that the lefts entire goal is wrong. If you justify the lefts violence, then the right violence is also justified and the whole thing spirals. But the left seems to be attacking the state itself, the foundation of the United States"

"I don't ever want to RESORT to violence ever again in my life but I wouldn't bet on it. It is definitely bad. The Left should never get violent, let them (the Right) RESORT to running people over like with their dodge chargers. I think there is a total over reaction right now by the left, with no intellectual firepower and censoring speech. Trump is just a joke, an opening salvo to the dark times we have coming. Someone is going to perfect his style. I say, Trump is doing it like all who came before and will fail us like all have before him. Fail more if policies go thru."
"I was a little bit hoping you'd go deeper into different philosophies of what violence is."
"I would argue that the Richard Spencer thing isn't really 'sadism'.  Sure, we love watching Richard Spencer get punched, but that's more symbolic than it is any sort of actual violence.  I don't think most of us would enjoy watching Richard Spencer be murdered, raped, crippled, or even just seriously injured.  Furthermore, can you stop dismissing your leftist critics with argumentum ad cringinem?  I really admired your twitter apology for dismissing your Singal critics, but they're just nice words if you don't live by them.  This is exactly what you did with Sarkeesian in your early videos and it was disgusting."

"Even justified violence shouldn't be enjoyed. The aristotelian point about dispositional habits is good to remember. Habituating oneself to treat violence as something good (or even neutral) contributes to making one more disposed to overstep the bounds of justified violence. There's an interesting detail from Locke regarding this. He advocated vegetarianism even though he thought that animals don't have any rights. His view (like that of Aristotle, Descartes, and of Christian theology) was that any violence towards animals, including totally frivolous sadistic violence - is not in itself wrong. It is still wrong, but not due to regard for the animal, instead it is wrong due to regard for the doer - the act of cruelty is an expression of and an reinforcement of a 'hardening of the mind', of a disposition within the doer to positively view unnecessary violence. We could translate this to Nazi-punching, even if you think that the Nazi himself doesn't deserve to not be punched, and doesn't deserve our care about whether he is punched, the antifascist (would-be) puncher deserves to not succumb into cruelty. And other (non-nazi) people deserve to live in a society where antifascists (and others) are not cruel people, people with a disposition of doing unnecessary violence. Also, i suggest Malatesta's Anarchy and violence and his Class struggle or class hatred, they're probably best short texts a leftist can read about violence."

"Regarding this crossroads you're at, I just wanted to add a thought. Think of Britney. Now I can awknowledge she sounds like an odd example right off the bat. No offense to her fans, but you may ask yourself what the f*ck can we learn from her situation? We can learn that the bitch took risks in her career. Some paid off really well, and she had some others that definitely did not. But at the end of that cycle, even when she lost everything (not like you would, but the dramatic reference is fun) everyone took her in because Britney gave them so much more than she ever took. And that is you. Don't let the fear of making mistakes misguide you because you give SO much more than you will ever take from this community, and I know this won't change with you. If you choose to talk to right wingers, have confidence that this is what will keep you centered. You have good intentions, and because of that you will always find your way. Even if you get lost for a while, you always will find your way."
"aWhen the revolution comes and I become Dictator of the Proletariat I am going to make homework illegal and video games mandatory."
"I acknowledge the issues with both paths but maintain that anti-fascist violence is right and good, even when it's ugly, even when it's 'fun'. It's always tactical, and if you've made a fascist a bit more nervous about stepping foot outside in the morning it's done it's work. Possible disagreements aside, know that the right isn't making videos like this and won't think twice if the balance of power shifts ever so slightly in their favor - they're already emboldened. Videos like this are why we are better people (I will not concede that point), even if I don't agree with your hesitation. Violence should make you hesitate, but we live in their world, not ours. We might not always have that luxury."
"Hey im here to give a voice to gamers that are currently being silenced in the post gamer gate, SJW,  lets-make-titties-smaller-in-video-games world. I demand gamer rights  But really, I do love video games, and violent ones of course, but i dont subscribe to claims that video games are only fun because they are violent. Some of the most popular games are completely innocent, sometimes nauseatingly so, i mean some of them are so saccharine you'd get a tooth ache (animal crossing, nintendogs, Pikman etc..) Of course Violent video games are the most popular but few of them succeed on violence alone, look... ok... GTA is one of the most fun games on the planet, and that is pure violence and sadism but it is the one that gets the most attention in media and such (uh oh as im typing im realizing i dont have too convincing of an arguement anymore). I think a lot of first person shooters are fun more for the challenge and strategy than violence. You can only see so many civilians get mowed down before being bored. Some of them just have to be violent in nature. For example SKyrim is a fantasy game, and in a fantasy game it is required that there is a certain amount of violence, I mean whats a fantasy story without swords and orcs and dragons. Thats the genre, but the genre relies on the excitement of a whole new world, and discovering that world. there is blood and fighting but,  Im a big overwatch player and, despite people have guns there is no blood or loss of extremities or car crashes. I think they succeed so well  because combat, is something that we seldom experience, its exciting, but mostly its a challenge. I just believe that for a video game to be fun it doesnt have to be violent, a lot of games, if they are team based or a FPS or a MOBA, require a sort of elimination, its like tag i guess. Help me Natalie. Help me still play videogames and not believe that I am a sadist. Anyway, video games dont make people violent."

"Violence is an inseparable part of life.  Whether it is people committing heinous acts upon each other or prey being eaten alive by a predatory, violence appears to be fundamental.  The act of prey being devoured makes easy sense; our motives for violence appear to be just a bit more complicated.  Although, perhaps we over think the motivation needed for us to commit violence.  If we are to say that violence is fun, which in some ways it may be, perhaps the roots of fun should be explored a bit.  If we understand why there is violence (revenge, removal of the old guard, prevention of more heinous acts), why should it be fun?  And if it is to some, is it normal for violence to be fun or not?"

What would be more worth exploring is how violence on large scale is conducted, justified and taught. You touch on the subject in your video for a while.

"Violence is bad, it's always bad. But sometimes it's necessary to stop a greater unnecessary violence. The thing to be aiming for is a society where the frequency of unnecessary violence, requiring necessary violence to stop or prevent it, diminishes to the extent that it is extremely rare. Justifying violence is morally dubious, as violence can often be justified even when it is not necessary to achieve the outcome sought. Justifying violence gives an air of righteousness that is not necessarily legitimate. Violence is only righteous when there is no viable non-violent solution."
"You look amazing <3"
"Making fantastic progress on the voice, Contra!"
"Violence is bad. That philosophy of 'the social contract' was addressed by the same author in Leviathan, where the Leviathan was a state system that was given the power to do violence but only in three justified ways -- in criminal justice to deter criminals, to defend itself with an army, and to attack other nations that will inevitably attack it (though even Hobbes acknowledged that this last one often looked like the 'bad' kind of violence where you attack a peaceful neighbor). But these methods were viewed as necessary, not as a 'good', because violence is never good -- at best it's a necessary evil."
"The only thing I can say is, 'Do people actually 'do' laundry in the dishwasher?' I keep seeing that joke around and now I really want to know if that is a thing people do.

"Hi Contra! I just wanted to say that your videos really have helped me be a lot more tolerant of what I would have previously considered crazy SJW ideas. I used to spend a lot of time watching anti-SJW videos and frequenting their subreddits, but slowly I started realizing that most of the so-called anti-SJWs would NEVER take a side against obvious bigots, and would often actually side with them for the sake of 'freedom of speech'. It started making me uncomfortable to share a space with people that I considered abhorrent, so I decided to take a better look of the other side, and that's how I found your videos. Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for putting out such reasonable and well thought-out arguments."
"Hardest one to watch yet. I'm not even sure if that's a compliment or not."
"Your voice is changing SO fast"
"I know of the problem of violence I know that it is bad and can lead to opression , war , genocide But to say I don't crave it  To say that I don't hate, to say that I'm not happy when thousands of people that I know have a bad history die horribly To say this would be a lie I understand the circumstances of the birth of such people and I know it's unfortunate But there are things that need to be erased"

"So entertaining you can't stop watching, so thought provoking you have to.  You really set the bar."
"Revolution reduces the value of all to worthlessness. Perhaps hierarchy allows people to entertain the concept of value, whereas equality does not? The Independence movements in Africa are interesting because they only really spawn dictatorships. The World Wars that destabilized the colonies did so because colonial subjects witnessed white folks in war, they saw the brave and the cowardly, they saw the able and the incompetent. It was the wars that fostered the notions of equality. Then came the problem of 'all men being equal', once they got rid of the white, they also realized they were equal to one another and so couldn't decide who had the right to lead. Technically, nobody had the right, because nobody was better than anyone else. So it all came down to violence again, and who was the most dominant and ruthless.  It's also why Communist countries tend to always end up quickly becoming mass-murdering.  With a hierarchy, a person is 'forced' to see the value in those above them, and in relfection see their own place, and those below them, shit always running down hill. Human life has 'value' in the same way products do. In equal societies, nobody is better than anyone else, but similarly nobody is better than anyone else. So you can't tolerate any level of control unless its at the poitn of a gun... This is why North Korea has turned its ruling family into almost a Theocratic thing, with Kim Jong Un inventing the hamburger and the internet and being suckled by wolves and stuff... It's creating the illusion of the Divine Right to rule again, because otherwise every General in his army who hasn't been executed with anti-aircraft guns is a potential danger - like the Crocodile in Zimbabwe. On the other side there is the French Revolution, where Hierarchy really takes the piss and people go starving. None of it works really... we're just 'between world wars' at the moment."

"I liked the aesthetics of this video, but I felt like it didn't say as much new stuff as your other videos. Maybe it's just what I in particular am familiar with, but the idea of rationalizing violence through othering people, our discomfort with sadism but not violence itself, and the explicit violence of revolution versus the violence implicit to a capitalist system isn't new to me or synthesized in a new way the way I felt some of your other videos were. Not a bad video, but I didn't enjoy it as much as your other videos."

"Sadistic violence is bad. I think that a lot of the justice system is more punitive than preventative or reformative (obviously), and that we should focus more on preventing crime and rehabilitating criminals than making people feel bad because we are angry and afraid."

"OMG, Tabby dancing to Boney M is the best thing Ive seen this week."
"Your newer videos are really the best for sparking *important* discussion between leftists, at least in my experience. My sister and I just had a good talk about the nature of freedom, although it isn't related very directly with most of the video, it was inspired by certain points. It went that, considering freedom is paradoxical (an idea a I've been thinking about a lot recently), advocating 'freedom' really just means advocating certain freedoms. This is why vastly different ideologies claim to be pursuing that same value. I think leftists should specify their freedom as a 'freedom of consent' (and right wing politics defend the freedom to oppress). Voluntarism might be a good word too if the 'libertarians' didn't already ruin it. If I'm right in saying so, leftists are the only ones that really care about consent in a consistent way. We care more about sexual consent, of course, but that's incidental. We also care more about worker's consent, in the form of calling out and rejecting coercion. Libertarian leftists, at least, also think about more about consent in social contracts (this is what actually relates to the video). Maybe authoritarian leftists are different, I don't actually know much about that. I don't know. Im just throwing this out to see if it makes sense to me."
"I love Curious George Kills the Rapist!"
"HEY CONTRA I LOVE YOUUU!"
"Is this really an important point right now? People are starving, drinking tainted water, being bought and sold, serving life sentences for no reason, and all other manner of suffering right this second under the ruling class, and YOUR concern is that killing capitalists isn't good for mental health? Well no shit Sherlock, it probably won't be, but it sure as shit isn't healthy living in poverty while the rich get tax cuts, legal protection, and deregulation. You claim to hate liberals and Nazis but an alarming portion of your videos lately has been about how the left is bad for being violent. Violence against the rich is self-defense. Stop shaming people for it."

"Content warnings.. christ."
"Love the video Contra. Since you like violent movies i reccommend Michael Haneke's 'Funny Games.' Its got everything, violence, opera, Germans (ok ok Austrians), and the film is an arguement AGAINST being entertained by violence. The antagonists break the 4th wall by asking the audience what to do and what they think and it creates this very uncomfortable transformation from being a spectator to being a witness. It's good, i'd be interested in hearing your take on it.   Here's a trailer - https://youtu.be/qmtEu9TnLG8  If you do decide to watch it find the 1997 version with Ulrich Muhle and Susan Lothar. Not the one with Naomi Watts."
"Capitalists aren't people. Harming them isn't violence."
"Just as some feedback on the form. Maybe tone back the surealist asides a little. I think they have less impact if they happen like every 20 seconds.  I think you are right about violence, when we have a justification for it it feels so good regardless of how good the justification is. I have been playing Shadow of Mordor recently, the violent is really visceral and it feels soo fucking good to kill orks because you know they are orks and the are gross and disgusting and evil. It kind of disturbed me because I'm not used to really enjoying violence like that. I mean I've played games where you kill characters before but it was normally because they are in the way of a goal. In this game you really are just conditioned to want to kill every fucking ork you see."
"Great video!"
"I always have a tab open with porn on it when I watch these videos to switch to in case any of my family members come in simply because the porn is easier to explain."
"Books can be a lot more violent than movies."
"cock hard pm me pls"
"17:37 'There comes a point where all of the rationalizations you tell yourself or all the things you believe and do just... don't make any sense.'  i would argue that they don't even matter either. so you might as well be violent only when it's in your interest."
"When do we devour the rich?"
"So back when I was in art school doing my Photomedia degree, I saw footage of police dragging protestors away on my own campus who were demonstrating against budget cuts, when I put these distressing images together with reaction shots from Cannibal Holocaust and scored it with Riz Ortolani's compositions this mashup became an agitprop masterpiece which earned me good grades at our end of year exhibition. I wasn't just slapping Cannibal Holocaust stuff on top of police brutality to be edgy, I was commenting on how the way the protesters were being dragged by police echoes the way the found footage filmmakers died in Cannibal Holocaust, and I was surprised to find out a lot of the students involved there actually liked how I created something so messed up to raise awareness to their plight. Even better, Robert Kerman, whose reaction shots I used in that mashup, approved of how I used his likeness here, so I essentially got an A+ from a pornstar playing an anthropology professor in the movie I was sampling footage from. It's on my Vimeo page if you're interested, seeing police footage in your video reminded me of that thing I made for my classes."
"overcooked steak"
"Way to overanalyze  violence in A Clockwork Orange. FYI, the Saw movies made that movie it's bitch as far as violence levels go. Oh, and also....these are works of fiction. Morale conscience doesn't come into play because it's not real."
"I'm not entirely sure, but I don't believe that 'Curious George kills the Rapist' is a real thing."

"Violence is Not Good. Violence is Not Bad. Violence is Neutral. Ninjai's Food For Thought forum had a MASSIVE discussion of this, that ran to dozens of pages. Dunno if they worked anything out either.  I have my own views on violence. When I created the 'Lonely God' Persona (as part of the lonelygirl15 universe), I called upon a small group of 'friends' to rise up against a massively powerful Secret Society, and in effect, destroy a kind of 'illuminati'. The character himself is mired in GLORIOUS BATTLE tropes, the kind that Listening to one too many Power Metal songs may conjure up in a fevered mind, but as the Tumblr that I tended grew, without an adversary as large and subversive as the 'Hated Chaos', who were more correctly the Order of Denderah, (And before Games Workshop's hovering lawyers sue, I arrived at that name because 'There is no Order in their methods, nor method in their Madness') The Lonely God turned into a more literal 'Warrior' for Justice.   Like, he put the 'W' in SJW. (much as I hate that fucking Acronym)  Still, Violence can be neutral, if buffing a friend's buttocks with a fur disc attached to a power Drill can be considered Violence (Long story, ask me some time, just not now)."
"Islam condemns hatred against people – 'O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do' (Quran 5:8) What do you think?"
"This is some fuckin' deep shit."

"Ur bleeping is 2 loud 4 me"
"If this video isn't for justifying punching people I don't agree with I will be disappointed"
"So this is an interesting take that poses very important questions we need to consider and that is partially redeeming you in my eyes (which is of course the most important thing, my loving approval); when I’ve discussed violence in leftist groups it always ends up as talking of how non-violent action is often responded to violently so it’s ok to skip ahead to violence to begin with, and no more talk of when it’s not ok. My takeaway was that violence needs to be strategic and enjoyment of it risks losing the self control to execute it correctly."

"Those Indonesians are my heros ,thanks contra never heard of them :D"
"Political violence is enviable in a mass society, probably due to some dumb evolutionary trait. The problem is the scale of these systems we've built, and of course, those same systems incentivize cruelty on mass scale. The only predictable systems are ourselves (as individual), and even then, we don't control a lot of ourselves. We exist in a constant state of cognitive dissonance, because we now can witness this violence on a daily basis though the media."
"I don't like violence of any kind in fiction, and I don't find it fun either. Indeed, my favourite movies and games are those that have no violence in them. I do think, however, it needs to be documented and learned from, and understood so that, if a harsh time comes, people know what is the right and just decision. But to me, people are cooperative animals, and you never see ants fighting each other, for example. And I think they are capable of doing something so much more than adhering to tribalism, which is a double-edged sword. I suppose that's what I think.  But no, I find that stuff nasty, even to the villains.  Also I'd give a little heads-up and say I think you've been digressing into skits a bit too often for this video, much more than usual. P. good regardless."

"Can you even _have_ an ordered society that isn't ultimately maintained through violence and the credible threat of violence?  Like, if I can't convince someone to co-operate, but their co-operation is essential (because they're running around stabbing people or smashing important things, say), what choice do I have but to physically restrain them? Short of mind control, which I'm not sure would be any better? That's why I find it hard to condemn the punching of Nazis except possibly on strategic grounds."

"I... don't get this video. Violence is fun. Or is it? Maybe? Sometimes? Who cares? Punching a nazi is bad, maybe, sometimes, at least optically, but then again? And then it just ends on... blah blah, platitude platitude, I don't know. I mean... okay? Unlike your other videos, this just felt very disjointed? Was there even supposed to be a point?"
"I love these open ended videos for how much they give me to think about  My immediate thought was to qualify the difference between 'good violence' and 'bad violence' and the only real-life application I could come up with is self-defense.  At what point does sadistic violence become self defense? If a large majority holds the beliefs that all queer people be euthanized, can physical violence against them be considered self-defense?  What about few people?  What if it's just one person?  What if you're not queer, when does your violence no longer become justified?  And are there other forms of violence I'm forgetting that could qualify as 'inherently good', if any can?  This video gave me a lot to think about, that's for sure."

"You should definitely check out '' modernity and the holocaust' by the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman (sadly recently passed away).  According to many sociologists people are naturally violent (which i dont know if i agree with). Baumans theory is about how something like the holocaust could have happened in a civilized society. How normal moral people could do incredibly violent things in the second world war. He uses the term 'moral sleeping pill' to describe what was also mentioned in the video: the reasoning behind why violence is okay in a certain situation. This also explains why we like violence in movies. It's like a drive we have in ourselves and we have to release it in some way.   Unrelated but just super interesting: also check out Baumans recent video's on al jazeera about the refugeecrisis."

"Interesting video. Going to be hard to unwrap all my thoughts about it in a youtube comment but I'll have a go. We all have it drummed into us that 'Violence is bad' but in the media violence is used in everything from Tom and Jerry cartoons to insidious cop shows about how the cops must always break the rules to bring the bad guys (whoever they may be) to justice.   The influence of the media is so strong that it's hard to perceive the world from outside its traditional framework - Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Who should we empathise with? Who should we take satisfaction from besting and beating? A Clockwork Orange is good art because it plays with the assumptions we make, but I don't think it's good to let media like this muddy our analysis - or even our feelings - about violence in the material world, or maybe more accurately power dynamics and the use of force to achieve goals.  It might be worth exploring as a counter point to this video the valorisation of pacifism and non-violence in the media, the movie Gandhi is the example that immediately springs to mind but I'm sure there are others, Star Trek? Bending over and accepting your fate might be a safe bet with positive consequences in a narrative, but is submission a good idea in face of actual tyranny? It's easy to 'condemn both sides' for the use of violence when you're living a relatively safe and peaceful life in a rich and powerful western nation, but aren't people justified to use force to defend themselves against violent aggressions? I think the fetishisation of non-violent means and 'dialogue' is a liberal luxury that can't be afforded by oppressed groups, but that's just my opinion.  Anyway, thanks for the video and best wishes."
"The domina outfit looks good on her, is what I'm taking away from this video."
"I don't think people like violence, I think people like competition. That's why games employ violent gameplay, because it's easy to compete in that scenario.  But you can look at a game like Hearthstone, it's not violent but it still is incredibly popular because it is competitive. People like to role-play in situations in which they would never be in, like racing, adventuring, exploration.  Violence is not something most people enjoy, we enjoy the fulfillment of retribution. But only when it is righteous, most people would feel bad blaming someone who is innocent, or hurting someone who doesn't really deserve it.  it really depends what act deserve violence, personally I think violence is only necessary when my personal health is directly at risk. In other situations discourse is much more fruitful."
"About the videogame thing, I think a component of why violence is even more prevalent in videogames than in movies or literature is because games are better equiped to represent physical action.  Think about it: the act of jumping can be declined in thousands of variations, using dozens of inputs. Fighting can lead to even more variations with weapons speed, weight and other behaviors. Meanwhile, dialogue and feelings are delivered through glorified MCQs and dry menues with gauges.  It's the same reason why action is more prevalent in cinema than it is in literature: while adventure is exciting in written form, action just is at its best place in cinema, because it is inherently cinematic, as in, rooted in movement.  So until videogames manage to create engaging interactions for dialogue and heartfelt storytelling that go beyond: answer A B or C and D is 'sarcastic', violence will remain the chief mean of interaction within virtual worlds."
"Our social order is predicated on violence or implied threats of violence on part of government and capital. Our society is based on separating acceptable violence from unacceptable violence."
"13:50 Is justifying violent warfare a new neo-liberal thing? The 'humanitarian' angle is for sure, but what they're doing doesn't strike me as unique in the history of warfare. The Catholic invasion of the Middle East in 1095 centred around the concept of a 'Just War', and wasn't all that dissimilar to Bush and Blaire's rhetoric in the early 2000s. Revenge and religion were just as much a part of the discussion as was the humanitarian approach. I might be misunderstanding the point though.  Unrelated: you are fabulous."

"As always, thank you for making a video that makes me think about my actions. I'm absolutely guilty of dismissing liberals' concerns about violence, much like most of the Left, I feel. But, in reality, this is not what I want our movement to become--ideally. If it comes to that, I do think we should defend ourselves, but our side feels like it should strive for something less ... vile. This video has helped me realise that."
"Ok, if I just saw what I thought I saw, that is NOT ok. Did you just cut meat with a fucking bread knife?! Please, tell me I'm wrong..."
"Do NOT watch this on marijuana!"
"Social anarchists (e.g. Kropotkin, Malatesta, Goldman) make the same point about statism: opponents of violence by non-state actors seem to have few qualms about supporting wars, invasions, prisons, or police when the people dishing out the violence are wearing uniforms. Indeed, they don't even define it as 'violence'. Apparently it only counts as violence if you haven't got the state on your side.  So it's not that they dislike violence, it's that they dislike violence that's 'un-sanctified' by their preferred source of moral justification.  Personally, I tend to side with the view that violence is always an evil, but sometimes a necessary one. Not only in instances of self-defence when directly attacked, but sometimes to eliminate greater structural violence – like when you have a broken nose, you have to break the nose again in order to fix it, even though that can sound paradoxical on paper."

However, I recognize that these nonviolent movements do not succeed without the threat of violence backing them up. (MLK had Malcom X's campaign, etc.) Also nonviolence may kill you despite you acting in society's boundaries (see MLK again).   I do believe in denying outright fascists a platform whenever necessary, and that includes violence. Fascism is anathema to democracy. Giving them a platform to speak legitimizes their views, which makes them palatable to the average 'rational centrist'. I don't advocate for violence, I prefer negotiation and mediation, but when you start shouting 'Blood and soil', this is where I draw the line."

I'd love to see the unedited footage of all this stuff. Still though, another great video ContraPoints!"

"I think the prevalence of violence in video games is easy to explain. It's not primarily violence that people are drawn to in games, but violence is a possible component of many things we are drawn to.  Before I go on to elaborate, allow me to provide an example to illustrate my point. Take the game Hatred as an example. Despite the controversy which surrounded Hatred before its release, what really relegated the game to the backwaters of history was that it was boring. It had all the violence you could want, but people don't find mindless violence compelling. It wasn't that the violence was offputting because it was pointless, the violence was boring because it was pointless.  So what makes violence interesting? Well, the most obvious answer is when it is the result of a conflict. More specifically, when the player is in conflict with something else, and the violence they are using is in service of their goals.  In order for a game to be fun, you have to have a goal. In order for that goal to be satisfying to reach, there must be something preventing you from reaching it. The most obvious way to do this is to have another entity with different goals who is in your way, and the most obvious way to resolve the conflict between two entities of differing goals is if there is a fight and one wins.  In the world we live in, it is easy to happen across many other living creatures, human or otherwise. Having many enemies oppose you feels natural. We don't naturally run into, say, puzzle-locked doors often, so having too many puzzles in a game can feel strange, if it is not framed properly.  Furthermore, having enemies is a way to divide up a game into smaller sections, which gives the player a way to feel like they are making progress by having 'little victories' on the way to their real goal.  Violence is a very visible way to give the player a sense of control over the world and the environment. Many games act as 'power fantasies' for players, so this sort of control is important.  Basically, what I'm getting at is that having violence solves many, many problems in games. It gives the player many things they want, none of which are necessary the violence itself. There are plenty of games that don't have necessary violence in them, many of which are well received and popular, because they resolve these many questions in different ways.  You are trying to answer questions of game design with psychology. It's interesting, but unless you understand the underlying design choices, your speculation has very little weight behind it. Discussing the appeal and role of violence in video games is valuable, but I don't think you've done a particularly good job of it. No offense."

"There is a disconnect between how we treat sex in movies and how we treat violence. People seem to accept that distancing from the violence is a valid rebuttal to criticism. I’ve killed hundreds of sentient beings in mario and no-one complains, in a way that would not be the same if the game was seen to be acting out sexual violence or sexism, no matter how abstracted it was from reality."

"I think another point worth mentioning, the liberal condemnation of violent revolution is somewhat hypocritical, since liberal ideology often came to power in Europe through rather violent political upheavals.  It's a narrative among certain classical liberals that Liberalism arose peacefully via the marketplace of ideas due to how rational and logical it was.  In truth, liberalism in Europe arose after a pretty grueling period of political instability that involved a lot of people getting beheaded or shot.  The French Revolution and the Revolutions of 1848 are the main examples."

"A good example might be painting some wall in Pakistan with Bin Laden's brains. A lot of people in the US celebrated when they found out, but I don't think even that should be celebrated. Yes, he had to be captured or killed. Yes, it was the right thing to do. But we shouldn't always take pleasure in doing the right thing. You shouldn't take pleasure in putting down a rabid dog. Kill, but kill with a solemnity informed by the knowledge that your act is a necessary evil. Wish for a world where this wasn't necessary, but act in the world where it is."

It's only in a revolution that both the bourgeoisie can be overthrown, and the proletariat can rid itself of our inhuman society. Violence is just necessary in this instance. It's more so a matter of what the form this violence takes and how best to direct it, but these two other questions don't matter right now, considering a revolution is not on the horizon at present."

"I strongly disagree with the sentiment that violence is so popular in video games because of toxic masculinity or to sate some innate aesthetic appetite we have for violence. This might explain the particular way that violence is portrayed in certain games, but when you look at the violence in Mario games, Dark Souls, and Minecraft? Give me a break, those games are not about the aesthetic quality of violence at all, and yet violence is a central mechanic.  Violence is common in video games because it's a very obvious and easy way for designers to achieve what makes a video game enjoyable. All games give the player objectives and obstacles. What makes video games unique is that they can also integrate a good narrative and a power fantasy into those objectives and obstacles. What happens when you try and simultaneously give the player a challenge, a power fantasy, and a story? Violence.  The people you try to kill will fight back, providing challenge; overpowering enemies gives you a power fantasy; and by having actual people to fight, there can be an interesting story (interesting stories very rarely lack characters). There are other ways to give people power fantasies, and ways to have other characters oppose you without using violence against them, but they're far more difficult to pull off effectively than just using a good ol' bit of violence. The primary reason why violence is the easiest way to achieve these three things is that physical activity makes for far more interesting gameplay than anything else. I've already said a lot but I could ramble for hours about why giving the player buttons that physically manipulates their character is always more engaging than anything else, so when these mechanics are central to how you play the game... when it comes to overcoming obstacles, it makes sense to physically fight them.  Combat is and always will be the easiest and most standard type of gameplay in video games, and it's purely to do with the formal qualities of what makes a game enjoyable."
"So. 9th grade. Age somewhere between 13-15, I am bad at math. But my homeroom teacher told me that she thought that I would like 'A Clockwork Orange.' I had never heard of it, but I got a copy and watched it. I didn't know what was worse, that a 30 year old woman told a young teen he might like that movie, or the terrible feeling I got when I couldn't stand to watch any more of it."

"LET'S TALK ABOUT WESTERN VALUES!"
"nice video. I am not sure you addressed something that I'm thinking about though. It seemed like throughout this discussion all forms of violence were judged as morally equivalent, which is helpful for thinking about the nature of violence, but sort of eliminates the middle ground most people tend to occupy here. Punching a nazi is something I'm comfortable with because in the end the fear of such an outright rebuke is effective. I don't see it as sadistic because the effects are more important than any feeling I may get from the act itself. However, torture, outright murder, etc, of someone like that isn't something I could see my own conscience letting me do. I feel like a lot of people fall into this, violence by degrees. It's important to ask 'well does allowing some violence permit more violent acts to be accepted' of course, but it's also important to realize that most people who support political violence on this scale tend to have a limit of harm they'd want to cause.  at the same time, of course, it's also important to recognize that in a full-scale revolutionary situation, there's definitely gonna be real human loss of life, and personal lines as to what is unacceptable can indeed be warped and shifted if you believe the cause is just enough. a morally clean revolution isn't something that usually happens. The risk of that is a good thing to think about, and I'm glad you bring that up here. but like I said earlier, I do think it's important to acknowledge that, in the meantime, people still have personal lines that they won't cross without extraordinary circumstances. I'd punch richard spencer, I would kick him, etc, but I wouldn't want to torture or murder him outright, just because of where my personal lines are, and I think (altho maybe I'm wrong, I dunno) a lot of people feel the same, and I think assuming all forms of violence are on equal moral footing is ignoring a pretty big aspect of how people tend to view violence."

If our way of life wouldn't include violence, it would immediately be replaced by a way of life that does."

Contra I love your videos, but this is not your speciality. Maybe it's just because I study violent conflict and politic for the last 6 years, but this is neither a well focus video nor really sturdy arguments (it goes a bit everywhere). Now maybe I am being too critical for what is a short video essay, but you already did this way better on your episode on Baltymore. You don't really define violence, nor do you take enough time to explain how it's a tool that shape people and society (or at least it should have been your main point and not waisting so much time on the question do we like violence?). Or then just talk about violence in our culture and not should we do a revolution or not?  Also, a clockwork orange is pretty tame in term of violence compared to other movies like Mother, Beast of no Nation, Silence, the revenant, Chindler's list or The Devil's reject (you follow litteral canibal has the main characters)."

"You gonna make us vegans reeee with all this meat"
"Contrapoint you should read Charle's Tilly The politic of Collective Violence (2005). It would give you a better frame of analysis for your video.   Also, having to choose between violent revolution and capitalist society is kind of silly. Many revolution  and regime overthrow happen without a lot of violence. I can think of Chile in 1988, the collapse of the Soviet Union, The destruction of the Berlin wall.   Also, when violent revolution do occur, the one doing it are not sadist, but a set of either professional trained and coordinated by the state or a paramilitary unit. Even guerilla's are largely made up of specialist in the practice of violence, not crazy psychopath (there's exceptions). When violence reach a large scale like a revolution sometime does, it's because it has reach a level of coordination that far exceed the mayhem of a few saddist. Essentially, violent people are just ordinary people who will use it when there's an environment that make it the prime tool of social interaction."
"Thanks for showing the estrogen and shit i fucking forgot to take mine"
"anarchist syndicalism is on the rise."
"Might is right. Be it the tough boot of a fascist pressing down on your skull or the social and economic power wielded by the head of a corporation. You do what is told. In a fascist or communist regime there is no uncertainty what you have to do. Oppression. In the current system you do what is told but in a less clearly defined way. You gain the skills for a job, you try talking to the cute girl or not, you play games to distract yourself from the world and you get money. There is a lot more undefined variables there so freedom, however freedom isn't exactly free since we are still chained to society and our inferior meat bodies. I want the freedom to fuck up myself rather than a top down decision meaning I starve to death. So thats fascism and communism out. I think a peaceful revolution is the smartest way. People who get put into roles where violence is an acceptable outlet tend to cause a lot more trouble than their worth. Political organisation and fighting against the old powers using new tech and new media so we can achieve something better than what we have currently is my way forward. So that one day every single person will have more might so they can be right or more right than they already are to inch closer to freedom."
"MARRIED WITH ME"
"U mean ultra violence"
"i'm going to wade into this morass of self-righteous vegans and delusional communists just to say of course violence is bad. even retaliatory violence is bad, though that type of violence is at times necessary. the real question is what does violence mean, and great artists have been working on that one for millennia.   P.S. i think i disagree with your overall reading of _Kill Bill_. though you're spot on that the giallo episode in the hospital is a nod toward violent cinematic rape-revenge stories, painting the whole movie as glorifying justified violence fails to account for most of the second half. sorry if i'm reading into this too much, i just find Tarantino to be pervasively under-analyzed. somewhat ironic, considering how much time internet neckbeards spend blindly fellating him for his potent quotables."

"Hmmm. Once I saw a guy being murdered and fell silent and paralysed except for nearly throwing up in my mouth. I have a flash bulb memory of him being thrown into a parked car like a ragdoll repeatedly then dragged off into the darkness. I also saw a kid on the floor after just being stabbed 8 times, and I have a flash bulb memory of the two inch gashes that went all the way down into his stomach, the layers of fat and the pooling of the blood that didn't spill over the edges as his stomach heaved and convulsed. It was nothing but distressing and upsetting. I'm also always the guy pulling bar fights apart. I hate real violence. I've never thrown a punch in my entire life.   But goddamn I enjoy watching 'real men' fuck up other 'real men' on tv when I feel powerless and victimized. My lip physically curls and my adrenaline goes up when that slo-mo fist connects with the face, smooshing it all up and blood and teeth go flying. My fantasy, my desire, vicarious. I still don't know what it would take to make me actually loose my shit in real life...  Is that really just a tenuous line of morality that I rationally don't choose to cross?   Also, I was surprised that the video didn't mention 'ooga booga', crocodile brains' and amydalas... Fantastic content nontheless... Thanks Contrapoints...

"‘Female’ Kung Fu Form - with 'symbolism'  Based on Wing Chun, Snake Forms, Tai Chi and Drunken Immortal Female Form (I didn’t event it)  Using typically a twisted horse stance (female stance) movements are akin to a playfull and ‘suggestive’ dance - disguising attacks.  Despite this being a ‘female’ kung fu form (also without kicks and punches and throw downs ect.) it is an ‘internal’ ‘soft’ style that uses very strong stances – utilising core strength combined with strong footwork.   I have no idea how practical the form is? Feels like the kind of moves one would do if defending against being groped or grabbed or pulled basically – with defences including delfections, palm pushes, elbow attacks and mis-directions/avoidance with shuvving etc.    Form Starts in a ‘Wing Chun’ Stance – Knees close togther and feet facing in, if facing forwards… when turning: turn out right foot to face right, turn out left foot to face left.   1) Face left, hold left forearm with palm of hand facing down horizontal in front at mid-torso, with right palm push over left forearm. 2) Face right, (ward off right) - maintain left forearm horizontal in front at mid-torso, move right arm with right palm facing you out to the right with left fingers pointing into right palm – stretch out arms to the right in this posture. 3) Face forward, bring right and left palm together in front of chest in a cross block with hands touching (right inside left). Then swivel right elbow into a side jab to the right – resisting left palm on top of right wrist with head leaning into right arm (as though going to sleep). 4) Face left, maintain position of left arm (but lower left palm facing down and begin rising up across torso to raise left elbow up to the left) and bring right hand up outside left forearm (as though holding a mirror to your face). 5) Face right, sweep up both arms into a double (shoo-ing) palm block at head height to the right. Then turn to face left in a left on-guard stance (left hand out in front of right hand) – hold the finger tips to thumbs on both hands in this stance with the fingers and thumbs facing down as though dangling a thread. 6) Facing forwards, retract both hands and hold them in front (fingers still touching thumbs pointing down), tumble hands so that left hand is palm facing down above right hand palm facing up just below head height as if holding something (curious). 7) Repeat sequence 1 to 3. Then jab left elbow to the left and sweep right hand with palm facing towards along left forearm up in direction of left elbow (as though throwing something out of right hand), follow the right hand with the left palm facing up. Using both hands, catch ‘object’ up to your left that was thrown previously the from right hand, place right hand palm facing down over (object in) left hand and then turn hands in front so that left forearm is horizontal in front at mid-torso with right palm facing up underneath the left palm facing down. 8) Face left, right palm push out to your left, left hand palm facing up at left hip. Twist torso to the right, right hand palm facing up at right hip, sweep left hand with palm facing you in front of face – look at empty palm… wooo… 9) Repeat sequence 1."

"For me, I really think I just get a very sort of primitive satisfaction out of seeing sex offenders and nazis get punished, probably because I see them as a threat, and when they get subdued with violence, the threat becomes smaller. It's relieving because it helps ensure my self-preservation, and biologically speaking, self-preservation is the most basic human goal. It's very primal, and a lot of people don't want to think too deeply about it because when we think about it, it leads to us questioning ourselves, and questioning our justifications for violence against humans we find threatening can be deterring to our self-preservation.   On a completely different note, you looked so pretty in this video! Estrogen really suits you <3"
"Rather than ask if violence is good or bad, it's probably better to ask if it is necessary or unnecessary.  Violence in self-defense is pretty much always necessary (you can opt not to if you feel strongly enough about violence, but few would ever question legitimate defensive use of violence).  So it is pretty much only the initiation of violence that needs to be questioned.  To that end, evolutionarily speaking, if your family or clan or tribe was running out of resources and would literally die without more, and the only way to acquire the resources you need, at least quickly enough to make a difference, is to take it from some other family or clan or tribe, than evolution says initiating such violence is necessary.  Good or bad doesn't enter into it, it is simple survival.  And in evolutionary terms, survival is good, so such 'necessary' violence would, in fact, be good.  If you have an abundance of resources and then still attack others to take theirs, then such violence normally going to be unnecessary.  However, in evolutionary terms, that doesn't make such violence bad, just unnecessary.  For most of history, most violence, both personal and international, comes down to the survival question.  In the past couple of centuries that has been less true for the more powerful countries, but that is a relatively recent development.  All that said, to the extent that initiating violence was a necessary survival tactic, it makes sense that evolution would encourage us to find initiating violence a bit exciting or fun, or at a minimum to find it not abhorrent.  If we found ourselves so appalled at the thought of initiating violence that we could not bring ourselves to do it, then a lot of genetic lines would not have survived.  And since those that did survive were those that were able to bring themselves to initiate violence in order to survive, that trait was selected for, and now we find ourselves still amply capable of initiating violence even when it is no longer a matter of survival."

"When it comes to violence, both committed by humans and the pain inflicted by nature, it is necessary to recognize there is a baseline similar to what Foucault discusses in which historically there has been an excess of cruelty and suffering, which is largely being 'remedied' by sociological norms rather than 'imposed' by them. Steven Pinker's 'The Better Angels of our Nature' is a good book to consult for the historical trends and the increasing abhorrence for violence, while Simon Baron-Cohen's 'The Science of Evil' discusses a fluid model of empathy in which it is a learned aspect of intelligence, and increases as general intelligence does over the years. As to the 'fun' of violence, I'd recommend checking out V.S. Ramachandran's research on illusory body associations (in 'The Tell-Tale Brain'). Humans can typically convince themselves that other people's bodies are extensions of their own, such as through the illusory hand experiment. With high empathy people tend to experience pain when they see others getting hurt. With low empathy and poor theory of mind, seeing a part of 'your body' get injured and NOT experiencing pain can induce a feeling of relief, or even laughter, hence the popularity of slapstick comedy. I'd argue that the fun of violence has these same neurological roots.  Ignoring the rise of sociological norms that seek to rationalize violence is a peril to civil rights movements, who have used them to great advantage in the past (Malcolm Gladwell's 'David & Goliath' discusses this in some detail in its approach to the Martin Luther King Movement). In brief, the first person to instigate violence receives condemnation, while provoking violence - presenting a soft target - is still seen as a sociological norm. People point to Spencer getting punched as evidence that the left doesn't hold humanitarian values, and that decides their democratic sympathy when it comes to votes on policy. People point to the murder of Heather Hayes for the same reason, to show the disrespect for humanitarian values held by Identitarians, with the aim of decreasing the opposition's political pull. In history it has been a soft rule that the group which exercises the most force has the most political power. But under humanitarian rules, the group which exercises the most force has the least political power. This would suggest the best tactic isn't to hit the opposition, it's to be hit by them, publicly, and alienate them by broadcasting their barbarity, leaving society to respond through civilized, democratic means.  There's an important distinction of violences in humanitarianism, which probably present the most rational justification, which while not ideally reflected in the state is nonetheless the aim of 'western values' (an admittedly annoying term): violence is not something which can or should be totally eradicated. If an entire society is non-violent, then a single violent individual can operate with impunity. Violence can be used as a means of preventing further violence. So this distinction arises: a person can be violent towards the violent, or violent toward the non-violent. Grouping these together results in the aforementioned paradox, while using violence as a (LIMITED) response to violence decreases violence over all, just as allowing violence as a response to non-violence increases it over all.  This largely means that the way one gets to enjoy violence is ensuring the other guy hits you first. And I don't really think that's a cheap or trivial rationalization - it's the most effective way to minimize violence over all. Of course within this model, it is necessary to make a distinction between appropriate and excessive force, because excessive force can obviously be minimized by employing further social norms. I don't think people really ever consider their own dispensation of punishment as 'excessive' or as a 'revenge', but rather as 'appropriate' and 'just'. When justice is subjective, it is liable to be inaccurate, just as the subjective observations preceding it are. At the very least for me, that's part of the appeal for revenge stories: the fun of justice, of understanding a seemingly excessive act by considering the actions that led to it, weighing it, and deciding if it be good or evil. As fun as the meat-slashy physicality of violence is, part of the rush is inherent in the fun of making moral choices which are usually denied to us in daily life, where we are made Clockwork Orangutans stripped not only of violence, but of moral choice by the intricate societal systems others have put in place. Which I think was Burgess' point, though probably not Kubrick's.  Finally, to go back to the beginning, I'd be highly wary of encouraging the idea that any economic system is instigating a broad, shallow violence over several generations. I think most (sane) people recognize that there's something inherently unlikeable about capitalism as a system that deals with scarcity. No-one likes scarcity, because it is largely responsible for human suffering. Similarly there are people who cringe at communism and socialism because they are also economic systems which deal with scarcity. ALL economic systems operating in our time have to deal with scarcity, not because anyone intentionally worked it into the artifice, but because the artifice ultimately has to deal with Earth, a planet on which most valuable things - especially human intelligence - are horrifically scarce. EARTH is instigating violence against us through scarcity; the economic norms we put in place to produce and allocate resources aren't, unless they deliberately prevent an individual from allocating or producing the resources they own (or at the bare minimum, own in their physical body). While we can fundamentally disagree on how best to produce and assign resources, and we can express that disagreement through diverse models of government and movements between them, the idea that any one system eradicated will do anything more but leave scarcity without artificial norms to heal it isn't particularly sound. But the subject was successfully changed, so it's all good. ;)"

"Take it down about 20 percent there Tammy."
"The point you make regarding how a rationalization process is required in order for someone with at least a semblance of a moral compass to enjoy real violence is really worth entertaining and, furthermore, seems to be something that's understood on a intuitive level by most ideologues of far-right movements( before anyone mentions, it obviously is something that can also happen with left-wing ideologies, however, it must be punctuated that in these scenarios such justifications come in a different form, which I will not get in to simply to be concise). So, given the scope I'm aiming for here, I'd like to perhaps contribute to the debate by posing a question: how can one set of ideas be so powerful that it sways millions of otherwise harmless individuals into absolute mayhem? I think the answer lies within that very intuitive understanding: scared people will do scary things, i.e, if you want to get people to rally around murdering others, a good way to do so is to paint the targets of your ideology as being dangerous to the point that their very existence is a threat to the very fabric of society itself. Given those considerations, I think the debate in this very comment section can actually be quite elucidative, since we have our favorite edgy anti-sjw making some wild and fear mongering claims about how corporations are far left and contributing to this oh so evil agenda to turn children transgender and workplaces hell on earth for white man. It shows very clearly that the bastion of truth and inheritor of the light of the european tradition that sargon impersonates is merely a facade being used by a deeply scared individual, so, while we are here using him as a case study, I think it may be interesting for us to consider how much of a common occurrence this way of thinking and presenting oneself seems to be in our times and, more importantly, it seems that we also must find a way to convey an idea that Paulo Freire, the famous brazilian educator, once brilliantly ushered: on the sphere of public life, everything is ideological, the true question is whether such ideologies are exclusive or inclusive."

"I mean I feel like the question of is violence “good” or “bad” is dependent on the situation but more so that violence is more a tool than anything else. While violence itself is usually “bad” it can be essential for achieving most long term political aims, wither they be moderate aims that seek to maintain the status quo, or revolutionary aims seeking its abolition. Violence itself isn’t really good but it can be justified. It’s a bit like hammering a nail, where we assume the nail is composed of metal mined by people working in some shitty conditions. While it sucks that the miners suffer to make that nail, the nail is necessary to make things and so what justifies using the nail is what you intend to use it for. If you’re just building yourself nice things with these nails with no regard for the miners that’s shitty, but if you were, say, building a machine that automates the work of mining and makes their lives easier that’s kinda less shitty. So really, the ends justify the means as long as something justifies the ends 👀"

"Violence provides a very primal psychological outlet for life's frustrations, conflicts, anger, etc. Even if the act accomplishes nothing itself, it still allows for a release of emotions. That's why many find it enjoyable, though those with a moral conscious prefer it in simulated form such as media and video games or bashing an inanimate object as opposed to a situation where someone else actually gets hurt (or if someone does get hurt then they prefer it to be 'justified'). This isn't the only outlet that exists: sex, food, drugs, alcohol, exercise, religion, etc all can act as outlets, with some being healthier than others. Personally I can find it somewhat admirable that one of our closest relatives, bonobos, don't have wars like humans or chimpanzees or anywhere near the levels of violence as they take out their frustrations as primates by having a lot of sex instead. It can also be noted that those with the most privilege can be seen to call for 'nonviolence' quite often as they have the least frustrations in life and thus see less reason for violence as an outlet. Which brings us to the crux of the issue; if you wish to minimize violence as an outlet for human frustration then you should first address the situations that lead to human frustration (and in turn political violence or even revolutions) in the first place by tackling issues like poverty, inequality, economic turmoil, labor conditions, political repression, racial injustice and discrimination, bullying, social isolation, mental health etc. It isn't surprising that the societies which do the best at addressing these issues also happen to be the least violent."

"I have discovered a new found respect for you here ContraPoints. You appear to have changed recently. I notice with interest your use of the term Transsexual in reference to yourself, not transgender. I'd be interested to know what prompts you to use a word I understood to be 'offensive' now.  It's the word I use as distinct from the latter mentioned above. Looking rather fab too, I must say. Loved the not to Švankmajer at the beginning. Droogs, as I have long been saying - walk amongst us."
"I used to love SVU, then I stopped enjoying it mostly because it dawned on me that I was supposed to see police violating the rights of the accused as 'justified' because the accused were always literal monsters. It wasn't even a conscious decision to not watch it - I literally just didn't like it anymore. With the increased attention police violence has gotten in the media, I found it impossible to enjoy any police procedural shows without making the connection between them and the public's willingness to justify real-world police violence. These shows always make 'bad cops' into heroes, and I believe it's why so many people literally worship police officers, even if (often especially if) their use of force is disproportionate to the threat level."

"So, in a nutshell *_*Punch Nazi_** _'Next week on Law & Order...'_ is too easy.  Even Anthony Burgess realized that revenge fantasies dehumanize everyone, _including the vengeant._  His novel makes a great argument that violence is always about enforcing someone's idea of the social order."
"The music is fucking great. I also enjoy that Contra is just introducing costumes and viewpoints without names and all that bothersome 'lore', it makes the exchange much lighter and more free-flowing. It feels more real somehow and less artificial without sacrificing the aesthetic strangeness. It feels less constructed."
"music at 6:43?"
"I think you are looking at human nature and human violence through your own lens.   In other words you are assuming people think like you do. Which is interesting since you suggest the primary reason people have for violence is 'fun'.   I think the primary reason is justice. But I guess it all comes down to what kind of violence we're talking about. You use the general word 'violence' in your title but then you almost exclusively talk about extreme bloody violence. Such as chopping up 88 people with a Katana for half an hour straight. Also that is my favorite movie fight scene of all time."
"I like how Contra jokingly pretends not to know how to pronounce the names of French philosophers for fear of sounding too pretentious. Hbomberguy does this too. It’s ok guys, you don’t have to dumb yourself down for YouTube."
"Violence is a method to get what you want whether that be molding a situation or the chase of a feeling. Clockwork orange shows what happens when someone chase the feeling of violence, this is not unlike chasing other feelings like love. The dictator dude prob used violence as a method/talent for power, the repetitive use of that talent caused him to see it as a boon and so he leaned on it more often and more freely.  The difference between those examples and normies is that those two see a future they want that involves violence where as normal people usually don't. In domestic abuse the abuser also sees violence as a boon but they do it only because they get away with it (and mold how and when they use violence around that) and so don't see it as affecting their future, when they feel cornered they look at their pool of talents and often lean harder on violence out of desperation if they don't have other talents (lies/charm/power). People who repeatedly get caught using violence are the same in that they prob don't have other talents but their desire for x is so strong that they use violence anyways even at high risk."

"Loved this video :) I always watch your videos several times. I can't follow your argument the first time bc I have to take in all that is happening on screen. I liked how you used to structure your older videos in chapters, it's just really hard to follow otherwise.   One point that you didn't really touch on but that fascinates me about violence is the kind of dynamic it can generate when several / a group of ppl are involved. How it can spiral out of control and how individuals end up doing horrible things that they otherwise never would have done. I think we also get desensitised to real life violence more quickly than we maybe would like to believe."
"I just now realized that ContraPoints is the Hotline Miami of leftists."
"Most of this video was pretty good but no matter how much you lampshade it by pre-emptively attacking fans who might criticize you the infaticide jokes were still.... weird??? i'm not even rly talking about the killing babies part since I get it's meant to be so over-the-top horrible that it leaves being a real issue and becomes something absurd; but like i'm not really sure what the actual purpose the jokes were meant to serve in the video. It seemed like the point of the infaticide jokes was so you could make fun of your own fans hypothetically criticizing you for it? Like the choice of having a queer furry on twitter write these comments it's just strange. It feels like punching down in way that's out-of-character for you. I'm not sure what that entire portion of the video added to your overall piece. It seemed like very off-topic lashing out at people who were critical of you doing an interview with Jesse. The actual thing you were being criticized for wasn't that big a deal and I don't think most people were that upset with you about it and were willing to forgive whether or not you ultimately agreed with them; but the way you've been responding *to* that criticism has been worse than the original offense (whether or not you see it as one.) I get that you want your videos to appeal to a broader audience than the queer leftists who are more dedicated fans. You want to convince centrists and center-right people to come downs to the left side. but if you're spending so much time lashing out and making fun of the same people they love to torment on websites like Ki#wi#far#ms you're just validating that behavior as OK. Is the purpose of antagonizing your fans to try and push away the 'undesired' fans for a new fanbase which would be less critical? Not every criticism is valid but you still need to be able to take it by at least considering if it's valid or not and whatever your decision is not lashing out at the detractors for making the criticism in the first place. It's fine to tune people out without actively targeting them as an justified target. At this point you're the one dragging the issue back up over and over with the same jokes we get targeting us all the time from the very right-wingers you're usually criticizing. Just because you're on the titty skittles now doesn't make it any less hurtful when you attack other trans people with the same negative stereotypes; you yourself made videos criticizing Blair White for this exact behavior before you transitioned.   Thematically this whole issue ties into the themes of the video; but in a strange way. If we're taking derision/making fun of people as a violence; what you're doing in the video is taking pleasure in attacking people who you are framing as a justified target (partially through things like having the strawman critic be a 'weird' group i.e. furries, who given other info on the profile seems to be a trans furry.) This is the same behavior that people on 4chan/etc. have been doing forever, against the same targets, and taking pleasure in attacking these groups (usually LGBT, usually on the left) was the opening that the stormfront recruiters used to turn them away from South Park Liberalism to Far-Right Extremism. A lot of trans people didn't transition because they were on these boards and trans people were the justified target for laughing at! I'm not calling you 'furphobic' or whatever cuz that's bullshit who cares. I'm just saying you're punching down and it hurts and I think it's to the detriment of the video and what you're trying to do in it.  But of course I'm a faceless youtube commenter with no subscribers so you probably won't even read this. I just want you to think about the road you're going down and maybe consider that letting the Jesse thing blow over rather than bringing up how oversensitive the SJWs are all the time would be a wiser move than acting like a 4channer.  And it sucks too because outside of those moments; which were brought up over and over; the entire rest of the video was really excellent; it's just hard to get into it and enjoying it when every 5 minutes I'm essentially being called a whiney oversensitive snowflake SJW furfag. Even though I've never been that strawman, that's my demographic."

"You make great content. Keep up the good work Contrapoints."
"@ContraPoints, if it makes you feel better, I'm very liberal/left wing and I'm absolutely horrified by attempts to justify violence with the promise of a communist utopia. I have no problem with the notion that the ends justify the means. It's just that the, ends in this case, is the permissibly of violence for a benevolent political cause, and proving a political cause is not benevolent, or that it wouldn't work in practice the way it would in theory, is virtually impossible. If we endorse such logic, how can we condemn violence with the intention of establishing an anarcho-capitalist utopia?"

Also Steven Pinkers 'the better angels of our nature: why violence has declined' is an amazing book on the subject of violence. And I think I hold the opposite view on Spencers punching, I think contra is implying that he should be punched, but it's wrong to enjoy it, that much, I don't think he should have been punched, but I really really enjoyed watching it happen."

"Contra, have you heard of the good word of V E G A N I S M? It's weird that you talk about violence having to be justified etc while eating something whose throath was slit for your pleasure. Consuming animal products means paying for animal abuse and cruelty. Also, it's really bad for your health and the enviroment. You should watch the 5 min video 'Dairy is scary' by Erin Janus (it will make your life better and open your eyes), go vegan and then make a video about it.  Edit: People are pointing out that she used the meat and eggs in the beginning to set the tone, that it was intentional. I can totally see that. While that's artistic, she still paid for animal cruelty. So it's not morally justified. That's why I want y'all to watch the video I mentioned: https://youtu.be/UcN7SGGoCNI"

"I guess I would say that my personal enjoyment of violent media (horror movies, stuff like Kill Bill, etc.) has decreased a lot as I've matured. Incidentally, there's a lost final chapter of the original book a Clockwork Orange where Alex calms down and decides he just wants to have a family and be 'normal.' You can read it online if you want, if you haven't already. When I first played the Sims and realized it was an option to lock everyone in a room and burn them, of course I tried it a couple times like everyone else. But eventually it got boring and I realized it was more fun and challenging to actually play the game. The same goes for games with morality elements like Fable, Skyrim, etc. Being a thieving murdering asshole is only novel for so long before you get sick of hearing the 'Guards! Guards!' looped dialogue. But if you play creatively instead of destructively, there's just more there. It's even less repetitive between games, as in my experience destructive events are pretty similar across different titles but creative experiences tend to tap into the unique offerings and plot of each individual game. I still liked your Sims 2 survival game video because I like you, you were doing funny commentary, you had a compelling selection of characters, and the survival game format allowed for a semblance of plot with some genuine twists and humorous moments. Likewise I can still appreciate a relatively violent movie like Mad Max: Fury Road because it's /good/. It has a lot to offer aside from the violence. But at this point in my life, the old ultra violence just feels like mental garbage sitting in the same place in my psyche as memories of a Shot at Love with Tila Tequila. Overindulgent exploitative violence for its own sake in media is mental junk food, in my opinionnnnnnnnnnnnnn And that's not even addressing whether or not violence in media affects real life violent behavior, which is a whole other can of worms.  That being said, of course it's right to punch the baby puncher? Self defense and defense of others is still a thing, I don't really see why that would be wrong. But yeah, I agree stuff like '#killallTERFs', or '#killallmen' for that matter, is just kind of... unhelpful, even if it's not serious."
"But honestly humans are an instinctively violent species, which has been dying out over centuries as we subconsciously domesticate ourselves for ourselves.

"Being left-wing in most aspects doesn't change your pro-violence stance into a left-wing one. There's no point claiming you're left-wing if you hold the worst of the right-wing stances. Left-wing ideology recognises social determinism, systemic oppression & rehabilitation. Ideology is the enemy, not people. Never marry ideology to the individual, never label any individual, every label is a potential scapegoat, & the definition of said scapegoat will broaden until it includes you. Why are we still talking about punching Nazis? A Nazi was hugged too, but that never spurred on an International debate. Every enemy is a potential ally & can be reformed. If you disagree, at least admit that you are right-wing in that way. 'Left-wing violence' is an oxymoron, it's got to be, left & right are OPPOSITES."
"So basically violence is cool as long its acceptable."
"The problem with 'violence is fun' as an explanation behind why humans are violent (though humans are less violent than many other animals, but that's another matter) is that it doesn't explain much. It simply leads one to ask why humans find it fun to be violent. When people say it's fun to do something, that's not saying much more than that they have the desire to do it, and your question is something like 'why do people have the desire to be violent?', so the statement that it's fun to do it is pretty much not answering the question."

"In a system where you have the potential freedom to move elsewhere, to organize for peaceful political change, or to set up your own semi-autonomous commune; no, revolutionary violence is not justified. Violence should always be a last resort, otherwise it becomes far too easy to slip into enjoying it and targeting it at any sign of opposition.  Unless the oppression of the state is explicitly mandated by those in power, rather than an incidental outcome of flawed policies/attitudes/behaviors, then you are not justified in preemptively lashing out against agents of the state.   Violence against Nazis becomes acceptable at the point where it stops a Nazi takeover of the machinery of the state. We are not at that point yet. Although he has authoritarian/populist/nationalist tendencies, Donald Trump is not a Nazi. The Republican party are not Nazis. The supreme court are not Nazis. The military has not sworn an oath to uphold the glorious thousand year empire of the golden-haired one. The rule of law still holds (more or less.) Concentrate on motivating normal people to vote, to change the system. Not sucker-punching random losers with a tiny following."

"You make a very good case for the violence is fun hypothesis and although I morally object to the idea that it was ok to punch Richard Spencer in the face I admit it was funny. I'm not sure my aversion to extreme violence is entirely due to some kind of social conscience though. It actually upsets and frightens me to see it or here about it. Even Spencer there was a part of me that felt that way about that clip because I have been assaulted in public before and it's terrifying. Also sure you make an example of one person who is ok with violence because he justified it but what about the soldiers from just about every war who developed ptsd from being exposed to violence. That doesn't seem socially induced to me. I feel like as much as enjoyment of violence is natural to humans fear of it is also natural."

"I think there are more options than just keeping the status quo or flipping everything around through revolution. we can try to change the system through reforms or peacefull protest yes it takes a lot longer but I think it's the only reasonable way if we don't want to run the risk of creating worse than we have now"
"You talk about life in a 'liberal capitalist society' but what examples of that are there? All of those supposed capitalist societies today are largely socialist. Even the US.  Socialism is the control / ownership of the means of production by worker / proletariat / community  (preferred collective concept). All western state have a large degree of this and like Richard Spencer, are around 50 percent National Socialist.   There's no such thing as structural violence and you make no argument for it. Violence  (other than legitimate  defense) is the initiation of force (rape, theft murder, assault) and can only be committed by individuals making the choice  to do it. Social structures therefore cannot be violent. 'Structural violence' is one of those bullshit terms used by  those who wish to re-frame their OWN violence as defensive but actual find the person doing it. It's a silly term and that's why people who might use terms like structural anti-violence or structural kindness would probably sound silly to you."
"16:25 is a really powerful scene. Great video. Now I'm going to rewatch A Clockwork Orange and get around to watching The Art Of Killing."
"Seriously great quality."
"Do you have dissociative identity disorder?"
"This video is more about violence in media, or violence as entertainment?"
"I am so desensitize with this world i am starting to believe pedophilia and rape are somehow justified in its existence. Even the bible seems to sanction it."
"The reason people employ violence is to acquire things. Like you point out, sometimes it's to acquire enjoyment although I think it's fair to say that this is very rare and the truth is that most employments of violence are done to acquire other things. The violent drug dealer doesn't seek pleasure, he seeks a method of making sure that he gets his money. The violent warring states engage in violence in order to get various things like land or liberty. The violent husband/wife engage in violence to get (or maintain) subservience or dominance. The violent killer out for revenge is trying to get justice.  Violence is a tool which is used to get things which a person wants and it is done (mostly) at the expense of others. The main goal in those who wish to see an end to violence is to find alternative methods which people can use to sate their desires which don't work to the detriment of others."
"its really easy: we need violence for the revolution, but we shouldnt celebrate it."
"I don't enjoy torturing my Sims, or doing the Dark Brotherhood questline and killing (relatively) innocent people. What's wrong with me?"
"you have quite the gift for the visual! this video is powerful imagery start to finish."
"Ah...this hit home. I am secure enough in most of my opinions - never 100% convinced, but veering towards one direction enough that I can act/express with a level of confidence. But with violence, I simply can't arrive at a conclusion. I'm just going to start copping out and linking people to this video when the topic comes up... :D"
"Also, I would like to get all Feminist Frequency here, and say something less interesting: it is established whom can enjoy violence. I think about Virgine Despents, and Itzigar talking about 'Fuck Me' a movie about girls that kill rapists, and how it was prohibited everywhere when movies that show women get killed and even raped terribly are never taken out of cinemas."
"25 seconds in: I KNEW there was something wrong with Abigail Cockbane"
"even when it's punching nazis or killing pedophiles, something I personally feel is just, even then the thought of wishing violence on others makes me feel uncomfortable and almost evil in a way, while still feeling that it's necessary.  Loved the message, Contra, if the video felt just a tad overproduced and at times, distracted from the dialog(for me)."
"don't put your laundry in the dishwasher, it's a dishwasher."
"I remember a time in my teens when I watched this show on the internet called 'Happy Tree Friends', it's a sort of ultra-violent cartoon that mimics the style, tone and character-design of a kid's cartoon, except it always ends in all the characters dying in creative, utterly horrific and gruesome deaths, to create a kind of absurdist, ironic contrast.  But I remember a particular episode that I didn't react quite the same way to, in which Lumpy (the moose) gets his leg pinned under a tree, and has to slowly amputate the leg. I didn't enjoy that episode, in fact, it made me kind of uncomfortable, because it wasn't fast and hysterical like the other episodes were, it was more drawn-out. You weren't assaulted with this crazy barrage of Tom & Jerry with blood, so it didn't manage to make it fun in the same way for me.  I dunno, just a thought that came to me regarding how, when and why we enjoy violence. Like, I guess it has to go over-the top until it becomes utterly absurd in order for me to detach so I can simply laugh at it. I guess that's what separates me from being a true sadist."
"My 2 cents: we'd probably be in the same boat as those Indonesian gangsters if the roles were reversed. 'Hell yeah I killed 1000 fascists in various, colorful, and inhumane ways'"
"I love the fact that you kept going back to 'Sadomasochism' themes, and maybe it's because I'm proyecting, but I saw it as an opposition of that which is shown on the video. I know the actual message here is not entirley about violence, per se. But I would argue that there are thousands of 'ethically'? or consensual forms of violence, and agression we enjoy. Like bdsm, football, rugby, kick boxing, movies, etc. And I think the world would be, maybe *utopyhere* less ultraviolent if we would stop policing bodies and sexuality, and what people enjoy (in a consensual frame)"
"Please continue to reclaim shock humor for the left, and thanks for the warning at the beginning.  Also, Clockwork Orange made me throw up, and that mass murderer dude? His calm, self-assured charisma is absolutely terrifying. Holy shit, I'm gonna have to take a break and digest that shit."
"Is it still bad if I comment upon your looks if I say you look kinda hot. #nohomo. you go contra"
"I feel like a lot of Contra's videos just have me nodding my head, but this was a nice change of pace. It made me confused and uncomfortable and now I have to think for awhile."
"Fucking neon demon who"
"The opening scene turned me on. 10/10."
"Best. Creator. On. YouTube."
"Contra I'm a huge huge fan of your channel and I think you're one of the best videomakers in this left wing youtube community, but even though I enjoy your newer content a whole lot, and plenty of people on your side seem to enjoy it as well, I feel that maybe this new direction your videos are taking might have problems when it comes to engaging people from the other end of the spectrum. what i loved about your older videos is how extremely accessible and personable they were. the down-to-earth nature of them and the way they got right to the point probably made right-wingers more willing to pay attention to the content. even though i, and other leftists, love watching your new videos, i can't help but feel like maybe these videos are too strange and indirect and uninviting to engage right-wingers, and i think that should really be the goal if we don't wanna just keep preaching to the choir. obscuring your arguments in artsy experimental film stuff probably just makes right wingers less likely to make it to the actual arguments and get anything out of the videos, or even be engaged enough to watch past a few minutes. but maybe I'm overthinking it a tad, I mean your videos on free speech and 'The Left' were pretty stellar. I just think that you should generally aim for more accessibility for the sake of the other side understanding you, rather than obscuring everything to the point where your only fans are leftists who already agree with you. i'd love to know your thoughts.  and i know this video specifically is mOre directed to lefties rather than centrists and right wingers but ya know i'm talking about your vids in a broader sense"
"14:37 'Well, that's an easy one.  It's because my side are the good people and your side are the bad people.  I'm so sorry.'  This but unironically.  Right/far right ideologies almost always focus on oppression and having some sort of other against which violence is morally correct.  Center ideologies aren't much better in that, even if they don't actively encourage violence, they are fine with passively permitting violence against pre-existing underclasses.  Pretty much only leftist ideologies are actually based in compassion for others not like yourself.  So even though the potential for the mis-use of violence is there as with any group, I think that chance is far and away the lowest, and so equating leftist violence with Nazi violence is absolutely a false equivalency.  Not that it's easy to convince center-leaning people of that, but that's an argument for someone else (mostly because I'm not learned enough to make it)."
"Natalie, my love, your videos get more aesthetically pleasing and more in depth with each one. Keep up the great work."
"Great video. Although I feel it rambled a bit too much."
"Why am i not surprised you own a gimp mask 😕."
"New fave ContraPoints video"
"The top rack holds the holders of the top rack."
"Omigod your voice is so different :3"
"In fuckin credible."
"Everyone should watch 'The act of killing', its an excellent documentary."
"Violence is required to sustain capitalist society, and flourishes in it. It's required to stop revolution, and keep people in line. While violence is required to set up a communist society. That society does not require nearly as much violence to sustain itself, and violence isn't nearly as common with in it."
"Zoe Blade is killing it."
"YESSSSSSSSS The Act Of Killing is my favourite documentary <3"
"Wow, Contra, this is my favourite film of all time, could you get any hotter"
"Contra, why is your Twitter not on night mode?"
"Damn, ContraPoints. It's like you're making feature films in your videos now."
"You clearly aren't a vegan."
"Very good, very edgy. The problem is people. They are also the solution.   People won't cotton to your mode of address and your penchant for seemy and noirish artwork. They are about their children and the right environment for them. While simultaneously being kinky little fucks. They are also stupid, bigoted, closed minded, unimaginative, panicy, judgmental and generally crammed with vice and weakness. Of such are revolutions made.  If you get on their wavelength and stay there you will never be accepted, but they might vote for you. And a vote is better than violence.  Violence is a tool of war, war is a tool of policy, policy a tool of interests and interests are subordinate to survival in power.  No violence in a western democracy - it is immoral, illegal and stupid. Any we start our opposite numbers can finish. I have my suspicions that we may be being dragged into violence, to promote a pre-revolutionary mood.  Keep cool. Don't trust the ape."
"Why are you just presuming punching Richard Spencer is acceptable?"
"The only reason why a communist picks up a gun, is out of the hope we will finally be able to put that gun down later."
"Give her a Netflix series, now."
"I suppose that the kind of violence we justify depends on the values each one of us holds as individual. For instance, you mentioned that government is based on the treat of violence, and that the consent of the social contract is not really a that solid when you think about it. For most people this is just a passing thought, but for many anarchists and libertarians this is the whole moral justification of their ideology, and this is what justifies overthrowing the state (or at least trying outside of its rule). I would even argue that even from a libertarian standpoint based on things like the non-aggression principle, it's not really clear what does count as an act of initiation of force, or even to what extent is it reasonable to retaliate when force is initiated against us.  PS. Sorry if this sounds heteronormative AF but, dam Natalie you look really passing lately. You've become quite a lovely lady :)"
"Every video you make is a masterpiece."
"I watch Contra for the cooking segments."
"I’m not the only person who washes their undies in the dishwasher?"
"I like your thoughts on this. Though I'm not going to discuss the ending question, 'cause that would take forever. But there is one point that caught my eye: You ask toward the beginning how can we enjoy simulated violence if we don't enjoy, to some extent, real violence.  I don't know from what point you're arguing from, because I don't know how you personally feel about viewing real-life ultra violence. I don't know if you've viewed anything like that. But I do know a lot of people haven't seen real, violent death. Whenever people think about the fun of 'violence', usually they're coming at it from incredibly vague, unrealistic terms. I don't think people enjoy graphic ultra violence, I think they enjoy the catharsis that can come from violence. This is why we can feel sympathy for a victim, while somehow sadistically enjoy the violence inflicted on the perpetrator.  I say things like, I hope Trump is stabbed to death, or I hope my rapist violently dies, because of the catharsis of vengeance is satisfactory. If you put a knife in my hand and said, 'Go do stab this person you hate so much to death' -- I couldn't do it. I want the satisfaction of feeling righteous justice has been handed down without having to actually hurt anyone, because if you put me to the task of hurting anyone, even if they really, really deserved it, it would be beyond what I'm capable of as a person.  I know this is sort of a general thing for people as well. When we're talking about the general populace of white cishet middle class folks, there's a six degree separation from having viewed anything that say, a Syrian refugee had to witness on a daily basis. Said person has never likely seen a dead body, much less had to watch someone violently die. All they have for the evidence of what said thing could possibly look like is through movies and video games, all that do not depict anything close to what it is like to watch someone die violently, and all with the veneer of fantasy where no one actually got hurt, it's fine.  But if you force said person to watch a marathon of real, violent deaths on LiveLeak or Documenting Reality or, really, any shock site where a popular snuff viral video is hosted and you get a different result. I went through a period of time in my life where I would force myself to watch snuff viral videos, even though it always left me crying and feeling horrible and somewhat traumatized. I've seen 3 guys 1 hammer, I've seen people beheaded, I've seen a guy violently stabbed to death in the neck as he screamed, I've seen ukranian boys beat homeless people to death -- real violence, and none of it is fun. None of it is like what you'd see in a movie or play in a video game. It's horrible and it hurts to watch. The only thing that keeps people watching is curiosity borne from morbidity (some part of you wants to know, even though you don't really, really, really want to know and will regret knowing).  But again, this doesn't go into the deeper question as to why violence wrought by self defense and such is seen as justified (which is something I agree with, to an extent).  All I know is that a lot of people who argue from this point have likely never been violent in their lives or have been witnessed to the ultra-violence a la Clockwork Orange you're describing here.  tl;dr I don't think people find ultra violence fun, I think they find catharsis that is born from violence (especially righteous violence) to be satisfying. There's such a degree of separation between the general public and real, horrible death that we can draw a weird pleasure from the thought of violence without understanding what it is or knowing what it actually looks like."
"I'm loving this super facetious attitude Contra."
"Wow that's a lot of views in an hour.  The cat girl persona is by far the most attractive."
"I'm glad to gave a nod to Curious George Kills the Rapist, my favorite movie"
"I love the Beethoven's 7th on synth at 6:45. Perfect theme for sad twitter tbh."
"I am pacifist but I try not to impose my way of thinking on others. Maybe because I feel safe I can practice this way of thinking but just be it. The weirdest thing is in past few years I have become more conscious about violence in media and stopped enjoying lot of violent media and when I do I am enjoying other aspects of that media. I dont have any other thoughts on this. Just that you are so pretty. I skipped a lot in this video it was disturbing in a lot of sections. Well done I guess. :D"
"Awesome video! Also, I could not stop thinking about how amazing your voice sounds!"
"I love it! I really need to watch A Clockwork Orange. Seems like a sin to be subscribed to this channel and not watch it. It's very tied to the L O R E."
"terfs are allies"
"Violence is a tool and any tool can be misused."
"And YES every one should read Discipline and Punish - even the non-nerds. It's a really interesting read. You can DO IT!!!"
"I'm so glad your videos exist"
"too much glamour that doesnt seem to do anything, seems to have gone meta in some way by using past characters that serves more in the context of real life than the video"
"Hey Contra— Not directly relevant to the video, but, I'm a dude with sandpaper skin and razorburn: Wat do?"
"I think what makes violence fun is feeling powerful. That's how it is for me anyway. (Mostly talking about fictional or simulated violence here ftr.) And that ties into the indirect violence point too because that's definitely about power."
"The Indonesian gangsters did nothing wrong, murder only applies to people."
"INCREDIBLE"
"Great video, Nat! Also you look damn good in a crop top!"
"The electronic Ode an die Freude in the outro was violence to my ears"
"Are you _really_ fine though?"
"Hi, just wanted to let you that I really enjoy your content, bye"
"Hmmmm.... As a lefty, I worry about violence, I oppose it so much that I am a borderline pacifist.  True or effective left movement has to repudiate all violence. Been thinking of a video on why the left should accept the Non-aggression principle.  I guess I have to get to it."
"New ContraPoints video day is best day!"
"It's curious that Kubrick chose the American version of Burgess' _A Clockwork Orange_ over the British which has a last chapter that alters the character arc the protagonist.  I think Kubrick's statement might have been that violence is inherent to the human condition.  Whereas Burgess seemed to be saying that people can change if they choose as Alex does in the Burgess' last chapter."
"I guess that's the real danger of violence. If you break windows out of frustration of the system, eventually, you will break some for fun, no matter how symbolic it was in the first place. If you keep fighting wars, people are going to kill for the hell of it.  If you resist fascism through violent means, no matter how useful it may or may not be, there will be hell to pay if you go too far. But if you don't go far enough, they could be as violent as anyone else could. Just read into the history of fascism as evidence.  Violence is a really a tough subject for me, especially as a far-left person. It is a useful tool, but am I any better than the Nazi for even suggesting it may not be off the table as a means of defense, even it means a greater outcome overall? I mean, even people in my political area have committed atrocious war crimes.  But our system still sucks.  How many more people have to be injured or killed for the world to be a better place? How many more in order to sustain what we have in the next second? How many for it to not be?  I guess the answer lies with all of us.  (EDIT: I’m currently reading Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook by Mark Bray, and makes some great leftist contributions to this argument upon thinking about it.)"

"pretty sad to see a reminder of how we are often treated as puppets or just 'shitty third world countries' that don't know what's good for themselves, when often times the problems were instigated, if not created, by some foreign force intervening. anyway...excellent video as always, greetings from Chile."
"Yay! More glorious ContraPoints.... yes, hmm, yup, ah-ha. ok. Yes! (reluctant agreement)... yup, total agreement. *nods* um, conclusion? <looks behind the monitor> Is the conclusion in the next video? (Or are you deliberately being philosophical so that no rebuttals can be constructed?)"
"Kill all paedophiles. That should be fun."
"Love iiiiit"
"Another video from Contra, another fetish awakening in me."
"Hell ya! Great job on the video! Keep up the amazing work. :)"
"How ironic that you'd begin a video about violence by indulging in the products of horrendous and unnecessary violence against nonhuman bodies (steak, eggs. etc.).  If you want to investigate how humans rationalize unnecessary violence against one another, start by investigating how you rationalize your own unnecessary violence against nonhuman animals.  Because I assure you, the rationalizations aren't all that different from one another:  'This is natural.  This is my right.  They are different, so their lives and suffering do not matter.'"
"The Queen is back !!"
"I just re-watched the 'act of killing'..very interesting."
"Great production value, but I am trying to figure out your line of argumentation; it seemed less clear in this video than your others for whatever reason. It is definitely a struggle to make sense of the topic and all its dimensions. (I know I am!) I did like the ambiguous moral conclusions, however. And the way that you seemed to acknowledge that in all moral decisions there is some sacrifice. I will have to rewatch this to try to really make out your argument and line of reasoning. I love the topic and its an important topic to consider for everyone-- especially leftists when considering the consequences and sacrifices that come with a violent revolution. (Smash store windows, throw bricks at cops, and punch Natzees). It seems to me that many anarch leftists especially buy the ideology of justified violence without ever considering the consequences and implications."
"Aaaaaaaaa stop being so pretty, I'm already in love with you!"
"Great job with this video Contra <3  Your aesthetic and arguments are on point!"

"You are well on your way to being a SUPERSTAR by the way....in France."
"Using Kill Bill as an example of how violence is generally enjoyable seems intellectually lazy when Tarantino's signature style completely transforms violent acts visually into marvels which barely resemble actual violence at all-- colorful, fun exuberant, etc.  You didn't even discus enjoying images of ACTUAL violence or participating in actual violence-- videos of people dying and kids starving and animals stuck in wells; or the NFL, the military, wrestling, sporting games, horse races.  Your video claims to be about enjoying violence but it's not-- it's about enjoying movie violence.  You could easily answer that the reason violence is so common in movies and video games is because it's an easy way to express conflict visually/audibly in a movie, as a stand in for moral, social, etc conflict.  Also saying the only difference between a moral and immoral sadist is 'the reasons backing them up' is tautological-- that's also the only difference between and good and bad person by most accounts.  Your video becomes so much more clever and interesting once you get into the issue of tactical violence.  I think you were trying to seduce us into agreeing with your early point to stave off criticism of your later point until you'd been able to get in some key arguments without us realizing-- very Socrates, indeed.  But I think the whole video would have made more sense if you'd at least started with a honest statement of where your video was going."
"I hear Lindsay and Claudia so far. I dig it."
"So hype!!! Watching this in a few!"

"“If we disobey the law, or are black”"
"This self-referentiality is causing me some serious sensory overload."
"Throwing my random bullshit into the mix: I learned in some uni seminar that dealt with evolution a little bit that the biological reasoning for a lot of violence is so called 'cheater detection' (google it). That we evolved as humans to be social beings who live in a society- and eventually evolution adapted us to want to punish 'cheaters' who make society worse. Like you said in the video, most people are OK with watching a child molester or a thief getting hurt (or sometimes even killed) because they perceive it as just. And I think that stems exactly from the biological mechanism of cheater detection. I would go so far to say that I bet most of the 'accepted' violence in able-minded (is that a term?) people is somehow rooted in this evolutionary trait.  In the end, we can try and figure out 'why' we enjoy or don't enjoy things, but really, we're not in control- our bodies, are hormones, they are the real ones calling the shots to a large degree. I can't help that I enjoy watching Sims getting burned alive, and neither can most people. But now we're getting into the whole nature vs nurture thing... that's a whole topic on its own..."
"I seriously hope that you do not bow to any criticisms which really limit your inquiries - you know what the fuck you are doing....even when you kinda don't or are trying to sort things out.  It is a good thing to show people who to actually deal with ambiguity competently.  I feel smarter rather than less smart after your vids - and that is the fucking point."

(uh, disclaimer: I admit I'm posting this /before/ I watch the vid, but I trust Contra's track record of well-made video essays.  I have some professional stuff to do, and this vid will be my reward when I take a break :D)  PS: Should I watch  'A Clockwork Orange' /before/ I watch this?   o:"
"Violence is a calculation: pleasure calculated against the risk of repercussion.  I wish you'd included the performance piece by Marina Abramovic, in which she stood still for six hours and allowed the audience to do whatever they wanted. They performed increasingly vile acts until an assistant had to step in to prevent her from getting shot. With the piece finished, Marina turned to face her abusers, who ran away to avoid a confrontation.  There's a line of sadism that is inherently cowardly, and grows bolder the more passive you are.  It's no coincidence that three of the world's most famous pacifists were all shot by people who were mentally ill. King, Lennon and Ghandi. Try that shit with Putin, see where it gets you."
"but.. but... human nature!!!"
"I think the answer to whether violence is right or wrong is always going to be a messy confusing gray area where it's very much situational, and far too often violence can even start out justified, but ultimately become unjustified as time goes on. We've seen this happen in plenty of revolutions throughout history.   I honestly don't think there is a clear answer, but what I do know is that anyone who 'wants' there to be political violence is likely dangerous, and not someone to trust."
"Wow fuck me up Nat edit: no mention of violence against animals maybe another video?"
"PLEASE DO MORE VIDS"
"The part where you talked about how trans women aren't creepy men, while wearing the clockwork orange getup was too perfect."

"GODDAMMIT! I have to throw away ALL of my costumes?...."
"This video seems to be posing the question 'should we do revolution', or 'is revolution 'ethical''', but this misses that revolution is not a choice. Violence through riots and their consequent backlashes from the state as society more and more inevitably breaks down is not something we can change by judging which side is justified, that brings morals into the question. We need to look at things scientifically, see what will happen rather than should. All we can really decide on is if we want to make efforts to turn approaching barbarism into Socialism. This is also ignoring the aspect of, whether we decide violence to be justified or not in our goals, that doesn't change what the Fascists will decide about theirs.  Anyway though this is a minor contention, the rest of the video was great as always."
"not 1st :("

"Do you really think that punching Richard Spencer is the only recent far-left violence that people can bring up?  I mean, it's the only example of them beating up an actual fascist that I can think of-- but there is plenty of evidence of Antifa and black block beating up random people who they label as fascists with little to no justification.  These videos have gone viral on YouTube, but I'll help you find them if you're honestly that clueless.  You're selling shirts that celebrate them after all."

I hate video games, movies, tv shows, anything that depicts it, so your hypothesis that the majority of people like violence when its happening to others or when it is deemed ok, is wrong IMO. People who find violence funny are people I don't want to be around.  You look really pretty in this video! ❤"
