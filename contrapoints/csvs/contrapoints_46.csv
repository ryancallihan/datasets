"sj shits aren't the next reformation, nationalism is."
"They aren't considered part of the west because they're generally fucking communists. The USSR was largely Christian and about as white as it gets, but that didn't make them Western. Because of the communism."

"Such glamour. Te zarp√°s en bella."
"Might actually be the best contra-points I've watched. Just really on point, insightful, and aesthetic. Also, I love Proust ((and Richard Rorty)), so I was really touched to see him show up."
"Is it just me or is the golden one SUPER ugly?"
"I think it is a good video overall, but the way you treated Judeo-Christian values in the Western World could have been better. You spoke as though Jews were almost ever included in the Western World. The Western World is often Anti-Semetic and even though the two religions have similarities, they tend to think of each other as very different. And you didn't mention how Eastern Europe, despite almost the whole thing being majority Christian, is normally not considered the Western World. Other than that, I enjoyed the video."
"I played Age of Empires!!!!!"
"'Dude if they don't use modern terminology it's not the West' tranny logic"

"I caught the Lick My Arse Mozart piece."
"Did you seriously just say that the Islamic world is just as entitled to Aristotle? Sis, just because they adopted his works during the Islamic golden age doesn't change the fact that we literally were a westerner himself. All humans are equal, but when you say silly stuff like this it doesn't do the case justice"
"12:00 unsound premise"
"11:30 doesn't understand the meaning of 'amalgamate' or doesn't understand the intellectual view of 'western ideals'"

"If you don't want to live in Saudi Arabia you must be a western supremacist"
"take your 'sthick' and go to an Islamic state and spew your demands there, lets see how long you live.   The west gives you the freedom and you all are using the freedom to destroy the freedoms of all.  Are you all just retarded that you can't see what you are doing?"
"Love it. *bump comment*"
"You are like other girls. Played Age of Empires too. With the sole aim of destroying my worst-liked region in Europe, Bavaria. What it gave me was the realization that they would not fucking die even if I spent my entire life playing AoE."

"The fake ass girl voice this thing puts on is honestly HILARIOUS"
"That mf talking shit on TPAB one of the bests albums ever just really shows how much those 'western civilization defenders' aren't trying to preserve their culture because they love it, but are just trying to dismiss every other culture as lesser or dangerous because they simply hate them."

"an annoying social justice warrior named Martin Luther really made me laugh"
"That's Professor DADDY studied the blade to you"
"No mention of what the Reformation and religious wars were really about.  The Huguenots and other Calvinist Protestants were a bunch of greedy heretics who rebelled against the Catholic Church because they wanted the freedom to enslave brown people (and fellow white people through usury) and that's why they founded the US."

"You forgot to mention that Spengler was a vocal critic of the Third Reich, and that his works were ultimately banned by the Nazis due to his scathing rebuke against German antisemitism and the 'sick parody of Germany' that his home country had become."
"Read Oswald Spengler, John Baggot Glubb, or Arnold Troynbee."
"You actually know a Gymnopedie other than the first, I applaud you 21:50"
"What glitter is on your face?"
"‚ÄúThou art as wise as thou art beautiful.‚Äù"

"Wait are you from bmore?????"
"14:33 Oh my god...THAT HAIR !!!! ü§£"
"You high key got a hot body"
"Interesting that you called the concentration camps exactly what they are nearly a year before Ocasio-Cortez stated it publicly as a representative. Just thought it was cool to have it in record that this isn't a new thought, it's just a fact that they don't like being called out for."
"Magog clearly made a Youtube channel based on a D&D character. So I'm considering making a Youtube channel based around my D&D character. Keep an eye out for Gregor MacIntosh, a Half-Elf Ranger who's specialty is dunking on authoritarians."
"Riley Dennis: Would you date someone who's trans?   Me: I don't really know, I haven't encountered many trans people in my life and I haven't really found any of them attractive so I don't really know if I'm attracted to trans women or not.   (Watches a few videos by Contra Points)   Me: Well, it turns out I can be attracted to trans women. Good to know."
"I was a stupid right-wing teenager during the first so-called ‚ÄùPC culture war‚Äù during the late 80s-90s. I recall the obsession with ‚ÄùWestern Civilization‚Äù where everything conceived by Europeans (and later U.S. Americans) were the epitome of human thought and culture. All other civilizations were barbaric, inferior, and not worth mentioning or remembering.   Things haven't changed much at all."
"You are so smart and funny, Mx. Wynn. I adore your videos!!"
"'islamic scholars respected Aristotle therefore western civilization doesn't exist'  Wow great video"
"'our society is pretty terrible to minorities'  Oh yeah that just be why said minorities are more successful here than any other civilisation in history, have more rights and public supports, gays have an entire month dedicated to them, women outperform men in many areas and they can destroy reputations with mere allegations of racism or sexism.   Yeah, our society sure it terrible to minorities"

"Uwwuuuu, God I'm so in love!!!"
"Like, it's not a point of interest but that opening with the powerful wizard annoys the fuck out of me. What the fuck is he even saying? She's secluded herself, not plotting conquer. Like his interpretation is dizzying in how fucking stupid that is.  I don't even care about Frozen but his word garbage is so stunningly stupid.  Is that a 'serious' person?"
"tbh europeans are inherently evil."
"As a 3rd-4th gen immigrant (USA) Pole the fact there are Polish Americans rallying around White Supremecist shit is like.... didn't your grandma ever tell you how shitty all the other white people treated us like, fifty years ago??? The idea that people with Polish (or Irish, or Scottish, or Italian, or Eastern European in general...) heritage should be banding together with the other Westerners is like, ridiculous. In terms of history, they were literally JUST shitting on us for being the 'other' - it's only been a generation at most - and now we're suddenly pals bc we're all pasty? Like, fuck that. Anyway, the west is a social construct and also this is an excellent video."
"Love me some Satie"
"Jokes in this are so good"
"Honestly one of the most surreal experiences I've had in Bread Tube was during the latter part of the video, when Gymnopedie No. 3 started playing and I immediately recognized it as part of of the soundtrack of my favorite surrealist horror/puzzle game. Then again, some of Contra's characters would be right at home in a Cube Escape installment."

"As a big gay classical singer I always appreciate your choice of music, especially when I realise that it's a kooky cover of something I know, like the synth Beethoven Symph 7 Allegretto at 18:37. Thanks for making content that manages to be simultaneously a) well argued and thought provoking, b) engagingly presented and c) artistically satisfying."
"I will never not think of Thomas Aquinas as one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerer now."

"Also, kudos for invoking AoE. I was into those games since the very first one."
"For a moment, I thought Jordan Peterson was holding a Japanese katana at 4:14. Must mean that Japan gets to be part of Western civilization now."
"Hahaha, I can't help but to love you. The combination of casual but spot-on philosophy, societal critique and intellectual discussion on the one hand, and over the top sexual innuendo, bored intellectualism and self-mockery on the other hand is just golden.   This coming from a man who greatly admires daddy Peterson as well. Hurray for juxtaposition!"
"One thing that always made no sense to me is the notion that Middle Eastern religions like Judaism and Christianity are considered to be 'European' in the same way as Bach or Aristotle."

"How can anybody claim modernity and science as part of their ''culture'' especially since everything that is associated  to ancient Greece comes from Egypt, India and Babylonia? The Indians invented the numerical system, and they had the first university in the world. How can you claim they didn't had ''science'' or that science was not part of their ''culture''? The Egyptians have given everything to Europeans, how can you claim they didn't had ''science''? Utter historical revisionism to claim modernity as part of your country."
"Greek philosophy comes from Ancient Egypt. Almost everything attributed to them originates and is stolen from Egypt, in particular the Egyptian mystery system which is where the so called Greek Philosophers were taught! Also, all the early so called Greek philosophers were actually Phoenicians, not Greek! There is so much historical revisionism it's unbelievable. Read the book ''Stolen Legacy. The Egyptian origins of Western Philosophy''. It's an eye opener."
"I personally put 120 days of sodom as the height of Western morals"

"'LGBT is ruining western culture!1!!!1!' Oh, you haven't heared of ancient Greeks and Romans? You know the two civilizations that created the very philosophies and political systems that formed said western culture? Yea well they fucked everyone and everything. Chances are, your favorite philosopher was a shitposting omnisexual with a weird fear- hatred for women and poor people."
"ok but the wings look like a ribbed condom when u close them around urself grl"
"Such crap. She doesn't know much about the subjects she's talking about. The level is like first-paragraph-of-a-wikipedia-article-shallow. But I guess that's fine. Probably sufficient for the audience of this channel.  It just amazes me how she thinks the west is so uniquely evil.   I mean, just look around. Europe, US and Australia are easely the least racist and transphobic societies on the globe. There's obviously always gonna be a room for improvement, but why so negative and whiny? Like:  'Ey ey, oh oh, ol' whitey's gotta go!'  By the way: I've never seen any real evidence that all support all these hypotheses about 'whitness' coming out of the humanities  ('It must be true because we deconstructed it and examined all  the parts and it's evil'). It just fits oh so well with the radical leftiest narrative. Well, whatevs. Take care.   Peace...     (from Sweden)"

"I disagree with you on many things you've said in your videos but I like watching you because your counterarguments to things being said on the right are not lazy. I don't like staying in my own echo chamber for too long but I've found it difficult to find people on 'the other side' who say more about their point of view than they yell about how evil some conservative white dude is. Well, sometimes you do that, but it doesn't completely take over your show. Anyways, thanks for being on YouTube!"

"which of you cowards is still postponing the much needed lip reading of the beeped food porn part"
"before i watch the video, i'm gonna say.  The idea of a unified western culture is a sham. there has never been a singular unified western culture, save perhaps for the middle era of the roman empire. and even then that was because rome destroyed Hundreds of cultures along the way. from gauls, germans, iberians, britons and more. though many of the listed people fall under the flag of 'celts' really that was a flag invented by rome.  so they can gauk at and mock many varieties of people that were different from them. all to justify murdering them, raping their women, enslaving their children, and destroying their religions/culture.  the concept of western culture is a code word for 'white culture' that's what it means period. and it's fucking bullshit."

"You're nothing but a loser who prays on the downfall of the western world and free market capitalism because of all the inequality it has produced. And you're right to a certain extent, capitalism has created so much excess and abundance that its produced an entire class of nobodies like you who take anger against the healthy and successful. Because of so much opulence and abundance more and more sluggards are claiming a welfare lifestyle, getting fat and gluttonous off the yoke of the working man who pays for these bludgers to sit on their asses and expect a free hand out. Then, out of their own inadequacy and self loathing, they hate the rich because these losers woin't be happy until there are no winners in society. And if there are no winners, then there are no losers, and maybe then you'd feel happy about your lack of lot in life. Knowing there's no judgement against anyone, everyone is perfectly equal, because you're against any standard of measurement that determines merit and success as morally virtuous.   Listen pussy, capitalism and western civilization are not going anywhere. If anything we're spreading, the Americinzation of the globe has mass produced Hollywood and rap music to every continent. The only reason for your existence is to crave revenge against the rich and powerful and happy, people that worked hard to get their pie and were not pathetic low life cocksuckers who were bitter at their own pitfalls. Liberalism is a mental disorder."
"Tbh I disagree with a number of stuff you've said here, but I do appreciate greatly your analysis of what constitutes as 'the West'.  I'm from the Philippines and for the most part these Islands have virtually been Hispanized for 333 years and Americanized for 44 years. I'm pretty right-leaning but the concept of 'the West' doesn't resonate with me if we're talking of a mostly Anglo-Saxon yet nebulous orientation."
"The concept of the West is nebulous, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Surely it's not an invisible entity, but the culture, language, philosophy, art etc are distinctive. If I say the West exists as a nebulous conglomerate then indeed it does exist. You can't force someone not to value something, and you're a tyrant if you do. Marxism taken to an extreme just turns into a different form of authoritarianism. Saying people don't like Marxism because they hate Jews is a straw man. I'm surprised the creator of this video doesn't have the objectivity to at least state that non-antisemitic criticism of Marxism exists. And some of those criticisms can be attributed to benign differences in ideology."

"As a Latin American, I totally understand why Latin America is left out of the West, as conceived by First Worlders, but that leaves us in a slightly uncomfortable position. At least here in Argentina, where supposedly over 80% of the overall genetic input is European, and definitely the ruling classes are of European ancestry, it's hard to know what we are if we're not western... Our language is European, our main religions are European, our school curricula are entirely based on European history, philosophy, literature, scientific discoveries, and so forth. Our history and literature stop being European only as soon as it becomes by and about Europeans born in the Americas. I don't know what ancient indigenous Argentine philosophy is like, I don't share their culture, I don't speak their language. I know about Ancient Greek mythology, about the Roman Empire and the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and even Norse Mythology way more than I do about Incan qhipus or Aztec writing systems, or what their societies were like, or what their traditions were.   We may not be European to most other Europeans (and their colonial offspring) because we mixed more with the natives, but the hegemonic culture is very much still European, and our cultures reflect that. Some parts of Latin America I'm very much willing to admit have significant influence from non-western peoples, like the Andean areas with their Incan influence and Meso-America with the Aztecs and Mayas, and Paraguayans with the Guarani, and the Caribbean with their African influence. But here in Argentina, even our food is bland and spiceless like in Europe, based on meat and potatoes, pasta and wine. I get why we're not considered 'western'. But if we are not the West, what are we?"

"14:14 'Leck mich im Arsch'  English: Lick Me In The Ass  Mozart died in 1791 and his widow,¬†Constanze Mozart, sent the manuscripts of the canons to publishers¬†Breitkopf & H√§rtel¬†in 1799 saying that they would need to be adapted for publication. The publisher changed the title and lyrics of this canon to the more acceptable 'La√üt froh uns sein' ('Let us be glad!'). Of Mozart's original text, only the first words were documented in the catalogue of his works produced by Breitkopf & H√§rtel.[3]  A new text version, which may have been the authentic one, came to light in 1991. Handwritten texts to this and several other similar canons were found added to a printed score of the work in an historical printed edition acquired by¬†Harvard University's Music Library. They had evidently been added to the book by a later hand. However, since in six of the pieces these entries matched texts that had, in the meantime, independently come to light in original manuscripts, it was hypothesised that the remaining three may, too, have been original, including texts for K.¬†231 ('Leck mich im Arsch' itself), and another Mozart work, 'Leck mir den Arsch fein recht sch√∂n sauber' ('Lick my arse nice and clean', K.¬†233; K.¬†382d in the revised numbering).[4]¬†Later research revealed that the latter work was likely composed by¬†Wenzel Trnka."
"Thanks for both calling out the reality that 'the west' is a social construct that changed throughout history but also for concept 6 about the evil west because there are definitely people out there who fetishize (and appropriate!) everything that is non western as some kind of pure garden of Eden and view international politics as if the CIA invented violence...but blacks and first nations and (insert random oppressed non-'western' culture here) don't want to be fetishized, they want to be heard, as humans capable of both good and evil.  Plus, every time someone brings up accusations of someone like Putin or China backing a dictator who gasses people or interfere in american elections, someone says 'but the CIA did worse!'.  It's understandable because our own generation has seen the US invade Iraq in 2003 just because it can but when your own country is manipulated by an old enemy who is clearly just as ruthless well, quitthe self-flogging and defend yourself."
"Great video but one quick addition.   Islam and christianity are strikingy similar in their presentation of moses, though they do not delineate the ten commandments in the same section Quran 007.145 However in a later passage it does express tenants that are almost identitcal to the ten commandments. Quran 6:151-153 The phrasing is slightly different but the basic ideas are all there. In fact the biggest difference is it just has one commandment that states 'ascribe nothing as equal with god' instead of several commandments.  The other big difference is that it states 'do not take a life except by way of justice or law' instead of saying 'thou shalt not kill'. In practice mosques dont post the commandments like churches do here in the 'west' but it actually does express the same 'judeo-christian values' so highly prized by the right wing nutjobs on youtube. Its funny to me how actually the alt-right would love the shit out of moslems if they only were pale in color."
"12:41 wait we're paying her now?"
"I love your videos.  I'd like to point out that even the notion of 'Judeo-Christian' is contradictory, as Judaism and Christianity have very different and often conflicting values, beliefs, and practices.  Further, much of the history of Jewish and Christian coexistence has involved the oppression of one by the other-- not exactly the cozy 'We're just the same except you eat Chinese food on Christmas,' relationship that conflating the two implies, and is meant to imply.  The idea of 'Judeo-Christian' values gained traction in postwar US political discourse, and it has no precise usage-- from the standpoint of religious scholarship, it is next to useless.  Does it mean monotheistic? Then you're excluding Islam and other religions.  Abrahamic? Again, excluding Islam.  Most frequently, it is a coded word that means 'Christian, except with plausible deniability.'  You are wonderful and it is so, so glorious to see deep critical thinking combined with humor and warmth."

"What distinguishes the West from all other cultures is its mastery of science and technology. Of course, success has many fathers:  China contributed gunpowder, paper, the magnetic compass, the stirrup, the rigid horse collar, the wheelbarrow, the moldboard plough, pasta, etc. India contributed the placeholder number system and the concept of zero (via the Islamic culture). Greece contributed Natural Law (via Tommy Aquinas), which eventually morphed into the scientific method. Ze Jews (via the Christians) contributed the concept of the intrinsic worth of all humans - at least as an ideal. The West itself contributed optics, calculus, the printing press, etc. Combine all the above with a continent that was politically divided (encouraging competition) yet culturally unified (encouraging the dissemination of ideas), and you reach critical mass..."

"The 10 commandments or any ethical rule do not have to say anything about rape and slavery because it is implied in 'Thou shall not steal', since those two types of actions are violations of the victim's property of his own person aka Self-ownership, so slavery and rape are severe forms of theft.    Also the commandments are not incomplete, they're actually too overarching, only one or two commandments - 'thou shall not kill' and 'thall shall not steal'  - are enough to formulate a complete, consistent  and universal ethical-legal theory."

"Judeo-Christian values are not responsible for today's western values. The enlightenment is, a cultural shift that pretty much the west alone has gone through. At least to that scale.   When you bring up how there was no real notion of the west during the ancient Greeks that argument is kind of weird.  Herodotus was absolutely aware of a concept of West vs the East. Before Alexander conquered Persia there was a constant and clear divide between the western Greeks and the eastern Persians.  The Hellenic west from all around the Mediterranean sea shared common cultural traits and religious beliefs that they did not share with the people on the far east of the Aegean."

"Christianity was major force as soon as the roman empire converted and was sustained by the existence of the Byzantine Empire (eastern roman empire continuation) against Islam from after the collapse of Rome. Well before the 'late middle ages'.  Just because the terminology of 'the west' as a category wasn't around yet, doesn't means its foundation wasn't already laid. If you think its intelligent to intentionally separate phrases from their contextual creation, your as fucked in the head as you look. Funny that you also equate Ben Shapiro and Jordan Petersen as 'defenders of the west' but ones an outspoken JEW and the other repeatedly denounces white nationalism and collectivism. You don't even know the movement your trying to defeat.   Judaeo-christian values are not derived only from the ten commandments either, the morality of the western civilizations was drawn from the collective books of the entire bible and the theology that surrounds it; As well as building on the philosophers of the ancients. 'the catholic church eventually enforced one man one woman...' wrong again to quote Jesus directly (he was alive before the catholic church in case you retards didn't know)  'For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.' and also 'Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh. on a woman to lust after her hath committed. adultery with her already in his heart.'  So not only was poly bullshit not a thing, but even looking and lusting at women (for eg porn) was forbidden. 'i grew up to be a woman' This is the best part. You will never be a woman.Only a the shell of a man playing pretend. You will never actually live the life you want. You will forever be a pale shadow of what true feminine beauty is. You will live your life forever longing for something you can never be. Go back to what your good at which is taking dicks and leave yourself out of history, just like you will be left out of passing on your pathetic genetics. It wont belong before your eventual suicide anyway, which is what you and your kind majorly end up doing when they realize what they are. https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-study-reveals-shocking-rates-of-attempted-suicide-among-trans-adolescen"

"In-Finland, there was heavy discrimination from the Swedish and Christians for our values and how we mourned for our dead and remembered them, anong other of our values. Including lowering the rights of woman, since back then women were valuable and did lot of the same tasks like hunting, etc. Which the remnants of that, our neighbors of the North being Sami, had Christianity coming later to them, which caused the values of Christian marriage and alot of abuse to their women, which caused them to write many books about it. This is also appearent to being first to let women vote and lot of the individual values still prevelant today, even the pagan religion mixing with Christianity. Even then, we faced discrimination in America, being drunks, being clannish, having hard language, using sauna, which was seen barbarish, and that we weren't Europeans at all, from our genetic make-up and our language."
"Not to even mention that 'Judeo-Christian values' are not a real thing. The values espoused by people who use the term 'Judeo-Christian' and the values of Judaism are often vastly different and often fundamentally at odds with each other. On top of that, the whole idea of 'protecting Judeo-Christian values' is at its core a dog-whistle created by Christians not to include Jews, but to *exclude Muslims.*    It's a fabricated idea often pushed by the religious right in the context of xenophobic rhetoric against the equally fabricated 'threat' of Muslim immigrants. And time and time again we have seen Christian pundits use the term 'Judeo-Christian values' then turn right around dive into antisemitism. To quote an article I'll link below, _'The phrase tacitly excludes Jews by subsuming Judaism into Christianity, and it explicitly excludes Muslims in its use in anti-immigration rhetoric. In reality, ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian values‚Äù actually point to a particular type of right-wing Christian values.'_"

"When I was young I always heard 'Western Culture' and 'Western Civilization' and thought it had to do with geography and didn't put much thought into it. Then, taking art history in college it all got pretty clear that 'Western' and 'Non Western' art were all sharply divided between white and non white. But they did still seem to present it all as though it were this clear, linear progression from one thing to the next and everything else occurred totally separate. No discussion of Indigenous influence on early American art and politics, or the intermingling of Muslim artistic styles and academic concepts in Europe. Even Indigenous peoples of Europe were barely discussed lest it interfere with the teaching of those styles and traditions considered classical. Great work with this video and giving insight into how inaccurate most people's thinking about the west actually is."

"About why South America isn't considered part of the west... I don't think it's skin colour. I think it has to do with industrialization and economy. It follows the concept of north-south divide. During the cold war when 'the west' became a popular phrase and concept, south America's economy and overall development was way behind, hence why it wouldn't be included despite the language and religion. At that time 'the west' was north America and western Europe, and these countries were industrialized and the most developed in the world (apart from Korea and Japan which couldnt be the west because of their Asian culture) so that was understood as a requirement to be part of the west, beyond the culture.   As to the refugee crisis, of course there are racist people who just don't want 'brown' immigrants. But the reality is that a lot of these 'refugees' are economic immigrants with regressive religious beliefs. I'm all for middle easterners and Africans migrating to Europe if they fit a progressive society. Let's take all the LGBT people, the agnostics, the atheists, the reformists... But that's not what's going on. Not wanting these current waves of immigrants does not mean it's racism. It would be like saying that because TERFs are transphobes then all feminists are transphobes. No. Some people opposing mass immigration from Islamic countries are bigots. But far from all."

"Not all revolutions in thought are good. Look at the Christian 'reformation' of the Roman Empire that didn't go so well when it turned everyone into slaves of their feudal lord and kicked off a 1000 years of internecine warfare. Also look at the ideological revolution that transformed Russia from a typical monarchy to a nightmare where millions of people were systematically tortured and murdered. I don't think western culture is just the sum of everything that happened and that any change is as good as any other. There are some central themes that carried forward from Greece and Rome. The idea of a community of equals. The idea that the individual has protection from the state. The idea that reason (rather than revelation) is the method by which we determine the good. Its true that you can trace these forward to British Common Law but its difficult to have a thing like British Common Law without these ancient principles. I'm not even sure if they are are even unique to the west but they do act as first principles for modern democratic states. The very thing that allows us to have this conversation without fear of imprisonment. I am also perplexed by the term 'Judeo-Christian values'. As far as I can tell these 'values' amount to only one thing, that people have intrinsic value. This concept is perhaps emphasised in these religions but was certainly around in various philosophical schools that equate the soul with a divine spark. Few proponents of the 'Judeo-Christian values' idea would posit the 10 commandments as a list of those 'values'. You are constructing a bit of a straw man there I think. Worrying about the decline of one's culture is not unique to any culture. Its a pass time for old people who are always worried that the young are going to mess things up. Shakespeare is probably the wrong figure to bring up if your goal is to prove that there is no line of succession in western thought. He basically recreates the Greek/Roman theatre in English and plagiarises Seneca with abandon. Your argument seems to be that all cultures are the same and that they all share the same founding ideas. That there is nothing unique about western culture and that the reason we have free market, civil rights etc. has nothing to do with guiding principles but are just a random occurrence. Its confusing then why they don't spring up in other cultures. Only cultures that have been subjected to a prolonged period of European Colonialism seem to have ended up with this setup."

"Personally, I view the West as a heterogeneous and impossible to draw borders on, but nonetheless 'real'. I don't buy into the post-modernist claim that just because stuff is complex and there are exceptions, all notions of supranational cultural identities (and hell, all categories) are essentially 'made-up' and constructed by politicians (and oh, they'll claim that no, I just don't understand they epistemology, but I do, it's just that it acts as a smokescreen to deny the existence of whatever is deemed politically inconvenient). There are a whole host of international issues and cultural norms which, if you say, 'the West does/supports X' that answer *mostly* describes reality. Whether or not individual 'Westerners' buy into it, China does, India does, Russia (in the form of it's perennial dithering over whether or not to be 'Western') does. Identities always appear more diverse from within than from the outside."

Thanks for the intellectual content. Thinking outside the box is definitely valid from the Sociological view. I would argue that the West's acceptance of outliers led to 'our' survival, see Alan Turing, etc. (I think he was pivotal in beating the Nazis and then was tortured to death for being gay, but maybe I am bitter.) Anyway, I have gotten some value from Peterson and you as well. Good luck to you and I hope that people hear what you are saying intellectually and historically. I really like your mindset even though the gender/sexual stuff is a little off-topic for me, but who gives a shit. You address issues really well with some scope. Thanks!"

Math numbers - Arabian. The best thing Romans came up with was huge numbers that had an end9ng. Monotheistic believe?  Egyptian - Aknenaten.  Don't get me wrong, I dislike Islam just as any other religion, and I do think it's a lot more dogmatic than Christianity, but you cannot deny the achievement of the East just because you have more money in current times. - not an Arabian or a Muslim, just sharing what I think.  The West is just another buzz word for tribal identity and thinking - the very thing SJW's are blamed for. The west and the east and the North and the south -  are inseparable - we have all influenced each other."

Every single time an atheist talks about the 10 commandments as if they're just repeating the same shit over and over again. 2) the 'graven images' part is actually elaborated in mosaic law, almost immediately after the twn commandments and clarifies that it means the act of worship should not be made into an expensive spectacle to show off your own wealth and status. 3) taking God's name in vain: 'god hates fags'. I'm under the impression that this is pretty damn obvious to anyone with a brain. 4) everybody is entitled to take the seventh day off, and you cannot take that away from anyone. What this has to do with Yahweh's egois beyond me. But who cares what i think."

"[dislike] here's my take, feel free to critique my points.   'West wasn't defined during ancient times' western values and philosophy originated in Greece, then spread to the rest of Europe.   'West and Christianity' Judeo-Christian values are a pretty important PART (aka, not the entire thing) of western history, however like the loom (and depending who you ask) they are both more or less obsolete in today's society, however without these two, society would be completely different, to a detrimental degree, as both have pros and cons.   'The west became a concept with imperialism'  this makes sense, as during this period human movement was at its then current apex, there was more of the world to compare Europe and the Americas to other places and cultures that were created independantly.   'West = bad'  The west has been used for both negative excuses as well as positive reasons/ guidance, it was and is the most efficient highly developed system that has yet been seen, there's at least some merit to be gleamed, despite the bad things that it has also done.   'against the communist east' it is true to say that the west during the cold war period was freer than the 2nd world, it was the lesser of two evils.   'Latin America is not the west' yes...yes it is, the only difference is that it's a bureaucratic nightmare.    'The holocaust' don't compare the current events to the goddamn holocaust, its disrespectful to the 11 million that it killed to compare it to something so trivial in comparison."

"Its funny when you realize that Uruguay, a country that has zero native americans, and with almost all the people being white, with the majority either being of Spanish, Italian or Portuguese descent, with the exception of some immigrants from other countries like its neighors, with its 'judeo-Christian Values', having a Latin derived language, having an IDH similar to many European countries and having one of the most democratic and progressive goverments in world history, does not appear on that map presented at 7:11 as being part of the West, while at same time presenting French Guiana and South Africa as part of it... This is for me, the main reason why the Concept of the West is just pure bullshit.  It is most used for white supramicists to feel better about themselves, for the lack of personal accomplishments they had, which they deal by just taking the works of others, works that many times they barely know of btw, so that they can feed their disgusting entitled egos."

"I know that this is the least important part of the video but I just wanted to say that the phrase 'Deutschland √ºber alles' (Germany above all else in the world) was deliberately misinterpreted by nazis. I get that it sounds really bad, but at the time the song was written Germany didn't exist, it was spilt into many smaller states that were prohibited from unifying by the elites. the song was written during the nationalist movement advocating for unity and freedom. considering the historical context, 'Germany' doesn't refer to a country (because it didn't exist at the time) but to a set of values, such as solidarity, equality and unity. once germany was unified, the song lost its meaning and it became easy for fascists to appropriate the lyrics.  I know it literally doesn't matter but it just bugs me when that poem is used to proof that 19th century nationalism = 21rst century nationalism lmao"

"I would add that though this video is excellent and makes lots of well thought out points, Polygamy is forbidden by Jesus, as well as divorce for that matter, he clearly preaches in Matthew 19 and Mark 10 that: ‚Äú[God] made them male and female‚Äù and said ‚Äúfor this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh, so then they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man divide.‚Äù   And:   ‚ÄúThey said to him ‚ÄòWhy then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to put her away?‚Äô. And He said: ‚ÄúMoses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning this was not so. And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.‚Äù   And some say that Jesus never says anything about gay people, but I would argue that the following from the same chapter states that LGBT people, here coded with the word ‚Äúeunuch‚Äù, are equal and should be accepted into society:  ‚ÄúAll cannot accept this saying, but only to those to whom it has been given: for there were eunuchs who we‚Äôre born thus out of their mother‚Äôs wombs, and eunuchs who we‚Äôre made eunuchs by man, and eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it‚Äù   Again, dont disagree with the overall point of the video, just wanted to mention that Jesus mentioned that. Not that I agree with it fully anyway.   Also, homosexuality is mentioned by Paul in the latter half of the New Testament, but he was kind of a hard on so who cares what he has to say anyway"

"So after watching your video and the golden one came up with some pretty relevant points   1. Alpha's do exist in certain packs or  groups Gorillas  and , chimpanzees which are closer to humans in behavior.   They  do demonstrate  Alpha male and ,beta male behavior. Which is prevalent in our current western society.   1 a. Most  women are attracted to jerks and assholes ( it's pure bullshit if they haven't  had  at  least one in their midst) repeat jail birds or jock straps.  2. Toxic masculinity isn't a real term it's a self created term used to appoint and demonize men for being men.   2. a Feminist movements no longer represent a positive aspect of promoting decent female behavior and, equality and, has turning  women to anger and spitefulness , promiscuous ambiguity.  3. Schools and colleges are now teaching that there is no gender classification which is leading to a confused males and females  in  who they are biologically which is leading to the degeneration of our society."

"I'm non white but I still think 'the West' is a useful term, if you define it as countries with a majority population of european descent with a liberal democracy.  Your argument would apply to practically any label designating a large group of people. Any large enough group is not entirely homogenous, and labels are useful to designate what you want to describe or not describe (therefore exclude). A good example is the alt-right.  If you're arguing against labels in general that's fine but will find it impossible to make intelligible videos without using labels.  That said I enjoy your videos and find them thought provoking and entertaining!"

The west has gone through many changes yes but it exists as a sum of it's people and the nations they built. The new movement is of large scale Immigration of people who are not from the west and have value systems, religions and cultures that would stifle progress, undo social cohesion and bring crime. China is for the Chinese,  Japan is for the Japanese,  Africa is for Africans and India is for Indians. Who is England for? Who is Ireland for? repeat for all western nations. When England becomes a massive melting pot of different and disparate cultures and the native whites are in a minority would it really be English anymore. The place is the same but the people make the place in my opinion.   If I go to japan I want to experience the difference there and soak in an alien culture. I do not want to stay in a multicultural area with less than 50 percent native Japanese because that isn't Japan anymore. Why is nationalism a bad thing.   The Nationalism Definition I use   The strong belief that the interests of a particular nation-state are of primary importance to its people. Also, the belief that a people who share a common language, history, and culture should constitute an independent nation, free of foreign domination.   I just want the same rights that other nations outside the west get. I am happy to help the people of the world but why not in their own nations. I would take in any genuine asylum seeker over skilled labour. Importing all the best doctors from the third world isn't helping the countries they leave. It is cheap for us as the bill for training all those doctors will be paid in the nations they left. Doesn't seem fair to me. This could be more damaging than any resources we bought or stole in the relatively small colonial period.   I am trans too but about 2000 books and two decades older than you. I was a socialist till about 20 years old. I have read no convincing argument that humans can thrive in that system but obviously our global elitist capitalist system is no way perfect. You do know it is those same capitalists who are happy to destroy the idea of a nation as I posit. Why? Profits same as always.   In the UK a lot of corporate and private wealth is tied up in property and the more demand the higher the price. Keeping the population growing helps to keep those prices up. If for example we started to have population decline and we shrunk by 10 percent this would change the housing market and prices would plummet. We do need to maintain our population or have it decline very slowly for this reason. The way we do this is with babies from those who have an investment emotionally, history in this country and have a proven track record of success. Not with strangers from abroad who tend to claim more benefits and have more children. Things will not end well."

"14:13 come and lick me Amadeus"
"The video is pretty interesting.  Really enjoyed watching it.  However, I think I might want to add something.  To start with, the construct of a Western civilization, or better said, Western identity is a modern construct dating back to the late 17th century and early 18th century once the Industrialization came about.   It is of importance to note that, at the time, the newly founded Western identity was restricted to the geographical space of Europe.   Back then, the Western identity construct was imagined through mainly the models of industrial advancement and commerce and trade. Also back then, the Western identity was shaped by the prime worldwide advancement of plurality of thought and political views (which, as rightfully the video points out, started with the Age of Enlightenment); albeit restricted to the landowners, clerics, and high society.   Although the ideas regarding a welfare state took roots in the modern era, the post-modern era was the time where such ideas were made into reality. Once again, the prime examples of welfare state are geographically restricted to Western and Northern Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.   My sensation (here I am referring to the 2nd point in the video) tho I might be wrong, is that, in the making of the video, Natalie comes from a place deeply seeded into the American realm (USA) where one shouldn't look for answers to the questions of Western identity since USA is, in many aspects, behind Europe. Although USA is the prime global geopolitical and strategic player, when comes about advancement of welfare state and the relationship in between the State and Citizenry (including sexual minorities, gender minorities, ethnic minorities etc.), much work has to be done.   Back to the video, here I'm referring to the 1st point in the video, the framing of the Western identity through the Judeo - Christian values is, in reality, restricted to the far-right ideology and some elements of the conservative ideology. Needless to say that the Western societal framing of nowadays faces a constant monopoly of power by right ideology, centrists and leftists.   The examples in the video (Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and far-right commentators) are opportunistic in legitimizing a point about the dominance of such voices in the Western societal framing when, in reality, such voices constitute a minority.   Moreover, the religious institutions themselves (here I refer to the Catholic Church, Protestant Church, Ortodox Church and Jewish conglomerate ; since I know them better) have become or are transiting towards social institutions. Indeed, they keep, to some degree, a normative role towards the attendees, but in no shape or form are as powerful as previously known. (Thus, the post-modern era brought about a noticeable decline in their authoritative and functional roles as once known).   With regards to the 3rd point in the video, I must note that there are 2 distinctive sides of the cultural coin in that one must realize whether one is referring to the locality of a culture or the globality of a culture.   To the extent in which the locality of a culture is discussed, I have to agree that Western Culture (prior to 80s and 90s) was just that: Western Culture which, in the modern era was accessible to the same ones who had a monopoly over resources, authority and thought itself (landowners, clerics and high society). However, once the print, and later the radio and television, came about, culture became more and more available to ordinary folks.   Then, the 80s happened, when European and American cultural artifacts were transcending barriers beyond the Western societal framing, although in secrecy. To me, this transcending of barriers into the non-Western world played a pivotal role into the crumbling down of Soviet Union; a farther democratization of societies such India, South Africa, Nigeria to name a few.   Thus, since the very beginning of the 90s, the Western culture became global (the globality of culture).   All in all, it is the Western identity as explained above, that led to a sort of ideation on the part of the non-Western societies.   With regards to the 4th point in the video, I do agree with the most of information. However, looking at the Western civilization as opposed to the rest of other civilizations is a far-fetched comparison since the International Organizations (especially UN bodies ) have pledge their efforts into a more and more inclusive world in all aspects (trade, commerce, culture, heritage, justice etc).   Moreover, to pity the Western civilization against Others in a 'US vs. Them' (especially, as shown in the video, Whites VS. Non-whites) is a slap in the face for all the Western Nations efforts to accommodate, integrate and assimilate not only the ethnic minorities in their own territory but also refugees and socio-economic migrants.   I do feel that is of significance to state that, in discussing the Western civilization, Natalie is committed to a fallacy after fallacy given that her views are very much entangled in the USA of yesterday and USA of today.  In short, to reduce the Western civilization to the American experience is an unacceptable fallacy if we are to talk about the so-called 'contradictions' of the Western identity.   Do not get me wrong. There are plenty of contradictions with regards to the Western identity and I really wished Natalie would have focused on those kind of contradictions instead.   The same argument goes for the 5th and 6th points.   Now, I can honestly confess that what I have learnt about the Western identity in the last 10 years is the promise of the Western civilization. A Western civilization which has evolved over the time and has gotten us, the Westerners into the best place on Earth.   The promise of the Western civilization. The promise of freedom; the promise of equality; the promise of socio-economic justice; the promise of rights for all regardless of sex, gender, ethnicity, belief or creed; the promise of acceptance, inclusion and assimilation of the Other; the promise of safety and security; the promise of a prosperous tomorrow and so on.   What Natalie failed to mention or even acknowledge is the we, the Western civilization have not only been engaged in delivering such promises to our own people, but ever since the WW2, we've been struggling (sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully) to deliver such promises to the Others.   To be clear, the West is not the perfect societal framing, but nonetheless is, in my opinion, the best we got."

"Christianity and Americanity as well as Western Civilization all are Manichaeism  Manichaeism was a major religious movement that was founded by the Iranian prophet  Mani in the Sasanian Empire.Manichaeism taught an elaborate dualistic cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness"
"I have to say I have been thoroughly enjoying your videos. While i consider myself a centrist liberal with left leanings, i try to keep an open mind about my views and thoughts on today's political world (which i do say can be hard sometimes, but I am only human). I certainly find that its hard really to accept a proper definition of the 'west' as there has been so many differing items that have shifted and influenced us, and many of them horrific and terrible as much as defining and hopeful. I do think that we in the first world today are probably at the best in terms of things we have ever been, but there is still things we have to change and adapt to truly push forward a culture and society that we can call free, to regard both differences and similarities between us all and realise we are on this boat together and to help one and other to achieve all our potentials and  happiness."

I mean my intellectual curiosity was all set in motion by Noam Chomsky then I got obsessed with religion and atheism with Christopher Hitchens...  I don't want to ramble too much because I believe the most meaningful things can be put simply.  You people here do not share my values. I don't like that you all act hypersexual. (I have been molested so maybe i'm biased or psychologically damaged in some way) I don't like that promiscuity is becoming normalized in our culture. Yes I do think it's your fault and you need to knock it off. I don't like the rhetoric that you use when calling out people, like you're a white male, i'm a trans, you're a male, i'm a black woman - I might be projecting but it seems like you put negative connotations on white men.. you treat us like trash and then expect us to bend over and take it? We've all got fucking problems and don't need to be reminded of the sins of our fathers. How do you think it feels? Does it make you feel better about yourself? And to the other white people who do it, does it make you feel better about yourself to live in the contradiction of believing that you are so loving and accepting and then to turn around and insult your genetic relatives? To ridicule them CONSTANTLY? It's awful, it's just... fucking monkeys man.   See Jordan Peterson doesn't do that... he attacks a state of mind which... as a person who has had their mind changed from radical anarchism (Noam Chomsky but now I want to punch people) to Ben fucking Shapiro... I completely understand what he means by postmodern neo-marxism, maybe i'm biased because I've seen almost his complete works... read all his books... (maps of meaning on audiobook)... read his reading list (The gulag archipelago on audiobook), and (beyond good and evil is too fucking hard for a pleb like me)... Wasted all of my free time trying to understand what he really means instead of watching Buzzfeed - I just... I don't want to change your mind, I'm just a poor white trash can sitting on a suburban lawn that stretches as far as I can see... I believe in god, mailboxes and capitalism, because if I didn't... I couldn't be.  'It's a thin line between a thick line and no line at all' - Michael Larsen  great I ended up rambling, either way you're wrong but at least I can say I tried to have my mind changed.

"sure the concept of the 'west' is an origin myth. but just because herodotus did not make a distinction between east and west, does not mean the west as an 'origin myth' does not predate him.   it does in fact. I propose that judeochristian tradition is completely independent of the West and actually is an eastern philosophy.   when defining things it is important that we define them not just for what they are but within the parameters of what they are not: the west is not the east.   So where is the line between east and west? it begins with the founding literature of our civilization... that is NOT the Bible.  It is HOMER!   Yes, the Trojan war was the first clear struggle documented of East vs west. the west, long haired Acheans, the Argives. versus the east, sons of Priam and their allies, the horse lords. And although troy was within the civilizational sphere of Greece it was clearly Eastern. for example the many wives of Priam (and hence his many sons) point to an eastern style haram which is also associated with Persia,  the Sassinads, ottomons, and modern Muslims.  there are no such examples of polygamy in the ranks of the Acheans. That's in part why the Bible is clearly an eastern tradition. but that's not the only reason, just a clear one."

"The term ‚ÄúJudeochristian‚Äù is one of my least favorite words. It was always Christendom, Jewish were never included until they decided after murdering most of us to actually include us Jews in the West, something we had never been given before and which is getting shakier now. Including judeo in judeochristian values is deeply inaccurate because it implies both that Jews have historically been included in ‚Äúthe West‚Äù which is BS, and that Jewish values are the same as Christian values which they mostly aren‚Äôt. And if you look outside of modern assimilated Jews or American Reform Judaism (which was designed to look Christian and is only now pushing back against that) Jewish practice and communities look no more Christian than a mosque does. And we certainly are no more ‚Äúwestern‚Äù or ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to the people who want to kill us"

"The 'it'd of been just as fucked up if Africa discovered the Americas and industrialized first' is a key thing people miss. We're all essentially still running on software designed for small hunter-gatherer tribes, it has only been around ~10k years maximum since we established agriculture. Back then resources were very limited, and maybe it was a good idea to distrust that guy because his skin color is different, after all your tribe and his tribe may be on the same land that can support a maximum of 80% of your combined people (no agriculture, random crop distribution, no fertilizers, and animals which will learn to avoid the area).  How we're going to transition to behavioral patterns which support modern, resource rich, stable societies I don't know. At least from the past 100 years it looks like socialization can have pretty strong factors. But how do we select against the old tribe-like patterns?"

"Its courious because Argentina regards itself as part of the west, although leftist politicians consider themselves detached from it and part of a latinoamerican identity that never seems to consolidate either. Since most of the people here are from european heritage, specially the ''white'' middle and upper class, they consider themselves part of the same history, however there is also a strong influence from precolonial original people, and most of the north fo the country is dominated by this heritage, so its weird so see how most american nationalists wouldn't consider us part of the same continuum, while here we do, and in fact we even protected nazis that escaped the end of the war, which I guess should add some bonus points to them (?)."

Cultures evolve and change, before we had spartins and athenians, then greeks, then europeans, why can‚Äôt you just accept the ‚Äúwest‚Äù is the next nessisary step in this cultural chain. Nessisary because the west has enemies, like radical islam, the alt right, and communist china."

"Not a single mention of Napoleon? Sorry but you have the historical awareness of a wet towel. I know it‚Äôs nice to pick and chooses your narrative,  but even your own list at 18:30 depicts the odd group divide progressive leftism has made itself between the mean white oppressor and ‚Äòthe marginalised‚Äô. This matters because the only thing binding these groups is the classist divide, sounds familiar? From a fascist supremacist nazi point of view it is laughable you think that in the real world Muslims and gays share any common political interest besides this ultimately Marxist concept of being marginalised in a confined geographic location. On the other hand, the concept of citizenship(regardless of race) was first and foremost developed during the Roman Empire. Most European mainland legal systems lean heavily on those first codexes by Justinianus. Reception and also the later code civil are basically what are daily lives are based on. In England and its children the system is mostly herited and based in common law and the decades long monarchist struggle that led to it. Ignoring history that matters in defining this sense of shared identity is in my opinion just ignorant."

"Hmm... (again, entertaining as always)... but I would have to say I think that the 'wizard' (which, was pretty entertaining to watch, too!) might've just been using this as a moment to be sarcastically antagonistic. It was fun to see a warlock argue a point of view from that of a warlock - was funny, made me laugh.   Simply put, the argument that something is 'this' and cannot be changed is absolutely absurd because it is something we created. Likewise, we can easily abandon what 'it means to be western' for an adoption of something much more universal. It's that fucking easy. Words are words and deemed meaning by us, the creator.

We have white people, we have catholic/christian white people, we have catholic/christian white people that hate black people and inmigrants AND we've also slaughtered almost all of our indigenous people.

I hate to use the term relatable but these videos really are to me, as I try to understand and explain the complexity of all those topics and fail frequently because some people (and even my fellow students) are just not capable of looking at problems in this kind of way... I think your content discloses very important contexts and it also helps me a lot to get on a higher level of understanding. Its extremely valuable to me, like going to an extra seminar - I would have loved to be your student üò´ also watching your videos is a good practise for my (academical) english, please don't be judgemental about any bad writing or grammatical mistakes.

"13:40 Umm, how exactly is Germany sweeping it's dark past under the rug? We are literally the ones who are looked at funny for not being patriotic enough (tbh patriotism is unnecessary, but you get the point). We have laws that make it a crime to deny the Holocaust. Education on the Third Reich is mandatory in school. Furthermore, the term 'Deutschland, Deutschland √ºber alles' is taken out of context. The full sentence is 'Deutschland, Deutschland √ºber alles, √ºber alles in der Welt, wenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze br√ºderlich zusammenh√§lt.' (Germany, Germany above everything, above everything in the world, if it stands, for protection and defense, stands brotherly together.) It means that Germany can be strong if it holds together and is from a tone were Germany was shattered into hundreds of small territories. It doesn't mean that Germany better than other countries, that would be '√ºber allen', above everyone. The Nazis used the song and interpreted the term '√ºber alles' as meaning above everyone, while it's technically false. That misuse is the reason the first stanza is not sung anymore (Also note that the third stanza was dropped in the Third Reich because the Nazis didn't want Unity, Justice and Liberty)."

"Hello ContraPoints. I know you most likely won't see this comment let alone respond since you get so many comments you probably don't have time to look at every single one, but in case you do I just wanted to ask: Sprichst du deutsch? Do you speak German? Because from watching your videos I see you throw up a lot of random slides in German and you speak German too but you don't speak it like someone who just punched an english sentence into google translate so they could include it in a crappily done skit or whatever. I mean your grammar is always accurate and so is your accent! You speak like someone who has at least studied the German language in college. I was just curious because I also speak deutsch and am very passionate about it . I even moved there impulsively at 18 just to learn the language and culture naturally so I was really curious if my favorite youtuber shared even a a sliver of the same passion I have for a foreign language/culture. Thanks!"

Good video though, as a right-wing libertarian, i struggle to find views outside of my own in a watchable way. I used to watch Laci Green, but i can't in good faith now, after she ran damage control for furries, but i digress. Even though I dont agree with a lot of your views, I do agree your logic is largely valid, and your delivery is very civil and  reasoned.

"I think Latin America is often not considered as part of the 'West' because the majority of the states there are developing countries... ergo there is a general confusion of the 'First' and 'Second' Worlds (both pre and post cold war) with the modern 'West' and the 'non-West'... so I think it is less of a racist and more of a confused economic and cultural mix of criteria that have been recently applied... also, postcolonial countries outside Europe are generally deemed as 'non-West' unless they are rich and culturally fitting into the Western narrative (ie the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and depending on its temporal economical status even South Africa) . I admit it needs to be reconsidered because the current definitions are a mess and the whole concept is simply confusing in our present globalist worldview."

As much as similar traits and shared beliefs bind together middle-eastern culture, why do you think they seprate on Arabian. European. or Asian lines. You have to see the shared similatiry of the cultures inside of these regions.  Vietnam has more in common with China than it ever will Brazil.

"Hey! This actually came out on my birthday. I'm really inspired by the videos you make, so in the spirit of counter points, I want to defend the professors who take this idea of the west and turn it on its head by asserting that it's uniquely uncivilized. The valid theory that 'the west' could have just as easily sprouted out of Africa and wrought havoc on the rest of the world does not respect that it didn't, it doesn't, and the concept of 'the west' is, as you said, a uniquely white creation. Like you said, I think it's a good idea to do away with the racist concept of 'the west' but I disagree with your disposal of our pointing out that yes, Europeans have behaved uniquely barbarously for a long time now and are unprecedented in their drive to destroy the earth. It may be a difficult point to accept, especially if European culture is your main cultural heritage, but its an important understanding to be explored and digested in order to divest from this not valid concept of  'the west'."

"The analysis is good, but the conclusion is just plain stupid. Acknowledging that the world is too complex to be reduced to a binary, and getting rid of the concept altogether, fails to understand why the binary exists in the first place. Yes, the world is complex. Too complex, in fact, for anyone to actually understand and make sense of. But people need to make sense of the world if they are to make choices. So we simplify it, we reduce the complexity, and turn uncertainty into certainty (or at least into risk). There is no getting around essentialists social constructs, because the naked reality is a meaningless mess."

We need to dispel that myth."
"I want to add something from my own experience growing up in an evangelical Protestant household (Not a super talked about group of people). I have found, especially in the churches I was forced to attend, that Western culture is seen as perverse and isn't glorified in the slightest. The Greeks are referenced for homosexuality and pedophilia. In the same way the modern SJW movement is seen as the same degeneracy. Again, within the Catholic church, perversity is often referenced. In this way the West can't be glorified any manner, because of a complete rejection of Catholic values, change, and a version of history that paints most of antiquity as savages or gay sexual predators. Consider them counterculture Christians. If that's a thing?  The above paragraph doesn't reflect my personal views and I don't pretend to think it's entirely accurate. it's just something I have seen from growing up, and I thought it was an interesting middle ground to her two perspectives of Western culture. Personally I'm just an angry gay who's a little butthurt I grew up in a quiverful cult.  Also obviously Western culture doesn't entirely revolve around religion but whatever. Also do we even know what Western culture is other than insecure white people?   I'm too stoned for this."

"@ContraPoints  The term 'Europenses' written in 754 cannot be used to contrast Christians and Muslims, because victors of the Battle of Tours were all Christians, because they were Franks. Muslims lost this battle. Frankish king Clovis was baptised in year 508. Battle of Tours happened in 732 when all Frankish state was already christian. The author of a Latin chronicle wanted to refer that European and Christian are the same term, which is wrong because as mentioned in quotation in the video much of Europe in 8th century was still pagan."

"Mostly I agree, but I don't understand why we can't say that a country is more civilized than other. Germany is more civilized than Saudi Arabia by any reasonable standard. And Sweden is more than the USA. The emphasis should be that the 'West' is not intrinsically more civilized.   Go to Europe in the XI century for example. The most sophisticated, cosmopolitan, and tolerant region was probably Al-Andalus (Muslim Caliphate of Cordoba that occupied ~70% of Spain and Portugal). The university in C√≥rdoba became the most celebrated in the world. It was attended by Christian students from all Western Europe and the library of Al-·∏§akam II was one of the largest libraries in the world, housing at least 400,000 volumes. Averroes was the one who commented Aristotle works and reintroduced them into 'the West'... so much that he was called as The Commentator.   In contrast, the Christian Kingdoms at the North of Spain were much more uncivilized by almost any standard you can come up.  Isn't it a mistake to reject that idea that currently, some countries can be more advanced or civilized than others?. Of course, things like Nazi Germany were brutal by definition, and therefore, less civilized. At the same time, we should make the emphasis that being more civilized doesn't depend on religion. We have historical examples as proof, and even nowadays, the more civilized countries of 'the West' are those countries less religious, but this is not the reason... entirely.  The point is that we are not intrinsically superior than Muslim countries. We are just currently in a better temporal position, but we must keep working in having a fair and tolerant society to keep it that way. And actually, alt-right stuff is becoming less civilized.    This actually cancels out all that demagogic arguments like that if you were living in a Muslim country you would be much worse off. That is true. It's also true that it would also happen if we would follow the alt-right propaganda. So their solution is being more similar of what they consider inferior? Our solution is maximizing happiness through higher respect to everybody, including minorities. I do believe that whatever we call 'civilization' is measured on how we respect others and reduce toxic behavior.    PS: Thanks of your channel. You rock."

"But.... but the wizard is at the start is wrong! Elsa is not about to conquer anything in Let It Go, she's fixing to live on her own out in the wilderness forever. She was already queen before she ran away, and in Let It Go she's saying goodbye to her old life, not to establish a new kingdom somewhere else but to literally be alone and live alone where her powers won't reach (or hurt) anyone. Of course that's just one aspect, the main theme of the song is 'I don't have to hold back anymore' but her being alone and removed from the kingdom is a big part of why she feels so free, because if she weren't, she might have injured Anna by accident again or done something else by accident that would be bad. The wizard doesn't know shit about Elsa's journey at all. Did anyone ever tell him?"

"We don't say that 'the west' started with the ancient Greece, but the ideas on which the western civilization is founded came from the ancient Greece (not all but some).  Democracy, capitalism, free speech, women's rights, individualism etc are WESTERN values, you don't find them as much as here in Africa or Asia. They originated in Europe and define the west. Marxism and SJWism may have originated in the west, too, but they didn't influence western culture until a few decades ago. Of course there will always be new reformations and new revolutions. The problem with you (SJWs) is not that you want to make a change, the problem is that your 'reformation' is based on false presumptions like rape culture, white privilege etc (all this stuff can easily be refuted) and that your idea's are not for the improvement of the people. You want to cancel the presumption of innocence, which is a great western achievement and protects the people. You want to destroy the traditional family, which is necessary to prevent mankind from extinction. Reformations can be good or bad, depends on the ideas of the revolutionaries. And yours are bad and against basic human rights."

"Funnily enough, people in Mexico at least (and I'm guessing the rest of Latin America too) do actually consider themselves the West, due to their relative wealth and European influenced culture. They also usually see themselves as white (at least in the sense that a tanned white person does), due to the media presenting them only with white people and most people aspiring to be white skinned. It's only when thinking of the society as a whole they think of it as brown skinned (especially their politicians who are generally percieved negatively), they think of themselves as white. This is less the case for southern South America (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay) where most people are ethnically European and so are white by nearly any definition."

"If I had to summarize my most scathing criticism of this video, it would be thus:  If only you allowed to common sense that same unifying aesthetic that you so rigorously apply to gender identity elsewhere.  ---  In more words: you admit of two potential analyses of 'the west,' ignoring entirely the only plausible one. They are:  1) The literally-everything-from-Europe-is-Western analysis. Nobody is compelled by such arguments that did not already corroborate their deconstructive, anti-western aims. Is Buddhism more Indian than Tibetan because it emerged from India? Is Europe more Islamic than Christian because some Islamic scholars saved Aristotle? No, and no. You get the general point.  2) The blood+culture analysis. Your attack on the 'cultural heritage' conception somehow stops here, despite this analysis just consisting in the cultural heritage argument conjoined with essentialist ethnic identity. Again: nobody is compelled by such arguments that do not already revel in demonizing the west. Are most 'pro-western' westerners ethno-nationalists? No.  ---  3) The theory you simply avoid, or evoke only at the fringes: evolving civic cultural heritage.   That doesn't stand in for 'every cultural idea that emerged here or in Europe,' nor does it stand in for 'blood and soil.' It stands for the shared and evolving ethical and aesthetic ideals that constitutes and strengthens those places so conceived as 'the rational western world' (think pre-SJW 1990s + gay rights), focusing most intently on the most active leaders and adherents of these ideals (hence the functional absence of South America), and so on.  There's as much conventional and normative character wrapped up in this conception as you, for instance, would identify in gender.  Going around denying you understand what 'the west' means doesn't make you an intellectual. It demonstrates the capacity of would-be intellectuals to fly so regularly in the face of common sense. It's like openly and earnestly questioning what 'American' means, just because you can't consciously analytically parse it out: you damn well know what it means all the same.  People like Peterson have found the vast audiences they have precisely because they simultaneously strike descriptive and normative chords in their audiences: they simultaneously reveal truths about regular experience previously unrealized, and they repair and bolster the aesthetic and normative mold for an evolving civic identity.  This is inherently constructive and positive in spirit, and is invariably why it will become a part of the western canonical history. So will choice aspects of social justice -- gay rights, for instance -- but so much of the destructive, negative character of the identity politics of modern day social justice will never find its way into the western canon. This much is as obvious as is the desire for those of such views to destroy and deny the 'legitimacy' of that canon (e.g. this video.)"

Why do you seem to hate white people and west so much that you have to support mass immigration to historically white countries?"

It follows that racism is bad and it's bad because it's an oppressive form of categorization, therefore all categorization must be crushed. It's the only way I can understand how gender nonbinary is even a thing. It's a category that defies categorization. <takes a drink> And your coda with it's freeform questions made me immediately think of Sulkowicz' video project: Ceci n'est pas un viol.

You really have to be as monumentally shallow and as pure a snowflake as our hippopotamous-in-chief to keep believing that's even the beginning of true.  Ignorance doesn't suit you; grow the fuck up.  And is this _really_ about Hitchens stating that overall freedom of speech is more valuable than clamping down on hate speech? What's your actual principle here, lady? 'Waaaah Dawkins argued that genetics informs sex! SPURN, SPUUUUUURN!  Bitch, where do you think your entire sexuality comes from? The disphoria, the drive to change? Try to follow denying these facts to their logical terminus because you get 'well I guess I just made it up, lol' and I'm pretty sure that's _exactly_ the 'terf' perspective on your situation. You aren't genetically female so you aren't a woman. Dawkins, OTOH, states that science backs up the idea that no you are transexual because you were born in that conflicted state because it's your genes. It is genuine, you are genuine; game, set, and match science. Modifying your sex to match your gender is as natural as fucking back hair.  But no fuck that what's _reason_ worth when you've got a childish grudge?  What blows my mind is how your 'Thuderfoot quattro' is so dedicatedly pro-humanist, pro-feminist, and pro-enlightenment equality. These 'people' are so emphatically sympathetic to your situation that you can't get over ...whatever the fuck is actually your beef... that you'd rather be prissy and pissy and sneer at them, and at everyone who respects them, and bring it up about as often as you have Tabby around.  (Yeah btw Jordan Peterson has _1.4 million subscribers_ (Harris is hiding his numbers, but has ~9000 patreon donor month to month) so if you're serious about pushing back against the forces that would only tolerate you as a woman if you could be made a compliant breeder for the next generation of wanna-be spartans you'd be minimally decent to knock it the fuck off.)  Now it would be actually _brave_ to at least interface with your three remaining nemeses (Hitchens is dead, I'll pause to let you refract) and I doubt Dennet would even notice you tweeted him, but Dawkins gets shit done and Harris is constantly active looking for interesting people to talk to.  What ever else you're interesting. He'd probably like your material on Incels for one and probably Fascists. Harris is Jewish (so was Hitchens -mother was Jewish, last name was Bloom iirc) and both of them were/are ardhently anti-fascii (but again, why not grind that axe intead) so in addition to the basic sanity of opposing nazis it's personal, but instead...just do like you do.   Why grow, when you can _bitch_ ."

Nearly every world power that self-identified(es) as 'Western' has been laying claim to being the 'Third Rome', either directly or indirectly. One of the notable expressions is the use of a variation of aquila (the eagle) in the societal symbology as a signifier of the inherited legacy."

Nowadays every German speaking person says ¬ªLeck mich am Arsch¬´ (literally ¬ªLick me on the arse¬´) instead. This is obviously a sign of the moral decadence in the West. Who should be blamed?"
"Noice vid as always. You are trying to define west from what it was, not what it is now. Do u identify as man, since u've been a man before u chose to become a woman? Do u identify as a child, cause u've been one before. I see this shitstorm as an evolution too, though with all the screeching and screaming u can't really see that anything good may come out of it.

"7:21 Some precisions about Charles Martel and the Battle of Tours, by a french guy. Charles Martel was not just a 'soldier', he was the true ruler of the Frankish Kingdom (the late merovingian kings were basically puppets and were overthrown soon after).  Nowadays, this battle is used as a symbol by the French far right. For them, Charles Martel repelled the Arabs' invasion and stopped their expansion. But in fact, the Franks did not stop an actual invasion : this was a raiding army. And the 'razzias' did not stop after the battle at all ! For several years, the Arabs continued to raid what is now southern France. Was it an important battle ? Well, it was certainly a great victory for Charles, and it proved that the Franks were capable of resisting the 'Saracen' (Arabs). Was it a big civilization clash won by the West ? Absolutely not. Anyway, the Muslim expansion was stopped by the Omeyyade caliphate's collapse some years later, and Charles Martel had nothing to do with it."

But people focus on the ten commandments, despite the fact that the Torah has 613 mitzvot in total. Basically, 'judeo-christian', as a term, is really just christian values saying 'hey look it's not just us!!!1!1!!1 Them jews believe it too!'  When really, jewish values differ greatly and (I personally think) shouldn't be roped in with christian values, because they are quite seperate."

Telling apart Indian and African elephants might be a tad harder to do, and even if there were two species of elephants whose categorization is not 100% decernible by the naked eye, it doesn't mean that the categories are nonsense. Similarly, the fact that we cannot tell the West from the Non-West in a handful of circumstances and that there are some overlaps doesn't mean that the category as such is nonsense."

"thank you for choosing the correct image to display for mozart"
"I like you and your videos but there is one trend I keep seeing that is bothering me; you often bring up a term (neo-marxist for example), and then pass your judgement on how the person that said it is using it and why, and it's never how the actual person says they are using it or within the context. It's as if the moment you hear the word or term used by someone you disagree with, you have it all figured out why they used it, and how it's just used to cover underlining motivations or contentious opinions they won't 'admit' to. You may not see what I mean but I did my best, I wish you the best. Keep on keepin on!"

And whites-non whites also cannot be related with him. In that video in which wannabe 'leftists'protest against him, there is a funny part when some SJW asks him why is he against people of color, while a bunch of black, hispanik, hindu students  are standing behind him and supporting him, and then one of them says: wtf are you talking about, when you are white and we are of color?"

"10:25 Wololo VS 4.20 mix. Without warning, my penis sprang to attention. The moment the first 'lo' hit my eardrum, rope after rope of hot sticky cum ejaculated forth from my turgid erection. Each 'lo' announced a further spurt of semen from my ivory rod of A E S T H E T I C RTS superiority. I knew I would never cum again, but this moment of euphoric symbiosis was worth an infinity of orgasms."
"Christians falsely hold the banner of 'The West' when it was reason and logic that led to modern western civilisation, not mysticism. 3rd wave feminism and SJW trails of thought today do not base their argument sin reason either, but rather emotionalism and 'the group identity'.

"I think something that ties in with this is the strange concept of the 'white race'. As if a group of people originating from many many different countries, cultures, religions, ethnic backgrounds, and social climates could be considered one homogenous race because of a similarity in phenotype is ridiculous. This concept is used by both sides of the political spectrum; by the right to insinuate some kind of solidarity amongst this 'white race', and by the left to insist that all of those belonging to the 'white race' must be responsible for the bad shit that has happened and is happening in the United States. For example I have been told that because I am white I should pay reparations to African Americans even though I am of norwegian ancestry and live in New Zealand. I have also been told that people belonging to the  'white race' have no culture, have an inherent privilege (again an issue that is seemingly specific to American society), and can't cook??

"I've always been fascinated by the concept of 'the west' shared by various liberals, centrists, conservative etc. One of the main villains of a fantasy story I'm writing is basically an amalgamation of just that; he's Rome, the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, he's the 'true Enlightenment,' colonialism, imperialism, a patriarch, and the supreme military governor of his state. He's idealized by his followers as the universal 'cure' for the rest of the 'untamed, savage, and alien' world. Both he and his state are seen as immortal and everlasting, despite having been changed and subsequently improved, by the very forces they try to opose. And though his view of the world is certainly incorrect, and though this view has lead him to commit unforgivable actions, he his neither a monster nor a pure evil in the traditional sense. He is just a man whose deluded fear of his own annihilation from history has lead him to defend himself from the illusion of his own erasure, no matter the cost.   Also the protag is the fantasy equivilant of a queer nonbinary fem-leaning non human alien from a marginalized eastern inspired culture. Subtextually on the nose, but i like to think there's enough 'fun action adventure fantasy' layers to keep even the Kekistinians from getting triggered, lol."
"Several of the liberal ideas about liberty, questioning authority, skepticism, and more were actually crafted in a context where people questioned the excess power of monarchies and the colonies questioned the overpower of empires. Many of these ideas have arisen in colonies and are often related in resistance movements of other cultures, such as the indigenous or the African culture of the enslaved. Black abolitionist movements often contributed ideas to the Enlightenment, the French Revolution and more (look at the Haitian Revolution and the Black Jacobins). We can say then that modern culture is not purely white and Western, but rather a burst of new values ‚Äã‚Äãthat have emerged due to the active coexistence and participation of other cultures. It is not 'European purity' that has created a 'great civilization' and good values, but just the opposite, multiculturalism that has generated a culture that values ‚Äã‚Äãmore tolerance than the barbaric of genre, Roman, or Judeo-Christian purity, but rather the integration of several different cultures that together need to create a more humanistic moral system to coexist with each other."

"Okay, I‚Äôve been watching your videos for a while now, and I‚Äôve been holding this opinion in for a while now, but I just have to say that I think you‚Äôre not really familiar with what most sane people would call an ‚ÄúSJW.‚Äù A lot of neckbeards on reddit will say anyone remotely leaning left is an SJW, but at least from my observation, most people who have a good grasp on right and wrong outside of their mother‚Äôs basement define ‚ÄúSJW‚Äù as a leftist version of the alt-right (which is a pretty ill-defined group in itself) also, and this is JUST my opinion, but I don‚Äôt think our country is necessarily bad, as it is abysmally confused. Things like the news, whether it be CNN or Fox, are just in it for the money. How do you get money? You get people watching. How do you eat people watching? Big stories, especially those that can spread. What‚Äôs big and important in our world, and can get people to talk about it easily? Politics! The news just focuses on stories that might create controversy, and even divide people, all for the money, because a making a living is more honestly important than thinking that far ahead, I guess."

"Do people actually consider latin america not part of the West?  I haven't heard that before.  I've always considered it the West, and I feel like most relatively educated people do too.  I also think it's fairly ridiculous that Russia isn't considered part of the West.  I mean I take all your points that it's an oversimplified concept and we're retrofitting it into the past.  But at least in the current age there, factually, *is*a strong sense of connection between most if not all of the members of the west, latin america included.  One of the most important things that can define a culture is language, and *almost* all of the countries that I consider the west have as their main language one that has descended from Proto-Indo-European (although so does Iran, Pakistan, and India).  They're all Christian nations (even though Christianity is also huge in subsaharan Africa).  Europe, Anglo-America, AU, and NZ are also majority white (and whites hold the power in South Africa), and race is a far more complicated idea in Latin America where most people in Argentina look as white as people from my rural home town inNew Hampshire--i.e. white as sin, but idiots think 'Hispanic' is a race.  Of course there is a massive mestizo population in Latin America as well.  Perhaps this is why historically people haven't considered Latin America part of the west--just pure racism.  But in my view, the West is relatively pretty well defined around these three things: Indo-European language, race, and Christianity.  Each one by itself can't define the west, but any nation that has all three is *least* disputable by the vast majority of people to be part of the West.  Except Rusia.  And even Ukraine and the balkans, for seemingly no reason at all. So maybe the communism/capitalism system is relevant to this schema.  It's interesting to note the strong ties Russia had to France throughout its history, and I don't really think they were that different in culture.  They were both European monarchic states.  And it's especially absurd how Russia is still not considered part of the west after the cold war ended..and how they've allied with the alt-right pseudo(or actual?) facists.  Certainly I agree with you that *ideals* isn't really a part of it.  As you pointed out, the enlightenment was as much part of the Islamic world as it is the Western world.  That's just propaganda trash.  But I do feel like countries that share religion, language, race, and *maybe* economic system, do relate with each other a bit more.  A lot of the culture is shared, same fads run through them, there's a sense of solidarity, maybe, kinda.  It is expanding though, imo, to even Japan and South Korea who are increasingly on 'our side'.    Good video though."

Too bad about Wallace - imagine a world without 2-nukes going off in Japan, everyone getting FDRs 2nd Bill of rights, no Cold War, no CIA/NSA, no U.S. involvement in Middle-East conflicts, freedom from lobbiests and so on...  Sounds like Fucking Paradise!    As for a on OVERALL 'WESTNESS' or Western Identity, it isn't hard at all to identify (especially if you contrast with both modern Eastern culture and Ancient Empires):  The West worships SELF, maximizes every possibly device to disable shame for hurting people, and sees the majority as contrary to the good of the individual.  This IS new.    In ancient empires like Babylon, Persia and Rome in particular, new territories meant new markets, opportunities and cultural growth. Where-ever possible better empires interfered as little as possible in local customs - preferring to build roads and aqueducts that many still use today (i.e. ACTUAL progress).  Slaves, in a large chunk of Rome's time had to be eventually freed and integrated into society, and orphaned children were commonly adopted by Roman legionnaires. Say what you will about assimilation, it beats the hell out of the 'Shock and Awe' and 'Peace with Honor' bullshit we do now.  After Rome fell, the crapfest known as the middle-ages led to a lot of bad compromises to co-opt Christianities new popularity with Old Rome's remaining Wealth/Power and a shit show of poor leadership ensued - culminating in Ignorance, Famine and THE BLACK PLAGUE.      F.F. to the end of the Plague:  You get a:   #1. Distrust of a Catholic church that had given bad advice like 'kill your cats that serve as Satan's familiars' (and also kill the rats spreading the G.D. Plague),   combined with:  #2 one-third of everybody dead, leading to fewer mouths to feed - easing pressures from the famines, better conditions and wages because a tighter job market:   and you sort of accidentally get   #3 THE RENAISSANCE.     But rather than looking at what had led to all the problems in the first place (corruption and inherited wealth), everyone's take away was to blame all the dead people for harshing their buzz earlier by wanting to eat and shit.  And a CULTURE of 'ME' was born.  In the Culture of ME, hypocrisy is impossible because whatever one must do to make a better ME is justifiable.  Everyone deciding earlier it couldn't be the big shots who were to blame - eased distrust of future big shots ('Nouveau Riche') and since  the previously-alive people had been the real culprits, then anything that leads to more previously-alive people becames totally good for all the MEs and not anything to feel any shame over at all.  When actually-not corrupt religious leaders would speak against this, all the 'Better ME' wannabes could then use the actual-truth of how the church had got it wrong to defend their selfishness.    Lastly, since the church was now fair-game, royalty - that based it's authority on the church, would come under fire next and all the new middle-class harnessed vehicles like Free Masonry and America to do a Hostile Takeover of Hereditary Lands in the name of freedom (International Law of Go Fuck Yourself).  So in short: Nathan Bedford Forrest, Ayn Rand and Donald Trump are PERFECT examples of what it is to be Western: Shameless Assholes."
"'Us and them' mentality is not bad. Its a fundamental part of biology. It keeps antelope from trying to fraternize with lions."
"When we mean West, we mean the sum of the history and achievements of White Civilization, from the time of Greece and Rome to modern times.   The Reformation was a threat to the HRE, infact the only reason Luther was not killed was because German (Prussian) Prince's protected him and used Protestantism to challenge Vienna's hegemony over Germany and there associated Catholicism.  Hitler actually met and disagreed with Spengler.  The idea that 'freedom' is the highest ideal is not intune with human nature. Fascism is about structuring human society with the laws of nature."

"I really liked how you pointed out how people in South America are excluded from the definition of whiteness by the right, white nationalists, et cetera, because they aren't 'fair skinned enough'. One thing I also think is funny and relevant is that a large percentage of people who identify as 'white' in the United States have African ancestors because, you know, slavery. But because 'white' is the privileged group, that identity goes un-examined, even though a mathematically significant number of white racists have similar ancestry to those they demonize and marginalize."

"That is an interesting point about how the west was influenced by the east in many ways. However, their beliefs still contradict each other even today, this confliction will only lead to chaos in the long term. The irony is that even acknowledging this problem would deem me a Nazi by any out of touch SJW. Let's face it, many Muslims and blacks also have an 'Us vs them' society more so than we do. Many don't respect the customs of the countries they invade, they instead seek to cause destruction due to conflicting beliefs and a lack of education. They are not perfect angels and many SJW's fail to realize that."

"Well of course western culture (or European culture if you prefer) won't last if millions of immigrants flood Europe. A solution to this problem is another story and can only result in inevitable chaos.

If it weren't for the west/Europe, we wouldn't have modern medicine, houses, vast food supplies and spectacular feats of engineering. Go figure SJW's."

Taken as a whole, we're certainly no lefty progressive liberals at work, and yet nobody perceives her as anything but female, nobody refers to her having been a man, despite the fact that she's not well liked (she's a bit of a dick and has a massive ego), and despite the fact she's pretty buff (I guess there's been a bit of overcompensation beforehand).

"Got here by way of the interesting The Verge article, which I haven't finished reading (yet) because I was so busy watching your awesome video. Loved every second of it, it was very interesting, educative and I think you're awesome. Thank you very much.  I just felt compelled to left a small comment here, which you probably won't see after 5500 comments, but anyway, here it goes: I'm from Brazil, so not from 'The West', but here the same 'us vs. them' mentality is pretty much in vogue now. We are at serious risk of electing our own fascist racist homophobic asshole as a president, and he seems to be even stupider than yours, which is scary and disturbing.  Another scary and disturbing thing is to see brown middle-class people (like me) espousing his views and endorsing him. It is truly a thing to behold. But I'm an incurable optimist.

"As an arrogant and pedantic french white man I have to point out that the 'Battle of Tours' is called the Battle of Poitiers in France (another city in this god-forsaken country). The importance of this battle is a topic that is debated, and there are very few details about the event. Even the exact location is unknown (only north of Poitiers is sure). I personally think that the arabs simply got lost in the woods. Charles Martel was passing by, the villagers said 'Hey ! You seen these arabs ? They're frightening and fierce !' Charles replied 'No, I... Oh YES ABSOLUTELY. In fact, I killed them all !' His soldiers nodded. And thus the battle of Poitiers was won."

"I really get the feeling you plucked some of your answers from Quora.com and cherry picked statements from both religious doctrines and philosophical books and mixed it with lame jokes.  I mean even why Latin America isn't considered part of West is still up for debate, but you worded in such a way you stated it as fact it's because they're brown and poor. Which isn't true. It really seems to depend on the person's view (yours being one of oppression), others say it's because it has ties to other Latin speaking countries, some due to religion,  some say certain parts aren't because of geopolitics, or because of the society itself. Like I said, it's largely up to the individual to decide for themselves if they want to include Latin America as part of the West and reason are up for debate.  There's a lot of other inconsistencies, lies, and cherry-picked facts you half hazardly stitched together."

"GAAAAAAY."
"The question of 'What is the West?' is actually a really interesting one historically. You can take it all the way back to the collapse of the Roman Empire really. The Roman Empire only collapsed in Western Europe, meaning these newly liberated countries went off and began their own development under the umbrella of Catholicism and feudalism. In Eastern Europe the Roman Empire, now Byzantium, kept chugging along and doing its own thing, hence the divide between Western and Eastern Europe. As Eastern Europe got tangled up between the Russians and the Ottomans, and a range of other stuff, Western European countries like Britain, France, Spain etc began conquering the world through colonialism. As for why South America is often excluded from 'Western Civilisation', the dominant proponent of 'Western civilisation' became Great Britain, since we were the most powerful of these Western European powers. Notice how most of the non-European countries you showed on the map were former British colonies (USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia etc.) 'Western Civilisation' became 'Britishness' since we were the dominant culture. Other countries in Western Europe began adopting our brand of Western Civilisation, including things like Enlightenment philosophy, industrialisation, etc. This continued with the rise of America which, for obvious reasons, has very close ties to British culture, meaning the countries closest to British culture (Canada, Australia etc again) continued to be seen as part of 'The West', while countries from competing empires, such as the Spanish and Portuguese, were not, even though Spain and Portugal were considered Western due to their location in Western Europe."
"I've honestly never understood the whole 'judeo-christian values are the basis of the West!' reasoning. The values that permeate Western society today, things like liberty, equal rights, freedom of speech, even opposing ideas like capitalism and socialism, all come from the Enlightenment, which was in turn based off of the Renaissance which was in turn a throw back to the Ancient Greeks and Romans, both of whom predate Christianity and, in the case of the Greeks, had next to no interaction with Judaism and certainly didn't view it as an equally valid culture. Judeo-Christianity had a huge impact on our civilisation, but the bedrock is definitely antiquity."
"I do not like how ContraPoints does not address one of her principle rivals against this idea 'the west does not have a common tradition, whether it be moral or intellectual'...... Nietzsche might have something to say about all of that."
"I do not like this false idea that 'progress is good for it's own sake because it was good in the past, so we must be heading in the right direction' go tell that to the Nazis and the Commies."
"Western culture preservationists or whatever: 'Judeo-christian values'  my jewish ass: but y'all...y'all ain't got the Zohar...or Maimonedes...no Rabbinical texts, or heschel . That's not quite judeo of you m8"
"In other words: Reductionism is silly. But with more smart words."
"Why does the West need to be a historic concept? From my perspective the term commonly used to describe a group of nations that are: - secular - value science - respect civil liberties - focus on the individual over the group - have adopted a free market economy (with varying degrees of social countermeasures)  Many also use a historic element to confine the group which typically is: - Majority Population is of European descend  Is that so stupid? The group usually included in 'the West' shares a lot of values and the racial criteria come mostly into play depending on how strictly you apply the value criteria (e.g. India's caste system violates the 3rd & 4th). For the record, I would count Latin America for the most part as part of the West (also because of geographic reasons)."

"This era no more deserve the term 'reformation' than the bush era did for bringing manufactured BS."
"Contra, we just survived a time when terrorism existed, but it wasn't exactly the number 1 problem.  Until it was manufactured as such.  And all of a sudden terrorists where 'everywhere'.    Some of us are sick of that song and dance of stating how terrible something is, that wasn't really that bad, especially comparatively.  Only to have it 'suddenly rise' amidst the complaining.  If the extreme left was against heart disease, cancer and strokes then maybe you could have some actual honestly of what actually threatens us.  We have a very serious threat from AI coming up, but we are by far NOT the most racist, sexist or even remotely close to a high capita of rapes.  People get MAD because you are inflating something that was a point of pride (we've been the best in the world) we were naturally getting even better.  And the left is now taking us back a step to make it much worse, all in this perverse effort to justify your own selfish campaign.  Again, we just rode this idiotic ride with Bush and terrorism. Bush Campaign: Look how bad terrorism is?  Aren't you glad we are keeping you 'safe'?   (Everyone feels in more danger from terrorism than ever before.  Except home grown terrorism, because that doesn't fit the narrative.) Left 2015+ campaign: Look up bad racism, sexism and rape is.  Aren't you glad we are pushing radical changes to fix that?  (Suddenly there's more racism, sexism, and rape reported than every before.  Except men getting raped crazily more often in prisons, because that doesn't fit the narrative.)  Sorry, some of us aren't falling for creationism, or post modernist nonsense.  And we'd like to actual improve the things we actually aren't great at.  Stop hamstringing progress for your own selfish, fear induced crusade."

"Ok, I am late as shit to the party, but I've seen people from outside America and Europe writing about their countries' ideas on The West so I'll try to type up some of my observations from a... western(?) country of Poland.  For modern Poles the West is perceived as either the cultural sphere to which people think we mostly belong to (moderates, liberals and centrists) or the luminescent ideal towards which we aspire and try to move towards: the well organized, tidy and clean, with well-working institutions and fair economy, comprised of people who produce from their ranks geniuses and achievers that are relevant to the totality of the world. There are two major attitudes that the latter perception gives birth to, and I would prefer to talk about them as they are more prevalent among my younger generation, and better reflect deep sentiments rooted in mainstream politics as well: 1: self-aggrandizement  2: a black-pilled self-hatred  The first is trying to prove beyond any doubt that Poland belongs to The West and its achievements are no worse, or even greater than, some of the undoubtedly western countries'. These people argue that we should 'promote Poland abroads', and usually try to pander to Western audiences producing propagandistic media of all sorts, glorifying our national heroes and emphasizing our role in history, with admittedly very poor results (Have you ever heard of any Polish made movie, series or game ABOUT Poland specifically? Exactly) The second are people who 'just gave up'. They think they've achieved self awareness of our real value and significance in the world, which according to them is none. As the Alt-Right's meme goes: We will never be white. We will never 'catch up' to The West, as we are inherently inferior, irrelevant, disorganized and discordant. They often try to mock any achievements made by Polish people as inconsequential, minor and ultimately not great at all.  These modes of thinking usually corellate strictly with attitude towards Germany: the first treats Germans with aversion following the trauma of the partitions and the 2nd World War, and sees them as the aggressors trying to erase our culture, and the second states them as an example for us, but not to follow, because that's impossible - an example to gaze at or to just submit ourselves towards.  So yeah, the idea of The West brings out deep insecurities in many of us. Couple that with the opinion that we are not present in western collective consciousness compared to countries with not much more numerous population, and add next to no representation in American entertainment, which is most of the entertainment consumed here, and you have a simplified picture of our confused sense of belonging, at least in my generation, but as I said - many of these sentiments are present in mainstream politics as well."

"I don't get it. What is this fascination with 'The West'? What has Europe been for most of the past thousand years? A festering petridish of plague and political and social strife and overpopulation and famine, it's like because Europe has had it relatively good for the past few decades they've forgotten that things were SO shitty in Europe that bunch of people just decided to fucking leave, millions of people over the course of Europe's timeline decided to fucking leave once they found places they thought suitable. Europe's entire history has been the story of all sorts of people TRYING TO LEAVE EUROPE and start their own 'West' - with blackjack and hookers. What is the draw here? Can someone explain this to me? My ancestors were part of one of the largest voluntary - peace-time diasporas in human history - not because of famine or war, but literally because Europe was a shithole and the United States hadn't yet made laws against people of 'my type' emigrating. Obviously my ancestors didn't find much about 'Western Civilization' with which to be enamored. It seems like they thought it sucked eggs. I'm inclined to agree with their initial assessment."

However, we all know that South America isn't as economically developed as the rest of those red countries that map showed. And some of these countries even experimented with socialism. You left those things out. Capitalism and general prosperity are core to today's definition of the West. Southern European countries, like Greece, get a pass due to their history."

"Wow! There are a lot of issues with this video. The biggest is trying to draw a comparison between modern progressives and the former reformations. This is total Whig history, taking the conflicts of the past and drawing unreasonable comparisons to the modern world. Are we going to support everyone who promises to radically change society. Yes Martin Luther wanted to change society, but so did Mao and Stalin, and the only way to know which one your 'SJW reformation' is would be to fully consider the ethical, political, and philosophical implications of the progressive world view.   You also seem to wan't to completely deconstruct and diminish the achievements of Western civilization by pointing to it's shifting and sometimes ambiguous boundaries. Would we consider the British Isles western prior to Roman invasion and occupation? Maybe not. Is that so bad? Does that undermine the meaning of the word 'Western'? I don't think so, inhabitants of the west are connected by a common history and culture. A people is western if the philosophical and spiritual foundations of their society are Christian and Greek. This tells us that the brown folks in the Byzantium Empire were Western and that the white folks in British Isles prior to Roman invasion were not. This also tells us why the West can be in danger even if European people continue to exist. The West is in danger not because the literal replacement of white people, since its boundaries have shifted before anyways, but instead because of cultural changes driven by immigration and ideology. Yes the majority of people who think this way have been White (of European descent), but 'western' thinking is not a natural result of 'whiteness' completely divorced from historical and cultural context. Modern science, advanced technology, individual rights, and a market economy require an environment which is founded on the spirituality of the Bible and the philosophy of the Greeks, in short they require Western Civilization."

As someone born in Latin America and raised in USA the concept of the West always included Latin America, after all the European explorers and colonists were... European. The old embedded idea of the West being only white people is also something that runs counter to a lot of what I was encultured to as a kid in American schools. MLK Jr is as much a part of the west as all the dead white guys writings. Anyhow, my point is that all these white supremacist west people have a loud voice, but are losing out to how kids are being taught these days about how expansive the west actually is.

"This video seems to ignore than most times people are fully aware of how contradictory 'Western culture' is, but that doesn't change that it IS a culture group, made up of many different ethnic backgrounds, hence the contradictions. What people who care about Western culture care about is having all that rich history and culture swept away by a sudden rewriting/forced demographic change in areas that were traditionally European. It's a matter of not losing your people's identity, no matter how contradictory it may have been in history, just like every other cultural group.  Also SJWs are still cancer either way. It's also very fitting to use the term 'Neo-Marxist' when the people the term is being used for literally profess themselves as Marxists.  I was expecting a well thought out video, but of course it all came around to saying 'Advocating white culture and evil whiteness = YUR A FOOKIN' NAZI!'"

You're a beautiful women and I'll be happy to punch any TERF who messes with you because I am a real radical feminist who realizes that the cost to someone going from being considered male by society to being considered female is a lot greater than the cost in my life having grown up as a woman.

Maybe I just should remember to take my methylphenidate pills on time before watching your videos. ;)   (I should probably also remember to turn on the subtitles, cause reading the same text as what I'm listening to makes me less distracted...

It is thanks to values and morals developed exclusively in the West (and nowhere else) that you're allowed to freely be the degenerate you are, without facing any legal repercussions as, say, bein thrown from a building, like they do to people like you in muslim countries. And your arguments about the Ancient Greeks not referring to themselves as Westerners (as if that was somewhat of a 'proof' of inexistence of the West) is just ridiculous. Greece was the beggining of the West, one of its sources, so, of course they woudn't have the perception of the greater civilization that was blossoming back then. As an analogy, people in the Middle Ages woudn't refer to their period as Middle Ages. I have a difficulty to determine if you're either too dumb or too dishonest."

"As a Latin American, I can assure you we consider ourselves westerners, and really, we don't the validation of anyone to do that. The good thing is that they can't call us racists when we save the West from the globalists."
"The concept of 'The West' is indeed vague, but I don't think you could find any concept that tries to define civilization or culture without at least a bit of 'vagueness' : the frontier between what is and what is not the 'West' or 'European civlization' will always be blurry. And yet these type of categories can still help us understanding the world.  The case of Latin America is very interesting. Samuel Huntington in 'Clash of civilisation' puts Europe and North America in the same 'Western civilisation', but Latin America is not in the same 'Western' civilisation. The interesting part is that Huntington uses Fernand Braudel's 'Grammar of civilisation' where Latin America is one component of what Braudel calls the 'European civilisations' (note the plural he uses).  The same for Russia : for Huntington, Russia is not 'Western civlization' but for Braudel it is a part of 'European civilizations'.  It seems that, when comparing the two books, Huntington's view seems to fall in line, at least in part, with a racialised view and a geopolitical view (West = Nato approximatively), while Braudel's view look more like a linguistic and religious definition of what the concept of 'European civilizations' is.  You could reject the concept of 'civilization' itself in order to have a more 'cosmopolitan' view of ourselves, but I don't think you need to go as far as denying there are some important common features between countries (religion and languages are a good criteria to know where the limits are) that exist.  Furthermore, you can acknowledge these civilizationnal traits exist and understand the frontier is not rigid and impossible to change but rather flexible to some degree.  Ataturk's Turkey and Meiji Era Japan are good examples of civilizationnal traits that go beyond there sphere of origin : both of these countries did adopt institutions that are arguably a feature of what Braudel calls the 'European civilizations'.  You make good points but your conclusion goes to far : there is some historical validity to the idea that mankind can be categorised into different civilizationnal sphere (religion and languages is, to me, the good criteria). And one can uses these categories without dog whistling to a racialised view of the world. I read Braudel's 'Grammar of Civilizations' and it does not seem that he is dog whitling or using these categories as a covert manner of promoting racial categories."

"West, as a white, christian and 'intellectual' ideology it's a construct of recent times. West as  the toga wearing, cut with water wine, and gay warrior army (Sacred Batallion of Thebes FTW) of ancient greece was a 'not so fictional' believe imposed with the difference of language and government. Even so, the difference between East and West was more close to geo-political interests of the Thalassocrasia, where both sides wanted to be the big stick of the mediterranean, Rather than a big cultural difference (the greek alphabet is the son of the phoenician which were 'cousins' with the persians). Everything went to the shitter when the pants-wearing, blond-blue eyed, germanic barbarians came to fuck everything.  On the other hand, in your 'this is the west' map, you excluded the Latin American countries. Just because in the USA they see 'latinos' (which is a nonsense word, because non of them come from the Lacio region in Italy) as a diametral opposite culture to the 'white' culture, that doesn't mean we aren't westernized. Our mixed inheritance makes us the bastard children of the west, we speak the language of europeans, we have the faith of the oppresors. We are more akin in our politics to the european standart (multi-party system v.s. two party system) as we follow the french law school instead of the british one. Our language is closer to the roots of western civilization, having entire academies dedicated to the growth of it. Our brown skin is closer to the colour of the greeks than the colour of the germanic people. I hate to talk about races, because that's demeaning to the human spirit, but to a society based on the discrimination and racism it's necessary  to speak in their own words. The USA thinks they're the true descendant of the 'western civilization' with their coca cola, cheap cars and free market (which is a code name of economic imperialism), when they're just a bunch of saxons invading the byproduct of a cultural orgy, plundering all what they can, and selling it back at the triple of the original cost."

It's also hypocritical and disingenuous, as we Western Jews are now being turned into an enemy of the left generally because of our association with Israel and the claims that we are somehow beneficiaries of'white privilege.'

"it's always been hilarious to me how right wingers, most of whom are militantly anti-gay, idolize quite possibly the gayest society in history in sparta.  seriously, the spartans were SUPER gay. one of their religious festivals was a naked boy running around carrying a cluster of grapes while other naked boys tried to catch him. that was the one, in fact, that caused these SO MANLY warriors to sit out the battle of marathon.  also i picked the franks in AOE because the throwing axemen were super OP."

"Sure eating meat is libidinous. The pleasure associated with it is directly linked to fascination for animal suffering. People don‚Äôt eat meat because sausages taste like dicks but because their unconscious mind enjoys that farm animals are massively brutalised in the industry. Meat eating has always been an erotic ritual, and nowadays, it has to reflect contemporary power: slaughter houses have to be as atrocious, materialistic and mechanised as possible.   Can you honestly debase dominant ideologies while having fun with meat? I would consider that eating naff sausages expresses that pigs are inferior beings whose suffering is sexy and fun.  It would be good to see a video about veganism on this channel. I suppose it wouldn‚Äôt be about being a proud speciesist SJW, would it?   Honestly, you should watch what the industry does to pigs. Have a look at the film land of hope and glory, for example. There is nothing fun or sexy about sausages."

"There is no historian I have ever read or know of who says that Western Civilization is clearly defined being that it is a historical phenomenon. Some start in Athens, but most historians would start with the ANE and Sumer, not Athens. What you are referring to in starting with Athens is classical studies which is connected to the idea of Western Civilization, but is not synonymous.  The argument that the story is ad hoc is actually comical as all history is ad hoc. What your point of view shows is that you just don't understand historiography. Saying that Herodotus doesn't have an idea of the West is asinine as he separates the world into Greek-speakers and Barbarians which is connected to the creation of the idea of 'The West' - separation of the world into civilized and non-civilized. This separation is the ground of all other separation. The other area of separation of the 'West' as different from the 'East' seems to be mostly art and architecture based.  Arguing against the term 'Judeo-Christian values' is valid, but look up the term's origin in the OED and you will then understand why it was created. I take it you have never read a theological work pre-1920. It was Christianity which changed the world morally, especially Paul. As far as I can tell historically, Pauline Christianity is what altered the moral landscape more than anything else.  I think one thing you could have hit on but didn't is that the one world hypothesis of the Greeks and the two world hypothesis of Christianity have been at odds since the beginning, so there are two parallel strands to Western Civilization. This is why the definition can never be given unequivocally. In fact, the two sects have been fighting one another for superiority since the beginning. This is clearly seen in any historical work on the subject. You are right there is a 'us vs them' mentality, but this covers up the fact that the 'us' inside the walls was always fractured."

"The fact that Abraham and Aristotle (and Jesus fuckin' christ) influenced both Islamic and Western civilization doesn't preclude the distinction between the civilizations. Imagine for yourself a venn diagram - the circles of  influential Western and Islamic thinkers would overlap, and in the wedge you would find Abraham and Aristotle. But in either circle you would find philosophers and theologians not found in the other - because the intellectual  histories of the  two are distinct; the Western and Islamic thinkers are mostly only in dialouge with other thiners within their respective groups after a certain point in time. Not that there were never any cross-influences or that there was some hermetic seal between them, but in general they are separate traditions.  To put it another way, you might group Western  and Islamic civilizations together under some supragroup  of  'Abrahamic civilization' or something, but you would still  have the divergence - we have a  closer phylogenic relationship with the Islamic world than we have to other civilizations,  but we're still separate civilizations."

Your production value, baroque aesthetic, preparation are great. Your ability to concede certain points is a strength lost on many. The 'left' needs more like you. Shutting down discussion and discourse of the 'enemy' undermines the ability to prove yourself correct.

Sometimes, you see a person, not knowing who they are, and when someone tells you who they are, like maybe a murderer, you have to reconcile the knowledge with the sight of a seemingly ordinary human.

You would thrive in the night life if you don't drink yourself to death. Become a brand. More self deprication and butterflies, Titania."
"I have a question about your use of the term 'imperialist capitalism'. I understand that current systems of capitalism - where government involvement in the economy and things like lobbying and corruption are high - unfairly rig systems of trade against smaller companies/countries etc. I wonder though if you think this is intrinsic to capitalism, as defined as an open network of trade between anyone who has anything to produce and sell?   I only ask because in my mind 'imperialism' and 'capitalism' as concepts seem like opposites. Imperialism for me suggests the dominance of a state which has a monopoly of force in some way - such as when colonising powers went to Africa or the instalment of the British Raj. Capitalism, when you remove government intervention however, represents a system of trade between willing parties.   Although the power structures of this trade are rarely completely equal (as relations between different people rarely are on any level) in my mind this cannot be linked with things like slavery under imperialism because the slaves got nothing in return for being made slaves. Also although individuals were allowed to operate as individual slave owners they did so under state sanction and because of the laws that the imperialist government put in place. This is not the case with workers under capitalism who are subject to human rights, who are paid for their labour, and who are allowed to leave at any time. If workers feel that they are unable to leave because of implicit threats such as poverty this too seems like a failure of the state who do not properly distribute taxes or have an effective system of tax welfare.  I know this is a slightly controversial opinion - I work at a university and the majority of my colleagues are socialists and believe that colonialism and capitalism are essentially linked in their ideologies. Funnily enough many of them also connect Communism with post-structuralism which I see as deeply incompatible given communism's need for a central and unified state ideology which must be upheld and protected from the inside. The seems to limit potential for self-definition which is so important in post-structuralism. You mentioned something about incompatibilities of systems under the term 'pomo-nomo' in your Jordan Peterson video I think?    I just wondered if you could expand on your thoughts on the relationship between capitalism and imperialism/colonialism or communism and post-structuralism and maybe address it in a video? I'd be fascinated to hear your take! I love your videos and think they're probably the best thing on Youtube."

"*(...) such critiques of orientalism do not know how to situate dissenting traditions such as those represented by minority feminists and lesbian and gay activists. In challenging the binaries of orientalism which associates modernity and secularism with the West, and religious, non-democratic traditions with the East, the anti-orientalists become apologists for the cultures of the East in all their patriarchal glory and question the inherent value of secularism rather than challenge the discourse of orientalism by pointing out that secular, free thinking traditions, can exist in both and conversely heterosexist, patriarchal thinking still encumbers the West.*  *The danger of analysis in straightforward binaries, the dichotomised West versus East narrative, which is the ‚Äòsin‚Äô of orientalism is also the sin of anti-orientalism. In the attempt not to be racist, in denying that the 'other' has its secular traditions, they end up being racist. By abdicating the responsibility to oppose religious laws, the anti-orientalists create a dangerous theoretical vacuum in which religious power can grow unchecked.*   *(...) There‚Äôs no need to ditch values such as secularism and modernity, just point out that they‚Äôre not associated wholly with the West ‚Äì that would be the appropriate response to orientalism.* https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/rahila-gupta/taking-flawed-stand-against-orientalism"

Actually we are much whiter than North-Americans since most of us are of European descent and there's no blacks in our countries.   The idea Latin America isn't part of the West is due to unitedstatian (I don't call you guys 'americans', America is a continent) ignorance, not because everyone in Latin America is dark skinned or non-white. Many Latin Americans are actually of European descent, inform yourself better. The whole idea that there is a 'latino' race is pathetic."

"tl;dr: definitions are nebular and there's more of a gradient and interplay between supposedly binary concepts, and there's often a shared historical origin for various topics.  And yet, everyone in academia knows *exactly* what is being meant by the term 'The West'.   So you spent about 20 minutes pedantically going over this, and only a minute arguing for an alternative -- essentially, that we should adopt a more 'cosmopolitan' view of things.   For what end? Would academia be somehow better served by not breaking down various topics into generalized areas -- like does it somehow *not* make sense to study 'Western Art Music' by tracing its origins from medieval music through modern Western harmony? Does 'the East' as a concept similarly need to be overturned?    This is where I think you should have spent the bulk of your time -- especially considering you dub your channel contrapoints."

"The problem with this somewhat expansive definition of the west is that is easily conflates the modern west with the west of antiquity and the middle ages when nobody really wants to live in the west during those times for very specific reasons. If you take these advocates for the 'west' and assume they are talking of the post enlightenment west in Europe and America, they have a compelling argument for preserving it. This is because the fundamental history of the modern west, as everyone who honestly looks at it describes it, is a history of freedom of thought and action. It is this culture that propelled the greatest wealth generation machine the world has ever known. This is the reason you are capable of expressing yourself as you wish-we live in such abundance that we can waste resources to let you be as useless as you want.  'The history of the west is a history of change and revolution.' The helicopters will blot out the sun."
"There is no such thing as European, African,Latin or Asian civilizations, those name are for continents not civilizations, and a civilization cannot claim EAST or WEST!.

It was so fu(k up Aficans and Muslims are still jealous. The pictures of the pile of corpses in Auschwitz, Treblinka and Sobibor still burn the brains of million. That was the result of an attempt to create an Arian western civilization. The West?  WTF they are the talking about?."
"21:49 That dress is MMMMMMMMMMMM"
"To be fair, there actually is a pretty real philosophical division between 'the West' and 'Islam,' and it postdates the examples that you're going to pick out of history.  Shortly after the Catholic Church had that magnificent idea to go fuck up one of the great bastions of scientific and progressive civilization so that they could...I don't even know - make sure there were plenty of parking spaces available at their summer vacation destination? - and in so doing gravely wounded one of the greatest intellectual cultures in the history of the world, the Islamic sphere had a major philosophical break that still affects us today.  'The West' philosophically embraced the skepticism of the ancient Greek philosophers and focused investigation on understanding reality, while the Islamic world philosophically embraced the work of one Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali and his followers, who devoted their intellect specifically to the understanding of god and the reconciliation of certain religious incompatibilities into a total philosophy.    That's the major schism in this particular use of the term.  'The West,' in this definition, embraced Enlightenment values (which, ironically, include secularism and humanism - things which most of the folks who go on about 'The West' aren't really down with) while 'Islam' regressed into a form of religious fundamentalism.  That's actually a problem in science that we're STILL working to fix, and one where the divisive construct is somewhat useful for now, in much the same way as the concept of race is presently still useful for directing programs and policies aimed at correcting past social iniquities and for medically and scientifically chopping up broad swathes of people with similar enough ancestry to make, for instance, efforts toward the address of a particular disease identifiable as disproportionately affecting this arbitrary population (sickle cell anemia, as an example) simpler to execute, without having to resort to the infinitely more complicated subject of division based entirely upon genotypical heredity."

Weve still got it pretty good so nothing needs changing yet, but push us far enough and youll regret your contribution to what happens. The last time we had a real enemy we split the atom and went to the moon, should be interesting to see what we come up with next. <3"

I am the result of 400+ years of assimilation and genocide.  I am the end result of 'the west' and I can say I'm fucking angry at it and where it's going but you're right that we can't do THE EVVVVVIL WEST in return.

"I'd like to question your last point. Turning the idea of 'The West' on its head, exposing it as a racist, evil ideology is important because it exposes colonialism and capitalism as evil systems. I think 'a more cosmopolitan' view of history and identity is important and necessary to move forward. However, villifying 'The West' is an important part of resistance in certain communities. I'm Canadian, and by pushing back on the racist history of colonization, indigenous communities have managed to critique the lasting effects of colonization. Similarly, black communities in America have had to push back on the lasting impacts of slavery as a Western institution, distinct from African slavery (of course, all slavery is bad).  I suppose what I'm curious about, is how resistance against harmful institutions which have had lasting effects (colonialism, capitalism, slavery) can thrive while simultaniously understanding that 'The West' is a fabricated concept. What can this resistance look like?"

"I love you and I love your sense of humor. But I think you got a few tidbits wrong. Like Luther's theses weren't *whiny* - they were jokes! Mostly. Pointed, but still jokes. ('course humor still had a way to go yet... They didn't have much practice. The medieval period just wasn't that funny. Don't you believe Monty Python!) But it seems pedantic to quibble about Herodotus and Europa, and such. I'll prefer to leave it at just saying I really enjoy all your videos, and appreciate your view, and admire the professionalism of your productions and wish you all the best."
"But if you have any nuanced view of what the western world is that strays from Contapoints' opining of what you think, I guess your not a racist? The only two people she looked at was a quasi-infamous white supremacist and a Canadian prof, so if your views don't correlate with them entirely then I guess the vid isn't talking about you!"
"I don't really get, how the fact that there have been helpful revolutions, makes what is going on right now good? There have also been terrible revolutions and parts of history. Not every political wave is positive obviously?? What is the point you're making? So what about rather finding arguments for the matter itself than just saying 'look this worked out so the new ideas we come up today (which are a completely different matter) will work out too'??? What kind of argument is that?  That could have been a discussion on whether objective morality exists and if yes if it derives from religion. But the points you're making are not correlated with the conclusions you pull?"

I think most racists white or black who obsesse over race secretly love the other side more then they let on. Not that it's a bad thing so I guess race mixing isn't as bad as Thurmond had a mixed race child so I Guess it's just delusional when racists say that race mixing is bad."

"This is the gayest thing I've ever seen."
"What is important to remember is that 'Western values' are fundamentally a good thing, just not in the distorted way right uses it. I'm not big on post-colonial theory or its relativism. I also think that there is no denial that the enlightenment period is undeniably influenced by Christian philosophy. The whole concept of communism is originally a concept taken out of the bible."

Though you are a leftist, you aren't the stereotypical hypersensitive activist, but neither are you an edgy, Kalashnikov-fetishizing neo-Leninist. You are just someone who has an understanding of the complexities of human thought and history, and wishes to point out a path where we can change our society and decrease oppression so as to benefit everyone, in opposition to the scary, racist us vs. them mentality pushed by many politicians today. And in terms of being able to argue '''''radical SJW'''' leftism to everyone, you really are the best around on YouTube. And all this while looking like a *hella aesthetic* stripper Titania.

"6:39 is misleading. While there wouldn‚Äôt have been any concept of ‚ÄúThe West‚Äù for Herodotus, Herodotus himself records the struggle of the Greeks in unifying as best as they could against the Achaemenids and frequently used the charge of ‚ÄúMedeism‚Äù against anyone who could be perceived to support the Persians. ‚ÄúMedeism‚Äù is really interesting because it was purely a pejorative, and used in the same way one might accuse someone of ‚Äúcommunist sympathies‚Äù during the Cold War. So there clearly was an analogous concept of ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù and ‚ÄúMede,‚Äù ‚ÄúBarbarian,‚Äù or any other slough of words that mirrors an infinite other slough of words many use today like ‚Äúcultural marxist,‚Äù ‚Äúpost modernist,‚Äù or even ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù if the speaker uses a snarky enough tone."

"Hitler and other NS or Fascist leaders never, ever had a sense of being 'white'  This is just entirely made up. Hitler's racism was mostly against other groups most people would call white, such as the French, Poles, Slavs etc.  Outside of Germany, none of the NS regimes were even in places where people are considered White.  Hitler referred to white Americans as a degraded race! He called Poles and Slavs sub-human! He bemoaned his physical proximity to France and considered Arabs his racial brothers.  The connection between Hitler and white identity is entirely manufactured!"

"You lost me after you brought up Anita Sarkeesian. Some of the claims she makes about gamers and the industry are downright demeaning.  She showed Hitman: Absolution footage of someone killing stripper NPCs you're supposed to sneak past and dragging their bodies around (it's a stealth game you're supposed to hide bodies), then claimed the game encourages you to kill them and defile their bodies because gamers are misogynist necrophiles. There isn't a single video on YouTube depicting anyone doing that, she had to have recorded herself doing it. Also, the game deducts points for killing the strippers, as you could see right in her video.  She claims she's a lifelong fan of video games when there's a clip of her in 2011 saying she's 'not a fan of video games'. Excuse me but fuck her. She deserves all the hate she gets."
"More reliably good stuff from Contrapoints. Hoorah! Just a little quibble maybe later...But yeah! Kicks off with a fully inhabited reading of WS...sweeeeet. Worth watching over and again just for that. And much else to enjoy for everybody. The West. Hmm. Yeah, it is a big broad category that attempts to capture a big broad aspect of reality in a small tidy word. Bound to fall short. But, y'know, there is Something going on in the difference between North vs South Korea or Haiti vs Dominican Republic worthy of attention. The quibble. The R word dropped at the expense of POTUS and those millions of white, black, brown, yellow, purple, green, gay, straight, mind yer own biz etc etc uniquely individual people who voted for him. No need for that from Contrapoints. The left has plenty enough censorious and dull folk to peddle that wretched dull word. Big dxxx special fxxx boy was fairer and funnier and more difficult to refute. See? Us Petersonian dull grey folk don't need duller 1930's authoritarian ism and ist words to describe how we feel and think. Shakespeare never heard of any ist or ism and he could talk sense. Anyhoo. More fun and fabulous stuff please Contra. Sermons in babbling brooks and good in everything."

"I honestly love the thought of school children, in 300 years, reading through their textbooks and trying to get their heads around the idea of this era. ''Social justice warriors'? Holy shit, can you imagine being so conceited that you'd call yourself that?' 'Oh, yeah, no. Their enemies called them that. It was meant as an insult.' '.........huh?' 'Yeah, originally it was an ironic title used within the group, regarding people who talked a big game on justice, but didn't do much, but then their enemies took hold of it and started using it against people who raised money for refugees or campaigned against rape.' '... I'm confused.'"
"'It's common to take for granted that there is a historical continious clearly defined thing called western civilization that start in ancient athens and flourishes in our own era of enlightened philosopher kings...'  'But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively by modern people for particular purposes it's like an origin myth.'  ¬†So you mean that it wasn't a bunch of white guys who sat down in athens and decided to found a civilization?! *gasp* You mean it was a bunch of historians and philosophers and other people who sat down and looked at history and then made a description?! Well then obviously there is no such thing as western civilization and we're all basically a free for all. Personally I''m going Japanese now.   Or maybe you should get your head out of whatever postmodern ass it's currently situated in and just stop! I mean the implication of what you're saying is that the west has no history which stupid beyond belief.   If you look at that map which Kwame uses to claim that there is no west in ancient greece you might find that Europe is located to the west of Asia... Also why is Herodotus the one and only Greek? I mean there must have been other Greeks in ancient Greece right? What did they think about race? Oh if you actually read up on it and don't just trust some article written by some pseudointellectual (Who might have written this article for, as you put it, 'particular purposes') then you might find that he was a somewhat controversial figure in his time. If some historian digs up your youtube videos in 2500 years would he be accurate to claim that your views on race, sexuality, fashion, etc. was mainstream in the US anno 2018? No.   And no one has been claiming that the Greeks had some sort of sense of european identity. Quite the contrary they considered everyone outside of the hellenic world to be barbarians. What is claimed is that the Hellenic ideas of democracy and science and philosophy and art won wider recognition outside of Greece after the hellenic civilization went into decline. Carried on by for example the romans who had quite a big influence on the west.   'So the idea of the west has to be more recent than that..'   Yes. But that does not in any way disprove or prove anything. I mean the first world war wasn't called the first world war when it started in fact it didn't get that name until after the war ended when people started talking about a rematch. That fact has no impact on the global scale or the terrible death toll of world war 1. Because history tends to be descriptive in nature. Instead of trying to write history in the future we write it as a way to describe what has already happened in order to see how we got to where we are today.    'Notice that the term itself posits an us vs them dichotomy'   Yes. So? I mean the dichotomy was there and still is there whether you chose to ignore it or not. If there is no us or them and the Judeo-Christian (I'd add pagan as well but that's probably just me) values of the west is the same as the Judeo-Christian-Muslim values of the muslim world then why do they punish trans people and homosexuals? In the west if someone attacks a homosexual that person goes to jail. In the muslim world if you attack a homosexual no one cares and the homosexual goes to jail or worse.   'A term usually used to falsely imply that contemporary moral norms derive from such a generic, parochial, and incomplete document as the 10 commandments. As if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder. As if the prohobition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever...'   thepointyou.gif First off people who claim that our moral norms are directly derived from the 10 commandments are usually Christian fundamentalists and they're idiots (but I repeat myself). The ten commandments was simply the codification of the moral norms of some sand people living thousands of years ago. The fact that you even know of the 10 commandments, and can probably list a few of the top of your head, should give you a clue that maybe they spread outside of that small desert tribe... And the fact that when you say 'the 10 commandments...' I immediatly know what you're talking about would suggest that they have had some influential role in the history of both our cultures.   'As if every major civilization didn't have laws...'   Yeah sure but we are talking about western civilization here so are you suggesting that the 5 Taoist precepts had more influence over Christian Europe than the 10 commandments? Or was that just something that sounded smart when some nu-atheist said it 6+ years ago?   'As if the prohobition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever...'   Interesting point. In the west graven images are not considered to be immoral however in the Islamic world it is considered immoral and it is a punishable offence in much of the Islamic world... So you know maybe there actually is a difference between western civilization and near eastern civilization?    ''''Exodus'''' Is a part of the earlier old testament (It's called old for a reason) and not part of the more Christian new testament. Later new testament text went more towards monogamy and later synods cemented the Latin Church's position on the monogamy vs polygamy issue. You know you should hire someone like me to do your research because it took me like 10 seconds of googling to debunk this tired old nu-atheism talking point. Of course unless you're pandering to the ignorant nu-atheists in your audience in which case carry on.   'In pagan lands this idea was slow to take hold...'   Yes but it did take hold...    'Then 300 years later a bunch of drink sodden fedora tippers appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire...'   Say what you want about the horsemen but the fact is that we're all products of the culture we grow up in and the culture we grow up in is derivative of the culture that came before and that goes back further than to the enlightenment. And the enlightement philosophers were products of their Judeo-Christian environment. You know none of this exists in a vacuum and the enlightenment didn't just spring out of the ground like Dwarves or something... The enlightenment was a result of Christians taking an interest in science and the old greek philosophers and a whole bunch of different factors.    SJWs aren't going to be the next reformation. Best case it will fizzle out into nothing worst case they'll be the new nazis. You know considering their flirtations with murderous totalitarian ideologies and regiemes and their insistance that some groups in society has unfairly gained their positions of power in their home countries...   Counterreformation? Are you saying that Trump and Peterson are secret Catholics who are trying to overthrow the Lutheran world? What century is this?!    'As long as people have been talking about western culture they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration''...the idea of western culture was influential well beyond the third Reich...'    I think you forgot to finish that first point. I mean the idea of western culture and it's decline has nothing to do with the third Reich nor colonialism. And just for the record: If you know history and you are somewhat worldly you should be worried the decline of the west. I mean if the west declines then we're going to be overrun by people who don't really have the wests tolerant view on things like the rights of sexual minorities. And if you know your history you should know that every great civilization that has ever existed prior to our current has declined and gotten overrun by the barbarians. There is nothing to suppose that the west is in any way an exceptional civilization in that regard.   Yes everyone with even the most basic education in western studies knows about how the Islamic world 'saved' the west. Maybe you should have studied more and boozed less in university? No one has claimed that the arab world doesn't have an inheritance from the ancient Greeks. Well no one of any sort of schooling has claimed that. But why would this be an argument against the existance of western civilization?   'So the origins of western culture is not unique to us at all'   Well no but as you may or may not have noticed there is still a difference between western cultures and the Islamic cultures... Might there have been some amount of time and evolution of our respective cultures in the time between Ibn Rushd and today? I mean surely you researched the important Islamic scholars in the time from Aquinas and Rushd to today in order to get a full picture of the divergence of the west and the near east, right?   'If you didn't know in Shakespear times boys in drag played female parts'   Shocking. No one has *ever* pointed this out before you.      I'm going to have to end it here because this is giving me a nosebleed. I will conclude with this: There is so much fallacious arguments, poor reasoning, and simple ignorance in this video that just have to paraphrase a famous northern freedom fighter.

"Honestly I am behind you here on the idea of 'The West' but using Anita Sarkeesian as a symbol really isn't helpful. She's a money seeker. She worked for a PUA and then when it was more profitable used feminist ideals to sell a kickstarter campaign that she never gave what was promised. She is a critic who doesn't understand the medium she's criticizing.  This is really beside your point though, but as a bisexual person myself I find Anita to be someone who is abusing my image for her own gain both financially and for status while simultaneously making a mockery of the LGBT movement and actual criticism and equality.   I want a variety of female protagonists both in games and in media. People others can see themselves in. However making a shit argument that the mere existence of a strip club in a game about a seedy criminal underbelly is inherently advocating violence on women is nothing more than 'Video Games cause violence' by another name. Anita is nothing more than a leech using LGBT rights as her newest fashion trend."
"I don't think many people who have a genuine clue as to what they mean use the term 'The West' in reference to a monolithic singular benevolent society or even more absurdly, a physical area.

Do you really think that people from other cultures are fully compatible with what are currently considered Western values? How are trans people doing around the world, for the most part? You know, outside of the West."
"I was like 6 years old when Age of Empires came out, granted whilst i did play it, it wasn't exactly my kind of game  My kind of game involved Red Alert 2, Tiberian Sun, Warcraft 3 as well as plenty of non RTS's like Nox, Diablo 2 (lan party with Family) and Ark Fatalis and whilst i didn't get to enjoy Doom at a young age, I did get to enjoy Brutal Doom and learn of a youtuber called ICARUSLIVES who regularly showcases awesome doom mods that put modern 60$ waste of money that companies call video games... To absolute shame. You know... Now i really want to see a video from you where you just do retrospective on the different RTS series that have existed, doesn't have to be in depth, Would be great if you just played them for a bit and had the video structured sort of like Mandalore Gaming type of videos     Also if you do ever play Warcraft 3 (Which has 24 player support, yes that game is still getting updated to this day) I highly recommend you play a map by the name of Canned Bread with at LEAST 8 people  Please don't look up any information about the map, just play Warcraft 3 and get someone who knows how to host and create maps (primarily someone who can use Makemehost.com OR entgaming) The map I'm recommending, really is an example of the charm and how vibrant the Warcraft 3 map making community is."

But really what I'm wondering is why I let myself scroll so far down the comment section. Why do I do this to myself?"

"Right, that's why it's better to replace 'The West' with the term 'civilized' or 'first' world. And in terms of values and laws all of the richest per capita countries gonna have something in similar, such as strong private property rights, healthy regulations, free market economy and in the most of them also free speech. Singapore, South Korea, North America, Western Europe, Japan, Hong Kong - all of those places have it. And such view is not racist at all because its not only white countries who managed to build such social systems. It could be the case that these intertwined social constructs emerged in the West, but then started spreading across the world gradually.  And it's also possible that rejecting them ruins the society to chaos and poverty as it happened in Russia after leftist revolution. So leftist struggle for personal freedoms of self-expression and personal life are perfectly valid, but when they surrender to temptation to redistribute fairly earned wealth it usually ends up with mass murder.  I.e. brother of my great grandmother spend 18 years in Soviet concentration camps just for getting to Nazi's camp as a captive in WWII. And her family lost a farm during the communists' actions called 'collectivization', which is just a mass robbery.   So be careful with the fight against capitalism, dear western friends, revolution can hurt its' authors once again - a lot of moderate leftists were killed or imprisoned by radicals."
"The Protestant Reformation wasn't nearly as revolutionary as you think it was. There are precursors to it that can be seen in the Investiture Controversy and the Western Schism. It also wasn't nearly as society breaking as Feminism or other 'SJW' ideas. The West is set apart from the rest of the world by real divisions, more or less the way that Dicky 'fuck America, let's just do Rome again lol' Spencer defines it (which you admit is pretty much correct.) It's true that the Middle East shares Greek philosophy with us, but that's because of a very long tradition of Hellenism in the Persian Empire and Roman Near East. There's more that divides us than there is that unites us with them, and the same is true of the East, most of Latin America (argentina is black lelelelelelelelelelelel) and Africa. It's more than genetics and religion, I would consider non-Israeli Jews to be western despite not being Christian (for now, God willing,) but I wouldn't consider Brazil a western country despite Christian and much of the south being European."

"WHITE SUPREMACY DOES NOT EXIST.  THE FAR RIGHT IS FIGHTING SUPREMACY! JEWISH SUPREMACY IS REAL.  Ovadia Yosef was the chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel.  He had the largest funeral in Israel's history in which nearly a million Jews were in the streets mourning his loss.  These are his words:  ‚ÄúGoyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world ‚Äì only to serve the People of Israel.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn Israel, death has no dominion over them‚Ä¶ With gentiles, it will be like any person ‚Äì they need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one‚Äôs donkey would die, they‚Äôd lose their money.  ‚ÄúThis is his servant‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap.

"Oswald Spengler has a weird relationship with right wing politics. Spengler used to have high hopes for right wing movements like the Nazis because he thought they represented some high ideals of 'the West', even while 'the West' was declining.   But later, Spengler hated the Nazis once he realized they were vulgar racist demagogues. He had backwards ideas about race, but he thought of race as a cultural and historical thing, not some genetic pseudoscience crap. He loathed Anti-Semitism (and he himself was of Jewish descent, believe it or not).  Hitler, Mussolini, and other fascists thought they were heroic Ubermensch who would stop 'the West's' decline. Spengler disagreed; fascist leaders were part of the decline, as scheduled. Reactionary morons fangasm over Spengler, even though Spengler himself thought reactionaries were ignorant losers."

The genealogy of liberal democracy is the common thread that binds modern Americans to Romans and Greeks.  Also, your just like Jordan Peterson.You both use shticks to get your points across.

"I liked this very much! You've marked the trenches for our forward movement in this episode. However, I think pinpointing that ‚ÄúGender science‚Äù is part of the western legacy will not be enough. We have to make the SJW Reformation into the second cultural revolution, that it is the correct hegemonic label, the more we piss the enemy of the more mistakes he will make. We will force them to make premature fascist  statement that the populist is not ready to accept.   And cudos for Age of Empire now i want to take you out for a drink even more.

"I came here because I heard of Magog being in this. And he is. As a fellow American veteran, he is not just some angry guy that knows nothing of the world, he is a veteran of the US Armed Forces and I proudly call him a brother of that same family. Yes, veterans tend to have a way of doing things that some do not understand, often being dark. That is because many of us have seen some of the worst things of our times and are still alive after. It makes one see the world differently from the rest. I am not saying that if someone is not a veteran, they are not a good person. I am, however, understanding that there are people who have the ability to find something funny with the world while knowing that we live in a horrific place of violence and death as far back as anyone can remember and likely will not change.  As for saying that he is a grown man who dresses up as a wizard, I am not sure WHAT you are. Really, man .... woman ... or some sort of science project that .... really, what are you? At least we know Magog is a man. And what is that stuff you have on you? Glued on insects, glitter, and whatever else ... and you are trying to talk down to someone who dresses in a black robe that plays a character. I can not even say that it is the kettle calling the pot black here as I am unsure if this is human or not.  If this is supposed to be anything but about 20 minutes of wasted time, I do not see it."

"I agree with the video but it must be pointed out that most secular non mathematical and non science works weren't preserved by the Muslim Arabs as they for the most part didn't care for the pagan history and blathering of the heathens they've conquered. The best translations of Aristotle and the Greek philosophers and various historic texts were actually from Nestorian Assyrians (who originally spoke Aramaic prior to the dominance of Islam and Arabic culture), albeit other than the Greek Byzantines who had also tried to preserve what they could in the turmoil of the middle ages.  Ironically enough Christians did harm the preservation of classical culture, in Christianity's nascent years from Constantine to Justinian, the Platonic schools and Stoic academies were closed and even later when papyrus became scarce in the Christian world due to the Islamic hegemony over Egypt, palimpsests were used from ancient texts made of parchment to create religious biblical works ie monks recycled secular works including science and mathematics to churn out bibles, no wonder the Roman technology of cement was forgotten during the dark ages!"

"Great video! Though instead of saying your refuting the concept of the West altogether, you should be more specific and say that you are refuting contemporary political notions of what the West is for us Internet addicts. This is a contentious and complex issue I'm sure even historians have a hard time discussing, simply because of all the sentimentality that is built around the topic. One video where even democracy in the West is slightly, if not barely, mentioned, in my opinion isn't enough to thoroughly go through all of the ideas built around this discussion/debate.  As an art student, and having to read A LOT of fucking history books on art  there is definitely a thread between the civilisations we deem to be western (Egypt being an exception, surely among some others) and the artistic or mimetic approaches to representation of the human form, which undoubtedly reflects a cultural condition, despite culture largely being defined by an elite (still kind of is).  And just because there have been MANY revolutions within Europe, doesn't mean no unifying factors cannot bring these countries together under one label. I mean can you look into Byzantine a bit? The Carolingian Empire? The attempted revival of Roman concepts of law in the Middle Ages, finding some origin within Ancient Greece? The network of philosopher's etc created during the Renaissance? (Renaissance being a term coined by thinkers of that time btw).  I'm sorry, your video is funny (top marks for comedy  bitch I love your performance I'm feeling the gay sweat on my brow when you talk), but you are missing so many things to actually prove your initial point of 'refuting' the concept of the west, which makes me internally scream as I have to spend days reading books on the history of western art (PS western art holds concepts of art that no other culture in the world has, but just because its a cultural construction doesn't mean it holds no inherent intellectual value)."

That's mainly the problem with the refugee crisis as well. They are poor and poorly educated.

"I tend to think of the west as those people who, through geographical advantage, were able to consistently prosper where those in more difficult geographic areas (the Middle East, Africa) were not. The reason Europeans and their descendants think they're the best is because they were dealt the best cards. Through their plentiful resources and relative safety from the wars that result as a lack of these, they happened to be the first to build good boats, and thus were able to sail to other places to tell the people how awesome they were. One particularly heated argument led to the long-term downfall of absolute monarchy, another to the large-scale adoption of free-trade economics. nd then in a dramatic twist, it went from being about who was the best at history and conquering shit, to who had the most boats. And then atom bombs. Each was won through territorial advantage and sheer dumb luck."

The only thing that's gonna get White People, Suspect Racist / White Supremacist to let up, is, we Non-White Groups are gonna have to draw a line in the sand.  In other words, push Racist / White Supremacist to kill us all or do Justice.  Justice, meaning guaranteeing no one is mistreated by guaranteeing the person or persons that need help the most get the most Constructive help.  Unfortunately Yellow People are the perfect Wild card for the 'West' their Imperial and so called Communist past and present has insured they don't play well with others, and the only people with the means to counter them is the so called 'West', who don't play well with others."

"Very weak video, though entertaining as always.  However, I'm not sure how it's possible that you're getting more shallow with every new release. Can you go into actual deeper points instead of covering broad topics at the level of a middle school essay? Like, yeah, I get it, your audience is mostly uncultured SJWs and dumb teens, but at least TRY to put some effort in more than the phenomenal production value. For a person that's so adamant about having read most of the worthwhile things in academia, Contra, you often come across as a total ignoramus.  I won't even get into the specifics of this video many of which are plain wrong. Did you even bother researching that thing about translations for example? Hmmm? Did you? Because if you had, which you did not, you would've realized that Muslims did more to destroy than preserve anything. Most of the writings, after all, had to come from somewhere - the East. The Byzantines. Almost all of the preservation and subsequent translations had been done by Greek-speaking Christians, and the Syrians played a principal part in conveying these things to the 'Muslims.' I hate that term because it's super broad and it ignores the fact that 'Muslims' (see: fucking Arabs) killed off most of the intelligentsia in the Middle-East. As it ignores the fact that all of the 'Muslim' philosophers you mention were largely Persians - others too, but in any case, certainly NOT Arab. The point is that these same people would've likely taken philosophy forward either way, as the Jews continued to do both under Christianity and Islam. The only reason those writings reached us in Arabic is because of the constant Muslim expansion westwards, which eventually brought them to Italy and Spain. A happy accident, and little else. Pretty sure anyone that suffered from Arab conquests would want to rip your fucking throat out for portraying them as heroic men of a renaissance.  And anyway, there's a reason we don't count many of these countries as Western despite some shared heritage. Because they're neither liberal democracies nor lawful, which is basically what Western stands for today. Your map was also idiotic, since Japan is clearly considered Western, even though it's on the other side of the world. The point is, all these countries that we share a heritage with (Azerbaijan, Iran, Egypt, and so on) will become Western the moment they turn their governments around. They're by no means excluded from the club based on some racial prejudice or whatever.   Like I said, terribly weak video. You're becoming lazy and self-indulgent."
"Imagine actually believing the worn out myth that Islamic scholars brought Greek philosophy back to the ‚Äòrustic‚Äô west. History says cease and desist."
"Thanks for that. I disagree with your conclusion in this case, but you always give me something to write about. Majority Traditionalists will look to their individual experience and call for a preservation of these values as a method of reinforcing a culture that they see as being under threat (whether this is true or untrue). While Minorities will fight to have their values become part of mainstream culture, which means fighting for change and acceptance.  Traditionalist's fail by failing to distinguish between something that is actually threatening to their culture and something that is non-threatening. Everything 'different' becomes a perceivable threat that must be eliminated or subdued.  Minorities fail by putting change and acceptance first, above all other considerations. At the extreme end, everything that runs counter to the majority culture must be embraced, as the dominant culture increasingly is seen as the embodiment of evil. This also leads to forced labor camps and subjugation, simply under the guise as stamping out anything associated with the majority.  I agree that we exist in a time similar to reformation in Europe. But I also think that it's similar to world that Confucius taught in. The point is that change can be good, but it can also lead to catastrophe. In my point of view neither the traditional right nor the left offer us a better future.  But there is something else to consider. Historically, when new information technology systems have emerged (like the printing press), these systems have drastically reshaped the way governments and cultures operate. So maybe it's possible that the Left and the right can both be relegated to the annuls of history as something new and more dynamic emerges.  Sorry for grammar - I'm dyslexic."

"This is a really weak attempt at trying to ''deconstruct the west'', and a really bad way of doing history ; that is, using anecdotal evidence and odd cases to dismiss broad strokes and large trends. Few things.  1) The arab translation thing is true in part, but exaggerated. There were, in western Europe, translators of greek to latin (james of venice, boetius, Moerbeke, and the occasional monastory monk). Translations in latin were preffered for obvious reasons, and Aquinas had access to an inventory of greek texts far bigger than any muslim scholar had before him. The knowledge of the greeks was not lost and ''saved'' thanks to the arabs ; it had been, in a large fashion, preserved by the byzantine CHRISTIANS ; which isn't to say that the arabs had no impact, but that it's exaggerated to paint a certain narrative. Even more offensive is the notion of equally shared greek-roman heritage between the arabs and europeans. The heritage is not equally shared in the slightest ; not equally shared in language heritage, or monuments, or genetics, or laws or psychology. Secular laws ; which were not concerned with a person's religion as long as he abided to the authority of the roman state, had a big impact on western christianity and later events (enlightenment thinkers), but not in the middle-east with islam, since it was in contradiction with the principles of sharia. Today, where can one see the greek-roman heritage in the islamic world? The heritage of the greeks and the romans can be easily seen in the west by comparison.

"But I think if you look at the fact that Capitalist imperialism HAPPENED IN THE WEST and has created cultures where, thus far, it has triumphed over all opposition, I think there is a fair argument that there is a fundamentally-western type of culture built on, and standing for, the legacy of capitalist imperialism. Not to say it could not happen again, but I think the more you look, the more any aspect touched by the master morality of imperialism turns to a venomous culture. A culture hostile to anything but itself on its path to eventual self-implosion once its internal contradictions are destabilize it. I don't think we can take this to the extreme that we can say the West cannot free itself until the rest self-liberate, as Maoist Third-Worldism does, but I think there really is SORT OF an evil western hegemonic culture that cannot coexist with truly culturally plural society."

Much like how the Soviet Union was never truly communist, Western culture has never been truly Christian, and it never will be.

"I am an Indian (from India) and can probably provide an outside perspective or the least Western perspective one can get on a Contrapoint's video.  India's perception of the West is mainly informed by the British Raj and as you'd expect, it is not particularly postive. It has changed a bit for the younger generations with the expanse of Anglophone pop culture into India but the older generation's thoughts still pervade over the younger ones.  Of the 5 points mentioned on how the West sees itself, you would get no pushback on 3 points by most Indians.  1. White: People here would even consider Russia and former USSR states to be the West though.  2. Christian: Some may consider y'all as not religious or hypocritical in the way you follow your religions but most would agree the West is Christian.   3. Capitalist: While everyone would agree that the West is capitalist, there would be disagreements on whether that is a good thing. Indians have been criticizing the West on it materialistic behaviour since forever. A lot of socialist criticisms of the West did not come from inside but from colonies who saw the colonists as imperalistic, money hungry and inhumane. There is a John Green video that talks about this as well but I don't remember what it is called.  The 2 that would be the most controversial would be Cultured and Enlightened.  Enlightened: The first issue would be that Enlighitenment means something completely different in Dharmic religions. But that is just semantics, the bigger issue is that a lot of Enlightenment ideals just do not originate in the West or the West were not the only ones to come up with it. A lot would argue that the West claims ownership of values they got from the East and then wiped out the East's contribution from their history. Basically appropriation though a Euro-centric telling of history. For example, a lot of Jains would say 'Anekantavada' is the precursor to the scientific method.   Cultured: This one would be the most controversial amongst Indians. A good percent of the populace probably see the West as uncultured whereas another big chunk probably thinks of the West as the pinnacle of culture. No prizes for guessing what age groups each side generally consist of. Money plays a big aspect in this debate as well. There is a lot of nuance and I can't represent the uncultured groups view well because of how wrong I think they are.   But Indians do think of the West as an entity, even if it is very different from the West's idea about itself. You could probably write an entire library on the individual and collectivist differences of the West and India. Something I know very little about and something I dare not try to write on YouTube. Anyway to finish of this rambling, this is a persepctive of someone that has lived his entire life in India's most 'Westerenized' city, Mumbai. India is extremely diverse at a level very few non-Indians can grasp. Please do not think of this as a good barometer of India's thoughts on the West but probably as a good starting point to learn from a perspective that is not from the West itself.   PS: English is not my first language. Please try to ignore any grammatical, structural and spelling errors. In case you find the mistakes too egregious, please point them out with explainations on how I can correct them going forward."

"The idea of 'the west' and statements like 'we need to defend western values/civilization' are euphemistic, and refer to (contemporary, conservative) white values, civilization, and people. It's not really kosher to say that though because it leaves you open to being painted with boogeyman labels like 'racist' or 'nazi', so right wing political types less honest than Spencer will dogwhistle and nudge and wink at each other while peddling the shit they peddle. 'Western civilization' is an arbitrary idea, but white civilization, that is, civilization born from the ancestors of white people alive today and spread around the world through imperialism, is a very real thing easily differentiated from say, Bantu or Japanese civilization by the sole virtue that it was developed and populated by white people in a largely closed off chunk of the world. It's not wrong to defend it either; there's nothing fundamentally evil about white culture or civilization.  That said certain right wingers (including but not limited to white nationalists like Spencer) try to deny a lot of aspects of white culture (like buttfucking, socialism, altruism, atheism, etc) are really legitimate in order to push views which fundamentally have nothing to do with western civilization and have everything to do with authoritarianism. The fact that my nazi dongle tingles when I see Natalie eat corn dogs is easily passed off as 'cultural neo-marxist jewish media liberal sjw brainwashing' rather than part of the proud history of white people rubbing their penises together. What they're defending isn't white civilization, but a sort of idealized fantasy version of it."

I had always internalized South America as part of 'The West' because it made logical sense, but when you pointed out how it's somehow excluded for no good reason, I realized my interpretation isn't the norm, and it became clear that the 'west' distinction isn't about geography."
"The 1960s marked a hegemonic transition from national to global capitalism, and the concurrent triumph of multiculturalism and anti-racism. The problem was that none of these things were moral or elevations of consciousness. The purpose was to enable capitalism to be more successful in foreign markets.That's why the dominant faction of the elite themselves supported this transition.  So when there's a backlash against all of these things progressives can say that they personally stand for globalism on a moral level, but they have no historical force to back them up. The backlash is not against progressives - it's against the global capitalist faction.  There's thus a profound contradiction, that the only force that progressives can stand with against the Trumps and Spencers of the world are the global capitalist faction that otherwise they, as socialists, oppose.  That's why, in both Europe and the United States, Trump and Spencer DO represent populist sentiment while progressives do not, and why they are capturing popular imaginations while progressives continue to be mostly ignored.  The solution to this for the left is to have a complete break with the global capitalists, to be anti-racist and globalist STRICTLY on a moral level and not to support imperialism."

"GREAT video ... BUT ... your timeline and sources are wrong. 1. Remember, there were no people on the planet organized into groups called, 'Greeks, Romans, nor Jews' until AFTER the 13th Egyptian Dynasty.   2. Ancient Egypt was then called, 'Kemet' ... or 'Land of the Blacks.'  3. The first universities established on the 'European' continent was done so by the Moors ... who were comprised of Arabs and sub-Saharan Africans. It was the more advanced Nile Valley Civilizations that brought civilization and learning to Spain and Europe.  4. It's pure INSANITY to say, 'Euclid of Alexandria was the The Founder of Geometry'... when the Egyptian pryimids were built 5,000 years before he was born!! And where ... pray tell... IS Alexandria??  [ 'Alexandria is a Mediterranean port city in Egypt.' ]  Okaaay. So after the fact, this Greek dude stubles on an 'ancient storied library' and plagiarizes the information as his own?  And the libraries of Timbuktu that the French continue to enjoy destroying ... were where the other library and university of the ancient world stood.   5. And those '10 Comandments'?  Sorry. NOT from Mount Sinai... but rather they are a part of the 42 Ma'at's.  (Google them.)  Listen to Joseph Campbell (a.k.a. 'Old Stop Short') discuss how the Jewish Rabbis (social engineers) changed the Goddess old world theology into the Patriarchal 'God' of Abraham. It almost works... but like he says... 'who wants to suckle at the bosom of Abraham?   6. Zeus and most of the Greek / Roman gods and goddesses were actually AFRICAN gods and goddesses.  (Research them.)  7. This is another problem with Jordan Peterson... he thinks he can simply change a few narratives and erase the collective karma of 'Manifest Destiny' ... and 'The West' can then ... 'have your cake and eat it too' ... without all the messy guilt, shame,  and generational trauma to worry about.  (More insanity... but you have to admit ... Peterson IS quite the pimp.)"

Yes the concepts of East and West are a simplification or reduction of a far more complex reality of history, culture, ethnography, geography or whatever, you can just point to the Caucus region to demonstrate that. But the terms do have instrumental value, in the same way having a legally enshrined age of sexual consent has instrumental value, in spite of the fact that it seems ridiculous that a person can be denied the right to have sex one hour on account of being a child, and a few hours later be considered an adult."

"You're one of my favourite youtubers, and I greatly support critiques of Ben Shapiro, Richard Spencer, Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones, info wars & the right in general, but critiques of Anita Sarkeesian, from what I've seen, are more than valid. She took a lot of money to produce a low budget video series, taking way more time than promised to complete... has she made it half way yet? Anyway, in response, TJ Kirk of Amazing Atheist fame started a charity drive for impoverished women in the developing world. To which some celebrities responded by bolstering her charity drive, not his, to fund her videos. Seems almost anti-feminist. Certainly anti-humanitarian. Thunderf00t & TJ Kirk are on the left. They're in favour of equal treatment of all races, religions, genders & orientations, and they're critical of those who advocate otherwise. Not only that, but they've been critical of right wing policies outside of the social; economic policies which serve to further disenfranchise the poor in order to cut taxes for the rich, and environmental policies which allow corporations to further pollute our water & air. I fully support your social stances, but be mindful of other factors when selecting enemies & allies. I'm sure they too would largely agree with your social & political commentary.

"I don't know if this will reach contrapoints, but I hope others at least learn from this: it's disrespectful to talk about the Jewish god by speaking their name. The name is sacred, and we avoid saying it just as we (and Muslims) avoid depicting our god. If you would refrain from depicting the Muslim god, please don't say the name of ours! We don't even say the name in prayer. Different Jewish people have different practices around this, but generally speaking it's more respectful to talk about 'the Jewish god.'"

"I think what many people of all dispositions forget when it comes to the phrase ‚Äújudeo-Christian‚Äù is that it isn‚Äôt just religious precepts that are being appealed to. The Greco-Roman tradition of philosophy, myth, and tradition was irrevocably altered by first Jewish scholars, and then Christian ones as time went by. The entire vocabulary of virtually every European language is deeply influenced by Jewish and Christian literary trends and concepts. For a very long time, the Bible was basically the only form of literature that most people living in Europe consumed. If language impacts the very ways we think and experience the world (which it does), then to talk about a judeo-Christian basis of western civ is not so much a religious argument but a linguistic and literary one. You can totally reject the truth claims of religion and still fundamentally understand religious idioms, myths, stories, and ways of speaking and thinking. And that‚Äôs why I think it makes a lot of sense to keep the concept alive. People who learned and speak European languages tend to create and live in cultures that in many fundamental ways, understand one another. I reject propaganda and notions of intrinsic superiority, but it is clearly an observable phenomenon that an American and a Spaniard are going to understand one another‚Äôa frame of reference more so than either of them will understand say an East Asian culture. It is less so the case today, but if you translated the story of Abraham and Isaac to an American and a Spaniard, the story would be instantly familiar to both and both would have a similar set of applications for that story. Whereas someone living in China might either not know the story or if they did, have a totally different view of it. We of course have nothing to lose in learning new stories, cultures, and languages, but I do believe there‚Äôs enough of a basis to claim there is such a thing as western culture, or a western tradition, even if it is very broad and contains many conflicting perspectives."

"The West is the Best, ya fucking Weab"
"So, cuz hshe has trouble defining _exactly and precisely_ what is 'West', we should all just pretend West doesn't really exist? What?   Think of the West as a muscle. At some point it stops being muscle and becomes the 'other'  or tendon. There is no _clear boundary_ between the two, true, but the point is called the transitional zone and is named 'Myotendinous junction'. That would be Spain (after the Muslim invasion). Same goes when it comes to tendon and bone. It is called 'Enthesis' - cells which attach tendon to bone.  Yes, the 'West' is not super-clearly defined, but it is not all then just a giant undifferentiated mass of tissue."

"That was beautiful, as always. But I disagree with the idea that there was no distinction between Europeans and Asians in Herodotus. At the very beginning, in Histories 1.4, he states the Persian view of the historical enmity between peoples from the two continents as such:  'Hitherto the injuries on either side had been mere acts of common violence; but in what followed the Persians consider that the Greeks were greatly to blame, since before any attack had been made on Europe, they led an army into Asia. Now as for the carrying off of women, it is the deed, they say, of a rogue: but to make a stir about such as are carried off, argues a man a fool. Men of sense care nothing for such women, since it is plain that without their own consent they would never be forced away. The Asiatics, when the Greeks ran off with their women, never troubled themselves about the matter; but the Greeks, for the sake of a single Lacedaemonian girl, collected a vast armament, invaded Asia, and destroyed the kingdom of Priam. Henceforth they ever looked upon the Greeks as their open enemies. For Asia, with all the various tribes of barbarians that inhabit it, is regarded by the Persians as their own; but Europe and the Greek race they look on as distinct and separate.'  The name 'European' may not be used, but that is mere pedantry."

Something tells me he originally wanted to make a comedy series about an evil warlock but got swept up in the whole reactionary stuff.  I'm actually always weirded out by the talk about the west. I mean, Poland for instance is being seen as part of the west by Americans but ask any European and they'll tell you it's the east. Wich is actually also kinda wrong because Poland is not eastern Europe but central Europe like Germany wich itself is seen as the West but many Germans will still refer to the former GDR as the east and at this point let's just declare Norway to a mediteranian country wich is of course communist even though it's capitalist and a parlamentary monarchy. As you correctly pointed out it's an confusingly narrow and contradicting definition wich doesn't make much sense.  I guess the whole thing could be compared to being a football fan.   You just identify with a particular club, for vague reasons you yourself can barely articulate, whose deeds have been exaggerated by sports commentators to a ridiciulous degree and then you proceed to bash everyone face in when they say anything bad about it.   Same with the whole western identity. You feel some vague attachement to it based on an heavily conflated importance and attack everything and everyone who threatens this notion even in the slightest.

"Latin American here, I agree with your take on why are we not western. Having lived in Europe for a while I can say that there is no fue difference between atleast my country (Argentina) and well some other western country. Every single country here in latam and by that I mean every inhabitant looks up to Europe and tries to emulate it, holding it as a standard to live up for. Every single city is built based upon the Spanish system and as a result looks very familiar, the issue is that the Americas are very rich ethnically and the number of natives or native descendants who still preserve their perennial cultures varies highly and thus it becomes very hard to describe every nation as western to it's full extent but with that logic neither New Zealand, Australia, Africa, Canada and the US would be eligible given their native population. But yeah it's very sad that some people are not aware of how close South America is to the so called West."

"The West is a collective string of progression related to ideals, philosophy, religion, cultural values and so on.  The similarities between the western countries are evident, a civilization of its own, thus Western.

SJW reformation will be a failure should it ever be, it only seeks to derail unity in the ''long run'', it rejects the western sphere: takes the negative narrative and amplifies it to the point it rewrites anything else and thats all it is."

"Contra, oh contra, you're so hot"
"Focusing on the wrong things, that tea setup was  a nightmare... Corndogs,cucumbers, strawberries and cookies that would make me puke."
"In fairness to Peterson. I did once hear him say something along the lines of: 'It isn't obvious to me that these principles can reasonably be described as _Western._ They emerged in the Middle East.'"

"Yup, 'The West' by and large seems to be a dog-whistle reference to 'The Whites'."
"Natalie, I love you more than ever ever ever. Also, I think when right-wing people talk about Western Civ they secretly mean men in cowboy hats. Newts and blindworms, do no wrong/Come not near our fairy queen!"
"This is ridiculous, the West, for practical purposes is European, Latin America is an amalgamation racially and culturally it's distinctly different. Philosopically it's defined by simple values like liberty and individualism. It's not that complicated to figure out what the west from a variety of perspectives. You're being facetious."
"I see your screaming, crusty wizard and raise you a glittery woodland nymph, with her army of butterflies."

"The Glorious golden one... I truly want him as our king here!"
"I wish you wouldn't have used 'Judeo- Christian' or at least recognized that 'Judeo' is entirely added on by Christians who are misinterpreting the entirety of the Tanach. When you say skeptisism of dogma is against 'judeo-christian' ideals, you only mean Christian. One of Judaism's main ideas is questioning and wrestling against G-d so no thanks on the lumping in"

"M U H       W E S T"
"The Proust reference killed me"
"Im just a little bit to drunk to make a fully understandable sentenxe,but if i understood correctly,if you are against the socially constructed idea of the west,because the westnis in itself a multitude of contradicting idrologies,does that mean youre also against the modern PC idea of cultural appropriation?Because that will get you some enemies on the left too.I would love to hear any answer from you,I am a Romanian conservative who loves Jordan Peterson,he is one of my biggest sources of inspiration and helped me in some dark times,but Im alwaya ready to learn more,mosrly because I hate being wrong and I want to know all arguments.I would bang you btw,best of luck."

"I always watch your videos, because my older brother showed me your channel. The end of your video with the corn dogs sums the whole message up, you are a massive windbag of disinformation and all you really care about is shoving corn dogs in your holes. What a waste of 22 minutes and 42 seconds. I've been misled by the gay community for a decade, now i refuse to associate with them. You say a lot of big long words but you know that you are trying to shape the entire world around you because you made the decision to defy God and pretend to be a loose woman, and you say you are helping people? I say you are deceiving people, and if anyone takes your advice, you are hurting them. I will give my life fighting before I see the SJW reformation take hold in our land..."

"What even are corndogs?  Are they like, battered sausages on sticks?"
"Sometimes the lack of self reflection when delivering criticism can be pretty hard to get over. I really don't like climbing mountains to listen to a person speak."
"Who's the evil wizard white guy in the beginning?"
"11:06 What a mindless cheap shot, nothing with Shermer was ever substantiated in the slightest.  There was a lot to like in this video, but it's weird to not jump into epistemology. I think Peterson's defense of empiricism and social science are his strongest points, and consistently get the weakest responses (or are just ignored) from left-wing critics."
"I think you are intelligent and extremely informative as a youtuber but god dammit if sometimes you don't make me want to go buy 3 family sized packs of corndogs, eyelash glue, fake butterflies, and gaint ass fairy wings just to then google some freaky midsummers night dream fanfic."
"Did I just get wololo'd?"
"Part of the alt right's argument is that white and European countries were technologically superior in every shape or form (or kingdoms if you want to prefer the middle ages) in comparison to other places in the world. However that argument falls flat when you look at white kingdoms in the Baltic region and especially Russia which for hundreds of years was not as technologically advanced as other western European countries like France or Italy for example. Also for a time the Ottoman Empire was on par with Western Europe during Suleiman the Magnificent where they developed a strong military with Janissary musketeers and cannon, a developed  economy and legal system. Go watch Extra Credits about this man to see what I mean. Also the argument fails when you stop and consider geography and resource capabilities of the rest of the world such as most of Africa which did not have as much iron ore or bog iron to develop steel or iron weapons and armor during the medieval period leaving them to use only limited amounts of steel or iron weaponry and armor. Another example of a white European nation that was weaker than the others was the Austro Hungarian Empire where they had to rely on Germany for help against Russia during WW1 because their military was weaker and not as advanced. A few decades earlier they lost against the Prussians because again their military was weaker and had low quality weaponry in comparison to the Prussian military. The failure of this argument as a whole is an obvious lack of historical accuracy and the fact that other so called white nations at different times were weaker than their neighbors.

"The people who claim that there is no such thing as the 'west', are usually not very well travelled, or are simply in the cosmopolitain camp of ideology. Sure, 'the west' is not an incredibly accurate term, but it does carry some meaning. Spend some time in Turkey, or Egypt, or Nigeria, or Nepal, or Thailand, and you will very clearly see a difference between 'the west' and the these places. And this is coming from someone who cringes at the judeo-christian value argument just as much as ContraPoints here."
"Natalie is this necessary   yes it absolutely is"
"Holy shit how does someone this unfunny get this much attention"
"I bet MLK, WEB Dubois, Malcom X, Aretha Franklin, and  others don't belong to 'the West' as the Trumps and Peter Jordansons of this world see it .... Funny how someone like MLK wouldn't be one of the best examples of these so-called judeo-christian values that are supposed to make us so good. This shows you what it's really about: the West for them means the usual dominant groups of society that have been oppressing the 'others' for ages. I now believe that something pretty important that this 'Western culture' haven't really found out yet is understanding privilege, what it does and how it works. Then again if you precisely don't want to lose your dominant status in society it's unlikely you'll try to understand it honestly.  This goes for sexism, homophobia, racism, classism, xenophobia, islamophobia, anti semitism, etc..."

"Good video, I've always found it odd how people describe 1st world countries as 'the West' not only because the direction of west is always relevant to your current position and how places like Australia are described as west. I think it is really just a catch all to label countries that are similar in politics, laws, social boundaries and general ethnicities.  And although I personally think Peterson is a relevant and interesting voice when it comes to aspects in our culture like political correctness I have always found his descriptions on 'Western values' and 'post-modern cultural Marxists' lacking.  The latter mostly due to Contra's video on Peterson pointing out how vague and broad Post-modernism is and therefore applying it to describe a very specific kind of thinking is a mute-point."

"The West is nothing more just an excuse to justify white supremacy. Pretty much every conventional category that defines The West has its outliers despite fitting in, but don't because they don't justify the narrative.  There are Christian nations that aren't seen as western: Armenia, Georgia, and Ethiopia.  There are nations with large numbers of pale-skinned populations that aren't seen as western: India, Iran,  Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, Syria, Khazakstan, and Iraq.  There are nations that are defined by Judeo-Christian values that aren't seen as Western: literally the entire Islamic world as well as Latin America.  There are nations that share a heritage and history with Greece and Rome but aren't seen as Western: literally any nation that lies along the Mediterranean Sea.  There are nations that are heavily European in culture, language, and history but aren't seen as Western: again literally all of Latin America and large parts of Africa.  Lastly, there are EUROPEAN nations that at various points in history weren't and aren't seen as Western: Russia, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Lithuania, Albania, Serbia, Hungary, and arguably Turkey.  The West is nothing more than a meta-narrative that white Europeans and their descendants in the developed world tell themselves to give a short-hand, one-sided explanation of contemporary geo-politics for the past couple hundred years. Sure, it exists and it has power, but it's one that has ultimately been oppressive for large swathes of the human race, and that's why it has to change. History is too complicated and nuanced for an us-versus-them narrative and it's one that's ultimately dangerous.   No one is against the culture or history of Europe. No one is against Europeans having an identity based on their different histories and cultures. It's when people prop those up to oppress, exploit, and invade others that it becomes a problem. The reality is that the overlap between whiteness, Europeanness, and westernness is superficial at best."

"The west really is just short for western democratic values.  Which include democracy, secularism and capitalism. Although a European heritage is implied as that is the birthplace for a lot of these ideas and also where they where most brutally faught for. From the french revolution to the world wars.  The west is also somewhat linked to first world nations. As in both allied forces and democratic superpowers.  So yes the west is a somewhat contrived and changing concept and not the most descriptive term at any given time. Espcially because of it's missuse by neo-nazi types to mean 'whuities only'."

"While you are right that Herodotus doesn't see 'West' vs 'East,' you're pretty misleading about it. Herodotus did see a clear difference in culture between the Greeks (he would have used 'Hellene' and Persians and Egyptians/Libyans/whatever else). I know you acknowledge that, but you fail to go on about how there is a clear linear progression in Philosophy and Literature from the Greeks to the Romans to the spread of Christianity.  Yes, a lot of Greek texts were preserved by the Muslims, and then brought over by the Moors of Spain; but you're glossing over two very important details. First, Greek Philosophers were always welcomed in Christianity (at least until you started getting to the Protestant Reformation or the Heresies of the Early Church). This was not the case with Islam. Consider a mainstream Islamic text at the time: Al-Ghazali's 'Incoherence of the Philosophers.' Yes, you had Averroes write the 'Incoherence of Incoherence,' but look at which side won that debate in Islam? Islam eventually adopted a reactionary response to the Greeks (the foundation of the west), and Christianity adopted the Greeks as their own, at least to a large degree.  So while you're right, like any narrative there are going to be myths and tall tales about our origin story, but its really telling that you agree with Richard Spencer on this one. Richard Spencer isn't Western either, he's a fucking Nazi, which is populist reactionary political movement to another anti-Western idea: Communism.  Sorry, you're too stuck in Continental Philosophy. Nothing good ever came out of Germany. Germany was always the place in the West that the Greeks never cultured."

After being poised to win the nomination the DNC literally stole it from him by bribing party delegates and gave it to Truman, who was little known but seemed friendly to the party and big business.

"I have been saying this in response to the whole Alt Right shtick. There is no such thing as Western society in fact the dichotomy that made the most sense historically was the ancient world centered around the land masses closest to the Mediterranean and beyond (persia, iraq, the italian penninsula, greece, carthage or tunisia and libya egypt etc..... and then there was the 'new' world of Europe which was developed long after the primary portions of southern Europe, the levant, and Africa and Asia as well.  What really happened was that the northern European stumbled upon all the knowledge of the ancient world, stole it racialized the knowledge by making it appear as though the ancient greeks, romans,  carthaginians, levantians, and persians were somehow apart of some fictitious people known as Europeans when this is wholly ridiculous because the former group is far more closely related to eachother intellectually and culturally than are they to the white germanic europeans. Western Society is just a term that denotes the transfer of the ancient knowledge of the world northward to the lands of germanic white people.   What is different about what Germanic peoples have done is that they based their superiority on race (perhaps because of their lack of proximity to other ethnic groups) instead of culture the way the romans and greeks did and therein lies the major problem with Petersonite constructions of Western Culture. Thanks as always for making youtube videos. You even inspired me to make some content as a law student i am working on a series that explains the law behind things discussed in the media!!

"I'd contest that the SJW reformation is a discrete thing, I's say its more the realsiation of different aspects of the long struggle between Patriarchal Capitalism and everyone else.  I get the feeling that you're channeling a little Edward Said there too, if so, nice! I heartily approve of this.  Watching this video makes me glad I'm Irish as well, we're sort of part of The West and yet sort of not and very much feel like we're our own thing (the obnoxiousness of a lot of Irish-Americans and the blueshirts in our own ranks notwithstanding).   Also, this video made me laugh several times. Love your work, keep it up darling and if you're ever in Northern Ireland for any reason HMU XO."

"A further note to make about the term Judeo-Christian values is that it assumes a united view of the Torah/'Old Testament' between Jewish people and Christians, which is not true. The relationship between the people and the texts varies wildly between Jews and Christians, both in theory and in practice. Naturally that means the cultures, values and norms are different too. And it's pretty disingenuous of the Right to lump Jews and Christians together when it suits  the argument and then call for Jewish destruction with the next breath"

"One thing to point out, using the Reformation as an example probably doesnt help your points. The Reformation was a period of incredible backwardness in comparison to the Middle Ages, all the horrible shit we think about in Middle Ages are post-Reformation, e.g. the Inquisition, Witch Hunts, and attacking science. I mean Calvinists are basically anti-Monarchist Wahhabists."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leck_mich_im_Arsch nice"
"Thanks for the history lesson Contra but since religious belief is well on the decline in the 'West' it is surely obvious that one of the main concerns we have about these 'others' is the fact that they are or are close to still being theocracies???  Is it not this obnoxious west which you castigate that is trying to have a more compassionate and supportive attitude towards the queer and the transgendered?  And why oh why the need to lump a bunch of different voices in to the 'white' box. Thats almost as obnoxious as the homophobia being pressed back against.  But the historical synopsis was most enjoyable. I give this one a guarded 5 out of 10"

Our conception of whiteness, Europe and The West tends to get fuzzy when you hit the Mediterranean, so it can lead to headway in getting people to think more complexly on the topic."

I think I could have used ~10 more hours of thought"

"There is this idea of that the reason Europe was able to imposed imperialism on the rest of the world was because they were somehow more reasoned and moral but really European nations just had more practice beating up on each other. So when it came to translating those skills to beating up on the rest of the world, Europe ended up being really efficient at that. European nations didn't share the same isolationist mindsets eastern powers like China and Japan turned to. To Europeans boarders weren't really a thing and were just spheres of influence. Extending those spheres of influence to gain resources was kind of way of life, but since that was blood nasty work there was always an excuse to moralize about it."

"'Judaeo-Christian values' is such a disingenuous bullshit phrase.   Cultural interaction between European Christians and Jews has traditionally consisted of systematic social-legal repression and bloody pogroms every couple of years. First they spend a thousand years vacillating between barely tolerating Jews and trying to wipe them out, and now they have the fucking gall to invoke 'Judaeo-Christian values' in their anti-Muslim propaganda."

"Great Video. I fucking LOVE your channel.  By the way, an interesting part of this issue would be the ontological use of 'the destiny of the west' by Martin Hidegger, considering he was one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century, and also a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (a.k.a The Nazis). I never see anyone mention him in regard to this outside of academic philosophy circles. It would show there's a really deep root to this faulty and dangerous ideas, but also that they are a kind of degeneration of some issues really worth discussing."

"I'm sorry Contra, but you do not have any place to take a shot at Magog when your channel's entire schtick is performance art and dressup, which is something I like in both his aesthetic and yours. And he's not the one you wanna be going after as an example of the 'angry white dudes who cry about how the West is being destroyed', there are plenty better examples and you know them. He's just a comedian trying to poke fun at stupid shit he finds from a guise if an intetdimensional wizard shocked by some earthlings' ways of life,  as in 'bitch u live like this?'"
"Here's some information on what the mythical figures known as Gog and Magog, or sometimes Gogmagog and Corineus, are descended from mythical pagan giants and their origins lie in mediaeval legends of the early British Kings. The story goes that Diocletian ‚Äì the Roman Emperor ‚Äì had thirty-three wicked daughters. He managed to find thirty-three husbands to curb their unruly ways, but the daughters were not pleased and under the leadership of their eldest sister Alba they plotted to cut the throats of their husbands as they slept.  For this crime they were set adrift in a boat with half a year's rations, and after a long and dreadful journey they arrived at a great island that came to be named Albion, after the eldest. Here they stayed, and with the assistance of demons they populated the the wild, windswept islands with a race of giants.  Some time later Brutus, the great-grandson of √Üneas, fled the fall of Troy and by way of various scrapes arrived at the same islands. He too named them for himself, so we also know them as Britain. With him he brought his most able warrior and champion, Corineus, who faced the leader of the giant brood in single combat and eventually hurled him from a high rock to his death. The name of the giant was Gogmagog and the rock from which he was thrown became known as Langnagog or 'The Giants Leap'. As a reward Corineus was given the western part of the island, which came to be called Cornwall after him. Brutus travelled to the east and founded the city of New Troy, which we know as London.  The full story can be found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's twelfth century Historia Regum Brittaniae, a largely fanciful history that connects Celtic royalty to the heroic world of the Greek myth by way of the old Welsh legend of King Arthur. The alert reader will have noticed that the fall of Troy was about 2300 years before the reign of Diocletian and that the name Gogmagog is a mangled borrowing from the Old Testament, but these histories were accepted as fact for centuries and will have had real importance to the mediaeval participants in the Mayor's procession.  the info comes from the Lord Mayors Show"
"The Jewish Question.  Okay, I hope I've got your attention.  You've danced around the subject in your videos for a few years now, but I really would love a video with your honest, objective perspective on it.  Please don't misunderstand me.  I have no animosity toward Jewish people or the state of Israel, for the most part.  Rather, I consider it an interesting ethical thought experiment.  How can I fully invest in the plight of Jewish peoples against other, less visible persecutions?  For there to be a state of Israel, must there not be a state of Kurdistan?  If Jewish persons make up of less than 5% of the American population, why is it that the a majority of the sexual assailants brought to light from the #metoo movement are in fact Jewish men?  Again running with that 5% (which is a very liberal estimate),  how do I reconcile my unwavering allegiance to the Occupy movement with the fact that, again, 35% of those in the Forbes 400 are Jewish?  How can we honestly express our love and compassion for all peoples and permit Israel to quarantine Palestinians in Gaza?  What about these shadowy Jewish figures I hear about arming nations at the cusp of World War I?  Why do these figures keep popping up?  Did I go down a scary Youtube rabbit-hole and now Fascist Google is subverting my reality?  Ahh!!!  I am a staunch equal opportunity compassionate...r  Compassioner?  Lover of all peoples.  As a rule I, and most people, don't believe this nonsense nor do we have any desire or itch to believe it.  BUT.  It is inescapable.  And I trust good witches like yourself to drop the house on the bad witches and free us starry eyed cheery but ultimately naive munchkins from this paranoia (is it the algorithms? am I a racist??? Are Ashkenazi Jews actually jews or are they evil vampire Khazars???  AM I A RACIST?!)  Okay.  Natalie if you actually read this, which would be insane considering that you've uploaded this video yesterday and you've already hit 2k comments, good for you babe by the way, I would be absolutely chummed if you addressed this stupid and probably-more-damaging-than-productive issue.  I know you're not up with the kool Capitalism aid but I would patreon the fuck out of you if you did!  I love your channel, by the way.  You haven't even begun to peak.

"Every time somebody says 'Judeo-Christian values', remember the pogroms, the holocaust, the ghetto's, the blaming of the jews for the death of Jesus, the Rhineland massacres and more. Saying Judeo-Christian, rather than Christian, is just a way to be bigoted against unbelievers and muslims that stays away from the whole anti-semitism thing which is thankfully still too toxic for most."

"Individualism and individual liberty are the ideals that 'The West' has tried and often failed to live up to. These basic ideals are what one must adopt to be 'Western'. People see the 'SJW reformation' as an attack on 'The West' because it lends itself to collectivism. Caring too much about racial, sexuality & gender diversity puts too much of a focus on someone's race, sexuality & gender.   Definitions are rarely clean and precise. There are differences between what people recognise as a circle and what the definition of a circle is. That doesn't mean we should amend or throw out the definition."
"also, the idea of monolithic european whiteness is such american horseshit. whiteness in europe is weird and complex and includes peoples being told they're the wrong kind of white, and peoples who have darker skin and are treated as such by white(r) europeans, but are then told by americans that they are white and therefore don't have the right to talk about the skin color based discrimination they face bc european=white.   and don't get me started on how american assumptions about the racial makeup of a country's people have some really destructive consequences on attempts to widen the idea of what national identity LOOKS like in several european countries."

"Do these anti-post modern neo marxists realize that Marx was, you know, born in Germany? Or that the first socialist revolutions happened within Europe? Or that there has never been any socialist middle eastern states? (aside from Turkey for a little bit, but even then the government was a benevolent dictatorship which clashes with socialist values, and that the Ottoman empire, which was ruled by Turks, was considered a part of Europe by the first world war.) Or that christianity came from the middle east in it's entirety? Sometimes the mental gymnastics people go through purely to justify being assholes to others boggles my mind, and even then, why even put in the effort it seems like they were just going to be assholes anyway, so why not just admit it? Maybe they know that they're wrong but are too insecure to admit that what they're doing isn't a righteous crusade against those damned Jews that just want minorities, non-binaries, and women to be treated better, but they're really just insecure little snowflakes, afraid that they won't be on top for much longer and are trying desperately to keep their place at the top of the social hierarchy."

"The 'West is dying' brigade pisses me off.  'I can't practice my culture.' Bullshit! Of course you can. Has anyone banned Shakespeare in the West recently? Can you go to a Beethoven concert without being harassed or endangered? Is selling roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, veg and gravy with a nice glass of beer to go with it still legal? (Have I just made myself hungry?) The answers to those questions are, in order, No, Yes, Yes and Yes.  Most of those alt-reich pricks wouldn't be able to tell Verdi from Monteverdi.   That said, while I love western culture that doesn't mean that other cultures don't also have great traditions. I want to learn about other cultures' traditions, too. Some of those other traditions have been incorporated into Western culture.   Now we get to my biggest complaint. The stand-out features of Western culture at its best are the ideas of individual freedom and liberty, equality and 'the fair go', the idea that people aren't forced to believe in a particular religion, that we don't all have to live in lockstep with each other. This is where the neo-Nazis really anger me: in their vision for the future we'd lose all that. In other words, they bemoan the loss of something that is still around, all while plotting its demise."
"12:04 Although I would  ü·¥è·¥†·¥á to read about the SJW Reformation in the future history text books, do you really think that it will be a comparably (=in comparision to the reformations and revolutions of the past) big step forward to demand that the resources are statistically evenly distributed?

"In the last point you made responding to college professors where you said 'Africans would be just as bad [as whites] if capitalism developed there' kind of highlights my problem with SJWs and your understanding of history.  I actually don't think the European colonial empires of the 15th-19th century were that evil.  Colonialism is a boogeyman for SJWs, and is used to prove how evil whites are.  They did bad things but so did every other empire throughout history.  I believe millenia from now people will look back on the colonial empires as a massive civilizing force, as we look back on the Romans today."

It used to be a liberal song from when Germany was still a bunch of small kingdoms and principalities. Sadly, it has by now gained the notion of superiority through it's use by the Nazis and Neo-Nazis (it also mentions some regions that are no longer part of Germany)"

It's just a stylistic choice for entertainment value.

"Some contra points:   1. Spengler makes a distinction between 'Kultur' and 'Zivilisation'. He would disagree with the term 'western culture' and would rather use the term 'western civilization'. Civilization as he would define it, is the last part of the development of a nation or a 'Volk' or the next step of a Kultur . In his book decline of the west (everyone seems to forget the subtitle: Morphology of worldhistory) he describes a civilization as urban and extremely materialistic. Civilizations decline because they overextend and become to imperialistic, but this decline should be welcomed by the people within this civilization as the crescendo of their collective work.  2. Spengler  makes the case against a eurocentric and rascist(less than his peers I might argue but not quite in the modern term) look on history, he looks more on nations, or what would count as such in these times (e.g. he says greek 'culture' and roman 'civilization').   3. The part that inspired the Nazis: well he was part of the small german 'philosophical' school of Nationaler Sozialismus, this school exists until the great depression, after that they were split into a conservativ/monarchichal and fascist part by others who had taken over their work (Rudolf Jung for example).   Apart from that: This video was extremely good and well made. You could have added that Nietzsche, Kant and Spengler were all ardent admirers of 'foreign philosophers'. As Nietzsche put it: 'Kant was the first european asian philosopher'.( tranlation by me, might be wrong but it¬¥s close enough to it¬¥s original meaning).  Kind regards a bored german with nothing better to do  p.s. please excuse any mistakes this is obviously not my first language"

"Yep, if I recall correctly, the catholic church had forbidden women to be actresses, musicians, singers, etc, so all the female roles were played by men and boys.  I don't know if this helped lead to castratis or not, but that was done too.  In a 60s movie directed by Ken Russell ('The Devils'), it spares nothing to the imagination even with the opening scene, a Medieval play about the birth of Venus.  It was a man playing Venus, the king himself specifically.  Since he was the king, the audience was expected to cry out in awe and praise at how beautiful and remarkable his performance is, but I have digressed."

"I loved this but I think it was light on some of the really important criticisms of the idea of 'the West' ‚Äî there was no explicit mention of Orientalism and its prominence in forming the modern idea of 'the West' and some of the Islamophobia inherent in the idea was kind of glossed over. You also could have gone in deeper on all the problems with the term 'Judeo-Christian' (the way anachronistically glosses over centuries of Christian anti-semitism and basically mostly exists to distinguish the West from Muslims)."
"I still have my Age of Empire games. I, II and IIII."
"The primary ingredient to civilization was the family unit.  Have you ever researched the effects of polygamy on civilizations and why it was banned in almost all of them?  If you consider the elitism of heterosexual female natural selection, you can see how legions of 'unattractive men' have been left behind in droves.. while most women compete for the top 20% of men.  After all is said and done, what you have is women who had their hearts broken repeatedly by high testosterone guys who had no intention of settling down with them, and just using them for sex, and the lower testosterone guys being exploited for resources and having their hearts broken such to the degree that they gave up and basic just sit in their houses depressed and playing video games waiting to die.. or worse.. just flat out committing suicide.  I lost 3 of my friends to suicide.  Marriage used to curb the completely unreasonable elitism at least to the degree that women would actually evaluate a man's intellectual qualities as well as his virtues before entering into a sexual relationship which would cause her to fall in love due to the pair bonding agent Oxytocin.  Anyone who suggests that we go back to traditional marriage though, is just a 'trashy tradcon' now according to the general public, or misogynist, or sexist, or whatever.. but it was good for the child.  The human race has to reproduce in order to continue.. there are natural circumstances surrounding that fact.  This unleashed culture of lust, is actually a form of mild eugenics.  Believe it or not, some people who might be considered 'right wing' are *totally opposed to eugenics!*  The science behind female sexual dimorphism was well explained by Dr. Lisa Wellings in her TED talk titled 'It's not you, it's my hormones'.  https://youtu.be/-LZZJTR0GxE  So.. men who now realize that they don't truly qualify for genuine heterosexual female desire are just giving up.  I wonder what 'civilization' would look like after we have subtracted the science, medical, and engineering contributions of 'unattractive' men from it.  Hetero men are seriously quitting women.  The future of children looks bleak..demographic implosion..etc.."

Late that night, at the hotel bar, you will be enjoying your last drink when you see a flash of yellow out of the corner of your eye. When you look over, there he will be, watching you. He will look around warily at first, but then he will approach and tell you that he may disagree with your morals, but he respects you as a person. He will offer to buy you one last drink. After a short conversation in which he seems strangely reticent to defend the views he espouses in his video, he will lean in and kiss you.   The next morning you will feel a strange mix of satisfaction, disgust and  disappointment. The Golden one will make a series of highly trans- and homophobic videos over the next few months. And we who have subscribed to your channel will all know what *really* happened."

For some reason in the US we view Russia as somehow incredibly different from us when they're not really. I guess one of the factors is the fact  Russia tried to be communist, but even communism comes out of France and Paris had a short period of being a communist state long before Russia did. Karl Marx was German.  A lot of this 'West' bullshit is largely influenced by the Cold War and propaganda."

"Do you think there's a problem with academics constantly wanting to particularize any attempt at a general idea? History will always have conceptual biases.  No conceptual division will ever be generally pure and without contradiction.  All concepts can be attacked as essentializing errors.   I guess I'm saying if I made a topic like this I'd be trying to show how marxism and SJWs grew out of our modern thought and aren't horrifying aberrations rather than critiquing 'The West' as a whole.  Until you have a satisfying conceptual replacement to 'the west' people aren't just going to stop using it and start thinking from a cosmopolitan stand point."

"Great video, of course. As always. I had a conversation with somebody about just this topic yesterday. To a sad extent, the 'West' is just a story we've told ourselves so we can enjoy the fruits of colonialism guilt-free and make sure than any time somebody reminds us of how we got all this wealth we can turn them into enemies and drop bombs on their families. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to seeing what you accomplish when your ambitions outgrow Youtube."
"I found this video very interesting. I always considered 'The West' as nations who adopt enlightenment values, however your point about most people not considering Latin America part of the west brought up a good point. Perhaps it's because one of the core enlightenment values is secularism and Latin America is still overwhelmingly religious? The US probably would not fit this value either were it not for the first ammendment"
"‚ÄúJudeo-Christian values‚Äù has a painful connotation for (us) Jews and is not a term / concept I‚Äôd want to hear continued or perpetuated.  What was coined as a term to acknowledge and show a kind of remorse or awareness or acceptance by Eisenhower-era WASP America long ago turned to a kind of creepy us-against-them evangelical tool to insist on alignment and our usefulness in bringing on Armageddon and Christian rapture.  Beyond creepy: we accept and tie ourselves to you so that we can see you murdered to bring about the messiah. And then there‚Äôs the numbers: Islam has been safer or less oppressive for Jews over the centuries, until recently. If you Contra wish to examine the topic or even read more about it, I‚Äôd be thrilled and suggest the book _Anti-Judaism_ by David Nirenberg as a current work on the topic.  In general, anti-semitism is alive and well in the developed nations including the US, as it was in prosperous 1930s assimilated-Jewish Germany."

"Funny how those who spout 'judeo-Christian values' don't really focus on the 'judeo' part, which can and does have different cultural values and also a lot of them still throw around antisemitic rhetoric."
"I'm a bit ashamed to say this but watching your videos over the past few months has really changed my prejudice towards transgender people for the better. It's silly that I should have ever thought of transgender people as different in any way, it's just that I never met a trans person I related to. Thank you so much for digging me out of a hole in my way of thinking and closing my perceived gaps between other humans a bit more."

"The 'West' is indeed a fundamentally flawed abstraction in it's usefulness, like all cookie cutter narratives. Although I think most people kinda know kinda what we're talking about when we talk about it. It's basically the set of ideological and cultural norms that were prevalent when/which fuelled Europe industrialising, and spread around the world from then. Upon which the post industrial 'western' countries still base a fair amount of their cultural/social/political/economic norms. OBVIOUSLY there's actually a hell of lot of noise in this narrative, which I think Natalie dwells on a little too much, mostly in the name of diluting the narrative, which to be honest is fair enough. Shit's complicated.  But... As a defence, and I'm not overtly conservative myself, you have to give it it's due. It's freakin' great for bagazillions of reasons many cleverer people than me have gone into. But basically, if you give any credence to historical determinism, the world is a fuck tonne of better place now for most people, than it was 300 years ago. Which is mostly down to the 'West'. Other places have had their moments but nowhere's come close to creating it's emergent system of checks and balances and intricate system of rights and capitalism. The bad people still done all kinds of horrific industrialised bad, but the good people done even better, and on a bigger scale.  However, the West still hasn't erased what to do with one of humanities most eternal problems. Our innate propensity to bunch up, create tribes, and blame and ostracise the little guys, whilst feeling at home with our kin. Maybe the 'SJW' movement is nurdling around this problem and creating some solutions, it's a little too early to tell. But just because some people ain't got it perfect yet, doesn't mean we should throw the baby out with the safe, clean drinking water.  It's something to be proud of.  If you feel being proud of stuff you had absolutely nothing to do with creating is something you should feel proud of. Which it isn't."

"'The West?' It amazes me that people are still peddling that snake-oil. How much does Irish culture have in common with Spanish culture? Some elements, but they're not at all the same thing. Swedes look at the world very differently from Italians, and that's not even to mention the outliers in almost every conceptual cultural value - my fellow Americans. How influential was the 'Western European Canon' in Central Europe before Charlemagne? How about the Vikings? Big fans of Herodotus, it turns out...no.  Hell, Northern and Southern ITALY have radically different approaches to 'civilization' and the priorities of living.   Until you can tell me what Switzerland has in common with Alabama, I'm going to call shenanigans on the idea of 'The West.'"

"I think western civilisation subjectively means what is expected when we were younger. It's usualy phrased as the frustration of the denial of expectaions.  We have an awful lot of change in modern times and the inability to pin anything down as stable, causes anxiety for many and protective tendancies to what people know.  Of course, different subjectivities. Different precise values. I am personaly more motivated by the enlightenment values interpretation, as something I wish to defend, but I am aware other people can use different boundries.  I don't know whether it's disingenuous to say the west but to me it's utilised as a concept to resist untested change... and I do go with it, in that context."

Also, I'm sure this is because you come from an academic background, but I love how you do such great research and present like you're speaking to an academic audience and don't use any manipulative tactics to make your points.

"I think the west IS being destroyed. I think the conversation should not be based around the truth of that statement; culture is always being destroyed and rebuilt, molded and bent. The question that EVERYONE should ask is something like  'Are the things that we are dismissing flippantly actually necessary to get rid of, and is our suggested replacement truly better than whatever it is replacing?' And the answer to those may very well be 'yes and yes.' But that's what the discussion should be centered around. Problems that exist, and possible solutions. But both sides always push too far, and are too unwilling to concede any ground.   People on the far right are too damn stubborn to admit 'hey, people are actually fucking starving in the streets, maybe that's indicative of a problem!' And that fucking sucks. Truly. But the response to that has to be tempered, and carefully, until it is as well thought-out as you can make it. You will not cure xenophobia by forcing change onto people. It has to be cured like any other phobia; carefully, gradually, and voluntarily (which ironically enough Peterson has talked about a great deal.) If someone is deathly afraid of elevators, throwing them head first into one will do nothing for them. They will just have a panic attack until the horrifying experience is over. You have to let them voluntarily and incrementally expose themselves to the concept over time.  Same with cultural shift. I understand that there is a time and a place for brute force. There is a place for the Malcolm X's. And there is a place for the MLK Jr.'s. But there isn't enough of the latter anymore. Nobody to stand up and speak with pride and confidence about bridging a gap and fostering understanding. It's just war. It's yelling, or underhanded misrepresentation of the 'others'.  We need someone in the public light to be forthright, honest, and in control. Peterson looked like that to me for a while but he's just too old and embittered at this point. I want the left to be great again. I used to be proud to be a liberal but I feel embarrassed more often than not (though I'd feel equally embarrassed if i was a conservative.)"

"@ContraPoints, I am down with the SJW Reformation being a historical thing... but I hoping the way you guys pitch your ideas gets better so the moment becomes more of a second Enlightenment or  a  'social enlightenment' movement. Also, I like how you said that is there is a FAINT TONE of 'whiteness' rather then out right whiteness. Western values can be appreciated by anyone. Progressive ones anyhow. Thats how I think the SJW Reformation can get more cuckserivates to listen to them. 'Being tolerate, understanding, and embracing diversity is a Western thing'...."

"Many people in the 'East' have also enforced the same dichotomy between the East and West. Saudi Arabia now wants to become the leader of the Muslim world. It's all just nonsense. There was an interesting article about how the Muslim world was invented. It basically claims that there is no such as the Muslim world.   https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2017-06-02/how-muslim-world-was-invented   There was also another article in The Atlantic about the same issue.   https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/the-muslim-world-is-a-place-that-does-not-exist/527550/  The Islamic view of the world is very simple. There are only three types of people: Muslims, Christians and Jews, and disbelievers or polytheists. Each group has a different set of rights and duties. The last group isn't really recognized that much and is to be fought in some cases. I am not really an expert in Islam, so don't take my word for it. I am also not sure why I am writing about this, but I feel like it's important because it explains why even the so-called Muslim World tries to enforce the same concept. This also explains why many people embraced this binary between the East and the West.  Japan also has its own unique separation of Japanese and non-Japanese people. They enforce the same ideas about how Japan is very different and unique from other countries because it's an isolated island. Some Japanese people see foreigners as dirty and uncivilized. Some Japanese authors have established an entire field or discipline that deals with Japaneseness or nihonjinron. It's the study of how distinct Japanese people are from others. It went through a lot of different stages. You can read about it here:  http://sociology.iresearchnet.com/sociology-of-race/nihonjinron/   I'd really appreciate further input about this issue from different angles. Please feel free to comment about how certain groups try to separate themselves from others. Judaism is an interesting one especially when it comes to exceptionalism and distinctiveness from non-Jews. This seems to be a very hot topic within the Nazi community -- I can't believe I'm saying this in 2018 or the 'current year.' I really don't."

'Germany, Germany above all, above everything in the world, How it constantly stands together to spite and protect. From the river Meuse to the river Memel, from the river Etsch to the Belt. Germany, Germany above all, above everything in the world.'  It's about One Germany with Gerans unified, protecting  each other instead of fighting amongst themselves all the time, in these geographical borders (the geographical borders are very *problematic* today which is the main reason why that verse of the song is not part of today's German national anthem). It was written during the pre-March, leading up to a civic revolution aiming to unify Germany into a democratic republic. It's about unity being superiour to stratification, hence the call back to unity in the third verse, the current day German anthem, 'Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit' ('Unity and law and liberty'). It is *not* about Germans or the West even being superiour to anybody else.  Sorry for ranting, but this is something a lot of people get wrong and it really rubs me the wrong way. There are good reasons this song part of the song is not part of the national anthem. But those reasons are entirely different ones."

"I really enjoyed this video but I think you're doing a huge disservice to your audience if you don't t least mention the Clash of Cultures theory and it's huge influence-- which reposits a fundamental conflict between 'the west' and 'Islam.'  It has been hugely influential in the modern neo-con movement, and directly references by Trump and others.  So part of how people are defining 'the West' is through it's 'opposition to Islam.'  Or if you're discussing anti-communism, please mention the fights the US wrought in South America, which are so often ignored, but contextualize both the chaos in some central american countries today and America's hatred of them.  I also wish you'd at least mentioned how the term Judeo-Christian values only includes Jews as a modern hand wave 'tolerance' and  middle finger to Islam.  After a thousand years of pograms, most Jews want nothing to do with this historical revisionist idea that Christianity is more closely related to Judaism then either is to Islam.  Finally, you look like a beautiful forest goddess and everyone is eating you up."
"The real reason for 'the decline of the West' is the decision of Western capitalists to shift production from the old centers of capitalism (Europe, North American, Japan) to the emerging centers of capitalism (China, India, Brazil etc.) without any regards to the thousands of people who are now left without work, or the towns/cities/regions that are now without industry and have been left to crumble and rot. I don't think you can pass by places like Detroit or Camden, NJ without getting a feeling of a civilization in decay, especially when contrasted to the rise of places like Shanghai or Shenzhen. The problem we're facing is that the blame for this decay is being directed at scapegoats (Immigrants, migrants, refugees, Muslims, Jews, 'degeneracy', LGBT, feminism, 'post-modern neomarxism', etc) rather than where it belongs, the capitalist class of America and Europe."

"but gender bending , intoxication and ' general divergent behaviour' isnt manifesting  in the same way as it has done in the past.  Its not perceived the same way  in hegemonic culture as in the past both recent and distant.  culture changes , western culture and society has changed and will change. But it just depends on what you value, complaining the west is being destroyed by cucks, sodomy etc is a really extreme and absolutist statement and opinion to express. And one which is easily shot down and exposed by someone like you. But there are down river short term and long term effects of ALL behavior and attitudes, expressed and held that effect society and culture. I will tell you one thing the west is in far more danger of being 'destroyed' (or rather changed in a negative way in this whole context) by climate change then liberal attitudes to intoxication and sexuality for instance. That is not to say that there are no negative aspects to liberal attitudes. Many people i have known and talked to  have become TOO intoxicated. One has on multiple occasions committed really unpleasant sex acts in fits of undeniably disturbing but none the less still taboo to 'express a disliking of'  homosexual urges. And how many times have emasculated push over men failed to act with confidence and bravery and strength both physical and mental and PROTECTED what ever they value. because that's  whats  attracting  ridicule towards the 'cucks' or rather push over,  socially weird, weak man boys in the west. They couldnt protect what they value.  If hypothetically all the 1st 2nd 3rd etc young muslim men in europe where 'cucks'  do you think the right would be so concerned with the islamification of europe? no they wouldnt because these modern man  boys dont value culture and tradition they reject it. They are not interested in women, and even if they are they are so socially awkward and timid nothing rarely happens. They are not religious , they're probably mostly cool atheists.  Its not their fault They didnt ask to be born into a resource rich environment to live in where their evolutionary psychology kicks in and tells them anything goes and its all cool and fuck everything previously thats happened and its all racist and trans phobic. You cant fix  the world, you cant fix your culture. But you can accept it and cherish it and know its strength and value.  Your argument says 'the west is not being destroyed because you cant define the west, and because the west includes things from all over, and even if it is changing it could be the new renaissance'.   well i disagree, i think the local and international culture has gone under major changes in the past century  and even more in the past few decades, has it all been for the bad of course not. But does the archetypal past have value? well I feel the weight of ages on my shoulders at the local medieval church where i live in the south of england.  And I reflect on the value and feeling of belonging I get from the traditional  community and way of life."

If I was a white person, I'd be their dream come true, but since I'm Black it's just more evidence that they're doomed.   The goal of white identity politics like this is to ensure a future of white people, to ensure the survival of a single phenotypic trait. But other groups have never been about that. Black identity politics has been about making sure that whatever Black people there /are/ have quality lives and equity in society, not about their potential to have a certain skin color or like a certain kind of art or whatever the fuck.   Honestly, Contra, I'm glad you're out here doing real identity work for white people. Cleanin up yall's name lol. I know white people don't want to go down in history the way they're going now.

"I've been wondering lately why Mexico and the rest of Latin and South America isn't considered 'the West' given that they are largely Christian, speak a European language and have an awful lot more in common with U.S. culture than they do with say, Polish or Chinese culture.  And really, given the heavily masculine/macho culture in many Spanish-speaking countries, it's surprising these alt-right dudebros don't like them more."

"11:48 you yourself have described many of those people as 'junk food feminists'  (video titled - Pop Feminism) in the past, people doing far more harm than good in social justice land,  but now we are supposed to take them seriously as revolutionaries or something ?  no. no. no. I hope you were joking there and I just failed to pick up on the sarcasm, but if not....    I have seen many people falling into this trap lately.  We see the low hanging fruit that anti-sjws and Peterson are picking and the ridiculous claims they make about how said fruit is representative of the left and how it will destroy western culture....  but instead of just pointing out how they are wrong,  we look for ways to defend that rotten fruit, but that fruit hangs low for a good reason.    This might be tempting, but I urge you to stay in the sweet spot, keep the problems of feminism and social justice in mind while battling daddy and the neck beards. hey, that a good name for a band, Daddy and neck beards."
"F*ck. 5 and half minutes into this video I spilt my tea everywhere (during the scene where Nat is stirring* tea as well). My virgin experience of this video has been ruined. Cast me out.

"The problem that I see with most people that use the term 'the West' is that they simply don't know history.   Much of the philosophies that became cornerstones of 'Western civilization' were bitter enemies in the past. If it weren't for the (very bloody) liberal revolutions of the 17th-19th centuries most of Europe would be monarchies - hell, Europe hadn't become synonymous with democracy until WW1.   The Hungarians and Bulgars have their origins somewhere in the central Asian steppe and only Christianized in the mid-Middle Ages. If they are considered proper Europeans then what of the other people of the western part of central Asia? The whole race thing gets messy really quickly.   It's interesting to me how Peterson and his fans generally don't talk about the early Christian schisms, the Catholic-Orthodox split, or the Protestant Reformation. The idea of nation-states and secular governments took off after the Thirty Years War - a war that kicked off because of religious tensions and got so bad that Europe collectively decided 'never again'. The Middle East, on the other hand, was still recovering from the Mongol-Black Death-Timurid tripple tap, and was loosing out on trade because the Europeans discovered the new world and how to get around Africa; which caused a slow and stedy decline of the Central Asian states.  Of course, knowing that stuff requires actual reading of texts that don't have anything to do with their pet ideology.  P.S: The idea that China has a singular unbroken history is also garbage."

"This is the perfect fusion between old Contra (weird reference to the Golden One, half-naked body presented in a liberated and funny way, weird sexy symbolism, comments about confused arousal in the comment section) and new Contra (dramatic lighting, really beautiful make-up, good editing, video essay divided by chapters).

"When 'The West' is brought up without a shred of irony or introspection, indeed my first thought is of White Supremacy... and if White Supremacists do indeed represent 'The West,' then you bet your ass we need a new metric for 'The Best And Brightest The Planet Earth Has To Offer From Its Dominant Species, The Human Being.'  Because what IS modern White Supremacy? ...Dorks in menswear-cosplay and mincing, flamboyant weirdos who think the world is ending because people resembling whatever sad, pathetic creature what stares back at them in the mirror now own slightly LESS of it. And that's just plain STUPID... because human beings are human beings. Among all races and cultures, there are idiots and geniuses. Criminals and philanthropists. Patrons of the arts and crude, boorish hooligans. The even-keeled and the hair-on-fire insane. The warrior-poet and the murderous sociopath.  Because the further back you dig, the more you realize we're all eternally dipping into the same soup. If only that realization brought us closer together... instead of, ya know, that OTHER thing."

"The history of Europe and it's colonies is a fascinating case study of humanity's ability to adapt, innovate, and overcome adversity while making all the same mistakes as always. Like, our ancestors got to a point where they could defy the authority of the church, had established a framework for creating meaningful knowledge about the world, and had more or less nailed down the mechanism which had created humanity in the first place, and and almost immediately some people wanted to use it to breed away poor people. We circumnavigated the globe, allowing us to find whole new civilisations to subjugate. We split the atom and used it to make a bomb. We sent men to the fucking moon more or less to show we could. We invented a system to both passively and actively share data between thinking machines and filled it with pornography and dank memes."
"Just a quick note: I know it's the commonly used phrase but 'refugee crisis' makes it sound as if people are a crisis.   I first heard the word 'Fl√ºchtlingsversorgungskrise' in an interview with Gerald Knaus, head of the German think tank that devised EU-Turkey deal. It roughly translates to 'refugee care crisis' which I think describes the issue a lot better.   Great video nonetheless, I was looking forward to this and I was not disappointed. I'd totally watch a full performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream played entirely by you. Also Wololo. I too play(ed) too much Age of Empires."

"I've always tried to find words to describe the concepts I'm talking about that make sense whenever one of the many topics for which the nebulous concept of 'the west' is typically used, conversationally‚Äîwhich is often a label that has next to nothing to do with Europe.    If we're talking about Democracy, Mauritius, Malta, Uruguay, and South Korea (yes‚Äîthe same South Korea that recently ousted a corrupt president) all have a higher democracy index than the US, right now, and people in Botswana are living _very substantially more democratically_ than people trapped in The Kremlin's sphere of influence. It ain't Europe‚Äîit's accidents of history.  The idea that enlightenment values are often conflated with christianity is tacky religious apologia; with whiteness, racism; with even geography and shared history, a label without even the slightest precision.   Though I'd still refrain from referring to Islam or Muslims as preserving the Ancient Greek philosophy, in the same way I'd refrain from characterizing the Enlightenment as Christian or the Sophists and Philosophers as Pagan."

"On the serious note, when you adopt non-essetentialist ontology, all you end up doing is translating a sentence  >'People like Trump and Peterson consider themselves to be the defenders of West'  to  >'People like Trump and Peterson consider themselves to be the defenders of a specific set of values and narratives that they and their supporters associate with with 'being such who belongs to Western culture' and with which they identify themselves personally and in terms of intellectual preferences.'   The answer to this is like: umh, okay. Yep, this is exactly what they are doing, and they know it. They both are aware that there is another way to look at North Atlantic history, and they promoting their own perspective as a better one in terms of potential outcomes. This is what MAGA literally mean from axiological perspective. Now what?"
"first off: set design and costuming queen üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüõ∏üíñ second off: i agree that the western pretense is deeply entrenched in academia and only encouraging america's ethnocentrism. i am a humanities major in college, and my program is extremely 'western' centric. many classes are dedicated to classic studies yet there is only ONE CLASS that covers ALL of asian humanities. ive heard that the philosophy program is just as diversity-barren in study and thought, and philosophy is the last thing you want to be that way. abolition of western fantasy and self-obsession should improve future post-secondary education, yet universities often have the pretense of being in the forefront of reformations. people study 'the west' and they think they have it all figured out. i hope that this new wave of enlightenment pierces deeper than just our politics."
"Today just got better."
"Stupid video.   You could make the same argument for getting rid of the term 'leftist', because it can also be contradictory, because it can mean something different to different people.  The term 'The West' is used, because western countries have the most in common with other western countries and it is a lot faster than saying 'Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, Australia, ............'"
"I can't wait to see how many triggered alt right snowflakes show up to cry."
"sodomy in europe??? *gaasp* well i never!!!"
"While the nebulous definition of 'the west' employed by fascists, like Mussolini, are inherently flawed, I believe most people would instead say thay 'the west' is the true lineage of greek philosophy and the roman political system. If you go to Istanbul, the last city of the Roman empire, you can see the remnants of european 'western' culture, but all that remains now, after 500 years of Islamic rule, is Asiatic. Its not a matter of skin color, or race, or any other simple trait, but rather fundenmental idea, and its the same reason why Japan, for all its western influences, is still so clean. Because a true western city looks like a shithole. Core to our beliefs: ('its none of your business') is the liberal principle, and the fascists embody a twisted ideal of 'western culture' inspired by it. As Zizek says, 'you can draw a line from Plato to Nato', and one can see it in the apology, wherein Socrates was killed simply for speaking his mind, that the western principle was engendered, and it still persists today."

First, I think sparkles and butterflies are your thing. that or the hormones are starting to really kick in. either way I think you looked really pretty in this.  second, I love that you are challenging this idea of a continuous western civilization. Herodotus is a good example. so is Marcus Aurelius who encouraged people to feel at home anywhere. plus, there are a handful of African catholic figureheads and I'm sure modern ones as well.  third, I'm glad you looked at the other side and pointed out that it isnt just bad to put the west on a pedestal but it's also bad to constantly bash it. it gives the idea too much power.  I think people really like stories and things that make them feel good. I sympathize but I think we have to decide on our own meaning for life and be as kind as we can towards others. cause while we may not all be in it together we all do have to deal with each other and it would be great if we didnt act like little shits. that is my highly sophisticated 'philosophy'. lol  I enjoy these irreverent videos that still manage to make a few food points and highlight current events."

"Time for some incredible deconstruction that you'd never dare attempt on a non European people. The bizarre thing is you actually are smart and understand these issues more than most. We just have different solutions. I like how you compare migrants WANTING to come to western countries and nazis keeping previous citizens in concentration camps. And wanting to keep your country, that your ancestors built, fought and died for, means you really just want to exterminate every non white. You would never accuse a non white person or country of this. You desperately have to portray whites as somehow uniquely evil. You can find actual brutality, intolerance and oppression in almost every third world country.  If white people are so terrible, why do millions of non whites risk their lives to try and get in our countries? They love the societies we create, but condemn the people who created them as evil. How about they build their own successful countries, problem solved. But deep down im sure even you know the truth. Many of these groups of people are simply incapable of building a country that isn't crime and poverty ridden. And I'm sure you'll say 'it's all white people's fault Africa is a shithole.' Then why does our oppression not hold down east Asians?"

"The left is known for reforming while others (usually people the system favors- white abled cis men,) accuse us of complaining over nothing (because for them, there IS no 'problem.') However, the left doesn't always come up with the best or most effective solutions to the problem. When we do, we end up making it more dogmatic than nuanced (saying you 'guys' is promotes sexism, preferring one set of genitals over another is homophobic, etc.) And because we feel like we have the correct answer, we try and force the masses to follow our dogma. If they don't, we shame them. We get mad when someone doesn't understand what we believe to be 'common sense.' When in reality, these things take time. Even if we have the right answer, we can't force people to think or behave a certain way. Even though I know God doesn't exist, I am not going to take away the right TO believe in God. I am not going to shame or fire someone for believing in God. And we shouldn't shame people for questioning, not understanding, etc.  Have you seen what happened to Bret Weinstein at Evergreen college? He is extremely smart, and although not always correct, he is a very reasonable guy. He was protested off of campus for not endorsing an equity policy because he didn't think it would do what it set out to do. Students accused him of being racist, he tried having a conversation with the protestors who just yelled in his face and got him to resign. Is this something we should be concerned about? I feel like we need another enlightenment period as well as a reformation. We need to reform based on fact and reason, and I don't think we are doing that right now."

"The West doesn't oppress women or people of color. Your group of progressives is casing problems.  The biggest problem it is causing is the Neo Marxism.    The West in Tales a few things, Christian values is one of those. The West was also influonesed by  the Roman Empire, Catholicism, and later protestantism. There are also other great philosophers during this time who influenced all of Europe.    Race doesn't really play into it. Nor do most people say it does.  The West has made the greatest number of advancements in human history. Weather be philosophy, mathematics, or science.  The West was the first to make slavery illegal. The West was the first to offer more Liberty to people.  the West has improved the lives of everyone around the world."

"Hi, I am among other things an historian, and I have to take issue with what you are describing starting around 12:00 as the series of reformations.  The 1517 Protestant reformation is massively misunderstood in modern times, as a 'progressive' movement, it was exactly the opposite, it was a regressive movement, an attempt to roll back all of the positive changes the Catholic church had made over the previous 1200 years, in order for what was essentially a doomsday cult, to succeed and thrive in the real world.  Otherwise you are spot on, and making excellent points... although I guess one could say Jordan Peterson and others of that vein, are attempting to engage in reformation."
"The phrase ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian‚Äù values is also almost always used by Christians and not Jews. The phrase implies a longevity and unison between the religions that really doesn‚Äôt exist today and hasn‚Äôt existed for centuries, probably trying to give the concept more ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù by extending its reach a few thousand years. The people who use this phrase rarely give a fuck about Jews and would be glad to stop using us as props when convenient."

We just joined the allies because the axis sank some brazilian ships in the Athlantic. Well, Supposedly, because the USA did everything possible to convence Brazil to go to war. The Disney's Character 'Ze Carioca' is an example of how  desperately USA wanted us to go to war by its side.  So basicly, the USA had no problem at all when a country ruled by a protofascist dictator named Getulio Vargas joined the allies.  Brazil even sent a communist Jewish militant (Olga Benario) to the nazis. So 'free world' my balls!"

"This is kind of a side note, but I would say another big problem with the term 'Judeo-Christian values' is that it's not really a thing. Like Judaism and Christianity have very different values. In fact, I would argue that Judaism is no more similar to Christianity than Islam is. I mean I guess Judaism and Christianity share the same ten commandments, but other than that, pretty different religions. Like I've heard people say things like 'the Judeo-Christian concept of Hell,' which, if you know anything about Jewish thought, you know that's like, not a thing. A lot of the time, when people say Judeo-Christian, they really just mean Christian, and I don't understand why they don't just say Christian."

"Thanks for sharing your down to earth ideas about the linear way history is thought and understood.

I get this, but we should also see its downsides and realize that we can do things better, by thinking just a bit more."

"Entertaining & excellent production, as always.  You're wrong to attach the West to white supremacy (skin colour is not factor in assuming a Western mindset & culture, white children must be taught it as any other would) & wrong to say the West is not culturally superior to most others (you can browse news stories from many places to confirm this). I do at least commend you for not going down the ludicrous road of calling the West uniquely evil, I do reject the statement that capitalism had anything to do with imperialism and conquest (the only thing which has ever restricted human conquest anywhere on earth has been capability, not economic system).  There is a reasonable 'red scare,' as you put it, because (for some reason, damned if I know) it does appear to be exclusively leftists who wish to denegrate or wipe out the concept of the West entirely (which was your own argument here). I would suggest you use caution when trying to destroy a concept our society may need, a society you thrive in and has protected your family for hundreds of years. Be grateful, you don't need to be proud but you should be grateful, for the West. It will be a tragic day when it is gone.  Enjoyed the video though!"

"The difference between the enlightenment and other revolutions towards liberation and equality under the law and social justice is that we do have equality under the law now. Modern social justice is fighting against social issues, that in my opinion, don‚Äôt exist. As for Judeo-Christian values, I agree with most of what you said. The church was a pretty toxic institution that exploited and stole, and oppressed a lot of thinkers and ideas in general, even though they did preserve most of the ancient Greco-Roman works. Now, it is true that there was no concept of ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù back thousands of years ago, but there were still different groups and states that had different values and forms of governance. The people in Greece weren‚Äôt the same as the people in the Middle East, and they did not evolve to become muslims, as much as the Middle East did. They were first conquered by romans, then Christianity started taking power, and eventually when the Western Empire fell the Catholic Church took even more power and guided the Germanic tribes into a feudal system. In the east it took another thousand years for the Eastern Roman Empire to fall, but when it did it was basically a power battle between the church and small states and municipalities that impeded the creation of large powerful states. In the west, due to better agriculture and other factors, the people started getting interested in politics and liberation, especially in Britain, then came the renaissance, and more liberal policies came along with parliaments, and enlightenment philosophers started proposing new and progressive ideas, especially in the small states that didn‚Äôt have big oppressive governments. So what that basic history that everyone should know explains is the differences between the west, the Middle East, and Asia- they had different origins and evolved into different cultures with different values, governments, religions, and etc. Also, on the fact that middle easterners saved Greek and Roman literature, that is true, but it was for their own interest, and let‚Äôs not forget who the people who actually created them were. And lastly, even if you were right about the history, it wouldn‚Äôt matter, there obviously is differences in the cultures of today. You‚Äôre average middle eastern isn‚Äôt compatible in your average western country, that‚Äôs why 80% of the migrants in Europe are still unemployed and rape gangs have attacked thousands of British girls. Of course, these are generalizations, but I think it‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous claim that Islam is compatible with western society, especially when it was basically founded to conquer the West. Protecting borders is not equivalent to the horrors committed in Islamic countries that don‚Äôt even have basic rights and equality under the law."

"You, ma'am, are a legend"
"It's also important to point out that, though the concept of Christendom emerged in opposition to Islam, the idea of Christendom was thoroughly not exclusively white until many centuries later. You see this in the image of the Three Wisemen, at least one of whom is almost always depicted as a man of colour if not two or all of them, which represented what many Medieval people would have seen as the three arms of Christianity, Europe, 'Asia' (Byzantium), and Africa. Ethiopian Christianity is just as old as the Bible itself and many people in the Middle Ages would have seen them as like them due to their religion and many probably wouldn't have cared about the darker skin colour. It's only in relatively recent times when the idea of Christianity and Christendom became a white concept."

"I deeply appreciate and agree with most of your historical analysis. However, I disagree with your characterization of modern events simply because it ignores the statistical realities that are manifest in other cultures. The violence in Latin America is staggering. The ideological dogma in the middle east would see you thrown from a building. Finally, the immigrant concentration camps which you suggest are wildly different from those that existed in the 1940's. The chief difference being that the events of the 20th century were those of democide wherein a government rounds up and kills its own citizens. The events now are nations stating clearly 'DO NOT CROSS OUR BORDERS OR YOU WILL FACE PROSECUTION.' Then, upon crossing, people are detained to await due process, a western right. Please, don't conflate the temporary detentions necessary for the protection of sovereignty with the atrocity of the genocide of one's own people. It diminishes the brilliance of your historical analysis, as well as demeans the lives lost in the atrocities of the 20th century. You are brilliant though, keep up the content."

"One comment on 'Supremacist Rhetoric' ( 13:40 ) The 'Lied der Deutschen' has (originally) nothing to do with european imperialism. It comes from a time, when there was no Germany as such and is trying to invoke the idea of a united German state above the many different states ('Vielstaaterei') there were at the time. Hence 'Germany above all'. It doesn't say Germany above all other foreign or 'savage' cultures. It was later appropriated by the Nazis and has acquired different associations since then (you might say, it has a different mouthfeel by now ;) ). I don't thik it really is a case of 'sweeping supremacist rhetoric under the rug'. There are still many misconceptions about the song even amongst Germans. For example, many Germans think, that it's actually against the law to sing the first two stanzas. They just aren't part of the national anthem any more, but you can still sing them till you are blue in the face. You might just get a lot of strange looks..."

"Just for the folks who don't get what 'essentialist' means, basically there are two theories of abstract categories like 'nation' and 'goodness'. Essentialism states that these categories are based on metaphysical constants outside of human observation and independent of physical material, while Nominalism states that these categories are derived through the similarity of physical entities and their discrete properties, and are thus dependent upon them. Under nominalism, notions like 'The West' are periodically scrapped as the current properties of the physical entities that once defined them change. Essentialism holds that such variation is at most temporary degeneracy, and that a single 'spirit' guides material over the course of history. 'The West' is one of these undead, metaphysical constants, and like others of its kind (here's looking at you, deities) not probabilistically worth consideration. Ironically enough, Aristotle was a proponent of Nominalism."

The idea of 'The West' as a thing that exists is so ingrained that it has become intuitive. You fight through that well. I do have a couple of critiques. I've never been nuts about the term 'Judeo-christian'  Jews and Christians have profoundly different relationships with the source text, with oppression and social status, and with Christendom and the so-called west. It's term that tries to grant Christians a degree of historical pedigree they most certainly do not have, and implicitly blames Jews for the wrecking ball of Christian supremacy. I refuse to be blamed for the Catholics, no matter what they say. Pfft. I'm also not...nuts? about the 'yaweh' crack? I'm going to assume you're not Jewish, forgive me if I'm wrong. Setting aside that's most definitely not how you pronounce that particular Hebrew name for G-d, and it's annoying how often gentiles fuck that up, it's...upsetting. Upsetting because, again, it lays the blame at Jews' feet more than is fair. Upsetting because it's another in a long line of gentiles misunderstanding and then misrepresenting Jewish texts. Upsetting because you're not supposed to say that name aloud. It feels shitty to hear that from a woman whose work I think is so great. Jewish traditions and prayers and words and names and faces and struggles are often the punchline. We're the joke. And it really, really sucks."

"Three thoughts: 1) Amazing video as always. Contra is one of the few youtubers who can talk about the views of the right, far right, alt right, whatever-the-fuck-they-are-calling-themselves without crushing my soul and making me hate humanity, 2) I really need to stop watching your videos at work. They're going to get me in trouble one day, 3) I definitely played a lot of Age of Empires in 1999, just thought I would throw that out there"

"As a fun side-remark: I have once been told by a historian that Martel's 'Holding off of the Moors' is not really uncontroversial. According to the French texts, which we of course read as gospel for centuries, that's what happened. According to the Ummayad texts, which western academia began to take seriously more recently, the French stopped one or two scouting parties who were on their way back from discovering that France was a complete dump and not worth conquering. So much for the glorious western civilisation."

"the music is so great ! with the picture that's perfect thank you"
"Would I be considered a traitor or heretic for being a Christian who hates Western Supremacy? Even I can't stand these so called 'Judeo-Christian values' that the West stands for, mainly because they distorted it into something hypocritical, holier-than-thou, self-righteous, and tyrannical."

"I just realized, why aren't Central and South America ever included in 'The West'? They were colonized by Iberia, and still heavily carry those influences forward. Christian, speaking Iberian languages, etc. Why is Iberia a part of 'the West' but her ex-colonies aren't? EDIT: Okay, I made this question at the beginning of the video. Just got to the part where you brought it up XD"
"I feel like the end threw major shade at a composer I don't know then discussed Threesomes with at least two men...and a mid-summer's night dream?  I'm confused, but I almost feel proud that I got that far."

"Excellent work as ever. Really superb.  Unfortunately the 'Western Civilization!!1' trope isn't limited to the traditional Right. The so-called classical liberals and admirers of capital p Progress also fall back on it:  In a curious way, Steven Pinker, Sam Harris, Matt Ridley, Richard Dawkins and the other latter-day ‚ÄúEnlighteners‚Äù show the truth of Hume‚Äôs maxim: reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions. In each of these cases, rationality is always subservient to an emotional investment in Western Civilization. This is the patriotism of the middle classes, yet it is more dishonest, and manages to be even less coherent.  'Certainly [Neoconservative intellectuals don‚Äôt] have much time to spare for the internal dynamics and plurality of every civilization, or for the fact that the major contest in most modern cultures concerns the definition or interpretation of each culture, or for the unattractive possibility that a great deal of demagogy and downright ignorance is involved in presuming to speak for a whole religion or civilization. No, the West is the West, and Islam Islam.'      Edward Said  Pinker has taken up the Cold Warrior reading of the Cold War, and the king of pseuds, Harris, has taken time out from thought-policing to call the United States a ‚Äúwell intentioned giant‚Äù. Those farmers in Indochina who are still unearthing US ordinance, and losing a face in the process, probably have a different take. As might the European victims of GLADIO terrorism, and the handful who made it out of El Mozote and Nisour Square (and here I‚Äôm limiting myself to recent decades).  Whenever confronted with events like these, Empire‚Äôs defenders will spew something along the lines of, ‚Äústop it with your false equivalency! We may engage in barbarism every so often, but have you forgotten our ever-shining ideals? Such excesses, though unfortunate, are slight blips on the road towards History‚Äôs terminus‚Äù. (History will end, and possibly quite soon, but not in the way they hope.)  It used to be the case, with the Neoconservatives Said targeted, that the monolithic West could be excused because it was a religious bulwark against the overly rational, atheistic, cold-hearted Reds. Now, with progressives, the West must be bolstered because it is rational, secular, and has overcome that squalling stage of human development, i.e. religious. The results are the often the same, and always dire."
