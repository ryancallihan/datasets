"Your paranoia leads to people losing their jobs and being attacked by the virtue of 'appearing fascist' in their views, despite the fact that most of the time they simply hold different beliefs than you do e.g. controlled immigration and low taxes. You defend anti-fascist action, yet clearly state you believe there is a thin line between fascist and someone who is 'alt lite' or merely conservative. If so, this paves the way for so-called anti fascist action on anyone who is conservative because this thin line is up for interpretation and validates violence against people expressing their views. Fascism will never rise prominently in the marketplace of ideas after the horror of Nazism. To believe that it will gain significant traction to the point where America becomes a fascist regime is wilful ignorance."
"This video is so gay it already made me deny the Holocaust"
"Why is the left so obsessed with Richard Spencer?"
"I don’t know what to believe anymore. On one hand, the left genuinely believes no one can have a right-wing opinion with being manipulated by, or directly being a fascist. On the other hand, the right might actually be secretly full of nazis using code language without you even realizing it.   It feels like both sides are wrong and right at the same time. I have multiple conflicting ideas in my head at the same time that I believe even though they directly contradict each other. This must be what Orwell meant by doublethink.   The only way to win the modern political game is not to play. Make like Candide and tend to your garden."
"'jews will not replace us'... hmmm.... how quaint..."
"Nice TV!"
"5:30 in 2019...oof"
"There is a difference between Fascist/Racist and Nationalist. Sure one can both, but you can also just be a nationalist (as in someone who believes in a nation state) that wants to protect local regional cultures, and wants immigrants to assimilate. You can think this about the Czech Republic and its culture or South Korea and its culture or Argentina and it's culture. But yes Western culture can be a dog whistle but it isn't always one just like the emojis etc. I do believe immigration is done best when it is controlled and the people are assimilated to the local culture, and that some cultures are more advanced than others,I don't think that makes me a fascist."
"What if you debate them and win? Isn't that good? We could change people's minds."
"Facism in Brazil have some diferent caracteristics.... Hmm..."

"I've been watching your videos in reverse order in an attempt to get some sort of perspective along with everything else? This is the first video that gave me a headache. Not in a bad way? I need a break."
"fuckin tranny"
"I can’t believe people believe this. I have some ocean front property for sale in Az."
"Really. A she male telling what is what. This is stupid!!!"
"Aaaand while the 'left' fights the 'right'  the empire bombs the shit out of 9 countries with the support of both sides. Even if you don't care about that Obama was easily as hectic in his immigration policies as trump. Your whole left right thing just makes it easier to govern and rob you."
"Fascism in its most unsullied definition is the adoration of the fasci; which is to say using the symbology behind a bundle of sticks almost always with a broad axe attached."
"Fascism is a leftist ideology."
"I ageee with all you said, the problem is most of your viewers are us that agree with you. Talking to trump supporters is frustrating as they usually say god is working his will through trump or trump is forgiven. The religious zealots are worse believing the lies their ministers and twisted bible cult pushes.  Now for my little bit of paranoia,  all of us have seen trump, fox and the other alt right entities blame the rest of us for their misdeeds and crimes. Like the idiot jones false flag claims. Here's the paranoid part, some of antifa may be alt right plants just like the soviet had plants in the 67 Chicago riots. What better way  to make people mistrust Democrats, the left and all of us deviants then by sparking antifa attacks on the right. Ok sounds crazy but it was part of the soviet play book and I see trump using both the nazi and soviet play books. So I hope I am paranoid cause it's better if I am wrong."
"thank ( god ;) for you."
"i’m glad anthony fantano got better, his political opinions have shifted further to the left"
"A fascist Identifying fascists LMAO!"
"'Who are you?'  I'm a fucking worker"
"What a crock of absolute shit. Just anotger subverted pathological altrustic mentally ill moron. Fascism is state directed capitalism, IE Obamacare with a government regulation. Granted it's true, homosexuality transgenderism multiculturalism and Feminism are Zionist Marxist propaganda tools to perpetuate degeneracy destroy the nuclear family and indoctrinate children to accept communism. Thank you for doing your part for the depopulation a d wester destruction agenda. You're the real fascist. You cry about the colonists being terrible immigrants efi killed the natives but then love the new wave of immigrant invaders who of course will never perpetuate miscegebation against whites. Never in history has a group of morons like you accepted and perpetuated their own demise."
"Slavery wasn’t fascist, it was capitalist."
"Those three beliefs aren’t fascist, they’re white nationalist. They’re quite different."
"White identity politics:  'we wuz Vikangs!1!1!2!!1!23!'"
"Hate it! Hate it! Huge Ego!"
"This video changed my life many months ago. I was slowly slowly being pulled into the alt-right and I'm deeply ashamed to say I was starting to become racist. I didn't even realise as I would justify it in my head. This snapped me back. It honestly felt like I was being brainwashed for 2 years. These ppl use these techniques no doubt in my mind. Hate, anger and fear consumed me and I am so sorry for ever having those sick thoughts. I'm so happy I woke up before it was too late"
"Sort by new and you find the most Paul Joseph Watson-esque arguments... It's honestly baffling. I can't tell if these people are 72 or 12. These are the sort of arguments I made when I was 12."
"Fascism is hiding in the modern leftist SJW movement who have gone so far left they have become totalitarian."
"I know it's incredibly bigoted to not find trans women as attractive and merely an aversion I've hammered deep into my psyche, but wow you are one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I need to reevaluate my sexuality."

"“I’m not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say” @8:01 ???"
"Great video."
"Hi Natalie, I'm a huge fan, and I greatly appreciate the work you're doing--it's extremely important!    I just wanted to highlight a small issue I had with the 3 tenets of fascism you discuss here--because there's a bit of confusion in public discourse about what constitutes fascism. It's important to emphasize that fascism is a political system, not an ideology...though it typically requires a belief system. And white nationalism is certainly a sub-group within fascist ideology. But it is not necessary for fascism to exist. Italy for instance saw Mussolini rise as part of a populist syndicalist movement against socialism. Racial purity was an afterthought that was pressed on the movement after allying with Germany.    Also, it seems from Paxton's typology, and I believe many scholars agree, that fascism only arises from established democracies. And this is important because it requires popular support and an electoral system that can be exploited--and this is what we need to be watching...the relationship between pundits like Richard Spencer, the alt-right forums, and the evolving political rhetoric from people in power trying to secure re-election.  I understand too that this video is a bit old, and your understanding of it may have changed since then. I just wanted to bring it to your attention. Thank you again for all that you do!  My sourcing: I have a background in political science, and my reading on this is limited to Mark Bray's Antifa Handbook and Robert Paxton's Anatomy of Fascism. If you have further recommendations, please let me know."
"Can we has a crypto liberalist language?"

"Great work. Thanks."
"more people need to watch this video"
"Love this"
">> this video pops up on my news feed  *WOW I DID NAZI THIS COMING*"
"I liked this video alot"
"idk,, i find it obnoxious when people say 'nazi' and not 'neo-nazi'. like when people say 'pibble' instead of 'american pit bull terrier of which there is only one'. but then again im an asshole :)"
"I have yet to hear anyone describe a reliable process for differentiating between someone dogwhistling and someone legitimately advancing only the neutral idea that others use as a dogwhistle (e.g. law and order). With that in mind, I think it's irresponsible to argue against the dogwhistle message rather than the overt message."
"Your elevator don't go all the way up."
"I'm sorry to say this video is a wee bit dated.  I'm writing this comment after Trump clustereffed us with another string of his weaponized tweets, in which he railed that the D.C. Squad needs to go back to where they came from.  Obviously racism and facism have not retreated back into the dark at all.  Trump assures racism and fascism will maintain center stage as he ratchets up his base for 2020.     Instead of attacking women politicians of color, why doesn't Trump throw a little shade at his favorite fascist dictators around the world, like Turkey's Erdogan, Hungary's Orbán , N. Korea's Kim, Philippine's Duterte and Russia's Putin?  Rhetorical question folks. Trump admires those fascistholes.     5:24 Also,  note the Freudian slip when the anon post suggests that alt righters shouldn't be too obvious by holding 'Wiki torches' (insteat of 'Tiki' torches).  The 'freedom of speech' and 'free access to information'  ideals become tainted when yielded by ideological despots in the service of facism and fanaticism.  Look for more Russian-orchestrated Wiki leaks in 2020. Putin encourages fascist and divisive movements in the U.S.  He struggles to lift his own country out of  the mire so he prefers do undermine the world's most powerful liberal democracy."
"Wow Amazing video"
"God damn it, they took the othala rune."
"Isn’t that a communist hat?  I mean it is German.  But it’s east German I think."
"It's a good video. It is. However, it sounds more like 'How to be aware of the alt right for dummies.'  Seriously, some of this shit in this video was just face palm, and me asking 'Does that really take people in?'  Not that I'm enlightened or anything. Just skeptical. Aren't people skeptical anymore?  Do people need to belong to something so badly? Shame."
"I haven't scoured the whole channel yet, but I do hope at some point you covered 'stochastic terrorism' and the related issues in such wonderful depth."

"As a queer left-leaning centrist, i know that the alt-right (or extreme right as we call it in France) is much much more dangerous than the extreme left. One is fighting against people and the other is fighting for people, that is a big difference. To me extreme left might have some scary ideas but it'll never be as scary as mass genocide. I'll be spreading that video, it's excellent content. The left must absolutely get better at fighting back and spreading its ideas if it wants to win the cultural-political war we're in right now."

"I don’t know why they’re so pressed about preserving western civilization when climate change is about to make sure there’s *no* civilization."
"that's not how fascism is defined anywhere... by this definition if the natzis where not white they wouldn't be fascist."
"I almost entirely agree with your points, but I do consider it important to host debates between alt-right members and anti-alt-right people. I was never really 'into' the alt-right, but watching the Sargon vs. Richard Spencer debate made me go from 'eh, who are these Alt-Right guys anyway? They might have a point, I don't know' to 'Oh god, their all looney idiots who can't even agree on who are white people, if they got what they wanted they would almost certainly kill me'. So yes, we should give Alt-righters a platform to speak on - but only with debates, against people who can prod them into talking about what they actually think, and not overreact to the reasonable-on-the-surface dog whistles."
"i've been arguing my friend who agrees (he's literally said himself) with the alt-right, and i argue all the time against him, but i think that he won't go fully through with the alt-right's ideas since, well. I'M BLACK."
"reactionaries are useful to fascists because of this stuff"
"I would argue that identity politics, intersectional feminism, communism and post modernism have succeeded in creating more fascists than fascism has"
"1) You're entire video is describing the alt-right, not Fascism. Both are repulsive but there is a difference. Fascism is a political system. It's focused on an all powerful figure who exercises complete authority. In the economic realm the government loans you your property and can make the decision as to what you do with it. It doesn't necessarily have to be racial (just look at Strasser and Franco). 2) Don't pretend like the far left is somehow morally virtuous. Antifa members killed a horse, destroyed countless buildings and have hospitalized many people. 3) Your quote from Lee Atwater is missing context. His point wasn't that the right uses racist rhetoric but rather why some racist southern democrats would throw their support behind republicans. The answer is because they see dog-whistles that aren't there (much like the modern left). 4) Lauren pushes Nationalism, not Fascism. Anyone can be proud of their heritage regardless of race. My family celebrates our Irish heritage and we hate the IRA's awful tactics as of recent years, one of my friends celebrates his Ugandan heritage and he doesn't support Joseph Kony, and a female coworker and friend of mine celebrates her Native American heritage while not being a fan of scalping. Enjoying your culture doesn't mean forcing it on others or embracing its darkest parts. 5) Antifa doesn't stop with Fascists. Ben Shapiro, Andy Ngo, Milo Yiannopoulos, Carl Benjamin, Markus Meechan, Paul Joseph Watson, and Candace Owens have all been attacked by Antifa."
"Portland made me believe that violence from the left is as dangerous as the violence on the right"
"' 'i'm not a fascist!' is exactly what a fascist would say!'  ok ContraPoints!  let me ask you this: are YOU a fascist?"
"Soooo once you've decided that someone you don't like is a Fascist then no argument they use to defend themselves is valid? Sounds fair."
"Right, so by your defintion: 1. western europe having shared cultural values is by itself fascist. And no other countries except european ones ever had any problems with fascism. 2. never heard anyone blame jews for immigration, but London is now a city where the majority of the people are immigrants. 30% of Swedes were not born in Sweden. What you describe happening to white people is actually going on, but I guess you considder demographics fascist. 3. ermm...there are white homelands. They are in what's called 'europe'. Ever heard of it?  No wonder people hate SJWs. If this is what you truely believe then your ideology truely is messed up"
"i cant beleive you managed to contact steve shives for this video. honestly thought he blocked everyone"
"This may seem a weird addition. But I've seen a lot of alt-light or farther right people talking a lot about 'monarchism'. Just as a heads-up in debating these people I've seen weird white- supremacy- type talking points and rhetoric. Watch out kiddos."
"ik im late and idk if this has already been discussed but are you sure that was the intention w anthony fantano's tweet? it seems to me that was more of a joke against the hashtag considering how left leaning he comes off as"

"Here in Brasil the president is a neo fascist who adores Israel because of his militaristic regime (when he decided to remove the embassy of our country from Tel Aviv to Jerusalém, we got afraid of a declaration of war from the Arabic/Islamic country's). Once he talked about 'been possible forgive but not forget the Holocaust', that caused a initial shock in the jewish comunity, we of the oposition hoped that this would been his down fall, but there's no signal of the relations between Brasil and Israel been broken, with soldiers of the israeli army coming as 'humanitarian help' when the dam of one city called Brumadinho broke and his muded and poluted waters draged and killed lots of people.  I'm a half black and half jewish brasilian, and i'm feel so horrified when seeing the regime of Israel treating the people of Palestine almost the same way as Hitler treated his ancestors and negotiating whit our neo fascist president."
"Good stuff overall. But the problem is that the reality is just a bit more messy. Some people say the things that your fictional commentators state (the 'strategies') and actually mean them. Similarly, some groups and individuals who are more or less fascist are specifically not anti-semitic,  and also support the Israeli state (Rebel Media?)...."

"How can you make videos about the alt right while saying 'David Icke was right' on your merch site? Is this not the same ''ironic'' racism you identify the alt right as practicing?"
"If Trump really is a giant step in the direction of fascism, shouldn't we want MORE people to own guns?"
"Fascism is a racist form of socialism.  Under fascism, there was generous welfare (to arians, of course) and the government controlled industry in the interests of the collective.  Part of the reason Fascists and communists fight each other is that their economic and government policies are so similar.  They compete for similar supporters and voters.  Fabian socialists supported incrementalist strategies way before fascists did.  Western Civilization is not necessarily racist.  Anyone can use basic enlightenment principles and see the value in Shakespeare, etc.  Reason and science are not racist."
"I'm gay and I have been attacked by more gay leftist, than conservative Christians. This video taught me nothing. That Contra thinks I am so dumb and need help."
"You literally compared centrists to children who don't get sexual innuendos. You think they are as smart as children... You wonder why centrists are identifying less and less with the left. You'll are nuts."

"Vikings weren't racists. They had no concept of race, and were very metropolitan, traveling the world, trading with different cultures, and taking ideas back with them. The fact that fascists try and appropriate Norse history to their racist propaganda pisses me off to no end as a Viking enthusiast."

"So long as fascists can't be open about being fascist there is no reason to call an idea fascist; there's a good chance it comes across as hyperbolic, even to someone like me. Either way, if you act less paranoid, you're less likely to be baited, and you are also less ideologically biased when making an assessment."

"Christ church was a Free Mason operation, the shooter was like Anders Breivikm who is a fringe free Mason. Free Masons and Zionists have identities that crossover. New Zealand has been one of their new bases of operation. Hawaii was the old one. This is why you see all of these Youtube Jews with expensive homes and cars in New Zealand. Both Hillary and Obama own property there."
"First two points are actually true. Last one is wrong, most don't care about an ethnostate its more so that others are purposely assaulting what is already an ethnostate, which is again proven true if you dismantle the modern identity by contrasting what the government and media views the nation as and what the nation has historically been, which was always what you are saying the 'facists' want to create. I'm saying the United States was always an ethnostate. Globalists and their slaves have been working to destroy it and the proof of that is clear."

"I'm all for resisting fascism, just as long as we don't resort to communism. Because I'll fight both to the last breath."
"Richard does realize that Romans, Danes, and Saxons fought each other for centuries right? There will never be a white ethnostate because white people are just as divided as any other group. Do you honestly expect the Croats and Serbs to be able to get along perfectly just because there aren't any scary brown people around? What about Spaniards and Basques? Or the threeway clusterfuck that is Britons, Scots, and Irishmen? Richard Spencer strikes me as an extremely lonely closeted gay man who is terrified of his interracial fantasies and clings to race-based nationalism in a desperate attempt to find some minuscule amount of meaning in his otherwise empty and pathetic life."

"Ты, безусловно, хорошим делом занимаешься, но приравнивать всех расистов и националистов к фашистам и нацистам - это очень дурной пример мамкиного радикала, где всех под одну гребенку мести приходится.

"So you're calling nazism a fascism despite those two are different, yet have some similarities? Not cool, bro"
"Muh Detergence."
"Honestly Im coming at this from a libertarian or possibly right leaning upbringing i guess because i am prior military, security etc, and I am confused as hell by the culture war or whatever is going on with left and right, and fascist and antifascists, things start to get weird with the whole thing, ill give an example, some gangs use cartoons as a symbol for their gang like a cartoon from disney, meanwhile non affiliated gang people ie regular people still see and use the cartoon as a normal thing, they still buy the merch, they still watch the disney channel, they still go to disneyland, the point being just because someone takes a symbol from somewhere and uses it in their evil ways doesnt make regular people who use same symbol bad, there is no way to know if a person is evil intent unless you let them speak freely and see their actions wich in turn reveal something about them. still, great production work here, i liked the sound, the edits were good, and the audio was good, script must have taken some time, so kudos for the work."

I know for a fact they wouldn't have.  The family unit is the whole foundation of society...and that is being systematically dismantled.  The whole thing is going to collapse.  All these 'ContraPoints' and all the Left's censorship and totalitarian political correctness and bullying....it's isn't going to save the basic rot of their whole degenerate system."

"Your insanity shows. The fact that people believe you is horrifying on its own. You are not 100% incorrect in this video but sadly you are typical. Calling Trump fascist, James Allsup fascist, clearly shows you are part of the herd. Yes racism exists, no it isn't to the point of making an entire platform dedicated to it. Good quality videos for sure but sadly you are simple minded and follow the sheep off a cliff."

"Hi I’m French and I discovered your video by a youtuber that I follow, and I wanted to thank you for this video so worked and informative, and I wanted to express to all people not-French who would see this comment late what I feel about this rise of proto-fascists in France. You may know this if you are experts in this subject, but France becomes and has become a symbol for white supremacists, I think it’s because we have a very large Muslim community mainly of Maghreb origin, coming in different waves (legal or not it depends) throughout the 20th century (a very large period therefore) and again in the 21st, and that we had the horrible Islamist attacks of Charlie Hebdo (It’s horrible what happened to them but didn’t go to read their diary he’s at least sexist and surely more and their draftmens don’t accept criticism, ironic) and Bataclan. The terrorist of Christ Church referred to his trip to France to imagine his horrible crime and of a well-lived French author who popularized in white people the theory of 'great replacement', Renaud Camus (he really is Creepy, he tried to run for the European elections but he made a flop).    In our country we are not as aware as in the United States of how white supremacists have anchored themselves on the Internet (but the French supremacists must know this) but we have exactly the same specimens with the same arguments as those described in the video, with subtlety. In us the most subtle do not claim Christianity directly but to 'secularism' (that is, the non-interference of religions in public affairs and vice versa), by regularly trying to prevent veiled women from living like anyone else because they would all be salafists who want to impose their religion on our children, the most cited example is for school outings where some do not want veiled women to accompany children if they are veiled (the Senate tried to pass a law along these lines, but the National Assembly rejected it, (it should be known that the National Assembly submitted to Macron is against the Senate because for once they had done their job in the Bennalla affair and that in response some insiders of the President said that it was necessary to abolish the Senate, So both tend to reject what comes from the other by rivalry, if it was the National Assembly that had tried to pass an Islamophobic law it was the Senate that would have blocked it, no one has any real values in France).   In France the 'Rassemblement National' (former National Front) does exactly what the video says, they try to make their party look acceptable by putting in silence the least subtle elements, as was Jean Marie Lepen, but in reality Marine Lepen still maintains close ties with dangerous people like neo-Nazis (I invite you to see Al-Jazeera’s excellent documentary, 'Generation Hate', which talks about a well-known white nationalist group here, 'génération identitaire')   But Macron and his government are also participating in the rise of extremism, as he has passed extremely dangerous laws to protect his little power (it should be known that Macron is an extremely full person of himself, he has given himself the title of champion of the Earth, one of his ministers has called him Jupiter and recently his wife has compared him to Atlas, the one who holds the world on his shoulders)  All around last November for the commemorations of World War I he paid tribute to Pétain (yes the one who led France for the Nazis) saying that it was necessary to differentiate the Pétain of 1917 from that of 1940. Besides the musty argument, the historical bases upon which it stands are false because Pétain never won the battle of Verdun, he arrived 2/3 months before the end of the battle when it was already won and he only executed the mutineers of 1917, reports of the time even say that he was considered by the other generals as a coward, This will be seen with his rapid surrender against the Germans in 1940, his so-called Verdun victory is nothing but propaganda inherited from the 20/30’s . Pétain is a figure of the French extreme right, and some to rehabilitate him have tried to make believe that in reality he was working with De Gaulle against the Germans, And I’m afraid that theory will come back with magician apprentices like Macron. Once the president allowed himself to say that, the other political sheep followed and also justified the tribute to Pétain, he released the word on a figure of the extreme right.     Then he passed a law giving the prefects the power to ban demonstrations if they saw the need, officially for security but in fact to limit the challenges of his power. And he just set up the 'universal national service', something that will become obligatory for young people around the age of 16 and that will in fact be a new military service with singing of the Marseillaise all morning, flag raising and black uniforms (go see there are plenty of videos on the internet it’s terrifying, and yet I don’t tell you all that’s wrong because it would take too long, For example, it’s going to cost $1 billion a year when he dared to tell nurses that there was no money for hospitals, and kids volunteering to test the SNU have have collapsed after staying too long in the sun without moving, the prefecture to dare say that the collapses was due to the solemnity of the singing of the Marseillaise, no fake, and they’re gonna run a daily show on it to make us believe that there’s no problem and that their thing is great, and the young people also had a course in which we hear about 'Pétain the winner of Verdun', again...). All this will help the extreme right if it takes power one day in France because the previous president will have done everything in their place.  The media are also participating in the rise of the extreme right by inviting his figures on TV all the time just to make an audience, and since almost all the French media are owned by billionaires a group of white supremacists who would take power would have no trouble making some concessions to get their support   It was extremely long, I don’t know if anyone will read my comment, maybe even the author of the video who knows, but I wanted to express what I feel, both my concern about the rise of this kind of person when we were warned for almost 80 years that they were evil, my disgust with this country and its intolerable inhabitants who know nothing but to complain and who understand nothing to what they open by allowing white supremacism to blossom (or who know it very well) because they have seen 3 Arabs cross the street, and towards the policies of this country which are all completely incompetent and which instead of fighting the extreme right when it comes to it take up these ideas to try to win their votes by the lure of power. In the end I love my country, but I have more and more difficulty to understand (or to accept) what is happening there, I do not want my country to become the laboratory of white supremacism and new fascists, I don’t want white supremacists from other countries to use mine as an example to commit atrocities at home, I want to live a normal life I don’t want to have to risk anything to protect my friends who would be directly targeted by fascists. I feel like a worm trying to fight just lost against a wave of fascism that can only win me by destroying everything in its path, I don’t want to be a worm that is crushed without any possible resistance, I don't want...   I’m finished with this, and I don’t know if anybody will read it, but I’m open to questions if you have any. If you’ve read so far, thank you again."
"None of the three things you mention as defining Fascism have anything to do with fascism.  They are the elements of the 1920’s Woodrow Wilson style progressive eugenics movements adopted by the Nazi’s.  Fascism is defined by its creator Benito Mussolini who was a specific kind of socialist, a syndicalist.  The Anarcho Syndicalism movement in the 1860s in Italy was developed by a friend and contemporary of Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin.  Syndicalists rejected the idea that communism would eventually become a leaderless society with no money.  They felt it would result in central authoritarianism.  So instead they decided that instead workers would be given a single share of stock in corporations and CEOs would be an elected position.  Not necessarily a bad idea but the problem was the syndicalists were Anarchs who tried to use bombs to make their points.    That Brujah slanted A symbol the occupy crowd uses.... a prefascist symbol.  Mussolini felt syndicalism was too chaotic to implement and changed it slightly (in his mind).  Instead of employees forcing ownership to transfer to them, the state would simply assume the shares of corporations and run the companies for the people.  Mussolini called Fascism the third way between Communism and Capitalism whereby instead of destroying and remaking the means of production as the communist, the fascist would simply take over the means of production entirely.   Fascism is corporatism.  It is the nationalization of industry.  The forced takeover of voting stock by the government.  When Obama used the Tarp and Auto bailouts to force banks and auto companies to hand to the US government majority shares of there stocks he was employing the tools of Fascism.  Fascism is not evil because of its association with racism.  The Italian fascists promoted nationalism but not identitarianism.  Many Jews worked as top bureaucrats in the Italian government until the Germans took over.  Fascism is evil because it places all of the public and private sector of a country’s economy under the power of a centralized leader.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely thus Hitler has the power to do what he did.  Spencer and these white separatists ironically are leftist identitarians.  The promote the socialism of the Nazis and the segregation of the Nazis but not the ethic supremacy of the Nazis.  Spencer argues he does not want to rule black people or tell them what to do.  He even says he wants to help blacks have their own nation.  What he argues is for a country where he and his white brethren can rule themselves without having to concern themselves with other races telling them what to do or say or be guilty for.  I understand you are an identitarian leftist pushing you own diversity views and the Spencer’s of the world are a threat to you gaining power to control people globally in your neomarxist paradise.  But.......  You will never effectively fight this alt right movement because you fail to understand it is a natural evolution of your own identity politics.  Spencer is a white Man who was part of the occupy movement before becoming alt right.  He sat their listening to how the black identitarian Ian would grant them power and the gay and the insert identity group here.  When Spencer looks in the mirror though he sees he is white.  He sees his identity is reviled and told to accept this because he has privilege.  But as you say he is just a marketing assistant who is nobody do where is his privilege getting him.  Standing up for the white identity is just where he will go.  Why?  Because you cultural marxists pushed group identity on the world defining people as nothing more than their skin color or ethnicity.  Sunk into your identitarian paradigm that is the only route he has to self worth.  You reap what you sew!  Reject all identitarian fallacies whether it is Hillary Clinton, Obama or Spencer and the alt right.  Choose to abandon your identity by adopting one that does not exist.  Join the 100% ethostate of Free Kekistan and follow the God of Chaos who refuses to lead you.....  ALL PRAISE KEK!"

"Videos like this have made me very wary. There's a discord group I hang out in that likes to throw around what they call 'Dark Humour', and a lot of it is racist in nature. I used to dismiss it as just being inappropriate jokes said in isolation, without any target, but now I'm not so sure. I've mentioned on several occasions that those kind of jokes aren't funny, but I was ignored (to be fair, last year we all watched a light-hearted comedy show which I didn't like, which earned me the title 'Hater of Fun', so they might have thought I was being my usual self instead of serious).   I honestly can't tell if they're genuinely racist, or just misguided into thinking that kind of thinking is okay. Part of me wants to stick around, be the contrary voice and remind them that what they're saying is wrong, but I know that's a fools errand. Another part of me wants to just tell them directly that I hate what they're saying, but if they haven't picked up on my displeasure already then they're not going to be convinced.   The option I'm probably going to go with is to just disappear entirely.

The interesting thing about this video is that a hard rightist could make an identical video about how to recognize a hard leftist, merely inverting the words 'right' and 'left' and by replacing the policies and desired end state of hard rightists with the policies and desired end state of hard leftists.  Remember, it takes *two* equally committed factions of fanatics, both equally adept at all Machiavelli’s tricks, to generate the ideological war being waged in Europe and North America today."
""
"This video also is guilty of facile oversimplifications that obscure the truth.  Just because a person supports a policy which is not liked by the hard left, it does *not* mean that that person is automatically hard right.  For example, I am White and during my thirty years of service as a U.S. Army soldier, I came to love as brothers and sisters my fellow soldiers of Black and Hispanic heritage.  But--I am still able to recognize the objective fact that the uncontrolled mass migration of people from Central America across our southern border is harmful to the sovereignty, prosperity, and social cohesion of the United States.  (Legitimate asylum seekers fleeing drug gang violence are required to stop in the first safe country they come to, Mexico in this case.)  The migrants lack education and economically useful skills.  As such, they place an unsustainable strain on our social safety nets and either take jobs from, or depress the wages of, American citizens from traditionally disadvantaged groups such as African-Americans.  Where my ancestors were in a hurry to forget Italian and learn English in their haste to join the mainstream, this newest wave of migrants is different.  More than previous migrants, they are resistant to learning English and embracing core American folkways and mores as their own.  They form more strongly insular sub-communities than previous groups, fragmenting the American body politic.  In the photos I see of migrant caravans, most of the people seem to be healthy men.  They need to stay home and stand up to the drug gang thugs just like the Kurdish *women* stood up to the ISIS thugs.  America’s first obligation is to its own sovereignty, citizenry, and social order.  It’s impossible for America to take in every unfortunate group in the world without America’s economy and identity being destroyed.  Now then, everything I just wrote is reasonable, intellectually and morally valid, and intended only to benefit the United States, of which I am a worried citizen.  Nothing I wrote here makes me a Fascist or a Nazi."

"Natalie, as a leftist, you protest too much about the right having a megaphone.  The powers that be at Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter are all heavily left-leaning.

"Mussolini was the godfather of fascism. He didn’t espouse anti-Semitic anti-Jewish ideas until the Germans insisted they purge Jewish black shirt members. Many early supporters of the Italian fascist party were Italian Jews. There is a definite ethnic nationalism present in fascist and falangist politics but it’s hyper exaggerated in Nazism.  Hitler was a fascist but Mussolini wasn’t a Nazi if that makes any sense.   I think the far right today needs better definition. The term Fascist is thrown about inaccurately.

"The word fascism is currently used as a slur against nearly everyone that rejects leftist dogma.  Using your fairly limited definition, there are very few actual modern fascist in the US.  Perhaps 10s of thousands, probably less than the number of rapists walking free.  There used to be thousands of skinheads in southern California in the 90s (many more prior) that arose as a response to black gangs terrorizing white neighborhoods.  As that gang activity has gone decreased the skinheads grew up and moved on with their lives.   The identitarian politics now being used by the left is a primary driver pushing whites to support authoritarian right positions.  If you keep pushing and trying to silence them you will get more of them.  If the left went back to true liberal values of a focus of treating people based solely on character and ability independent of immutable characteristics, I bet you'd see a decrease in white identitarianism because most would not see a need for it.  Most white people on the right just want the same rules for everyone, no special treatment for different 'oppressed' groups.  This dynamic has been obvious to me for years.   Suggest you take a look at a recent Bret Weinstein video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1sJgjG5AF4"
"16:30 Free speech defense"
"4:14  the AMA disagrees with you.  Studies have found that minority patients are much more likely to select physicians of similar racial and ethnic backgrounds. For example, an Hispanic patient is 19 times more likely to identify an Hispanic physician as his or her regular doctor than non-minority patient is [1]. Minority patients seek care from physicians of their own race because of personal preference and language, not solely based on geographic accessibility [2]. In addition, patients report receiving higher quality care from physicians of a similar race or ethnicity [3], as well as being more involved in medical decision making [4]. Efforts to increase the number of those from underrepresented minority groups who enter the US physician workforce may partly address some of the issues raised by race and ethnicity in the patient-physician relationship. However, given the growing differences between the racial mix of the US population and the composition of the physician workforce, strategies other than changes in medical school admissions policies must be pursued. Greater emphasis on teaching those skills and competencies such as improved communication that will neutralize the consequences of racial/ethnic discordance will likely have more immediate, broader, and more permanent impact on strengthening patient-physician relationships."

"In your 'three points' of fascism, your aren't describing fascism. You are describing nationalism. There is a lot more to fascism. Devotion to a strong leader for one. Belief in an all powerful state, for another. In short, you miss everything that makes fascism a political ideology.  Fact is that the Founders were 'fascist' by your definition. Here is Federalist No. 2.  'With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to *one united people -- a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion,* attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and independence.'

"I guess I am what you would call a fascist. I personally wouldn't call myself that, but I take it from this video that you adamantly would, so suit yourself. Now, you do seem to use the terms 'fascism', 'nazism' and 'white supremacy' interchangeably, even though they are, objectively, very different ideologies. I would gladly clear up that misconception but you state in the video that you're not interested in using proper terminology anyway. It seems to me, in fact, that you're more interested in looking for an enemy to frame in the broadest strokes possible. Meanwhile, your real enemies are ones you seem to be welcoming with open arms - in fact, you are fighting to have as many as possible as your neighbors. I know first hand what I'm talking about. I live in Germany, a country that you surely applaud for its no-borders, everyone-is-welcome policy. Well, guess what. It's become a REALLY uncomfortable place to live for LGBT+ people. Oh, and Jews. And atheists. And women who choose not to dress in garbage bags from head to toe. And the reason is not that Germans have suddenly turned into 'nazis' all of a sudden, like perhaps you would claim. The reason are the millions of young men who have come here, who were indoctrinated since childhood to believe that they have a divine mandate to push homosexuals off of rooftops, punish women who behave in a way they consider 'immoral', exact revenge on Israel, and force people of all other faiths submit to their own. So, careful with what you wish for. You might get it. P.S. I know this video is 2 years old, but I doubt you've changed your mind in the meantime."

"Recognizing a 'fascist' is easy. It's anyone who disagrees with the genocidal multiculturalist left. And yes they are open about genociding whites. Only extremist multiculturalists think white European cultures should not exist and claim preserving European cultures is 'racist', and notice they aren't trying to destroy the cultures of any other societies. Multiculturalists are a tiny extremist fringe, for example less than 15% of the British public support mass immigration, but they have huge financial support from the corporate media and monopolists like Google. Finally note that calling something a 'dog-whistle' for a different belief  is just lying and deliberately misrepresenting someone's views . But then lies are all that the multiculturalists have."
"Isn't F@scism a political paradigm?  If so, then it can apply to any ethnic(?) group that tries to Purify its territory; it cannot be defined as a 'culture' group trying to purify its territory because that is what a proper Civilization is; a Society with a uniform Culture, which defines its civility, throughout.  But if the culture promotes many ethnics to interbred and become a uniform ethnic within that closed system: it then becomes an ethnically pure state, cross-generationally, which that culture supports... so: could in the long-term qualify under the same terms, couldn't it?  But I've heard f@scism, as a political paradigm, is about centralized power by the state in a police-state like environment & with total-domination international expansion policies; which make it akin to a Pirate Nation, and use the Purity Policies as a stepping-stone to indoctrinate centralization & violence as the go to.  I think the Purity talk you speak of is one of the distractions, that you have bought into.  Wouldn't the 'How to Recognize a F@scist' only apply to relevancy once they get to the point of implementation of 'National Centralization' or 'Promoting Internal Violence for Minor Offenses', where their views actually impact greater society at large? I feel like the shutting down dialogue, even if the opponent is totally evil, from your point of view, is not the healthy approach to the situation.  Free-Speech needs to extend to even those with distasteful opinions, that is the entire point, because their voices are there to bring forth a societal tension that exists; if you shut them down completely then they cannot use _mere_ speech to bring forth release to their tensions anymore; and as some have stressed tends to lead to violence.  Choosing not to publish them is fine, if you disagree, but it is important that the public square is still a platform available to even those you disagree with. <So I agree with you, in the way you expressed _that_ , although if I had a commentary enterprise: I wouldn't take your advice. I'd bring on those with drastically different opinions to help point out, to the general audience, how insane they really are, with their own words, in debate.> If you lack the faith in your own audience to be able to be intelligent/mature enough to be able to figure things out on their own, to a certain extent, and you need to talk down to them like children, then I'd argue that whatever paradigm you are spouting/coming-from probably has its own major flaws as well.  I cannot tell what your actual stance is in the political paradigm to be honest, but I also do not think it matters so long as you are not a legal policy maker nor committing crime."

"Silly tranny; whites with their freedom loving Libertarianesque ethos are the number one reason you're even allowed to be a tranny and speak your piece on the interwebz, and here you are attacking the one group that inherently preserves this ethos by virtue of their existence. What do you think is gonna happen when these different ethnic, religious, and sexual minority groups you support, vying for power (aka equality) by undermining traditional whites, come to a head of conflict politically? Do you really believe it's gonna result in some kind of gay Utopia where everyone is tolerant of everyone else and loves each other? The naivety it takes to believe that is astounding! The only reason tolerance is even a thing is because of Whites' pathological altruism, and by disempowering whites, you better get ready to kiss that tolerance goodbye.   Fascism is just a natural result of the manifestation of Natural Law that desires order in a chaotic world that you for some dumb reason reductively think is just hate; and hate must be stopped by not allowing this emotion (as if that ever worked; just gonna make them hate you more). Trying to suppress this kind of sentiment by labeling it a boogeyman is counter-productive; especially when you don't provide an alternative solution to their concerns, but rather you just dismiss them; and how has that ever solved anything? Let them form the kind of society they desire; you don't have to be a part of it, and neither does any PoC or White useful idiot Marxist type. Like would it be that big a deal if they got say Montana for their ethnostate? Who cares? You don't need to live there.  You all can just move to San Francisco where you may get stabbed by a crack head hobo with a feces filled syringe, or go to the diverse Utopia of Britainistan and live in fear of getting your head chopped off by one of the Muslims you seemingly love so much and are so tolerant of. Silly anime tranny; full of 'virtue', depleted of common sense."

"I think it's also important for leftists to watch this video because it helps explain why talking to liberals and centrists about fascism can be surprisingly difficult. I almost lost it when I got into a debate with my step dad (a liberal) who pulled the whole 'the far left and far right become the same' rhetoric on me. He's an incredibly intelligent person too! He's a history teacher with encyclopedic knowledge about many things and closely follows politics and the news. He's also not conservative in the slightest. He's Jewish and more suspicious of fascism than probably the average liberal, as well. But being a liberal he still buys into certain myths about leftism and fascism.   A lot of it also ties into how liberal media tends to distort matters. I remember how, early on in Trump's presidency, when I said that people painted antifascists as being 'just as bad' as fascists, my step dad scoffed at that idea, but now, as portrayals of antifa in the liberal media have become more critical, I've noticed he has also become more critical of antifa. To be sure, I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist. I don't think there's a concerted effort in mainstream US media to *enable* fascism. It's more that liberals and centrists, like you say, are naive about fascist tactics, and also that they're misinformed about leftism and tend to view leftists and their tactics as 'extreme' or 'dangerous.' So the more liberals project these false beliefs and naivety in their coverage of fascists and leftists, the more they distort the fight against fascism."

"Maybe the most dangerous thing about dog whistles that I came to observe is, that finding and decoding them feeds their political opposition with the same reward and reinforcement stimuli that makes conspracy theorists addicted to finding ever more irrational 'evidence'. This sometimes leads to overreaction to legitimatly coincidental usages of whatever the dog whistle is. This overreaction then feeds the paranoia of legitimate centrists, center-leftists, liberals, non-fascist rightwingers, etc because they sometimes lead to deplatforming, attacks and harrasment of said individuals.  The only real way I see to counter dog whistles and open symbols of fascism is not so shirk away from them and to demonize those who use them (wittingly or unwittingly) and by that feeding into what they want to happen, but to use their weapons against themselves. Take the dog whistles back and start using them for your own purpose. The only might a symbol has is the one that is given to it. Make the symbols meaningless, give dog whistles no space to exist by being afraid of them, dont give them a platform in your own minds, dont give the fascists power over how you think."

"May I suggest Umberto Eco's 'Eternal Fascism' as being one of the best serious works on the subject of fascism. Not so much the alt-right in particular but it certainly helps to understand them on a deeper level as well as any other fascist movement.  And, as a bonus it is an excellent essay on what is NOT fascism, as long as you read it to the end, otherwise you could really get the wrong idea."
"This man is a literal joke who entirely ignores black fascism and other things. She defined multiple people who are libertarians (James Allsup, and the woman at around 5:00 ) as Fascists, despite them protecting free speech, freedom of press as long as it isn’t slanderous, states’ rights, etc. Of course, black fascism isn‘t the biggest thing, however minority supremacy are larger issues. This is the thoughts that are shared by some hispanics and whites that we should kill all whites, which might be a bit of a reaction to some of those who condone genocide and not just mass deportations. He also labels all fascists as white supremacists, and as I said, he said non-fascists WERE fascists. This is just throwing around scare words at this point to rally up NPCs. He also doesn’t condone free speech, to which I have to say, if you have to ban someone from saying something, might it not have some truth? Also, is banning free speech not just a fascist policy? Not to mention this man said not to debate them on Youtube channels, even saying but to just protest them. This man also said that every single fascist is racist, which is BS. Plenty of fascists simply seek a land in which their children can grow up to similar children and not have to worry about some of the issues that multiculturalism brings (racism, cultural appropriation, things like that.) This man on his own is a fascist spreading propaganda. Stay woke."

"Natalie is such a treasure"
"You're too fast to assume the centrists are just gimps of the right.  There is an implicit assumption that the left always makes, that  the so called 'Dog Whistle' is always a short-hand for a sinister subtext. However that subtext may only be in the Imagination of the extremist. The centrist may mean the 'Dog Whistle' statement at face value. Rather than the implied 'slippery slope to fascism' it may equally be not that, but rather it may be where the centrist draws the line between themselves and the extremists on the right."
"I don’t hide my beliefs or opinions online or in real life. I’m an Irish/European Nationalist and my people absolutely deserve a home of their own to preserve their culture and maintain the existence of their kind. You denying the attack on white people in the modern world is just disingenuous and reveals you to be quite nefarious and snake like. Anyone who researches or even lives in a European country like mine is feeling this happen and intensify over a very short period of time. Quit the passive aggression and facetiousness and understand that others are experiencing these culture wars from a very different position than you and they care that their countries and people won’t exist in a generation or two. This my dishonest friend does not make them evil, inhuman Nazis."

"How is the first belief false? Surely white people exist. And yes they historically come from Europe. Why is that incorrect?"
"Now they seem to be using the wave emoji to reference themselves"
"As someone who comes from the 'meme culture'. The point isn't to explore white supremacy, it's to offend people. It's a different way of dealing with things. Some people joke about tragedy to get over it. Yes, some people that are memers are racist but most really aren't from my experience. I think it's important to keep it original and the intent clear which is fading in the culture. Filthy frank started this culture of people and he made fun of everyone in a creative way that kept his intentions clear. He wanted to push the lines of comedy without being directly hateful towards a group of people."
"Speaking as a ...whatever group claims me... I don't think Nazis/etc. can really be explained rationally. Not by humane standards. It's a God complex, with a very paranoid, vengeful, and emotionally weak perspective that in no way lends itself to any group it might promote itself to defend or manage.   Back in the 90s, when Jeffrey Lebowski was the only Dude and everything you knew about Fight Club was what your friends told you, something that was morally wrong was morally wrong for very obvious reasons.  We did not (I certainly didn't) anticipate 22-year-old virgins to conspire with 62-year-old virgins in a strange attempt to... Yeah, where the fuck is the alt-right going with anything again? Do they build statues or something?"

"'the poor centrists'  ???? hahaha"
"Hello contrapoints, I don't like this video.  First you are confusing the alt-right with fascists. While most alt-righters are indeed fascists, there are many forms of fascism. Fascism is “a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.” (merriam Webster). Governments like in North Korea can be considered fascist, too. There are many kinds of fascism.  Then you are denying the existence of the alt-left. If somebody on the left rejects free speech, is racist against whites, sexist against men and straight phobic, then this person is just as shitty as the alt-right and can be described as alt-left.  You say 'anti-fascists' (Antifa is not anti-facist, it's alt-left) only silence fascists, but why are they trying to silence Sargon of akkad, Christina sommers or Ben Shapiro? None of them is a fascist by any Standart. Antifa is fascist itself and a perfect example for the alt-left. Noam Chomsky was right about them."

Tell them they have no choice and that they're nazis! They have to give in! Hehehehhehe."
"I think I am just tired of people being called Nazi's over jokes that commonly are poking fun at racists. For instance, I would be the kind of person who would retweet a racist joke talking about Jews or Blacks for one of two reasons, either I would do it to laugh at the sheer shock value of the post, or I would be doing it because I am laughing at how stupid the racist person is. Most of the time it is the latter. However, should I just be assumed to be a racist simply because I retweeted the joke? I say not. Jokes are jokes. They are, by definition, not meant to be taken seriously. I will put any word into a joke, any action into a joke, or anything into a joke if I think it would be funny."
"So an edgy “shit poster hilariously memed his car into a group of people”. Someone pointed a rifle at him so he got out of the way and accidently hit someone. Get your facts straight."
"You didn't describe fascism in the opening. You described the alt right basically. Fascism has nothing to do with white supremacy. You can have a fascist state in an African or Asian country."
"Funny how 'Fascism' sounds a lot like 'Socialism': both promoting the concept of belonging to something greater than oneself. This is not really surprising as both Mussolini and Hitler were both inspired by Karl Marx and saw themselves as socialists fighting against the evils of Capitalism (epitomised, in Germany, by the Jews)."
"Well, I don't exactly know where I am on the political spectrum, but the more and more the time passes, the more and more I understands why social justice policies are important, so I guess that I'm glad that this video exists. Also, I don't know if I'm the only one who thought about the Enigma machine when she talked about the codes that the Alt-right use? I don't think that it goes that far, but the possibility (and the link between the two) feels a bit...strange, to put it lightly?.. (Also, I'm sorry if I did not use the right terms; english is not my first language and I guess that I don't have a lot of experience about this kind of subject)."
"As a Social Democrat, this is what I see when I look at the fascist movement:  Sooner or later, the fascists will become so desperate that they'll institute the 'Sith Rule of Two'.  I often see Star Wars as a cautionary tale about how, even in the most democratic environment, hidden and subversive fascism can still exist and gain tremendous power.  The Sith are the perfect mirror of fascists, they keep themselves invisible and try to gain power behind the scenes.  This is a great video and I hope the more people see it, well, except for the fascists.  I have liked and subscribed because this video gives me 'A New Hope'  ; )"
"It’s funny because fascism is being implemented by the left😂"

"Political center is like a water source in the middle of the town. There goes the right to wash their hands and there goes the left to sink and drought. In most countries, at least at a legal level, nazi and fascist discourses are tagged as 'hate speech' and thus, not covered by the free speech right, although in practice most times this doesn't apply. The american far right of today is the son of the ideas and doings of Louis Beam, former vietnam combatant and kukluxklan grand dragon. Here you have another insight of the far right tactics: https://timeline.com/louis-beam-white-supremacy-history-20d028315d Discussing with centrist is so tiring and stressful because the right had more than 50 years to propagate his message without almost any real opposition and because they are f***** everywhere. All we know the old cryptos, right? Let's refresh them: 14/88, HH, even if you see '66' in the username watchout because 66 stands for 88. I don't know in America, but here in Europe, they doesn't hide them much more. 'Don't give nazis loudspeakers' it's easy to say, but more difficult when our dear 'free' press see the opportunity of selling news giving nazis and fascist a very big loudspeakers. They say big terrible things, so, why not? In Spain, the massive coverture the press gave to a fascist party has lead to them taking 24 seats in the congress in the last elections where before they had 0. They know they are wrong. They know they say shit, and they care nothing because it works."

(Not to mention that other problem with a classic  Batman movie! the villains depicted as stereotypical bomb-throwers with auschwitz's inverted red  triangle as their badge, meant for communists/anarchists. But this isn't about the batman series and it's irrelevant; the higher you go the more sympathizers one would encounter as expected of late capitalists)"

"Wow. Someone never googled the definition of fascism."
"Libertarian leaning subscriber here. I generally agree on this video, except for the 'euphemism' part. In this case, this could be hard to differentiate conservatives, European-style nationalists, civic nationalists, and the truly fascist white supremacist. One could criticize conservatives, European-style nationalists, or civic nationalists and discover if one really is white supremacist. Think Stefan Molyneux, he started speaking like a civic nationalists but constant push-backs made him reveal himself."
"I just gotta say, after stumbling across your name in a reddit post while I was looking for some fresh perspective in this increasingly politicized climate, I have never been more convinced that the political spectrum is neither a line or a square with an origin and a two axis. It's a circle. Having watched and studied alt-right rhetoric for some time, and now watched a fair number of leftist perspectives, I've become increasingly convinced that the two ideologies are two sides of the same coin.   While I consider myself a moderate (Due to me not living in the US could be translated to center right, I am aware), but the political climate and this video has me, feeling like an alleged 67% of americans.   Politically exhausted.   However, some fresh perspective is what I came looking for and that is what I found. Your channel has helped me broaden my views and thought processes on certain aspects. Thank you.   Now for a question; As a eastern european, would you say that if the american left can make a russian salute and advocate keeping up the good fight, does that make excuse me for hanging a confederate flag in my garage? After all, both these things are things from culture neither of us have ever really known personally. You might not have lived close to or felt the effects of communism, yet I have never lived closed to or experienced the effects of slavery and Jim Crow. Does these cultural disconnects allow us to use these items because, I'm assuming, we are look at these things through rose tinted goggles. Only seeing the perceived 'good things' in them?   I'd be glad for a reply, from either you are someone from the fanbase who are willing to debate this in a civic manner."

They also removed the slaves from the Harvard shield but left the word 'Veritas' above it. You don't see what is wrong with that? How do you shame the southern people for their past if you remove those statues from their sight? I'm not even sure how the left 'won' that battle, because their arguments were terrible. I'm thinking it is because they lied about Germany, and most people just accepted things that aren't true because they don't live here and couldn't verify it. Do you left wingers in America actually think that the Germans are flogging themselves? Hell no, they put that history in a book or a documentary and then they go on to treat foreigners like shit. xD  Um.. you know that some of us immigrants are white and that the majority of Americans want something done about immigration, right? In Europe do you think the conservatives aren't talking about polish and Americans when they talk about immigration? You believe that everyone who doesn't like more people like me coming here is a fascist? What about the leftist who want ami to go home? They fascist? I'm not sure how you think that ACLU meme bears any resemblance to the Nazi meme. Other than the little German looking kid in it."

The Richard spencer types are far more unpopular than they are well known, and to conflate the regular conservative types with him is disingenuous.

Most anti-sjw types are absolutely against identitarianism in all forms. Don’t create enemies that don’t exist."

You know after helping Germany stand on it's feet ago, America almost started WW3 and almost dragged Europe into it. You aren't that great saviour you claim to be. Germany isn't under any control of the USA anymore and you should stop claiming that and actually look into the mirror.  America has one of the biggest 'Nazi' or 'Alt-Right' population in the entire world at the moment and you should stop claiming to be the oh so great America, when you can't manage something in a few centuries Europe has managed to do in around 100 years."

"So fascists excel at stuff because they better at being cool?"
"There is one technicality I would like to correct: It seems that this video is only about white supremacy not fascism. Merriam-Webster definition of fascism is 'a political philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition'. I did not here critiques of dictatorship so the term 'fascism' could have been left out."
"The concept of 'western civilization' is insane. The Greeks killed Socrates... And, he's the first guy that comes to mind when you hear those words. Europe was always at war with itself, until nuclear weapons made that unprofitable.  Unfortunately, you're making a really common leftist mistake in this video though... You say that 'low taxes', is a code for fascism, yet I'm sure you would also agree that 'most welfare is corporate welfare'?  You know the state only helps wealthy, connected, popular people... Yet you want it to grow, in order to protect, minorities?  It doesn't make any sense.  I bet, for example, you think the 'new deal', was a great achievement... It's wealth capped, and it doesn't apply to capital gains, so literally the only people who don't pay their fair share, are the rich. They then live the longest, and see the doctor the most. High taxes, and a larger state, should be seen as code for white supremacy. Everything else seemed accurate though... If you're still talking about 'the west', or a place 'my people', in 2019, you're probably garbage."

Because I think, generally, the whole sjw thing went more out of style (peaking at the time of this video in 2017), which means the right wing reaction to it also went more out of style. So all the people that just wanted those darn sjws to shut up aren't thinking about them anymore.

Thanks Natalie for reminding me why I am adamantly opposed to marxists, socialists, and 'the left'. You sound like the alt-right. You justify your side's hate and violence. You justify your own paranoia and overreaction by saying it's the fascists' fault. Then you say your forgiveness is open to me. Fuck off.  As I said, thanks for the reminder.

"Fascism: an autocratic society that spends it's time micromanaging it's population through force, legislation, and artificial markets designed to protect and further the interest of the governing body.   A modern example would be North Korea.  You're welcome 😊  Throwing around loose language and using that to characterize a broad spectrum of individual people is not only dishonest but also harmful. I fully support changing some laws that exclude people based on identity. Gay marriage was really the last big one that I supported. Now using force to prevent gay marriage or using force to coerce someone to participate in a gay marriage in my eyes, completely wrong. Not only is it wrong but it is an authoritarian step towards fascism. This is why groups like antifa are inherently at odds with itself. Fighting fascism with fascist methods is hypocritical at best and possibly the very definition of violent idiocy. Instead of focusing attention on a group of people and pointing in disapproval why not focus on more productive things like researching unfair legislation that places favor on a specific identity. Better yet why not focus on ensuring a better tomorrow?   Maybe hold an event where everyone is welcome and instead of preaching down to people and judging them based on identity or spouting off an agenda everyone can work together to do something nice? Like clean up a park in poverty-stricken area? Do a cook off and have everyone bring food to said clean park so everyone can get a good meal?   I think acts of kindness really leave a better impression on people than treating them like terrible people.   I so often see people screeching about cleaning areas up, being 'green', reducing crime, lowering poverty, helping 'people of color' and so many other issues yet not a single one of those people DO anything about it. Instead people vote for arrogant and dangerous ideologs like AOC that would destroy the world in her attempt to save it."

"Fascism and Nazism are two different things. Yes Nazism is fascism, but fascism is not nazism!    Im so sick of fellow leftists using them as synonyms making us all look ignorant. Mussolini's fascist party had Jewish membership because it had a nationalist(Italian nationality) profile, while German style fascism was heavily racist based. And Franco style fascism was heavily catholic inspired.   One can even go further and call Wahhabism Islamic style fascism, and modern zionism is also very fascistic, but that doesn't make Netanyahu a nazi!"

"9:33 No, they're pointing out that you are merely engaging in ad hominem attacks, and not with their arguments or positions. The Nazi party really hasn't existed since the 1945's.

Fascism advocates for complete subordination to the state and to work collectively for the betterment of the nation.

"First off, excellently produced video it really was a pleasure to watch.   I have to disagree with almost everything you said as methods to figure out who is fascist. I know you tried to joke it off but you really are being far too paranoid. I see two results of using the methods you describe, either you end up assuming nearly everyone is a fascist or you dont rely on them and wait for concrete proof in which case what was the point of looking out for those things in the first place?  I purpose an alternative and its not a comforting one but it is far closer to reality. You can't ever tell if someone is a fascist (or any other terrible thing) if they are trying to hide it from you. Your only coice is to wait for people to slip up and when they do it will be so obvious that you didnt need to be watching them in the first place.  Lets all try to be a little less paranoid and quick to judge each other. Im getting really tired of people throwing all these terms around at each other it was funny for a meme at some point but now it is all just so cringy."

"I'll admit you have some good points . how ever your insalting of centrist as clueless childish morons Really aggravates me. I am a centrists waiting to pervent voilets and keep the conversation open on both side. So the left and right can be forced to exspile there more exstrame elements. Then the smart and not crazy people in both groups can work togeather to fight the underlying problem.  To the normal people  Antifa and the AltRight are both crazy exstramest that are both just as bad as each other.   There end goals may not br but there tactics are. I would personnel fight agest both. The all white people are racist hate filled creap spite out by SJW only makes people hate you.  In short let the racist shit haeds run there mouths and act like you havr the moral high ground.  Insulting a centrists like my self only angers people that would in times past have been on your dame side. 😤"

That was just.... :o"

"@ContraPoints, the problem with this mentality is it leads to everyone with conservative beliefs to be labeled alt-right, or alt right adjacent. This paranoid view and assuming anyone could be a cunning fascist leads to people being written off and judged for things they arent even aware they did. I remember i was talking to someone about my Russian orthodox upbringing and how i had a traditional set of values and i happened to be wearing my Cleveland Indians hat, which is coincidentally red and this girl at work assumed I was some alt-right troll.   This is why many people accuse certain leftists of an almost hypocritical closed mindedness to anyone who has a different set of beliefs than them.   Is my only solution in your eyes to disavow my christian upbringing, and my value of cultural traditions ( to me being my adherence to the bible, belief in good and evil, and my ideas of perhaps what a classic man should be to his family) and i do like this channel, and find it fascinating. I am not out to proselytize anyone. But if i try to explain this i end up written off as some alt right asshole. Do i need to be a self-loathing white american and pander to progressive beliefs all the time to be accepted?"
"Contrapoints lighting tutorial when?"
"ITS OVER 8000!"
"Wishing to preserve one's culture/values by regulating immigration does not make one a fascist or a racist. Mass immigration and the shift in culture and values that it may produce in certain cases is a legit issue that needs to be discussed. It's too bad that racists and fascists infiltrate this discussion. There are stories, for instance, of homosexuals and transgendered folk fleeing their countries because of death threats/beatings/persecution but when they arrive in a country like Germany, they are threatened all over again by immigrants from their home countries"

"The problem with the idea of a homogeneous 'white race' and 'European culture' quickly falls apart when you look at the diverse amount of different ethnicities of Europeans, the multiple and vastly-differing cultures and subcultures of different countries, and their associated histories."

"I was in a taxi going home when news on the radio mentioned a bomber being caught, his name being something very western, like Joe, or Lucas or something like that, and the taxi driver said 'that's not usually the sort of name you expect for this kind of thing.'  I replied something along the lines of 'yeah, sounds like he was probably born here', trying to go with the idea that not all immigrants are terrorists, that anyone can be.  To which the taxi driver chuckled and said 'problem is they keep letting them in.'  I might have said something under normal circumstances, but the last thing I need, as a disabled person, is for a taxi driver to refuse to take me home in the middle of a journey.  See, that's one of the problems, you can't always argue against this kind of stuff even if you want to because the situation won't allow it.  I can do little more than make vague noises in response from potentially racist remarks by a taxi driver, and someone else might have to keep their mouth shut when in the presence of their boss, or risk getting fired."

I also like free speech and the odd edgy joke. But I guess I'm a Nazi despite being Asian and left wing my entire life. This is so dumb 'be exactly like us and defend us or you're dangerous and problematic,' actually fuck off. The dumbest thing about the video is that it frames everything in the context of if all non-antifa are white...which is ACTUALLY racist unlike me going 👌 to say gottem"

"So what you're saying is, anyone who has a right wing viewpoint on something or does anything ironic or edgy is a fascist, pretending to not be a fascist. Now i know the left have officially become greater conspiracy theorists than Alex goddam Jones.   I don't think it's a good idea to correlate Western culture or Western values to white nationalism. it's kinda racist to do so. Western culture isn't just white. Hip hop and r&b for example are pieces of Western culture that are rooted in black communities, but I don't think white nationalists or fascists would want to persevere that."

"You do know that Antifa are fascists as well, right?"
"So marxists and fascists have been going at it for quite some time and are both horrible. One has taken over the right and the other has taken over the left! That's why identitarianism needs to be broken down on every level. So JP is on point. Also, it certainly seems like the left has far more power and uses the very small number of actual fascists as a distraction... however this video certainly has me thinking. She is certainly right about how hate groups cloak themselves as benevolent groups... Feminism, I'm looking at you!"

On one hand, I can see why fascists want to play the long game and using moderate arguments as jumping off points into further radical ones is definitely a thing that happens. Plus everybody underestimates the power of 4chan.  On the other hand, you really come off as paranoid by the end. You have trouble telling the difference between 'fascists in disguise' and moderates who aren't entirely left wing. It feels like you're seeing a problem that doesn't exist!"

Continues with 'Ah silly, you shouldn't think somebody is fascist because of some silly reason'.   Yeah. You stood on 4chan way too long for your own mental goodness.

Which is why, in discussion (with your alt-righty family members or whomever), we need to remind ourselves to stay polite and explain our viewpoint as rationally as we can. I think everything else will push them away from us and into the arms of fascists."

"I have a genuine question, if anyone is willing to answer: can one be proud of their European heritage and promote the values of 'western culture' without being labelled a fascist? I'm not and never will advocate for a white homeland but surely there has to be aspects of European culture that are worth preserving? or is it all just oppressive and terrible?

"Seems like a lot of people commenting on this video following the Christchurch shooting, and following the (partial) release of the Mueller report, Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court, and the beginning of presidential campaigns for the 2020 election, we're hitting some major turning points I think in how we discuss the institutions of this country and how democracy and various marginalized people are being affected.   ['As a trans woman'] I loved the most recent videos on trans specific subjects from 'The Aesthetic' (which certainly has themes relevant to other political subjects) through 'Gender Critical', but as we move closer to Democratic Primaries (with infamously trans-exclusionary coward and former HRC head, Joe Solmonese as new DNC Chief), I think it is time to shift focus somewhat as well back to these topics and things that all the communist kitties might divert attention from over the coming year and a half."

"When arguing with a fascist on mainstream platforms or even irl, I've noticed that they either go on the defensive or radio silent when I call out their use of white supremacist dog whistles while centrists are viewing or even engaging in the debate. I'm still not sure if this is the norm though, might any other liberal, centrist, or conservative comment their experience?"
"LMAO...calling Sargon a centrist..."
"the term western culture is not a dog whistle lmao. when people say it they mean liberal, egalitarian, meritocratic believes"
"Ok so the part of analysing facism as a whole was very well researched and explained but in the latter half most clearly the last part of your video it seems that you think of centrists as childern, even using a metaphor stating so. And that idea that we're uninformed thus influenced by all things facism because we havent seen the light of either left or right and just believe everyone, is straight up bs.  The reason I haven't aligned myself with either is because I have been so cautious, and because neither belief system speaks to me fully,  rather both posing different solutions and ideas of which some make sense and others are crap. Its that balance between the two that al least in my case defines me  not the absencd of knowledge or criticism on myself or others. I too see facism peeking around the corner but I also know that looming at the current situation there are some notable differences between then and now that will at least slow them dowm. And im not saying facism isn't a threat, what instead im trying to say is that sometimes  (predominantly leftists) have a somewhat irrational fear of all things that could have ties to facism more reminiscent of the red scare than healthy skepticism.  Take for example the countless allegations against Pewdiepie having ties to the alt-right because of two people made inside jokes on his youtube channel, Ben Shapiro and your personal favourite Jordan Peterson. While Felix has made stupid jokes and insensitive comments anyone tracking him will know he in no way thinks white people are superior. Of course these allegations are also part of the sensationalism of the media trying beat they can to get a story, but it non the less illustrates what im talking about, constant allegations against everyone desensitises people to facism, today Pewds was one, tomorrow Markaplier and in a week another poor guy, and hey those guys aren't actually bad so how bad could Mussolini have been?  The risk of following this all so closely and consistently crying wolf is if anything pushing centrists to facism by making it have ties to good people, also it seems I have now argued for what I first condemned; the fact that every centrist can be easily swayed... well I guess I now am just as much of a hypocrite as the rest of you... sigh.  The point im trying to make is that while not ignoring the red flags along the way we shouldn't curl up and fear tomorrow beacause of the relatively small amount of facists popping up these days, they were always there, now they've just gotten the means of communicating with the internet just like we have gotten the means to communicate and snuff them out.  -some guy with way to much free time on his hands for commenting on a video that has been irrelevant for months  (Edit: added some enters for eay reading)"

"Your definition of 'fascism' is highly flawed. Fascism is not necessarily a synonymn for white supremacy. Yes, fascism is nationalistic. But there can be Asian fascists, African fascists, etc.  I get your point, but you're conflating a few things. The nuts on the alt right do this a lot as well. It is always manipulative and unhelpful."
"Honestly, think about how patently dumb her arguments are: Someone denies he's a fascist = he's a fascist  Someone wants to disassociate from fascists = he's a fascist Someone pressures the marches not to invite fascists into their march = he's a fascist   How in the planet are this a good argument? She basically assumes her conclusion in which every person that she disagrees with (on the right) is a fascist by default, which is a circular argument, and you can never prove her otherwise. Are you guys retarded? Jesus Christ."
"Cumcell on Instagram is a good example of a fascist meme account"
"I want a beautiful world of real diversity. I want Africa to be African, Syria to be Syrian, Japan to be Japanese and Europe to be EUROPEAN. There is nothing immoral about this notion. I could argue that the philosophy that my family and folk come first is REAL morality and not disingenuous virtue signalling practiced by the modern multi culti establishment types. I don’t hate. I have a genuine reverence and respect for the different cultures and races of the world and wish they all fulfil their collective destiny. The fact that the flourishing of my people now and in the future is a controversial even dissident idea shows that the same respect I have for others is not reciprocated. To me this idea is non negotiable and I respect people of other cultures and races who feel the same about their people. This is real morality."
"I think the problem with your definition is that it is possible to call anyone a nazi. And furthermore, its difficult to see how you would distinguish a conservative from a nazi. I think that makes it an unusable definition."

"I love the idea that bigots will not be able to tolerate watching a transgender person, and therefore will not be able to learn from her."
"I've enjoyed some of your videos, but this strikes me as incorrect right off the bat. Fascism isn't at all restricted to ethnocentrism or white nationalism. Some scholars have even claimed that African history contains examples of indigenous fascism. Certainly this is contested, but my point is simply that fascism isn't defined as strictly as you lay out. See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism"
"I've come here on a recommendation. I've been in the 'right' sphere (what would be centrist 10 years ago), for some time now and grown tired of the same talking points. I've come here to give an honest listen, and must say, I enjoy the sarcastic and often absurdist humour. Still seems like 'you people' are afraid of a big alt-right movement that doesn't really exist. Well, it exists, but most people that get placed as 'alt-right' are quite normal people, like James Damore. And when even dismissing figures that go too far is a problem, I struggle to see what a proper way to act would be? It ends up looking like it is simply not okay to have a different opinion."
"Pepe is a meme. It is used by low life internet slaves, and yeah, was probably used once of twice by actual Neo-nazis. Equating internet trolls and 4 chan'ers with fascists in hiding must make the world seem like a scary place indeed. There are so many of them!"

"I'm very firmly on the left, but I still defend everybody's right to free speech. It's my experience that filth festers in darkness. The best way to discredit a viewpoint is to drag it, kicking and screaming, into the sun, where everyone can see how ugly it is.

"As a white cis male from rural TN, Ive had a inside look into casual fascism. Hell, when I was young and not nearly skeptical enough, they had me saying some of the stupid shit. White supremacy so normalized you are ostracized if you question it. I never fit in with the false macho nazis, but I look like them , so they dont hide their tendencies around me.   Ive been warning people for over a decade we were back sliding into fascism. Yes, back sliding. We fought the nazis almost as a projected distraction from out own ethnofascist society's atrocities.    I dont understand why so many people now pretend to be 'country' or 'rural' when they live in sub urban sprawl. But they do, fake accents, real bigotry, boots that have never been dirty and jacked up trucks they dont need to get home on their paved roads are just the surface, underneath is a 'culture' of dishonesty , cruelty and avoidance of hard work. They are too bust taking credit for the work of others to do their own. Like typical fascists. Everything they see as masculine is actually projected insecurity.   Meanwhile none of them value the traits I was raised to see as masculine : building, fixing and growing things that make everyone's life better. - A TN hillbilly who is tired of ignorant bigotry being synonomous with rural folk."
"17:57 is terrifying."
"9:39 I kinda agree with this, so I guess... I'm a fascist?   But seriously, it is rude to assume a person of color is not born in Europe, but at the same time even people who were born in Korea or China people will assume you not from there. This is not something I can ignore, and no I don't want to kill anyone who is poc living in Europe, I'm simply pointing shit out."
"I think you make some good points, but perhaps set up false dichotomies and slippery slope fallacies. For example, take the immigration debate. I support reducing immigration into the USA massively, but that doesn't mean that I would support an ethnostate or a fascist government.  You have created this idea that to not want mass immigration and to not want your country to completely, ethnically and cuturally change, is necessarily a dog-whistle to fascism."
"I almost got dragged into that stuff when I was younger thanks to youtubers who made all that feminist cringe stuff.

"I think it would be healthy for everyone if they imagined Natalie as a black woman.   Ironically, I think the conservative non-fascists and centralists listen to  Natalie more, compared to other Youtubers saying the same thing  can be credited to the fact she is white.   I didn’t understand why this video made the same arguments I’ve heard before seem so sound. When I imagine the outcome of my feelings of watching this video where Natalie is a black trans woman, it was different. I imagined myself dismissing it as an overreaction (or even a delusion). I thought I was just being an objective Asian woman when I didn’t agree but this is clearly proof that I cannot be objective in a life that is rich with variables.   I’m making it a goal to watch one of her videos every day during my lunch break. This will be a journey."

"After the Christchurch terrorist attack, I can finally say, that I heard the dog-whistles. And that is all thanks to this video. Thank you Natalie, you're amazing.

"Is this guy for real? I don't understand why he has to dress up as a woman to make this, uh, point? I still do not understand why it is so wrong to be white? I am white, I am a Latin, and I am an immigrant. I find it so ironic that there is more hate for the white race than any Alt Right bigoted group in the WHOLE world!! Videos like this just makes it worse because you do not distinguish between anyone on the right. You homogenize it all into one. I could only take 4:40 and shut it down."
"to call the Roman Empire Multicultural especially most other Empires Multicultural is very misleading when compared to today's society in what multiculturalism is.    The left has that kind of nitpicking, so using the left logic I can argue that the Confederate States of America was Multicultural because they had a higher number of blacks living inside their territories and as well as higher number Asians, Arabs, and Latinos that lived & even fought for the Confederacy. Yet the liberal still tear their statues down...    Empires were authoritarian by Nature, in  most Empires you didn't have the same rights as we see today and many free countries.  Multi-ethnic? Sure.  Multicultural? Not so much.   I don't think you understand the idea of nation states is to keep these internal conflicts at a minimal by separating people in too different homelands and territories. The word Nation itself means tribe or race of group of people."
"thank you for emphasizing non-white immigrants, it's tiring to see both fascists and centrists vilify foreign immigration, but always say 'not that type of immigrant' when euro immigrants are brought into the conversation like uggghhhhhhh does this shit really fool ppl?"
"They is nothing racist about having a 100% white nation if you disagree you you’re self are the racist"
"And sadly it’s well established in France and even starting here in Canada. Strategy 2: “Western values” and false comparisons with dictatorships.  S3: wayyyyy back in 1973 Robert Paxton showed that Vichy France was indeed fascist, but that’s still denied because they didn’t use the name. That debate still rages. And enrages.  S6: bad comedians, Nantel here, Dieudonné in France.  S8: that’s the effing worst! Our conservatives here say “we will take fewer immigrants but we will take care of them.”  S9: add also denial of intimidation. Most excellent summary and analysis, Sweetie! Brava! 🌸🌈⭐️❤️"

"Wouldn't it be better to platform the alt-rights, and debate them, and DESTROY them with FACTS and LOGIC, instead of deplatforming and shutting them down? I've once heard Zizek saying in one of his interviews something like 'If you have proponents of authoritarian ideology in your society, don't shut them down, let them manifest themselves as such'. And I already agreed with that kind of thing at the time.  Imagine some latent nazi like Richie Spencer or Stefan Molineux come up on stage and spew some bullshit about Europe and cultural heritage to, for instance, Noam Chomsky, who would in response calmly DISMANTLE their statements with a 1.5 hour lecture, ultimately dismissing their agenda as rotten from the foundation in front of the cameras. Wouldn't that be great?"
"Ah yes, the Left's favorite angle: 'forget the dictionary, *MY* definition of [label for anyone I disagree with] is....' By wholly making up a 'modern definition,' you can call people Nazis without saying Nazi; just cry 'fascist' in the broad, dictionary sense--how most people know it--while dog-whistling to other Leftists that ho-hum conservative #5136 is a Nazi. That's why the telltale 'strategies' are vague, like 'incrementalism' & 'humor'--stuff used by normal people to convey normal ideas. The goal is to tear down conservatives, not just 'fascists.'"

"You don't know what Fascism is."
"Yeah “all Europeans” As long as it’s not a poor country that’s Slavic because they are seen lesser than European. I love how fascists pick and choose who is a valid European"
"I don't know. I value accuracy of language, and I just think the word fascist should be reserved for people that support an authoritarian dictatorial government. It seems what you're trying to call out is white nationalism, as it seems you're well aware of. I think that label is pernicious enough as is. I don't see the need to jazz it up by invoking the automatic repulsion we feel towards the words 'fascist' or 'nazi'. Granted, there are some out there who genuinely are white supremacists, but I feel like you're conflating those people with people who hold views as moderate as supporting the curtailment of illegal immigration, and everyone in between.  There are a bunch of minor points I take issue with on top of that general critique, but I understand that your videos are intended to educate people about the current political climate and in that I think you've done a pretty good job, so thank you for that."

Most ppl don't fucking pay attention or they only start to pay attention AFTER shit tons of ppl have died violent deaths (like now w/ Christchurch). It shouldn't be this fucking easy to get away w/ shit, the alt right lies their ass off all the time about how violent they are and they just get away w/ it, god damn I wish it was as easy for me to lie to get what I want."
"If you think conservatives are fascists or worse for holding traditional conservative values then your well on your way to being radicalized. Congrats."
"Okay, I have a slight problem with the 'No platform' thing. I remember as a lefty student (bugger me! It was THIRTY YEARS AGO!) supporting my group in trying to shut down an address to the Student Union by an official from (then still apartheid) South Africa. The reason was 'We provide no platform for racists and fascists', but it looked to a lot of people like we were simply suppressing free speech on a university campus. Worse, while saying to genuinely fascist groupse 'You may have the right to speak, but we are not obliged to give you a platform' is all well and good, it can be abused-anyone can find an excuse to say 'That's racist' of anyone they dislike who says anything remotely questionable and then invoke, for instance, the 'No platform for racists' rule of the National Union of Students to refuse to let that person speak in any NUS affiliated student union ever again. Witness for example attempts to deny a platform to Ayaan Hirsi Ali on the grounds that she's 'Islamophobic'-she criticises Islamic society, she's not racst, but well-meaning people support efforts to silence and vilify her."
"Are there not 'fascistic' attitudes and movements that aren't specifically white nationalist or anti-semitic?"
"I don't get the idea of 'White identity' at all. None of the groups that are said to make it up either hardly ever interacted or never fucking got along. And maybe before these fucktards should acknowledge that the Norse were notorious for dipping their toes into the gene pools of every european group along the Volga trade groups. Thor and Odin are mixed race gods, fuck white nationalists and their refusal to lay down and die!"

"I had this friend who is gay and diagnosed w/ AIDS, I was appalled at the things he was saying on his new alt-right/alt-light “radio show” I tried talking w him but it just went nowhere fast & I had to block him out of my life. Can you do a video on this whole “other-ism” movement? I’ve noticed a lot of groups of people who shouldn’t support trump as his policies don’t actually benefit them, but they seem to be hooked on wanting to be “alternative” so they take up for it like how they’re trying to frame the alt-right as the new punk rockers when they’re anything but that.  Great video! Just subscribed! ❤️ Watch for the dog whistles and gaslighting ☮️"
"Is there a transcript of this? It's brilliant."
"Natalie you fucking crown jewel diamond in the god damn rough, I love you so much. This is still my favorite video."

"*Its okay to be white*"
"Soon these same leftists will demand that whites are put in concentration camps,just fucking wait."
"Firstly, you’re clueless about the definition of a fascist and fascism.  Get a pad and take some notes snarky one.  Fascism is not by its nature a European movement or a movement of White People – hence Japanese Fascism.  This alone invalidates all three of your anecdotal “definitive elements of fascism” which actually have nothing to do with what is fascism.    Fascism, in the abstract (i.e. removed from the political context) is a good innate human survival mechanism.   Simply put, fascism is the instinct of people to stop arguing among ourselves and to organize and fight together when we are under attack from an outside group.  This is why the symbol for fascism is typically, well, a fasces, which is a bundle of sticks bound together with an ax to form a single weapon.  The individual sticks represent the many individuals, the binding represents the bonds that unite them into a single unit and the ax represents the weaponry of the unity.  It is a symbol of unity and strength against foes.    Well that doesn’t sound like such a bad thing so how did fascism come to mean something horrible?    Simple answer: exploitation of this innate instinct by villainous leaders.  Certain villainous leaders in history, Hitler and Mussolini being two of the most infamous, used fascist instincts to quash all political dissent and to enable the leader to have near dictatorial control over the country.  These leaders preached false fear mongering hateful rhetoric demonizing specific outsiders and claiming their country was under attack and therefore must unite to battle their common outside enemy.  As history shows, this can be super effective in enabling the leader to effectuate policies that would otherwise be politically untenable, such as eliminating debate, starting world wars or a genocide that kills many millions of civilians.    So then fascism is always manipulative and bad?  Well, technically no but in practice the word is almost exclusively misunderstood and therefore (mis)used to signify something very bad.  Where has there ever been a non-manipulative “good” fascism?  Practically every time people come under attack, such as right here in the USA just a few years ago…  On 9/10/01 G. W. Bush's approval ratings were about  50%.  Days after the September 11 attacks, polls showed approval ratings peaking in at 92%. Political dissent was near zero for months, even among the largely left leaning media.  I remember days after the attack I was in a NYC bar among democratic professionals when GWB’s speech came on the TV.  Everyone  went completely silent in anticipation of his words.  Like the unison of a sports bar when the town’s team is playing a championship game, people eagerly cheered and applauded his every word as though they were one.  I bet not more than a few had voted for G.W. Bush just months earlier.  The very very few people to criticize Bush were met with instant aggressive hostility by nearly everyone.  I believe he then could have announced he had launched a nuclear attack of the region where OBL was believed to be and people would have cheered him as if their town had just won the world series.  Behold, the awesome power of fascism!    Now let me specifically state that I’m not in any way suggesting Bush was a fascist, only that he experienced the power of fascism.    The elements of a fascism, as in the manipulative leadership context, are a (1) dishonest narrative of being under attack by outside groups, (2) used to justify an emergency Nationalistic unified militaristic response, (3) and used to justify authoritative powers, (4) including the stifling of all dissent to effectuate political unity behind the leader.   This is why all fascist leaders in history were militaristic, nationalistic, free speech stifling mongers of fear and hate.  Richard Spencer’s video (the clips you played) is not fascist as it is simply a call for white people to identify by their common racial and cultural heritage.  He may otherwise present a narrative of being under attack and even hate of others, but that’s common in the radical parts of most all identity groups.  Nowhere did I see him call for the quashing of dissent or authoritative powers to effectuate a military campaign, though admittedly, I wouldn’t trust him in a leadership position.  Of course no one but Richard can know what he really thinks but I have not seen him say anything that could make him a fascist, though he may aspire to be one.  Neither have I seen him say anything that suggests he is a “White Supremacist” as that is a person who believes whites should rule supreme over people of other races.  He certainly is a separatist and a ethno-nationalist of the white variety as he wants whites who choose to have the ability to move to an white-only country.  I have also seen him advocate for a black-ethno-state.  You may disagree with him but there is nothing inherently villainous about an ethno-state concept as it’s both the justification for Israel and the justification for the historical rejection of European colonialism by many brown and black countries.  Are they all racist facist Nazi's too?  Of course not silly.    Other nonsense is your assertion that having others from a different culture in proximity to yourself can in no way inhibit your ability to be free.  This is a ridiculous overstatement.  Try moving to a predominantly Muslim country and living as bisexual cross-dressing trans white woman and see how long before you are thrown from a building top.  Culture certainly matters and so can race as most people use their racial/ethnic identity to dictate the culture they  should subscribe too.     You’re strategy 1 idea: That it is ok to “read into” (i.e. project) onto people what you suspect they really think by asserting any word they say is “code” for a different concept is a frightening and dangerous assertion.  Sure, people use dog whistles and code is a real thing but that can’t justify anyone having the power to assign to others what they really think only to then want to punish them for your projection of what you say they think.  That’s just crazy abusive.    For example you say when a person says “I’m not a fascist” you can interpret that to really mean they are a fascist because denying one is a fascist is typical of fascists.  So are you a fascist?  If you say yes then you are and we can punish you but if you say no then that is evidence that you are because true fascists deny they are fascists and we can punish you.  It is circular idiotic reasoning and is nearly identical to the hysterical logic that led to the Salem Witch Trials.  Yes literal witch hunting.    The second half of yr video is simply chuck filled with paranoid demonization of those you disagree with and your rationalizations of normalizing your right to project yr judgments on to others.    Honestly yr beyond help."

"I'm equally afraid of the Nazi right as i am of the far left. And I know you did that little Russian accent ironically at the end there, I appreciate that, but honestly I can see a correlation. Maybe not w/ people who think like you, but I do believe that there are political activists w/ dangerous ideology who are using the left as an avenue to push their agenda. And they use just as clever tactics and diversions and masks as these fascists. In fact, I think we're in danger of fascism on both extremes of the political spectrum. And I don't like it.  I know this country is in dire need of change, not only in terms of inclusivity but also in our economic model, but I can't help but feel like this desire for change is going to be used to offer us some sort of 'solution', if you know what I mean, as an alternative to revolution.  The left takes up the plight of the disenfranchised and fights for equality which are all good things on a social level. On a political level, however, I can see some of the same comparisons you are making btwxt the right and Nazi Germany, and the left and Stalin's Communism. How do you know that even if you are the leftest of the left, so left that you are willing to excommunicate former comrades who made a mis-statement to prove your worth and security as 'woke', to the point that socialism has indeed replaced capitalism and the outdated bill of rights  have all been updated to protect the disenfranchised working man, that you won't be lined up against the wall and shot, b/c you are not really queued in to the real agenda and have therefore outlived your use?    And you might say, well that's paranoia. And I would say, is it any more paranoid that believing that there is a real fascist threat to public persuasion in the first place? That the political goals of Nazi Germany are starting to materialize and take hold in America? But that they're limited to the underground KKK who has come out of hibernation and is manifesting itself again on the far right? Did you forget that some of the same academic thinkers behind the European rise of fascism amongst the minds of the people that gave power to the movement had to eventually flee persecution to the US? And that these same ideologies were adopted by liberal universities spurring the counter culture movement and communist theory once again in left wing academia, forming the more prominent liberal ideology of today and creating a new wave of liberalism that even old school liberals are finding it difficult to get completely on board with b/c they were the rebellious and independent hippies who don't like being told what to do?        ...I think not   Don't forget that the bad guys who own all the money have historically funded both sides of all the wars, Nazi Germany AND the UN and US. Why wouldn't they use both sides of this war? Divide and conquer."

"Fascism is a political philosophy from Italy in the early 1900's and is entirely different to National Socialism from Germany in the same period. It's just plain lazy or intellectually dishonest to conflate the two and even more so to compare them to the so called alt right of today."

"We need to do a better job of making it clear to people that it's not about blacks or gays or jews, per se.

"For the past few days I've had to tell my dad that you shouldn't kill Muslims just because you disagree with Islam (after the NZ shooting.)

After watching this video, I'm a little concerned for myself, since I think I've used some alt-right lingo without even knowing it. I don't wanna be cozy with the alt-right, especially when they want to expel me (queer and reconnecting with my Jewish roots.) I even went back on political debates on many social media platforms and updated my comments with warnings of unknown dog whistles.  I'll get better. I remember I watched this video when it came out and was kind of like 'that's silly!' now, I think that I was a bit silly"

"Oh my god, so much ignorance and propaganda in this video... Did you know that there were initially many jews in the National Fascist Party? And did you know that in 1933 Mussolini stated: 'Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. ... National pride has no need of the delirium of race.' ?  Fascism, at least ideologically, places little emphasis on race and anti-semitism. Fascism is fundamentally an ideology that aims to create a corporate and organic society, opposed both to liberal democracy and marxism, where everyone works for a common good, that is, for the good of the Nation. You are labeling 'fascist' anyone with nationalist and/or racialist ideas, just like the vast majority of the people of your political color.  National-Socialism (not 'Nazism' !) is the ideology that truly references race. But even when it comes to national-socialism, much of what has been said about it is false, if you want to know what NS is really about, read Mein Kampf or hear Hitler's speeches. National-Socialism may or may not be considered a variant of fascism.  I'm not going to scrutinize all the lies said in this video, since it would result in a very long comment, but I think that if you start to use the words 'fascist' and 'fascism' appropriately, you will come to the conclusion that most of what is said in the video is false."
"I am a Fascist, I’m one of the only Fascists that are open about that. Most of your strategies are true, I tend not to associate with other Fascists because of what you’ve described.  Most of them are plain hateful and use Fascism as a disguise to be a dick. However, from my point of view, most of what you’ve deemed excuses are things that I actually believe. Colored people and LGBT people don’t deserve to be treated like sub-humans, there is no Jewish conspiracy, it’s the bourgeois.  Yes I do believe in a white ethno state but I believe there should be free speech, that not everyone should be a Fascist, I advocate for LGBT rights, and against the systematic oppression of people of color. I believe the formation of such a state should be humane, I’m a White Nationalist, with the beliefs which you’ve claimed are just excuses but they aren’t. White Supremacy is the epitome of retardation and I’ve fought more Fascists than I have anti-Fascists in my life over this. In his book “My Life” Oswald Mosley states that he is for gay rights. Oswald Mosley in an interview also states that he was never anti-Semitic.  But Oswald Mosley is notably terrible with communication, in a movie about Mosley which is unbiased it shows that Mussolini had numerous Jews in his government cabinet until Hitler forced him to remove them. All Nazis are Fascist but not all Fascists are Nazis and I’ve dedicated lots of work to proving that to both Fascists and non-Fascists alike.  I am both horrified and disgusted at the recent shooting in New Zealand and I’ve arguably fought more Fascists and other more obscure ideologies who endorse the shooter than Leftists have. But assuming you’re right; What system to you propose in place of Fascism? (Edit: I won’t be a dick about it, I hang out around Leftists a lot and I’m very adaptable to changing my opinions)"
"I want to thank you for being a light of rationality in the discussion, I have always considered myself a left leaning  centrist who tries to stay out of the culture war. As a veteran I always wanted to keep my vow of defending everyone's rights to free speech and due process and both sides don't always have the same view as mine so I stay as neutral as possible. On top of that identitarian beliefs has never sat well with me in a country so diverse and so it's difficult to pick a side that tries to appeal to my emotional state. You are the first person who has made me truly rethink my stance on alt right speech. After the massacre yesterday in NZ I read the manifesto of the killer and found myself starting to become aware of the tactics used to make people like me accept fascism despite my resistance to it. When I searched for fascism on youtube your video was the most important that really solidified my move farther left from the alt right beliefs I had no idea I was beginning to believe.  Subscribed now and going through more of your vids to get some more informative advice on other beliefs I wasn't aware I was holding onto."
"Very interesting & informative: I'm learning a lot from it. Just a small point: at 8m12sec, when the subtitle is 'euro-nationalist', what's actually said is '*ethno*-nationalist'."
"Nice try, but fascism is 1.'Everything in the state'. The Government is supreme and the country  is all-encompasing, and all within it must conform to the ruling body,  often a dictator. 2.'Nothing outside the state'.  The country must grow and the  implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every  human submit to the government. 3.'Nothing against the state'.  Any type of questioning the  government is not to be tolerated.  If you do not see things our way,  you are wrong.  If you do not agree with the government, you cannot be  allowed to live and taint the minds of the rest of the good citizens."

All that art, literature, philosophy. Yeah whatever, they are great because of whiteness. Seriously, this is one of the most offensive things (to me personally) that Neonazis actually do. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just seems like they just think that all of Europe is a single monoculture..."

If your not antifa now your a step away from the hitler youth or the ss so jump on the band wagon now to promote an ideology you may or may not believe in or not. Good luck. Hahhahaha if something seems and feels wrong to you when it concerns how to treat others that you may not wish them to treat you the same way then it is wrong. Thats all i can say."
"Excellent video. Subbed"
"Speaking about symbolisms, I don’t get why the facists don’t fall back to the fasces (or was it fascis), the axe with the bundled stick. The word facism comes from it, and it is prevalent as a symbol for lots of democratic governmental iconography. In a sense, it’s like hiding in plain sight, you don’t even have to use the black, white and red color scheme as well. Then again i’ll bet because this is the symbol Benito Mussolini used for his brand of facist party, and of course old germanic symbolism is far more superior than from those dirty degenerate Mediterraneans, what with their oiled smooth skin, lucious curves, laid back hospitable charms, wild grape and olive scent,..... what are we talking about again?"

There are non-white fascists, e.g. in Japan, and white fascists in Europe who are more focused on their specific nations, e.g. in Ukraine. That being said, these guys are often in solidarity with white American fascists: for example, the Russian fascist philosopher Dugin believes in a multiracial pan-Eurasian empire that would include both white Slavs and Asian Turkics as equals, yet he supports the Alt-Right as allies against the contemporary world order."

"I have a suspicion this comment will be deleted but I'm going to make it anyway, this video is terrible, I was honestly waiting for the point when it's revealed as a joke, it's entire core is based around a No True Scotsman fallacy and multiple Strawmans. Fascism is a very complex ideology and there is no strict definition or really set of beliefs tied to it other than maybe Authoritarianism and Nationalism (I suppose this is probably just going to seem like 'Pedantry' huh.) I am a proud Fascist but I think that all ethnicities should have the same rights and that people shouldn't be discriminated for their sexual or gender identity (I suppose that you'll just assume I'm lying.) Also just food for thought if all fascists believe in European supremacy and that European society needs saving why has there been multiple very successful fascist movements all through Asia in places like China, Japan, Burma and India."

"Definition of fascism"
"Often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition   The Italian Origin of Fascism"
"The English words fascism and fascist are borrowings from Italian fascismo and fascista, derivatives of fascio (plural fasci), “bundle, fasces, group.” Fascista was first used in 1914 to refer to members of a fascio, or political group. In 1919, fascista was applied to the black-shirted members of Benito Mussolini’s organization, the Fasci di combattimento (“combat groups”), who seized power in Italy in 1922. Playing on the word fascista, Mussolini’s party adopted the fasces, a bundle of rods with an ax among them, as a symbol of the Italian people united and obedient to the single authority of the state. The English word fascist was first used for members of Mussolini’s fascisti, but it has since been generalized to those of similar beliefs.   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascists#other-words   or   watch this video for ContraPoints opinions & Beliefs"

"8:10 I once talked to a guy from NMR, the Swedish Nazi party (yes that exists, unfortunately) and he told me that he identifies as a national socialist. I was baffled, and said 'so you openly identify as a Nazi?' to which he took very much offense for some reason and tried to tell me how 'Nazi is a slur against national socialists' and how it 'has a negative ring to it'. Not kidding. It was overall not a very giving conversation, if you couldn't tell, unless for showing me how fucked up some people are in the head."
"When I say those talking points, I actually mean them.   I really don't what white supremacy over the whole world, or over any multicultural state.

I'm not saying it to cover up desires for ethnic cleansing or expulsion of non-whites.   What do you say to someone like me?"
"Could you do a video on Pewdiepie? He's a really irresponsible platformer who unknowingly exposes right wing content to his young audience. He thinks because one time the Wall Street Journal painted him as a Nazi for making anti semitic jokes that the media is just out to get him. It's because of this that he just shrugs off any legit criticism against him and doesn't think critically about why some of his content, regardless of intent, can be harmful."

"This video makes it seem that dogwhistles and symbology is what should worry us. I'm very happy with some of the perspective I've found on this channel, because it's one of the few that tends to have very well articulated ideas, but here you just sound paranoic and conspiratory. I think it's better not to call out people on hand gestures and obscure/hidden symbology, but to call them out on the bad policies they're proposing first. I think the better solution is to better understand why bad propositions are bad, and understand what are the things we'd like to prevent. I think it's better to learn to recognize fascist ideas rather that to recognize fascist people. Thinking 'everything a fascist says is wrong' seems like an uneffective strategy and a logical fallacy. Let's focus on the contents of the discussion whenever possible. People's evil intentions are hard to guess."
"another lovely video from that lovely woman! I am glad to have found your channel!  but you know your content is so good, its actually hard to follow for people, who arent as clever as you are and arent easily seeing subtlety. what I´m trying to say is that I wish there was more content like 'what is facism and why its destructive - for dummies'."
"The irony that they believe in a Jewish conspiracy while they create groups filled with cryptic language and plans for conspiracy against the common person of European descent on anonymous message boards by means of manipulation is staggering."
"I would typically identify as leaning right and potentially fascist as defined by this video. Yet, I am a biracial person that grew up in Canada. Is nationalism, the support of a monoculture and desire to preserve a specific culture intrinsically tied to race? I believe that culture isn't intrinsically tied to race and therefor many of the YouTube creators being accused of racism may not be fascists, and could be nationalists.    It is possible to believe that illegal immigration, multiculturalism, an over focus on minority rights doesn't necessary make for the best society (nation) without hating certain types of races, devaluing other cultures and wanting to strip minorities of their rights. I think having strong immigration laws, only accepting cultural values from other nations that could enhance are own, and not losing sight of the majority needs while still advocating for minorities are not ridiculous positions to hold."

"what the whole 'calling out fascists' thing does is that the people who get called out that way associate themselves with these beliefs. i have been called many things by leftists. alt-right. authoritarian. proto-fascist. fascist. i did not know whether i was alt-right, because its a vague term. i mean i like the discipline and ruthlessness of the nazis, their collective spirit, i think 'deutschland uber alles' is a great song, hugo boss appeals to me, i was part of a blackface tradition and think there was nothing wrong with it and i'm on the right allright. so perhaps that must mean i'm alt-right, right? maybe even fascist? i did not know, but i did start to identify as a social darwinist, because i think the 'comrade' who said that had a point: i like to use evolution to argue my ideas. of course most other social darwinists are fascists and it's one of the underlying pillars of fascism. so that puts me right into the same corner with them. how 'convenient'. so am i a fascists now? i certainly must be right?  i deserved to get called out right? of course all this happens while i don't oppose immigration or black people or anyone let alone condone ethnic cleansing or genocide. anyways i greatly admire and respect you and your videos including this one. I just wanted to give you some ideas because i think unlike the average reddit radical, you are reasonable and will be open to them. a lot of people are somewhere in between political extremes. that means that they probably like some aspects of nazism. Nazi stands for National Socialism. People who say they were socialists are of course idiots, but thats not to say the Socialism part was just a paper tiger. Also, 'comrade' Stalin killed jews too. Nistrovje. So please don't 'call out' fascists. the idea that people who belong that 'fascist' you want to call out as a human monster might be more similar to you than you realize. try to convince them they belong on your side instead."
"a couple points. 1. dog-whistling a popular misunderstanding of fascism.  2. 1:00 none of the three beliefs are inherently fascist. 3. 1:42 oops. 4. 3:42 wat? 5. 4:15 back to fascism. 6. 4:32 lol, Baked Alaska is a fascist? 7. 7:51 lol, Lauren Southern us a fascist? 8. 8:26 What on earth are you talking about?? 9. 9:25 misunderstanding pedantry. 10. 10:00 completely new topic. 11. 10:15 switched it up again. 12. 10:49 new to memes 13. 12:00 wat? 14. 12:43 yeah... not so sure about that. 15. 13:40 literally the only piece of logic in the entire video. 16. 14:11 lol, Fantano is a centrist?  17. 15:06 throws out term without knowing what it is. 18. 15:18 that was you 12 seconds ago.  19. 15:51 extremely bold claim. Good luck backing that one up. 20. 17:11 wrong again. 21. 17:25 giving up freedom is part of forming a civilization. 22. 17:34 good luck finding many examples of rabble-rousing.  23. 18:15 condescending assertion considering you're not either. It doesn't look like you've done any research outside of a few scrolls through 4chan(esk) Twitter.  This was REALLY bad."

"So police harassing black people unprovoked is wrong, true. Therefore harassing people you think are fascists is right? That's not how morality works."
"I feel like you could call Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, Jonathan Haidt, Bret and Eric Weinstein, and pretty much any members of the IDW fascist using this rubric. Why devalue the term fascism when you can instead point out exactly what you disagree with? If they make claims of races being biologically predisposed to actions BOOM, fascist; that simple. If you are an honest and intelligent person, you can simply point out specific policy outcomes and why they are flawed."

"The blue lives matter or 'thin blue line' flag has become another very common fascist symbol."
"Great vid! It's kinda scary to know these strategies are being implemented. IMO, the best way to resist a crypto anything movement instead of getting bogged down in the deception rabbit hole, engage the ideas at face value. If there are racist or harmful elements, be very critical, state those parts explicitly, and condemn them.  It's analagous to the TSA looking explicitly for explosives in baggage instead of profiling people. (They probably DO profile, but ideally they shouldn't)"
"Has anyone in the comment section thought about this. Perhaps the Alt-right is on the rise as a retaliation to societal decay and people want to halt it with radical means? Also it doesn't seem to matter anymore if you point out problems or rationalize things cause it ends up being taken as 'you're not in my group you are wrong'  'I am left wing you're right wing meaning you're automatically wrong'  'I'm a liberal you are not a liberal meaning you don't want freedom or free speech'. In the end nothing changes until the majority of the public decides to overthrow opposing factions and assume dominance either by force or subterfuge until IT will be demolished. There is nothing new to see here pass along."
"It is genuinely disturbing that some of the strategies used by fascists are common place in the country I live in: Lebanon (though I guess it would be Arabo-Fascism, Islamo-Fascism or Great Syrian-Fascism even Christiano-Fascism). All the political parties use some of these strategies if not, all in some cases, and this tells you everything you need to know about politicians in Lebanon. Only a few political figures from the independents are of any common sense, I guess. Perhaps what's most concerning is the amount of conspiracy theories around the Jews and the amount of hate some people garner from them. I am even regarded as gullible for not believing obvious crazy ideas about 'the enemy' as they say."
"KLANSEVATISM..."
"I’m a “centrist” and an individual and you seem pretty paranoid. Leftist policy could way more easily become problematic. It doesn’t matter how you personally interpret it, but as an American I find  the freedom of speech somehow helps everybody..."
"17:27 thanks I hate it"
"I want to stress that fascism is more than an ideological of racial superiority, but a decidedly anti-humanist project and anti-democratic political organization. If anything, the race thing is only a justification of those other two, of projecting one's own self-loathing and desperation onto others, of rejecting the idea that human being has any inherent value or dignity, of releasing one's own death drive into the world and establishing a new political order that forces all people into a rigidly stratified order."
"What's wrong with the ok sign?"
"1. Wrong. Fascism is not racism, fascism is might makes right. Fascism takes many different forms or aesthetics but the core values of fascism is that winning is winning, no matter what cause that wins exists. For example a fascist would see it right and good that a liberal dictatorship (if such a thing) came to existence, because it was forced and is unbeatable. It has used might and is therefore, right.  2. Same as point one, whilst those who believe in this lie or push for it to raid the Jewish savings may be fascists, the core principle still exists and gives roots to many other dictators.  3. See one and two.   Racism by itself is meaningless drivel, it has no scientific basis at all, so it isn't even mighty from a realistic point. One of your black generals may win a war that a white one would not, or make something useful. That you reject these people is shooting yourself in the foot. It may well be that your refusal to 'play optimally' leads to your downfall in that 4D chess game you keep on whittling about."

"Here's my problem: This same sort of thinking can be applied to similarly problematic results about people on the left. In this case, the prospect of a Fascist Dictator (from which Donald Trump is a far cry) can be replaced with a Totalitarian or something of the like. The feared end result is the disarming of the people, the stifling of opposing free speech, and the unjustified execution/imprisonment of dissidents. Something like that. But of course, prospective Totalitarians can't come out and bluntly share these aspirations! No, instead, they will begin the assault on free speech by gradually suggesting that silencing those identified as 'Fascists,' even of the covert sort, is justified. Some will even suggest that the use of  'self-defensive' force against such 'Fascists' is justifiable. Thus, the infringement of free speech, even if it begins with seemingly innocent 'de-platforming,' will grow in scope and magnitude. Similarly, these Totalitarians won't come out and say that they hope to disarm the masses. Instead they will use dog whistles like 'common sense gun control' and 'who needs an assault rifle?' to begin the process and expand the sort of political action deemed acceptable to centrists. Likewise, these Totalitarians can't come out and say that they wish to use the judiciary as a club against those who dare to act against their oppression. Instead, they will insidiously begin by asking that the masses 'believe victims' in cases like that of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Once this is cemented as a norm, they can levy such accusations (which may have originally been true) against any political opponent. How do you reconcile that threat?"
"She hit the nail right on the head! Everything I’ve been screaming about for the past two years- you’ve said in this video. Keep up the great work!!!"
"I forget if it was in Spain or France or another country but there was some political disarray with what seemed to be a nazi party and in another country a fascist party (could be Greece too not sure). But one of the leading politician for that party said these words specifically 'Yeah our policies may look like fascism but we're not fascists because we're not Italian.' Then they began to read and recommend 2-3 very popular fascist books."
"Nope. There is nothing racial about fascism. Sometimes fascists can hold white or black superiority beliefs in addition to their fascist beliefs. But you interjecting race into the definition is just as strange as the white supremacy people who also interject it everywhere."
"This bitch is being serious. Whoever wrote this script is a full fledged anti American scum bag"
"The only good fascist is a dead one."
"Nice video. I'm now thinking to myself to the parallels we got on Brazil and the facism uprising in the last election"
"So a thing you fucked up here is that not all fascists are white.  There black fascist ethnic groups in Africa that want to remove all white people and I'd have to say China is the most fascist country I can think of.  Anyone who isn't specifically Chinese and isn't ultra-rich is treated like 1950's black America.  You can't throw a SCUD missile in the middle-east without hitting an attempted ethno-state. In short, why did you tack on 'white' to your list of qualifications for 'fascist' when you can find groups and actual countries of every race and religion that fit the entire rest of your definition?"

"If those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, 21st century America is in worse shape than we imagined. Religion and Fascism go hand in hand....hence, White Christian Nationalism. This is the new Nazi party.     The analogy of you cross-dressing 'ironically' perfectly describes the whole 'Can't you SJW's take a joke!?! Gauuu!' BS they pull. The Right-wing douchebags have found a messiah, and they *are* recruiting 'ironically', indeed. Even Trump uses that gaslighting tactic.    The antidote isn't just engaging with friends & family IRL, it's educating them and debunking their propaganda, which is ample and often repeated by Dems who thought Hillary was cool.  As Michael Moore said, 'Everyone off the bench!' Get people who don't vote to vote Progressive! Every real American should be an Anti-Fascist."
"Watch Owen Benjamin. I think everyone who enjoyed this video should look him up. You would definitely enjoy him."

"Decent video. Didn't expect that. Although, the alt left does exist. Radicals that believe in attacking people and pulling random people out of cars just because they think they are the enemy, are no different than the alt right youre so afraid of."
"This is retarded. I came in expecting a rational, understanding point of view and all I got is 23 and a half minutes of propaganda; you could have make the effort of making it subtle tho. It's okay tho, at least you're all here to jerk each other out, good ol' group effect. In fact, my very comment will probably reinforce you into your ideology; and truly I don't give a damn: best case scenario some of you realize how indoctrinated you are; worst case I push you further into your hole so that the final clashing finally comes. We all know you people don't stand a chance, so the sooner you get your hands dirty and show your true colors to the rest of us, the sooner sane people can go back to their daily lives.   Take care tho, you're gonna need it."
"You are getting Fascism and National Socialism mixed up. Fascism or in Italian 'fascismo' meaning a bundle of sticks is the belief that the group is more important than the individual. One stick will break but if they sticked to getter they will never break, Think Star Trek. While National Socialism or Nazism on the other hand is fascism combined with eugenics and racism."
"i do believe that some sort of cultural unity in a country is essential. that being said, i do not appreciate people making me look bad by levying my sentiment for their racist purposes, anyone no matter of their ethnicity is capable of sharing my values and that background does not in any way shape or form influence their worth as an individual. I agree that fascist behavior need to be called out but i think that your reaction to those people is over the top as they do not pose any real threat politically speaking as the number of people that hold theses ideas is relatively small, even less those who would be willing to actively participate in any kind of violence. Lots of these people are only tired of pushy sjw behavior comming from many on the left and find themselves attracted to those who speak out against it in a, on the surface, rational way but would only need, like me and most of the people ive interacted with, to stop and think about the implications of what they are currently believing to find that its not the right way to go about things"

Then you can say, 'Don't be them, they're gross and dumb and here is why they're gross and dumb.' And then everybody's inoculated?

"As long as you aknowledge that: Communism (Extreme Socialism) = Corporatism (Extreme Capitalism = Dark Age Religions The Alt Left is closer to Dark Age Religion and Communism, while Alt Right is likely Dark Age Religion and Corporatism. Only difference between all of them, is the terminology and how they practice deception.  They can also be categorized as Absolutist Ideologies, which always hold 'Us vs. Them' and 'Good vs. Evil', a binary of absolute definitions. All Absolutist Ideologies have endgame which is to give Absolute Power to a small group of people, usually these people will be Sociopaths and Psychopaths, as normal emotions are not useful in attaining absolute power. Another thing about Absolutist Ideologies, is that they have endless number of enemies, most often identified as such by the Absolutist Ideology itself.  Also Absolutist Ideologies own material doesn't sell, which is why in the past, all Absolutist Ideologies resort to use of *violence, murder, oppression and deception* in order to propagate itself and rally the expendable human resource known as the rest of the society into self-policing through organization of 'Thought Police' groups, which will often go plucking citizens who are either innocent bystander or actual rebel element. Such ideologies are not above of using slave labour, they will either legalize it once more or use internment camp prison-systems, the radicalized common citizens are more likely to wish death on anyone who breaks the laws of the Absolutist Ideology.  The end results will be often the collapse of said societies, when the leadership devolve into different factions killing each other for power, until the least able ones remain who will drain the government wealth into their own hidden accounts and etc. Then the whole thing collapse. Sadly with all things, it leaves behind a power vacuum, which is then at worst case refilled with the worst of sociopaths and psychopaths with great selfish ambitions."

"there's a lot of great points in here but also a heavy tone of neuroticism, i of course understand the reasoning and the stakes but i also believe that there actually are a shit ton of trolls who aren't nazis,  i don't believe the whole thing is as contrived as you're making it out to be, it's an absurd moment of time we live in and there are definitely people who plot but the arrangement isn't as apocalyptic,   the idea isn't to give a megaphone to these people, the free marketplace of ideas is a critical one because you have to let the broader public decide what their opinions are, if the idea is fucking stupid on a popular level then it'll eventually be rationalized out of public consciousness,   to attempt to suppress the conversation is in itself inherently fascistic and part of the intolerant repugnance of the radical left which attracts the centrist voters you're discussing - the instruction of 'argue' with people is the wrong approach, instead just keep it light and discuss ideas  in recent times we've seen stunning strides in not only global politics and law becoming more inclusive but we've also seen the most egalitarian societies in the world established, it's not all bad - since the civil rights movement it's effectively been an adrenaline rush of empowered and diversified communities surfacing and succeeding in a historic wave,   i think the intellectual superiority approach determining that anybody who isn't on the left is either confused or evil is part of the problematic propensity for people to stereotype and categorize which runs at the heart of your issue; in paradox   ultimately i think pump the breaks on the killuminati vibes and maintain the focus on true victories that are occurring"

"One small piece of criticism from a fairly uneducated person, feel free to disregard if it's ever even read:  This video sets up fascism as 1:1 synonymous with white nationalism. It seems to me that white nationalism is a racially identitarian subset of fascism. While it's probably the most prominent, I think it's a mistake to set it up as the only form because such a close association may have the effect of people not noticing in the event that other forms (say, 'let's make a Christian theocratic nation by any means necessary.' This would still be largely white, but much less exclusively so, since the premise is different, but this can still be recognized as fascism) take prominence in the future. I agree with the point of the video. We should be against fascism, and we should therefore be able to recognize it. I'm just concerned that the focus on this one form exclusively may cause some to be incapable of recognizing it in others."
"It is a double standard that black people have their own television channel, history month and black lives matter movement when whites cannot. These are examples that fuel the alt-right movement. Until these things are recognized by the left things will be slow to change or become worse."

"'Who are you?'... I knew the Vorlons were fascists.  On a serious note (though someone smarter than me could probably make a serious analysis of the ideology of the Vorlons and Shadows in B5) : Yeah, you say 'modern fascism', but I still think you're being too specific.  More broadly, fascism is an anti-left authoritarian movement.  Different fascist movements vary somewhat in espoused ideology and particular tactics, but they draw from a common and fairly well known toolbox.  No single ideological point or tactic is share by all fascist movements (other than being anti-left), but there is a lot of overlap none the less.  PS: Shaun's voice is so great."

"I'm not white. In fact, one of the best things about my country and culture is that we fought the British away and did not let European influence into our culture.  And I'm a fascist. A nation state gives EVERY right that anyone has and it is given to anyone who is a citizen of or resides in a country. You'd have no rights if you had no nation state. So, if you're against nation states, you are a complete imbecile. I'm opposite of 'against a nation state'... i.e. I'm pro nation states... not just one nation state, but the very idea of what a nation state is... which is what makes me a fascist.  What is funny is, there used to be a time when there were no nation states and hence no government authorities to protect your rights. Back then, your kind could barely make your identity public. The best life your kind could have is in a secret brothel, from where you'd mysteriously disappear one day, never to be seen again. And now, you are throwing out 'fascist' as an insult. Pathetic!"
"while parallels between the alt-right ideology and strategies and those of nazism are very easy to map and widely known, there are also strong anti-decadence, anti-liberal and anti-personal freedom sentiments within alt-right thinking that have clear and distinct parallells with those arguments proposed by sayyid qutb, a radical islamist and fierce antisemite, known as the father of modern islamist fundamentalism.  his teachings and published ideas led the muslim brotherhood adopting the increasingly radical stance they did from the 1960s onwards, a primary influence on ayman zawahiri of the egyptian islamic jihad, who became mentor to none other than osama bin laden.  this absolute non-coincindence goes all the way to explaining why the alt-right, who claim so loudly and proudly to hate radical fundamental islamist ideology, get extremely confused when they realise Isis (et al) are slaughtering homosexuals en masse. they thought that was their great idea, so are uncomfortable with the possibility that they may only be suburban Isis-lite in khakis and white polos.  i can highly recommend adam curtis' superb documentary 'the power of nightmares (3 parts)'. the first part ('baby it's cold outside', often found on youtube) deals with qutb and the rise of islamic fundamentalism, but (as with all adam curtis docs) the series is must-see.  i also agree entirely with your comments re centrists (consciously or inadvertently) enabling, facilitating and even promoting the cause of the extreme and radical alt-right (neo-nazis).  hitler (a fascist, for all those who struggle with the idea) was helped into power by centrists and the conservative right, in a (fatally misjudged) attempt to keep the left from gaining political power in germany following the effects of depression. this why the very first people to be rounded up and imprisoned in concentration camps and forced labour camps by the nazis (soon after they were invited into government c1933) were not the jews, but leftwing activists, bolsheviks, communists and anarchists.  when wealthy centrists fear they might be obliged by a leftwing govt to give up some of their wealth (redistribution), to meet a crisis among the poor that has arisen as a consequence of wealthy centrists playing casino with state finances, it is always to the fascists they turn for protection.  hence no coincidence at all that the major post financial crash political shift of this millennium has been from centre to right. fascists and the alt-right (interchangebale terms) did not seize control (as hitler did not seize control), instead they were invited in by centrists in denial and in ignorance and fear that the consequences of the financial crash may lead to a rebalancing of the economy away from them.  a good documentary on this theme is laurence rees'  'the nazis: a warning from history' (episode one 'helped into power). again whole series is must-see, but that episode most relevant to this topic. this documentary is not on youtube atm, but the other places have it.  keep on keeping on, ContraPoints. am wishing you a fabulous 2019!"

"7:39 You are playing with fire there. People can easily mistake someone for being a fash just because of their friends or behaviour. There have been many false positives around twitter which caused people to be unwarrantedly ostracised.

"'This doesn't cause centrists to become allies with fascists, history show that happens regardless'  Typical leftist messianic complex.  'The strategic fascist knows it is better to start with realistic achievable goals.'  Imagine how much more effective leftists would be if they just did it too.  'Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.'  The same reason why leftist strategies work."

"I'm curious how should someone who is legitimately not a racist make it clear that they are not when they hold a view that most on the left automatically lable bigoted such as strong opposition to Islam? I dispise Islam for it's anti-liberal values but I am instantly accused of being a racist anytime I voice this opinion. At the same time the racists who just hate any outside group are being supportive, it's fucking frustrating. Islam is shit and we should be able to talk about it without having to get our blood tested to be sure we aren't changelings :/"

"Although I am a right-wing Republican, I do agree with you guys that the nazi alternative-right freaks are a bunch of psychotic loons.   Trust me, a lot of us regular right-wingers wouldn't touch those fascist freaks with a ten-foot pole, and we honestly hate it when we are associated with those inbred dumbasses."
"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH <3 Keep it up!!!"
"All I can think about through this whole video is: what are they convincing themselves is so great about their perceived white culture? The virtues of not being lazy, criminal rapists? I mean, I'm pretty ok with those ideas, too.  So if these and whatever other virtues are held with such high regard, why not be consistent? Why do whites get a pass every time they neglect them? Why are non-whites overlooked when they embrace them?  Is it really about virtues? Or is it easier to find a scapegoat than it is to not be a hypocrite?"

"*TLDR; Contrapoints doesn't know what FASCISM is and doesn't understand the alt-right.*  Your 3 main points have little to do with fascism, they are merely commonly held far-right/alt-right beliefs external to fascism. Not all alt-right or far-right individuals are actually fascists. This is an unfair characterisation, I know this because I occupy some corner of both movements/ideologies. You can have different opinions to mine, whatever, but try and be accurate. Your 3 points would be a reasonably fair characterisation of a large chunk alt-right. There are a lot of different ideas in the alt-right and a few of fascism too, the three points married to 'fascism' end up describing only a certain intersection on a venn diagram.    I appreciate the cinematic qualities of your videos, but the actual substance is all over the place. I don't think you're trying to be dishonest, but you really don't understand the right or the third position as a whole.  There are ancaps, libertarians, fascists, constitutional monarchists and others in the alt-right. The alt-right is a collective of modern, politically deracinated people with varying degrees of many opinions, they shirk the dogmatic conservative ideas for a whole spectrum personal ideology - racial concern is the only absolute commonality. The same can't be said for fascists.  There are fascists who don't care much about race. You fail to see that it's two different worlds quite logically meeting in the online political sphere, two ideologies melding in the minds of certain modern right-wingers. They're not one and the same, though there is an arena where that is absolutely the case.   If we assume you're talking only about people like myself, you're not wrong, but you completely lack nuance. To me this shows that you don't know much about the subject, only wgat your framework allows you to understand.  This abject dearth of nuance is evidenced in your inclusion of the Jewish white-genocide conspiracy, but no others. I'll afford you some wiggle room, obviously you're setting the groundwork, so I'll presume you know that the alt-right (which is actually what you're describing) includes others in white-genocide, like paid politicians, media figures and so on.   The problem is, this is supposed to be about fascism. Fascists place business interests and so on with near-equal primacy to Jewish anti-white plots. You wouldn't need to be a fascist to place great emphasis on all subversive forces (television, marketing, porn, etc.) that aren't explicitly white-genocide (they can be, but not every instance of corporate greed for example, is Jewery or an attempt to harm the white race) but deeply tie into the fascists concern for the health of the nation/people (same thing really), something that is less of a concern to (some) alt-righters, or is only mentioned when it pertains to white genocide.   White Genocide is a conscious attempt to destroy/ruin whites, with its genesis in Jews and Zionism, obviously involving all manner of bad shit, there's a degree of auto-pilot, it's like an avalanche started on purpose and intentionally manipulated. Fascists also really care about subversive things that aren't necessarily a Jewish attack on the white-race, granted they may well be related to the avalanche. I hope this makes sense, it's very important and you failed to mention it. Alt-righters are about this but it's not a universal ideological component, whereas white-genocide is. Fascism isn't explicitly white, the alt-right and white-nationalism kinda is - most white-nationalists are actually ethno-nationalists though, ultimately.  There's one easy way to recognise a fascist - ask them if they're a fascist....A fascist will tell you. If you're too scared if the connotations/don't identify with it enough to accept the connotations, you're probably not a fascist."
"Those fucktards who say 'fascism isn't racist because Mussolini said racism is bad' probably never read Julius Evola in their sorry lives.  Still there are 4 current things that make me fucking cringe about leftists everytime: - Leftist using the word 'neoliberal' unironically. - Leftists thinking that pepe is a political thing. - 'Fascists are a threat and they should be censored but people like me who want to kill the bourgoise should be tolerated.' - Leftists still thinking that white nationalists are actually a threat.  Anyways it's a good vid. But i think openly making them look like retards is a better option tbh."
"I thought this was going to be a serious video about people in alt right being schills not a lgbtqaii person talking nonsense."
"How can you tell if someone is a tranny ? Well they look and sound like a man !"
"The sad thing is that altough that I am a classic liberal at the center, when I don't agree with the ideas of SJW and presenting valid arguments and facts, in an instant I'm labeled fascist... This because when they find out that they can't win the argument they play the fascist card to discredit all that I say. Cognitive dissonance at it's pure state."
"Eco-Fascism is the answer"
"This video was extremely useful in making me realize how completely gaslit i was and how i fell for every one of these tactics. I was one of those guys going around saying 'guys the alt right is kinda iffy but we should hear out their ideas' and ' i dont think calling them racist is fair'.Jesus its honestly shameful how easily i fell for it."
"I really appreciated this video. I was a sucker for this stuff. I was in a right wing evangelical 'church' and I fell for all of this bull crap. I even defended what happened with the same rhetoric as trump. I had a rebel flag hanging in my room. I didnt even see it for what it was. My best friend and roommate was black and we both ended up at eachothers throat for it. I lost friends and everything following that trash. I didnt know it was racist and I let people convince me it wasnt. I even debated killing myself after I came to the realization of what I was supporting. So I pray that anybody that watches this video really listens to what you have to say. Dont fall for it. Great and well explained video contra!"
"A very late comment;  Great video, but I do feel that there's a huge downplaying of the outright paranoia seen in the left. Seeing racism and fascism everywhere is a huge part of the problem today as it alienates people a lot. The complete inability to see nuance in opinion is also a grave issue. If I were to call everyone who wants higher taxes on the rich 'secret stalinist scum', I'm pretty sure the response wouldn't be positive."
"I'm a bisexual centrist, so I'm everything Fascists hate, and I don't side with Fascists, I side with the system of law, and as long as Fascists follow those laws and aren't actively breaking them, they should be left alone. The other argument that I have is the one put forth by Arendt, that all radical extremists are inevitably more isolated than others, because to put yourself in the position of the few and the disenfranchised, one will often already be disenfranchised and isolated and only become more isolated through their opinions. A Fascist will want a 'tradwife', they will want to live in an all-white neighborhood, they will want to work with people of the same race, talk to people with the same beliefs, read books that support their views, teach their children their views, and Fascist political movements are often set up where business owners will hire within their own movement, offer housing from within their own community, and offer each other money to help each other build a strong network. All these things will further the isolation, further the disenfranchised sentiments, and further the rage and anger at the way the world currently is, remember that these people want a non-democratic system where a very defined group of disenfranchised people have all the  power to decide over everyone else's faith, turning everyone else into the disenfranchised. The only solution to this is not to mock, laugh, or push away and further disenfranchise and isolate these people, it's to break it and have talks, debates, and possibly programs that help them get back to where they were."
"Yeah because Fascism is totally restricted to the white race. How do you explain Imperial Japan, Argentina, Thailand, or any other non-white Fascist country? National Socialism is more focused on the preservation of race."
"In Brazil exists: 'I am not a nazi, because national socialism is a left wing politics, is socialism.' Yep, Brazil has a fascist governament now."

"I get what youre saying, and I agree. but kekistan was ORIGINALLY (key word originally) a joke. it was then quickly coopted by the fascists. I watched it happen and quickly abandoned ship once i saw where it was going. (this was back when i was a different person, before i had came out to myself)"
"You're channel is awesome, very glad I found it.  You are well-spoken, confident, and fabulous.  Drop the mic after 17min.  BOOM."
"Make a shorter video; my brain cells can only handle so much prolonged retardation"
"When fascists bring up free speech, you gotta remember that 'free speech' means the government doesn't put you in jail for what you say. It does NOT prevent individuals and organizations from refusing you services or a platform based on what you say."
"Love the shoes 🖤"
"I've rewatched this video a few times and I think you're creating confusion as to what fascism actually is. Why don't you point out the difference between fascism and nazism? Conflating them glosses over the fact that fascists can have non Jewish scapegoats and promote non-white racial supremacy and the implementation of non-white ethnostates. You're making it seem like everyday white right-wingers are more likely to be fascists than black supremacists."
"Your primary definition of Fascism is a bit disingenuous. A lot of fascist movements do not have racialism as their central tenant."

"I've been seeing the same patterns and strategies in the workings of RSS/BJP and all the upper caste fascism(the regular fascist citizens) in India. Sadly I lack your articulation and academic background to put my point across in an organised manner. But, I have noticed that there's a huge population of people who just don't want to hear, discuss or even think about this and the danger it poses. How would you go about tackling that?"
"Hey, Contrapoints, I've watched almost all of the content of your channel and have recommended it to some of my peers that might find your arguments very interesting here at UNAM at Faculty of Music in Mexico City.  Debunking Pewdiepie's channel as a videos essay on the phenomena of the massive amount of subscribers on his platform (which now I find sort of alarming), might have a possible beneficial outcome for the left since most of the audience really doesn't understand, or might remain skeptical (including myself up until recently) why he would be or not a fascist. Because of your video, I kind of confirmed what I always found suspicious ever since the media called him out as a nazi (the symbols he uses all over his merch and how most of his videos have these 'dog whistles'  you've pointed out.  I've been meaning to start an essay on this subject but I feel like I might need some kind of references like academic papers on neo-fascist symbology or heraldic in the 21st century to back up this, just to not sound like a conspiracy theorist. Could you recommend some if there are any existent?  You've made debating these subjects very entertaining to me. I'll sign up as patron.  Bye!"

"Oooooooh my god, it all makes sense now."
"Seems like you're focused on identifying fascists and slapping a label on them, rather than refuting their toxic ideas. Look at your own life and study your own changes in mentality and recognise that you are not the person you used to be. Cringe at your former ideas...the ones you are glad didn't make it onto youtube videos to embarrass you forever. Not everyone is at the same place at the same time and some are salvagable. Maybe such a brief education on how to judge everyone so they can be categorized isn't good. Love you videos, btw. I just believe that you're describing a fringe movement that is dying out...and by antagonizing its members we would just give them fuel to linger. Im sure I'll be called a naive centrist now...though Im a bit left of center."
"Tribalism or Tribalism. This is why I don't bother with this bullshit."
"I think a big problem with this video and leftist as a whole is that is doesn’t meet people where they are at. I like watching these videos because it helps with getting some great content from a different viewpoint but it doesn’t help me understand anything when you jump to conclusions like  Why is trump a fascist?  Why should I worry about people like Richard Spenser?  Why should we exclude people with unpopular ideas from debate?   Are their any more mainstream examples of people who speak in dogwhistles?  If I think higher taxes and healthcare for all is a bad idea am I just being fooled by fascist?"
"To be totally honest, I'm really glad that I'm gay. When I was in middle school I was drawn in through the memes and shit and 'ironically' spread that kinda shit. Then as I figured myself out more I was like WHAt I have the gay? And although I hope I wouldve been drawn out of it anyway, I'm glad any fascist future I had was totally squashed once I was forced to actually pay attention to the people I was beginning to think of as lesser."

"'Na Zdorovie! Keep up the good fight comrades!'   **home of the brave plays in the background** YOU SNEAKY!"
"it's so hilarious how these people talk about individual historical identities like, greek, Roman, norse, germanic, Anglo-Saxon, and Celtic and whatnot, and then just group them in as a single identity as 'white.' Like the culture of my ancestors was very very Irish, and I think that's cool and I wanna learn more about the history of Ireland and its mythos and culture, but that doesn't make me want to preserve some white identity because white as an identity is a really weird nebulous one whose only commonality is the understanding that this 'whiteness' affects the way you see yourself and others, creating power structures accordingly. The concept of whiteness itself only serves to perpetuate white supremacy and rampant racism. Yet one must talk about whiteness in order to dismantle it, because no matter how much people like to say that if something is a social construct it's not real, they're wrong. It's just real in a different way, and it's not useful to deny the existence of concepts like 'beauty' and 'justice' when their reality affects us every day despite their intangibility"
"So you're calling white nationalists racist and fascist now? Pfft those words have lost all meaning. What next, national socialists are Nazis?"
"You're not talking about fascism. You're talking about white supremacy."
"Socialism destroyed my country (Venezuela). Fascists aren't the only danger in the world."
"Ok ok ok. I agree with almost everything else, but it is unfair of you to put the iron criss in here. Did the nazis use the iron cross? Yes. It was used by the teutonic order first, however. It is a symbol for them to show status as a catholic knght of chivalry. The teutons are not white supremacists by any stretch of the imagination."
"Wow this boogeyman is really scary lady. My gosh! This fictious story of yours is really scary. Fuck you for calling normal people fascists."

"So basically all people how say or use symbols you don't understand are fascists. Gotcha Ms. Witchhunter."
"Lol so much witch-hunting you proud of your bullshit lady?"
"My ancestors did not have a very strong sense of their identity.  Like 90% of population most of my ancestors were simple farmers who considers themselves to be 'local' . Seriously, idea of nationality is so fresh that in 1928 there were still people in Europe who had no idea they are part of some nation, as in- did not identify themselves as members of that nation."
"You don't know what you are talking about."
"Thank you comrade we shall bitch slap these fascist biet cykas"
"I just discovered your channel recently and i have to say i really love your content and how your channel and characters have improved over the time. That being said i have something bugging me here.  It seems to me that the same way people on the alt-right go calling anything related to socialism, minorities and left activism as post modern neo marxists. You call anything with slight nationalistic views, and slight dirty use of rhetoric and defenses a fascist. And is not only in this video, i see you use fascist as a slur to anything pretty much right leaning on your channel.   And taking memes from 4chan and calling a fascist dog whistle just make you look like those experts in wsj or NY times. Of course extremists use these symbols, but most of all, 4chan is the place for trolling and shitposting in any way and direction possible. Most of the content i see coming from there is just pure shitposting, or trying to undermine an opposite idea by being absurd. It can be a toxic environment for sure, but calling these symbols as dog whistles for fascism is kinda silly. Most of people there are neckbeards trying to troll people."

"'Where an edgy shit poster hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people' God I'm crazy about this brilliant gal!"
"Ive been watching a lot of right leaning you tubers lately and I found myself agreeing with a lot of their positions especially when it comes to free speech individuality. However I found myself repulsed by their ideas about immigration and their generalization of minorities. I was starting to get worried that my thinking would shift to the point where I started agreeing with their ideas that once repulsed me. After watching your video I am not worried about that anymore because you have revealed their coded language and ideas to me.   Thank you  I do disagree with that we shouldn't engage with them. What is needed is people who can have smart debates with them without getting frustrated and start yelling hashtags. It would be far more effective to point out the absurdity of their arguments and then turn those into cool videos like 'Alt Righty getting owned.'"

"This is one of the most paranoid video I’ve saw on Youtube, and I’ve seen many from the “alt-right” paranoids. Implying that everyone with more right wing leaning opinions is a probably a nazi (ora fascist, as you use this word, but m’am, it is such a wrong use of it, like did you at least read wikipedia’s page on fascism?) is soooo lazy and so dangerous! You sound like the paranoid commies from the sixties when they talked about americans, and like the americans paranoids when they talked about the commies. Such a bad idea to listen to your opponent in a debate and IMPLY it must be a nazi and what is saying are just code words. I’m Romanian and I live in Italy and it amazes me the use you ignorant people have of this words: learn a little bit of history, for God’s sake! Anyway, history ignorance apart, what you’re saying still remains dangerous and misleading. Not judging people’s opinions when trying to debate them, but assuming they must be this and that so you can call them names when you needed? Yeah, totally “liberal” strategy over there! I liked other videos you’ve made because I focus on your words, not you as a person of this race, this gender, this ecc. but I extremely disagree with you on this one, and not because you’re a “libtard”, but because you said wrong and dangerous things."

"There's a lot of focus on the racial element of fascism in this video, but even the definition mentions it as more or less, an addendum.  'a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition'  The last portion is what defines fascism, particularly 'suppression of opposition.'    Most of this is about racism and bigotry, which are both terrible, but let's not confuse terms, because fascism and authoritarianism are more dangerous than racism and bigotry.  Anyone can be a fascist and we should all make a conscious effort not to be."

What we should be telling people is to verify every 'fact' that is told to them, I can't tell you how many times I've told someone the truth and then they come back a week later talking about how sharia is going to take over Europe, as soon as I'm like 'okay show me some proof of why you think this' they become befuddled"

You think leftist violence is okay and thats what nationalists hope for btw. Live by the sword,die by the sword.   Black men 6% of population 50% of murderers.   Transatlantic slave trade was 70% jewish owned and you can read about it in their own words.  White men were the first race in the world to legally outlaw slavery after thousands of years global practice. (Still exists in the Arab countries)   This is the channel of bottom feeders. Youre a destructive degenerate and the path your on is the road to misery and failure as is always the case with marxism."

"You can’t go arround calling people nazi’s without proof, this is ridiculous"
"I think there is at least one thing in every ethnic culture to be proud of. And there is nothing inherently wrong that being proud of your ethnic background. But to use that pride to justify horrible behaviour and beliefs is ridiculous. It definitely is a sign of European-centric thinking because that ignores the rich history of the native peoples of Iran, India, Egypt, Mexico, and Zimbabwe as a few examples. There is absolutely nothing special about Europeans."
"I'm loving your work Cheers from Brazil 🌈✨"
"Sometimes it takes a video like this to realize how susceptible one is to propaganda and snowballing persuasion. I think this channel is part of my disillusionment out of the 'Anti-SJW' videos that got me hooked several years back, later leading to a rabbit hole of conclusions that I didn't consciously come to."
"I am butter before you. My heart is a frightened sparrow."
"I actually got hit with the not being believed when pointing out Nazi dogwhistles. I saw someone on twitter who had a frog and okay sign emoji in their display name and advised someone not to bother bc they’re a Nazi while pointing out said dog whistles... and then was told I wasn’t helping. :|"

"At the same time we have to admit  how impressive Western culture is and how much it has advanced. It is very self reflective and is able to absorb a lot of criticisms, and in turn develops.

"My girlfriend's creepy uncle is the biggest normie of normies who doesn't have his own computer or internet access and he keeps picking up alt-right talking points.  As a Slav it's very easy to see how much gas lighting Nazis engage in.  Right now they're pretending to care about Poland, but they think Slavs are all degenerates who will exterminate white people while being controlled by Jews."
"So being a fascist is like being into esotericism,   just instead of middle-aged single moms in denial about their worthwhile life being over it's young men in denial about their worthwhile life being over.   We can really blame nobody but god for this. Let's all dress up as women to mock him."

"Also, as a person from Poland I find the 'na zdrovie' joke about commrads/communism shameful. On one hand you are against neo-nazis who are racist. On the other you make a jokey reference to a dictatorial regime responsible for deaths of tens of millions. Yes, you didn't just refer to communism. You refferred to USSR, which after WWII (when allies said 'fuck the eastern europe' and pretended Stalin isn't as evil as Hitler) oppressed and murdured people for decades. DECADES! Poland managed to have their first free election in 1990. Peole who earlier negotiated with the government and asked for assurance of their personal safety (not being accused of false crimes and punished) had exactly that happen to them. I want to slap you when I think of actual people who got murdered/imprisoned/sent to work camps/were tortured by that particular regime not so long ago. And it's a joke to you? REALLY?! Would you laugh if someone on the right did a Nazi salut!? WOULD YOU?! At least have decency to refer to Marx instead of USSR, China, Cambodia and other places of genocide, repression and misery."
"I don’t agree i think agree with you or with the « fascist » video and why the heck is ur channel proposed to me?"
"Western Culture isn't a dog whistle, what the fuck?  Was the Enlightenment racist?  So far as I understand is Western Culture is a euphemism, its one for the Enlightement.  Hitler hijacked socialism, yeah?  Well, consider the possibility that fools like Richard Spencer are trying to hijack 'Western Culture'. Don't help them."

"Aaaaand you just made up a definition of 'fascism'. Well. I guess that explains a lot about this video. After all, traditional definition of facism would include leftists and stuff (and god knows we can't have that. That would be factual. Like... fascists can be on both sides of the political spectrum.)   This, of course, may be difficult to grasp as left and right mean different things in different places. For an American, right wing would be capitalist+low taxes+religious+patriotic (and a few other things), but the core is capitalism. That's the defining quality. For quite a while in Europe the defining quality was nationalism/patriotism. That was what got you classified as right wing, even if you were a socialist... I know. I was confused by it as a child too.    Here is fascism checklist for those interested: - authoritarianism/dictatorship tendencies - militarism - patriotism/nationalism (that can devolve into racism - but doesn't have to!) - zero tolerance for any divergent ideologies - The Party exerting significant control over social and economic life of the people (low freedom) - Statism + corporatism (state control of er economic/social aspects of life. Economic Statism would include state-owned enterprises and socialised services. Also regulations and interventions into private sector). In short NOT CAPITALISM.   Did you hear me? Capitalism by definition is NOT fascist. You should have known it from high school, for crying out loud! Don't you read? What you call 'right wing' in USA is NOT fasist.   Also, you made up a definition of a 'nazi'... WHY? Nazis hated most people (including whites). Yes, they considered most white people to not really qualify as human beings (some were meant to be exterminated, some turned into slaves). People you are talking about are WHITE SUPREMACISTS not nazis. How do you have so much difficulty with using words and understanding their meanings? Every nazi is a white supremacist but not every white supremacist is a nazi. (and that's just for starters....).  Words exist! And they have meanings! Please, do try to use them accordingly. I'm so fed up with the word fascist being exuated to white supremacist. That's racist! Anyone can be a fascist! In the 30s in Brazil you have Plinio Salgado (Brazilian Integralism). You have Columbia in the 20s. Costarica in the 30s? How about Mexico after 1929? Rings any xenofobic, racist bells? Ever heard of Gold shirts? Japan in 30s and 40s was close to fascism. Kuomintang? Kateb Party in Lebanon? Ossewabrandwag?"
"Alt-Right:  Hmm maybe we should try Nationalism one more time.   Come on guys, it's not like Nationalism caused 2 World Wars within 30 years, barely 50 years after becoming an accepted ideology. It's not like it caused countless genocides and wars outside of that  pretty much every time it's attempted either! Iraq, Libya, Argentina, Serbia, Egypt/Syria (Arab League), Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and of course Germany, Italy and Japan all entered self destructive Nationalist pursuits in a singular century. This list doesn't even contain all of the Nationalist regimes who entered into damaging campaigns against their own people under pretenses of removing 'troublesome' ethnic groups or political opponents by force such as Uganda under Obote, or ones that incited civil wars such as Franco's Spain.  Also the Alt-Right: How dare you suggest we attempt any form of socialism, it'll never work (Despite the US and UK's most popular leaders (FDR and Attlee) being very socialist)!"
"I love all these points about how to spot insincere, coded bullshit from White Nationalists. However, I think using the term 'Fascist' to describe them might not be the best way of going about it.  Let me be clear: BOTH groups are awful (Fascists & WN), but 'Fascists' aren't always White people. Fascism can be a political movement that specifically undermines democracy & oppresses certain groups, yet still include groups besides Whites. I'm only saying this because given the day that a movement arises that is Fascistic, as long as that movement can say 'well, we have Black/Latino/Asian/etc. members within our group,' then they can weasel their way out of being called Fascists if we define it as a group wanting to establish a White ethnostate. Just saying.  These people are White Nationalists."
"Hate sucks 😭"
"I have a centrist friend who doesn't vote and is openly apolitical. I was talking to him about the neo-nazi rally in VA and he says that both sides were bad. Apparently he thought that the liberal counter-protesters (didn't know the name Antifa) drove a car into the Nazi protesters, when it was in fact the other way around. I believe that his disillusionment with politics led him to this kind of ignorance and that it's actually dangerous to us all."

"Freedom of speech is not freedom to engage in criminal conspiracy. I don't think it is accurate to call fascism a philosophy when it is nothing but criminals conspiring to rob and murder people. Because the ultimate end of the road is murdering everyone they don't think should exist and taking everything that belongs to those people. For the fascist it's about the crime they want to commit and everything else is circumventing or removing anything that stops them. Stop being fancy about this we are just dealing with criminals."
"I find your video funny and interesting, however I cannot help but notice the fact that the proclaimed beliefs of fascists seem more aligned with race than what fascism as an ideology actually involves. Fascism is an authoritarian movement centered around state, and does not involve queues like those of Nazism which include racial and cultural warfare. Fascism as an ideological movement believes in absolute state control under a powerful and authoritarian ruler, who will hold the nation together through unified national interest. Basically everyone works for the state, and the state controls everyone in turn. This obviously has the potential to lead towards misuse of authority (as it was in history) much like any absolute authority in history. But Fascism in and of itself does not fight racial battles in their tenents. That is what I've learned in academia anyway, though I am now in a form of interrim process due to mental health. Overall however, I found your video fun and enjoyable to watch, even though I do not agree with your portrayal of fascism as what it is commonly referred to. I understand that the definition you use has been changed from tradition most likely due to political and cultural language evolution, though I do not believe that is a good thing personally as it could warp our understanding of the past. I prefer the creation of new words when discussing hybrid ideologies as opposed to warping already existing terms over them. I do not want another incident to happen when yesterday's historians blended modern economic principle such as communism, market economy, and capitalism to the workings of the ancient world. I do hope you read this, so you can maybe understand my point of view. If you do, feel free to discuss my view with me or privately. I wish you the best of luck, and your skits are very funny.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_(insult)"
"Any video that works to fight against Fascism but doesn't address its essential class-struggle origins in the first 5 minutes can sow division.  Even though there are some very useful strategic points in this video I'm not keen on it for this reason.    IMO, to be effective, for example like Gilets Jaunes, the left must understand why the alt-right is attractive to the working class and address it. I'm not special. You're not special. The people who fall for the alt-right message are just surrounded by a different context of messages (designed to divide) and they're angry because they can't pay their bills.  I know she addresses this point at the end of the video but by then any person going in the alt-right direction would have already been alienated.  The working class can't win divided. I'm not a fan of any video that doesn't offer a path of redemption for the people that fall into the alt-right."
"Anyone not agreeing with my Leftist views is 'Alt Right', especially if they are to the right of Lenin..."
"That CRT image of you in a MAGA hat is one of the most unsettling visuals I've seen on Youtube, and I've seen The Alphabet by David Lynch. Awesome video!"
"Those three tenants are wrong once you realize that places like India and the Philippines are essentially governed by fascists."
"While some of this (might) be true of some supporters of the alt-right movement, how big of a group do you think it is that believes these things?  The most liberal study I could find claimed that 24,000,000 people were aligned with the alt-right movement.  That's ~7% of our current population.  At the same time, leftists are calling anyone with right-leaning ideals 'fascists'.  That would be the equivalent of saying that if you vote Democrat, you belong to Antifa.  I think it's important that we don't just lump everyone into one derogatory category, and instead be inclusive, courteous and civil.  Just remember that there is a whole spectrum of people, personalities and beliefs.  Best wishes."
"You are confusing fascists with white nationalists. Further assuming that everyone's a crypto-fascist is lazy and intellectually debilitating. An argument stands on it's own merit, you should address the idea instead of making assumptions about the person."

"As a young and impressionable moderate independent centrist whatever I am now extremely paranoid about being fed these secretly racist ideas. As I started watching more conservative youtubers and not just liberal/independent I've noticed these subtle ideas that were mentioned in this video. Hopefully I'll be able to catch them quicker now and to use logic to explain why they're completely ridiculous."

That makes it sound like you also support not being upfront about what your policies are supposed to lead to, which I think is still a bad ploy no matter what for. Granted that what Conservative already figure in many cases( ACA being just a means to eventually implement nationalized healthcare or calling for restrictions on rifles, but eventually wanting all gun ownership gone)"

"'Fascist only about their race' - WRONG !!! Fascist in my country don't have problem socializing with black people if that's serve their purpose. They hate them behind their back, but still socialize as a front to mask their racism. And infiltration in left wing movements is their basic too. Infiltrate, ascend and then undermine and in the end show their true color."
"I agree with everything except 20:45  You shouldn't avoid giving a platform, then you can make this argument about literally everything you don't like or think has a negative effect on anything in any way  In other words, don't allow commercialism, don't allow money, don't allow religion, don't allow negativity, don't allow billionaires, don't allow liars, don't allow anti-free speech people, don't allow any of the previous a platform  That's contradictory of how society should work  It should promote discussion and ideas, not be based on predetermining everything and then disallowing everything else  That is actually fascism"

"The Nazi were socialist lefttist....they took the democrat jim crow laws and used the verbatim for their nuremberg laws...just as the slave-owning democrats have tried ever since losing their slaves to regain control over people through economic and social systems...this video supports global socialist control...a slavery that is based on twisting history to fit their dogma just as the bolsheviki and nazis in the past... modern cultural marxist like this presenter or shills for this ideology and survive due to group think and identity political tactics...the title itself shows their violent attitude...'how to spot your enemy'"
"Good job getting Shaun"
"What a well made video! It will be interesting to see the strategies and counter strategies develop over time with the ever more online society. It seems highly likely some kinks in the armor against fascist internet based strategies will be exploited and lead to an atrocity before these exploits are highlighted like in this video. More of this thoughtful analysis will probably do society a great service. Thank you."

"Trying to find one video you made dressed as a Nazi where you talked about the behavior patterns of the alt right and their internal workings why it appeals to them ..it was about how they maintain their identity and how these tools draw others in .. Was that video pulled ?  It dealt with the language they used and symbols used ... it seem aimed at the 4Chan people Love your videos"
"Idk. After watching this I kinda feel like I should stay out of all this debate both political and social. The fear of being seen as a nazi or paranoid leftist."
"Id like to point out facism is beneign, yes i prob spelt it wrong, kill me. Facism is the use of using the state to enforce a or any political ideology, ie whats good for the state is good for the people. So anyone for what ever reason if the use the means of the state is a facist, the state is an instrument the state itself cant be facist nor a federation, unless expressed explicitly so.  Contrapoints prove me wrong your not a facist, i know i made the accusation so the burden if proof falls on me, oh wait kinda like you on calling white nationalists facists, in fact most white nationalist dont want anyone to be able to use the state as a means of power hence there need to limit goverment, in fact by seeking to limit the goverments powers thus the instrumental power of the state ensuring the states power cannot be used against the people is in fact anti facist, so ironicly most white nationalists are anti facist and you in fact are the facist but you would deny that fact even though the pure definition of facism is using state power not limiting it as white nationalists would limit state power.  What you call facism amongst white nationalists is but seeking freedom for freewill, look up the etomology of freedom and you will understand what i mean.  The concept of freedom is white or european, its a free domain without restriction save for justice for all yes even you and your ilk.  Facism is so thrown around so easly people forget it actually involves the collective power of the people throught that state, thats what facism is, it existed long before white nationalism and (((them))) ;)"
"You pointed out what the Alt-Right does point by point. I would argue that you did a good job of that. But when it came to 'what moderates can do' you gave some very generic comments and even implied that going towards a more left authoritarian direction would be good. This is at least what I got and I think this is the main problem with the left. They are good at pointed out, usually valid, problems but can't present a practical solution that is acceptable from the center."
"20:35 mark: All these years, I was thinking the left is the more wise one, better at intellectual stuff, smart. Seems Ron Paul has taught a great lot about conspiracy theories. Everyone is conspiring, knowingly or unknowingly. Lol. You really think morons who can't do basic math, follow simple logic, support flat-earth, oppose evolution.... You seriously think this bunch of nincompoops are so exceptionally good at hiding in plain sight? What next... Illuminati? May be Lincoln masterminded Sep11?   This is some serious nonsense.

"As a brown skinned 'ex-pat' from Chennai, I feel that your thoughts are extremely degrading, insulting and dehumanizing to me and my siblings whose origin is near Kasimedu (S.N. Chetty road).  You seem highly focused ONLY on the white supremacist. There are supremacist ideologies across this globe. I'm fairly certain that at my last visit to 'koothaandavar kovil vizhaa' (a festival attended by a huge number of persons like me), I did observe at least a couple of voices that were 'trans-supremacist'.  You need to realize that there are bad ideologies (like the one you're so passionate) across the spectrum and across geographies and across centuries.  I use the golden rule. Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you. Would I want myself to be viewed with doubt for a frog face meme?   A better credo I try my best to live up to:   இன்னா செய்தாரை ஒறுத்தல் அவர் நாண நன்னயம் செய்து விடல்   I plead with thee... Don't view humanity as groups and fight for group rights. We are all each unique individuals and should each be held accountable for it actions. We can't be deified or shunned for being part of a group. No. It's not sensible.  Allah Hafiz"

"The ok symbol has been used by many politicians. I wonder why... And its not even called the 'O.K' symbol, its literally an Illuminati symbol, aka 666. The Illuminati uses this symbol for deception. Symbolism is a key language for the elite to deceive. This left/right bullshit is exactly that. Bullshit.  Please read books by Fritz Springmeier. Truth is only what matters."
"That black sun ring is p dope where can a fashy goy like me😎 get one ?"
"@ 6:25 This is a specific point I also relate the argument that people will vote for a candidate simply appealing to one of the lowest common denominators money. By tricking people who only go by bite lines of lowering taxes somehow benefiting them when the changes in tax structure that has taken place since the founding of this country to favor the upper class more and more and are hurting the poor, workign poor and middle class more and more. They deceive people in those classes to vote for things hurting themselves and apparently this has also been a direct tactic to obfuscate the oppression of people of color as they had to be more and more vague about the language they are using until it gets so lost we are talking about different approaches to economy with uniformed and ignorance and misinformation instead of how it actually functions or it's roots in oppressing people."

"I am not a centrist but the left needs to strategize if they want to win and accomplish goals. Rebrand the wall and make the repubs legalize pot to pay for it but only if a Democrat wins in 2020. No win, no wall. And also, footrubs for migrants would be nice. Make the border humane. If we demand it, we might get it but it comes at a cost. The left has to give something to the republicans that might not be ideal. Why not humiliate them which is clearly what they are after?"
"Simply,.. No"
"I really don't agree with the point where you say that we shouldn't debate with fascists. It's like avoiding an argument because you know you're gonna lose. This will actually work in the favor of Nazis as they paint you as the kind of people that suppress the enemy instead of facing them."

"These pathetic losers imagine that they have some cherished, privileged, enlightening information, but they've been completely corraled and manipulated into the exact cookie cutter army of incels that the puppetmasters designed to further their political/monetary agenda and goals. There are plenty of all white nations, but they want the US to bend to their whim because they hypocritically can't hang with or assimilate to an actual European culture, and they're too stupid and lazy to learn another language. These idiots keep their inane, redundant, paradoxical propaganda imbued neo-nazism very thinly veiled, but they think they're being slick like they think they're 'enlightened'. However, if you suspect them, and you're white and straight, they will definitely feel that you will be safe to speak to about their uncensored sentiments/dogma in private PMs, texts, phone calls and one on one  conversation, especially if they've known you for a while.  This video is one of the best and most comprehensive of its type that I've seen on the subject. I am not sure that you got EVERYTHING spot on, but practically. The 'OK' sign and many other mundane, everyday gestures are often used to identify 'deep state cabal' members and 'Satanic illuminati' henchmen. I have heard one particular 'friend' who was sucked down the rabbit hole, comment that the👌/OK symbol is now representative of '666', the generic, Western centric, misguided/self-absorbed/misinterpreted view of their great 'Satan's special mark. Satan means ADVERSARY in Hebrew, but through a lot of unintentional and intentional convolution, conflation and mistranslation, 'satan' became an actual central demon figure, and many characters were renamed and reconfigured into an amalgam that is the misguided 'Christian's 'Satan', who they mistakenly believe people who do not even share their culture, somehow worship. There are also many locations that were all consolidated and renamed 'Hell', and its modern depiction and aesthetics are derived from more modern art, plays and literature. 🖖 They have gone as far as to say this 'live long and prosper' Star Trek sign is a sign that 'Satanic Jews' use. You can find endless videos about this, and despite trying to fence-walk, they will post a bunch of supposed instances of these symbols being 'flashed' by celebrities and people of different ideologies. I inquired about what purpose flashing those symbols would achieve, and the alt/far-right propaganda narcotic addled mind cannot give any sensible answer, and the best I've got is 'so people become desensitized to it'. Their whole personalities and ideologies are in constant metamorphosis, because the shadowy political figures, public political icons, nazi forum leaders, Russian trolls, anarchist trolls, etc. have to constantly update their hypnotized lemming loyalists' alternative realities to keep up with and explain actual reality and current events,, to keep them addicted and captivated, and to try to make a lot of the outright paradoxes in their indoctrinations somewhat explainable. I have 'friends' of many, many years who flipped to alt/far-right culture who would be the last people on Earth you'd ever expect. And the insidious agenda takes many forms, it wears many disguised to capture different interests, demographics and cultures/subcultures. The bottom line is racial/sexual/xenophobic hatred, but they have different personalities to pander to all walks of life. They have the 'incel' pied pipers, the Christian crusader pied pipers, anti-Christian (and of course Muslims and Jews) pied pipers, Eastern esotericism/mysticism based pied pipers... They have a customized alt/far-right neo-nazis fascist rabbithole for the bastardization of all walks of life, and some of them seem very unlikely and very different from one another, but all of the bait and rabbitholes lead to the same final destination, and their shared rabid hatred draws them much closer than their differences push them apart. The figures and interests that push this brainwashing agenda want to make all of their pawns feel unique and superior, but want them to martyr themselves to pariah-dom where they become isolated from their true friends and family, and gain a dependence upon these radical cells and icons and forums, where they don't believe anybody else can understand them, and that they are totally alone and only have the grand agenda to live for. It most definitely makes a lot people extremely dangerous. There was recently an e-mail leaked from 'Stormfront' (major on-line neo-nazi haven) where the insidious origins of using the 'Pepe the frog' icon as a mainstream palatable nod/wink to neo-nazi sentiment.  Debating these poisoned by the media virii/propaganda is often pointless, because most of what they put forth is a total buffer and misdirection from their true far more extreme views. They try to legitimize and explain and excuse and deny and blame all kinds of people and things, and pretend to believe in certain causes and political figures/icons to depict their agenda as purposeful, romantic and heroic, but these sh'll agendas, political figures and shills are constantly outed as being fraudulent, deceptive, disingenuous, fallible, lies/liars, etc., and in reality, all they care about is racism, dominance and superiority. That's why when one of their icons is outed and completely switches up their stance on something they were supposedly firm on, or one of their decoy conspiracy theories is irrefutably debunked, their morals and values they pretend to hold so dear are completely fluid and malleable, and they will contradict themselves all of the time, they will deflect all the time, because the base racist/genocidal sentiment that their idols always pussyfoot around is all they truly care about. They are confused by design, they need to be distracted with constant barrages of irrelevant bullshit to keep them from actually ruminating on any decoy cause or purpose too long, and they have huge echo chamber networks designed to keep them in their labyrinth"

"'society will forgive you' the four most important words in this video. When I was a gullible centrist I was the most stubborn person until theryn meyer of all people introduced me to your content. One thing that I have been worried about is fellow leftists digging up my past to use some, let's just say horrifically insensitive, things I said against me to try to shut me down.

"Ummmmm pretty sure you're a fucking idiot. Fascism is using force (authority) to control policies, most notably today in the form of censoring of ideals and thoughts one doesn't approve of. Ex, shuting down a debate because it offends you would be a fascist type action because you use the venues authority to stop others from presenting their ideas. Fascism has no fucking race, sex, religion or political party you dumb sack of shit.  Delete this comment and prove my point *Edit*  You said 'na zdrowie' or 'to health' in polish, and then Comrades. This is hilarious and indicative of you're entire shity video. The polish were decimated in WWII worse than most any other nation, losing approximately 1/5 of their ENTIRE population due to the RUSSIANS and germans invading their highly jewish population and slaughtering indiscriminately. So not only did you say something to your 'left' audience in polish (an incredibly 'RIGHT' political nation) but you followed it up with comrade as if though every single polish person wouldn't think you're a piece of shit for making something akin to a NAZI joke. But i suppose the tens of MILLIONS who died to starvation in Russia and 45 or so MILLION in china under similar communist governments don't matter because the ends justify the means, except the end is a stunted and poor nation with lots of preventable death dealt by the government, so yea, yay communism.   you're trash."

"Attributes of fascist ideology are colectivism, nationalism, despotism, militarism, cult of youth and strong regulations of market. Antisemitism and racism are not necessarily part of all fascist regimes. Fascism originated in Italy was not antisemitic. It is true there fell persecution on some Africans, but not because of color of their skin, but because they were not Italian, which is not rasism, but nacionalism.  Almost all communist regimes was also fascist. Also many countries in Africa are or was under fascist regime and it have nothing to do with racism. Nacism (national-socialism) is older than fascism and contains literally all efforts for combinations of nationalism and socialistic structure of the economy. Communist Russia and China was basicaly national-socialism. Nacism do not necessarily obtains fascism. NSDAP are not first party based on nacism. There is not direct implication like this: Nacism>Fascism>antisemitism and racism"

"Both sides honestly scare me. So many groups that support something that just seem crazy to me.

"A lot of fair points! The only problem I see is that you leave almost no room to try and address real-world ethnic/cultural/religious/immigration issues/tensions that do exist in a multi-cultural Western society, since almost every way of approaching these problems can be viewed as a 'fascist strategy'. After all, we must not forget that the extreme melting pot, with relatively equal rights (not opportunities) that has surfaced in Europe and North-America is a relatively novel and unique experiment"
"The patients are running the asylum."
"I love your stuff, Contra, but you missed on this one a little. But so have many people. Fascism is about nation and the cult of the leader, not race per se.

"As the child of two East-German history and german language teachers and living in Poland for a while, I grew up with the notion that race is an overblown concept. I learned that people have different colors based on their geographical roots, but the concept of race was universially conceived as harmful by my social environment. As a result, it wasn't used in my head before I came in touch with US-American culture when I was a young teenager. To say the least, I was terrified to see how the so-shunned concept rules this society."

War after war, Multiculturalism, monotheism, birth of democracy, birth of scientific thought, philosophies concerning external truth...etc. etc. 'The east' would stretch out to Japan with Chinese states, Persians, Russia, Indian States with Monocultres,Polytheism, Buddhism, philosophies of subjective personal truth, massive empires, mystism..blah blah. If youre a white ethnostatist, just move to Russia. Russia is ultra white and mostly 'eastern' in their worldview..so their probably gonna be white for a very long time...just dont get hung up about the drastically different legal/social climate. 😓"
"Strange how the 'jews will not replace us' phrase changes with tone, 'JEWS, WILL NOT, REPLACE US!!' 'Jews will not replace us' we can turn their phrase around to mean 'you sound crazy, that will never happen even if it was being attempted'"

"This Video is soo sad Can we guys get 100K Dislikes"
"Free speech as is it is in the US is a utopian idea that can never work. Hate speech laws absolutely decimates these sort of hate groups and do not gain as much traction in other countries with such laws because they are not allowed a platform. The very small amount of time that this law punishes for example a comedian making a joke in very bad taste or an off hand comment on a media platform versus the amount that is gained from not having to constantly battle these obvious and overt hate groups is an overall positive. I'm sorry but openly advocating for an idea based on genocide isn't something that should be protected under free speech. Regardless of tech monopolies over social platforms and how problematic it can be which is an unrelated problem to free speech and much more a problem with capitalism, not having Alex Jones on youtube is a net positive, not having Milo allowed a Patreon to fund Neo Nazi rallies is a net positive."
"Even in the videos where I agree with you you present your argument in a dishonest manner instead of just pointing out why it's wrong. You fall in the same problems of Milo Yiannopolus and the talk show hosts. Just get to the point and drop the satire. When you mix satire and then dedicate a part to argue the points normally you come off as disingenuous"

Ugh. Fuck them they don't get to have these terms."
"why not doing a simple thing? a comparative body-count on both sides, the one you try to butcher with this vid and the other one that you wish to win. after having made that real life cold fact comparison you could come back, present the numbers  and tell your audience why it still makes sense to fight on the award winning sicko killers side."
"Just a mild quibble:  I do disagree with your definition of fascism. Fascism, to me, is defined best as a cult of action for action's sake without a necessary central ideology. Italian fascism was different from German fascism, for example. That said, I do agree with your general assessment of the tactics of the alt-right and think it's a necessary thing to bring attention to. Thank you for that."
"I think everyone has a right to their own homelands, including Europeans, however I do not believe that it automatically means we should kick out all brown people, everyone has a right to their own homeland and their own cultures, otherwise things will go to shit. Just look at the Kurds, they have been refused their own homeland by Arabs, turks, and Persians for as long as the world remembers, and they've constantly had to put up with conflict, genocide, and being refugees because of it. Tolerance is good, but tolerance to extreme extents ends up ensuring you get stabbed in the back by the people you're trying to protect. No I am not a fascist dog whistler, I am a normal fucking rational human being, I don't want to see my own people or any other people suffer genocide or violence."

"also ... at 9:45 there was an incredibly ignorant comment made... you suggest that if a person literally said and believed that ' no white people are not superior to anyone. I just believe white people deserve to have a homeland and continue to exist, as do all other races'  than what they really mean is ' whites are superior ...'   what the fuck? they literally said the exact opposite. as someone who agrees completely with the first statement, yet disagrees emphatically with the idea that white people are somehow superior to any other race, I find that notion incredibly false and disengenuous for you to even suggest.   you're basically saying 'i don't care what you say, I don't care what you do, I don't care if I have evidence for it or not, if you think white nations have the right to exist, then you're a fascist'.   everyone who watched this had to see that... they had to have realised how incredibly ignorant the comment was, and how you suggested that you are able to literally read minds.   either that or you're seriously saying that anyone who thinks white people have the right to exist is a white supremacist. I also think black nations have the right to exist. so if thinking a nation/people have the right to continue exist makes you a 'supremacist ' then I suppose I'm a black supremacist too... and an Asian supremacist. and every other race supremacist.m haha so in actuality that would make me NOT An actual supremacist at all.  which is the truth."

"I recently found your channel thanks to the IDW (intellectual dark web subreddit) and have loved your videos so far, but I have to ask, where did you get that definition of 'Fascism'?  It seems like you made it up to fit your video."

"So many of them get drawn into it and manipulated into spreading fascist ideology without even realizing that's what they're doing."
"This list of what a person on the left thinks a fascist is could draw people in the center more towards the right. There leaves little room for discourse. Contrapoints states that anyone who is concerned about illegal immigration is underhandedly planning for a white ethno-state, there is no middle ground. This is idea is divisive and useless when trying to converse with someone who is legitimately concerned about illegal immigration. Other countries enforce borders and control inflow of immigrants and refugees, I fail to see how doing the same is suddenly extreme."

"You are attributing the word 'fascist' to white supremacists or general racists. It's sort of a intellectually dishonest thing to do as those things are not inherently connected, while connections can be made between the idea's at times (as with many ideas). Using fascist as a blanket term for white supremacists, or racists, sort of precludes other forms of fascist thought or actions, as fascism as an ideology can pop up in lot's of places. Fascism is more a means then an end, where as the way it's used in this video makes it feel like an end. Just call them racist's, and/or bigot's, it's simpler, more direct, and is hard for anyone who is truly of that nature to dance around."

"Excellent video (from France)."
"Instead of hormone replacement therapy, trans fascists go on ETHNIC replacement therapy."
"'3 points = fascist'  Wish it was that simple, not the case. Merely describes white supremacist stoogehead goons/pawns. All ideologies have such counterparts.  'Disproven, wrong believes'  Thats because believes are subjective. Ideology is fueled by such bias, cognitive dissonance. Dogma demands such.  In essence there arent any ideological movements that are the problem Its human development itself that is: Poor communication, dualism, allround ignorance empowered by narrow minded dogmatic bs, etc"
"This video pushed me much further left and towards suspicion of fascism, when I have tended more towards taking people at face value. But I still have some qualms. I’m not a fascism connoisseur, I’m a perhaps naive leftist who wants to have human conversations with people and really doesn’t want to alienate centrists or even moderate right wingers by throwing divisive language around. Am I just falling into the fascists game by not branding fascism wherever I suspect it? Alternatively, isn’t an over-zealous left just falling into their game, by alienating normalish (maybe ignorant) relatively politically disengaged people? I would hazard to say there are (lots of) people with shitty views who are not yet fascist who can still be called to responsibility in a human way, and to me that’s critical to the fight against fascism, this simple ideally face to face, non-judgemental call to responsibility. If we as the left can’t do that, then we are playing into fascism by eternally calling normal people on things in a way that alienates and makes them prone to the victim complex that feeds fascist ideology. I’m not a centrist although I often get called that, I just think we need a sliding scale of response to varying degrees of ‘fascism’, and as leftists we need to be able to call each other on excessive suspicion (get our fascism senses/responses tuned) without being called nazi sympathizers, or else we will have no ability TO tune our response. I think anti fascism is way harder than fascism, it’s a fine line you have to walk, because negligence allows fascism to continue and overreaction and premature judgement alienates/victimizes/radicalizes centre-right folks, and all the fascists have to do is capitalize on any time we step off the line in either direction. Is this assessment fair?"

"So this is why my brother thinks I’m a closeted white supremacist/fascist/nazi - I only see the satire in Pepe memes, I find the idea of the “ok” symbol _actually_ being used by white supremacists hilarious and all of the other “dog whistles” I find hard to believe are genuinely made by fascists. Oh and I have a tattoo of the eye of ra, flower of life and a Penrose triangle that he was hella suspicious of when I got it, now I know why, he thinks ima fucking nazi... Jesus Christ.  So now I’ve been painted as a nazi and any attempt to prove my innocence just makes me look like a dishonest nazi being deceptive. Wtf am I supposed to do?   He literally said I was condoning genocide the other day when debating Islam, all I said was “I don’t think Islam holds a good set of values, nor do I think it is compatible with western society” - to which he replied something along the lines of “oh so those people can’t exist according to you? Are you saying we should commit genocide to rid the world of Muslims” he also made some remark about how I was being “racist”... this straw man pissed me off to say the least.   I’m an anti-theist, I think religion is the single worst thing humanity has ever made. Every time I debate my brother about anything, he always has these “gotcha” moments where he thinks he’s uncovered some hidden fascistic view I _don’t fucking have_ .   It’s tiring and it makes discourse hard when I’m constantly trying to not say anything remotely nazi’ish at the same time he’s trying to find some hidden nazi agenda in my views. Is it hopeless? It feels it. I’m starting to see the actual far right memes and how they work but I feel it’s too late. I laughed at them before and told my bro he was being ridiculous for thinking they’re right wing dog whistles, this made him think I’m a nazi but now no matter what I fucking do I’m gonna be painted as a closeted nazi/facist/racist whatever. This is fucked up."

While I get what's meant by it, to anyone still affected by the situation, the little 'на здоровье' reeks of ether supporting the genocides and ideological cleansings of USSR or the imperialism and tbh, fashism of modern day Russia, and that just fucking undermines the whole video that I just watched."
"I’m a conservative"
"ContraPoints for Bundeskanzlerin!"
"Ya'know, if you feel like you have to hide your agenda from people who don't agree with you then maybe your the one that's wrong. You don't hide things that are innocent and not going to hurt people."
"Your definition of FASCISM could not possibly be more wrong. You've defined naziism. Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian ultranationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy, which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.  Now who does that sound like, hmmm?"
"when you explained fascists at the beginning of the video, you were not explaining fascism but you were explained nazis. there is a  huge difference between the two."
"Are you fucking kidding me?"
"How to create a fascist, not having a purpose in life, bad patenting, depression, lost of identity, etc... fascist don’t scream, “white power.” They are screaming help! Sadly sometimes does who help them are..."
"The way your videos look hurt my eyes. Tons of clashing ugly colors, and ugly patterns. Also, your definition for fascism is wrong. That's the definition of Nazism. All Nazis are fascists but not all fascists are Nazis. Mousillini and Hitler were both fascist but only Hitler had a particular hatred of Jews. Ya know what I mean?"
"Rather odd to define fascism in terms of Eurocentric ideas, given that there are any number of examples of non-European fascism."
"Oy vey! They want 6 gillion more dead!"
"one of the first things actual facists do is revoke gun rights...."
"Just discovered your bad ass channel.  Subscibe!"
"So you actually think the term Western Culture is facist??  Where do you get that idea from?   Western Culture is separate from Eastern Culture. That's it. It's historic terminology."
"I decided to view one of Hitler's speeches on YouTube several weeks ago, and the comments were very reminiscent of your examples. Everyone was saying that he only wanted the best for his people, did nothing wrong, that he is vilified by the world because 'history is written by the victors' and spouting bizarre conspiracies. Crazy amount of people out there who genuinely believe that stuff!"
"Look, the U.S. is ALREADY FASCIST.  It supports Israel, which is a fascist apartheid state, in fact the U.S. has virtually been colonized British-India-style by the Israelis.  This makes Richard Spencer ironically more anti-fascist than Antifa just because he is against this."
"Over the course of about the last two years of our relationship, my ex went down the alt-light rabbit hole. He always told me 'I'm just listening to all sides!' when I was frustrated about him watching Sargon et al. Yet, he never watched any leftist youtubers. (I wish I had known your channel back then, I would have shown him some videos.) He practically hung on to JP's every word (though of course he 'listens critically', as he told me). He used all the memes like Kekistan and even showed me those 'good old days' videos. He did do that one as a... weird joke I guess, because he told me how stupid they were for romanticizing the Nazi era, but how did he even find out about them? And why did he watch so many of them? Why did he find them funny and show them to me?! Especially since he knew how angry this shit makes me. He said stuff like 'they're not Nazis, the Nazis liked the Turks and they don't like Turks yada yada' as well. At the same time, he did rant about Nazis and racists. Sometimes. I think he just hates the Left so much that he'd rather hang around alt-right spaces online... well, we've broken up because of our political differences and I wonder if he's totally going to fall into that brown hole now. I don't want to know. I'm just glad I'm away from that dumpster fire about to happen."
"This video is very good and important. Thank you!"
"To be fair, there are authoritarian leftists. Can we start calling them the “alt-left”"
"You don't like hate and violence? Me neither. Why is this narrative pushed? Why are people made to think that this is the biggest threat? Meanwhile the real criminals operate with impunity. The intelligence apparatus, the CIA, the NSA, the police state, the military industrial complex, Mossad. They are the real 'mass killer', the real torturers. Have fun fighting each other while they go unchecked."
"Wait... are you saying all the alt-right is fascist haha that’s not even what alt-rights is. I’m a classical liberal and I’m alt-right, as are a majority. No one believes in an ethno state.  Idk if this video is before you started researching these subjects so just went with whatever definition you believed to be true... but this certainly isn’t alt-right. Combing from a trans person, would have thought living in a culture where it’s legal to be a trans woman... would be a good thing. This video disappoints me"
"Can we just agree that chicks in Hugo boss nazi uniforms are attractive af. I wonder how many ppl became nazis cause of Hugo boss"
"While I agree with the message, I do take some offence at your not so subtle implication that centrists are stupid and impressionable."
"As a non-white person here, I rather get gassed, then listening  to a tranny."
"Before I came out as trans and started living as a woman, I kept my head shaved and grew a beard.  And I'm like very white. So this guy comes in, sees my white bald bearded seemingly male self, opens his wallet, and shows me the '88' in his wallet.    None of my coworkers believed me when I told them he was a neo nazi because it 'Could have meant anything.'  Yes, it COULD HAVE. But it didn't.   So, yeah, you GOTTA look out for the symbols and you have to educate people on them."
"btw Enoch Powell was right."
"there was two interesting news yesterday.  according to certain study, finland is supposedly the most racist country in europe, and a muslim teenager serial rapist put his victims suffering on racism because they should have just taken it.  I dont believe we are the most racist country in europe, they just play the racist card when ever it pleases them. not to mention when they keep doing shit like this, they damn well deserve all the violence they receive. here is an idea for them, get the fuck out of my country and all  you  who disagree have no business in here either."
"How is our president a fucking fascist?"
"Thank you for this vid. I've noticed all these subtle tactics(in particular diverting the topic when defeated) and I'm happy someone finally made a detailed vid exposing them. Thank you"
"thank you for these vids! I've forwarded them to ppl who could use a wake up call☎😘"
"That outfit is fab, though."
"Wow, so insightful, thank you! The only part I disagree with is the Kekistan issue. It was created and hyped by a small group of (multiracial) people who just get off on shitposting and trolling. They are not racists. (The President of Kekistan is in fact a black man! lol). The fascists who used the symbols I believe were just too dumb to pick up on the fact it was designed to mock them, not to cheer them on. Jeff Holiday made a great explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q9SIVhLI6o Your contention that the memes do harm I agree it could by causing some confusion among normies, but I think theres a stronger argument to be made for it helping to hurt the fascists.  By taking their symbols and making a mockery of them, it serves to disarm and render their symbols less powerful. Now when i see a nazi flag, i think of kekistan. So in my mind they are associated with a joke, not to be taken seriously."
"I general Sherman approve of beating the shit out of copperhead confederate shitbags."
"I've never understood why the need to protect a color of the skin? We're all humans. The colour of the skin is completely irrelevant."
"I hate fascist, but i like Burzum"
"As a Romani person I dont really have a place because the violence towards us fascists hate us so much. We're not even considered people in some parts of the world"
"A lot of what she’s saying makes sense to me but I don’t agree with some of the stuff she believes in or maybe I misunderstand"
"When in doubt block and report"
"This actually taught me a lot. Thank you for the video."
"I learned things. Nice!"
"You still look like a man try better"
"you disgusting tranny thing"
"you guys are so wack lol"
"Great video dude, you're a funny fellow. Keep it up, man."
"Honestly getting sick of Joe Rogan being a useful idiot mouthpiece for these clowns. I'd love to see you make a video on him."
"The Alt-Right and Far-left Ideologues only want Free Speech when it benefits them?  Who would've thought that they are as bad, if not worse than the far-left?"
"How do you explain the few FoC (Facists of Color)?  I've seen plenty during my times on the internet.  What motives could they possibly have for siding with an ideology that hates them?"
"Sargon of Akkad isn't a fascist. He's just an idiot."
"i agree with your opinion that the left should be more tactical. i like that you're a voice of reason."
"The alt-right ruined Vikings, milk, and the OK sign forever and I will never forgive them for that.  Well, that and all the other things."
"Punch a Nazi for Jesus!"
"This is total bullshit.  Pseudo intellectual crap."
"I think your channel is a great way of representing an antidote to what the altright says. If one is able to distinguish the things you are saying from your appearance, then they are able to learn something new. Even if they disagree with some things, it's a good thing to not let the appearance of someone hinder your way of listening to them."
"17:58 I think my balls crawled back up into my guts at this part."
"Excellente vidéo sur la forme comme sur le fond ^^ Je voudrais juste revenir sur une des défenses de l'extrême-droite 'C'est du second degré', se cacher derrière la carte de l'humour,  non seulement ne tient pas devant tes arguments mais une étude a également montré que les idéologies derrière les blagues déresponsabilisaient par la suite en partie les comportements liés à l'idéologie (en substance : les blagues sexistes crédibilisent le sexisme futur, pareil pour l'homophobie, le racisme, ect... source : http://www.slate.fr/story/156365/humour-inclusif )"
"Ahahah that shade on Lauren Southern"
"I'm a Minarchist. Any fucker that wants to give the State to do whatever the fuck it wants to do with the private property deserve a Davy Crockett to the face"
"I mean.. I started out watching your incels video and it was brilliantly made. And now you're just slamming this thing aswell. Im impressed, ur sharp man/maam. Keep up the awesome work!"
"Their free speech argument is absolutely ridiculous. We're supposed to tolerate their intolerance? Absurd."
"If you find yourself in a new job, I would encourage you to take the opportunity to find out if any of the people you work with are fascists.  Start out by looking/dressing like a naive centrist.  Don't make political statements.  Spend time around them on lunch breaks.  Smile a little at their off-color jokes, or at least don't register disapproval.  They will also be testing YOU to see what kind of person you are.  Gradually their jokes will become more extreme - note that when they tell a joke, they will immediately look around to see whose laughing.  This way you'll learn that many or most people calling themselves Republicans are really fascists.  You will naturally become more disillusioned about the human condition, but overall it feels much better to understand reality."
"takes one to know one"
"above everything else fascists are pathetic little joiners. Cowards who are desperate to look strong and sexy."
"Is that Shaun I hear in the background?"
"My, what a conveniently broad brush to paint with that brooks no room for anyone accused of fascism to actually defend themselves if they disagree with your terms. Everything they say is a dogwhistle, and nothing that they say is what they mean because *you* know what they mean when they say what they mean but it's not *really* what they mean, even though they're saying it is."
"4:03 where is this from?? i’m asking for a friend"
"fascists all have the same condescending annoying-ass personality in my experience, pretty easy to weed out"
"So let me get this straight. You went on and on about how the alt-right hides itself behind 'irony' and 'humor' (which are true points, BTW) and then you end the video with a 'joking' reference to the USSR? How am I to believe you're not a communist? This is what they mean when they talk about the alt-left and alt-right equivalency: the use of 80s pop culture references, 'ironic' Nazi or Soviet references, making light of totalitarian ideologies that slaughtered millions within living memory in order to prove you're more hardcore than the 'normie' guardians of mainstream civil discourse. It's the same shit!"
"This video is great. The roasts had me D Y I N G"
"ich bin gerade so dankbar dafür, dass ich diesen kanal gefunden habe. <3 du bist eine wunderbare göttin (see what I did there?) und ich feiere dich hart."
"I thought I'd just watch a few minutes and then was sucked into the entire thing! Excellent work.  Thanks for doing the research so we don't have to."
"Cool video, everything on point, but... Why make a communist reference in the end? As a former citizen of a country that has been devastated by communism, I don't really get how people are never scared by it. It's not like fascism is up there alone with devastating effects on minorities (and often not only them), communism has done a lot of harm too, yet you feel safe from your - bear with me - privilege of never actually have seen what it means, making references and jokes about it. That's basically like crypto fascism, except it's even more subtle because people don't know the perils of communism as well. It honestly makes me sad whenever people make communist references, even worse when they are talking about adversing another type of totalitarism. It's quite offensive towards those who have suffered from communism, as making references to fascism is offensive towards the fascism victims. Just stop being an extremist and let people live their lives freely."
"So, can you do a video about people who aren't nazis or fascists but fetishize them? I feel like this is a fascinating and quirky topic."
"Thankyou"
"If fascist means caring about your heritage, and refusing to open the country wide for foriegners who don't give a fuck about western values or integration, if fascist means being for a just capitalist system and not a divisive filthy commie leech, then I'm a fascist and proud of it."
"You're so smart and reasonable. Thank you for your voice!"
"This is one of the best videos on youtube."
"Quickly becoming my favorite channel on Youtube. You're wonderful."
"I was down right up until the last bit, when she gave a Russian toast. To many in Eastern Europe, such as the Balkans, Czechoslavakia, and Hungary, the Fascitst Nazis and Communists were just two sides of the same coin. These peoples were relieved of the Nazi boot on their throats only to have a Russian one applied. Much of what was said about Neo-Nazis can be applied equally to modern Russia. They're no longer called 'Communist' or 'Soviet', but Russia's still anxious to re-claim the glory of the Soviet Empire. See the  'Ukrainian Uprising' in  Eastern Ukraine, sponsored by Putin's Russia. Also look what happened in Georgia. Any legit opposition to their puppet government is brutally dispatched."
"Thank you I just say I’m centrist because I don’t like to fight but I’m ftm trans and gay and agree with the left the most because most of the other side want me dead  I don’t know, on the surface their arguments can be compelling but I can usually tell what it means"
"I stumbled upon your videos today, and I'm glad I did.  Informative and humorous.  Keep up the good work."
"The very fact that we are still hearing the Fascists making the false claim that their 1st amendment right to free (hate)speech is being oppressed is proof that in fact, they are NOT being oppressed.  They are NOT being silenced. When companies like Twitter choose not to host Fascists, they are actually exercising THEIR 1st amendment right to free speech. The 1st Amendment does NOT force any one, neither a company nor a private entity, to host you or provide a platform for you while you spew your hate; the 1st Amendment simply protects you from being arrested by the government for spewing your lies and hate rhetoric.  USA makes a horrific mistake by allowing Fascism to continue to spread their lies under the 1st Amendment — their ideology, their rhetoric, and their acts are actually well-defined as SEDITIOUS, and SHOULD be punishable by law as acts of SEDITION."
"I love this channel."
"Right now the Nazis are using the white snowman emoji as their symbol"
"I have a crush on you. I know I'm not alone in that but I thought you should know. Another great video!"
"14:09 I'm pretty sure Fantano is being sarcastic there"
"Imagine being so worthless and insecure that the only thing you can latch on to and be proud of is your race, something you have absolutely no control over. The irony is that these white supremacists claim to hate 'identity politics' but they're the ones who play it harder then anyone else. You're entire movement is based around racial identity."
"Capitalism alienates as it pushes rugged individualism for the masses while elitee operate collectively. It breaks social and interpersonal relations by stunning the social nature of humans into 'I/me/myself'. Sucks! Socialism burns down the economy where you're forced to eat dogs and communism invariably ends up in gulags."
"How retrograde is it to be prejudiced against Jewish people? It's like putting up a 'No Irish need apply' sign."
"This is part of the problem with both sides painting with such a broad brush.you are basically painting people like Ben Shapiro Jordan Peterson and Steven Crowder and the like as fascists and Nazis to people who don't have time or care to look into these people for themselves. So with all due respect don't say dog whistles are a purely right-wing fascist tactic when the left uses them just as much if not more to gain political and social people. I'm well enough red and open-minded to realize that the people I mentioned above are not fascists Nazis or whatever but to what you like to call 'normies' they may be looked at that way. All in all a very good video from someone of opposing views, your just painting way to broadly and we are never going to get through past our divisions if both sides continue to do so."
"Wack, can’t even use scuba signs anymore 🤦🏻‍♂️"
"When I first got a Twitter account I was getting so confused politically with the 'Q' shit and being a liberal/centrist and watching this I realize why I rage quit Twitter the 1st time because I was uncomfortable and saw people in my Twitter feed who were posting racist shit and liking my posts but then watching this video I was totally being influenced into like a cult mentality that's crazy shit. How are you so smart lol? Im just now back to being a cunt"
"You only see things one way. Neo-nazi presence in my country is non-significant, has always been non-significant. Anti fa does accuse random white people of being a nazi. I am not standing up for something illogical and unreasonable. I do not have to be part of anti fa to crush Nazism. The alt-right does not mean Nazism in an absolute sense.  Yeah, antifa is an excuse for people to oppress white people for their own personal pleasure. Revenge racism. It has nothing to do with anti facism. not anymore."
"What's the difference between facism and Zionism?"
"Bitch, you smart. Give me more."
"Just discovered this channel. Love you already. *runs to binge more videos and possibly subscribe*"
"There is no such thing as hate speech. There is distasteful speech and crude speech....rude speech but in reality hate speech doesn't exist. By the way, who of you that supports this nonsensical idea of hate speech want to give the power of defining that hate speech to a government entity? You do understand that by giving a government this kind of power, you take the risk of them declaring YOUR speech of ANY subject hate speech and give them the authority to silence and/or imprison you, right?"
"There isn't a far-left? Does not far just imply extreme versions of views everyone in the group may hold? Certainly there are lefties who take their views to far or am I misconstruing?"
"https://lithub.com/fascism-is-not-an-idea-to-be-debated-its-a-set-of-actions-to-fight/"
"Fighting the good fight!"
"Lotta interesting supposition about identifying WN's, but the same argument leftists make about how people like J Peterson or even Gavin McIness enable WN's could be made regarding the ideas in this video.  Reactionary types may use it to target anyone they 'feel' might be a WN.  I say we go back to innocent until proven guilty, allow all free speech in the public square unless it specifically calls for violence and more importantly: educate people that specific common values are what matter and not ethnic, gender or whatever other type of group identity.    As long as common values that promote what is necessary to human welfare, anything outside of that is individual and/or cultural expression, and should not be restricted.  Incidentally, I consider myself a modern liberal by definition, but sometimes conservative views are necessary i.e. economics or a focus on rudimentary education/training goals.  You wouldn't want your airline pilot not to have diligently practiced flying a lot."
"Watching this after Trump called himself a nationalist... Subtlety and innuendo is lost on the fearless leader."
"I used to identify as a liberal and although I agreed with nearly everything the left supported I became sick of tiptoeing around jargon and being labeled a fascist whenever I argued that our strategy was failing to attract centrists. I began to feel that the left preferred living in a philosophical bubble to effective action. This is when I was unwittingly courted by covertly fascist narratives of an oppressive left. Your videos are extremely helpful as they've allowed me to identify and disavow this narrative. The left needs coordination and we need a softer image, otherwise we'll continue to lose ground to effective fascist strategy. The centrists aren't unredeemable as most leftists seem to believe."
"If you remove the word 'fascist' and replace it with 'communist,' Joe Mccarthy could have made this video."
"Facts 👏👏👏"
"I know this is old but Fantano is definitely not a centrist. He's very left leaning, basically in line with Bernie."
"Their latest ploy is 'I'm not conservative, I'm not an alt-righter, I'm not an incel'. After either:  1) Speaking in a public forum and screeching on about 'feminism is cancer', 'Neo-liberals are responsible for the toxicity of the internet', 'There is no such thing as hate-crimes' etc...  or...  2) Writing the same drivel in a conversation thread.  Their responses when someone calls them what they are is the full denial."
"incorrect, that is not fascism"
"Loving your videos"
"I was very disappointed with this video after I watched your video on incels which gave a fairly unbiased and well researched look into that social group. The reason why you come across as a paranoid leftist is because you are acting like one. I know there are fascists and many of them are clever in how they portray their views or air them in a group to see if their opinions are welcome in a group or if the group is susceptible to the views. However how you portray fascists hiding their rethoric can also be levied against the far left and many antifascist groups (who in and of themselves are no angels). They hide their opinions and air them only through code at first to see who they are talking with. Also my greatest problem with antifascist groups is their inherent use of fascist tactics like beat everyone up who I don't agree with. In the end they became the thing they fought in my eyes. Sorry for this inarticulate response but I am very much frustrated with the lack of self awareness in this video. However I do love how you are advertising for the organisation: 'Life after Hate' but this, in my eyes, does not make up for argumentation, straw-maning and propaganda."
"Here's one thing that i think people don't really consider, both SJWs and the alt right. So I'm pasty white, as white as you can get without being albino, and I have green eyes. I physically cannot tan. Many make up brands don't carry my color foundation because I'm so pale. BUT, I'm a Jew. I've got jewish heritage supposedly dating back to the original 12 tribes of israel. So OG Jew.   Anti semites, white supremacism parties, and other hate groups view us as an 'other', just like they do black and latino people. So by their views, I'm not white, no matter how white I look.   This really confused me for a long time because it brought about the question of where do I fit? I'm too white for POC and too ethnic for white people.   It wasn't until recently when I was doing research into Jewish people historically that I came across the term 'ethno-religious' which describes a people that abide by a certain religion and are also their own ethnicity. Looking through many other articles and asking other jewish people on social media what they thought, I've realized that this is a fairly accepted belief and I just wasn't aware 😳😳   So yeah, now I just mark 'other' on pages that ask for race or write in 'Jew'. Just food for thought"
"Hey weird question but where do you get your wallpaper it is quite lovely"
"Holy fuck someone taught me fascism. That's impressive."
"Very well made and intelligent video that I will definitely show to friends! Thank you!"
"accent from the north west of England there , home."
"Your videos generally hold a very high theoretical level, but here I think you confuse 'fascism' with 'national socialism/white supremacism'. The later is actually just one form of fascism. For original Spanish Franco fascism, for example, racism was actually not a big component. Other forms of contemporary fascism are for example Grey Wolf Turkish nationalism, or the far edge of Hindu Nationalism such as Shiv Sena. You could even argue that Jihadism is a form of fascism or at least share a lot of characteristics with it."
"I can't even begin to comment on this video. It is great! I just wish it didn't scare me so much... because I don't even feel I can make a coherent and genuine appreciative comment without coming over as disingenuous. I have become afraid to say anything... even this. Not because I believe I will offend but because I can't change anything.... This video is a landmark for me as a beautiful summary of a very valid opinion more people should adopt yet it hurt me so much because I have never felt more alone and more powerless.... No one cares what I say, a random person, a single random person at that, on this video of over a year old. I can do nothing as much more verbose and intelligent people fight my fights and fight for the world I want to see:   a world I can't even describe anymore, I've noticed.... which doesn't help.  This video has my like and my first comment in six years on this site.  It has openend me open my mind even further to the problems of this world.  I've never felt more alone on this earthen orb we call earth and that is why have put this up.  I am afraid of everyone and everything"
"I very much wish you would make a podcast."
"Hitler tried to do this ethnostate crap. Contrary to popular belief, most Germans weren't down with his most potently insane shit. Sure, they put their sons in the Hitler Youth, but many liked shopping at Jewish owned stores and didn't think killing handicapped kids was a great idea.   You know, the murdering millions and subjugating millions more to crazy oppression (until they could be murdered) part, they mostly didn't go for it. That's because all the Germans really wanted was to just live like they used to. They wanted to be able to feed their families and stuff. Germany was in a pretty shitty situation after WW1, let us not forget.   The main reason Hitler's psyops failed was that it's really hard to get older people to think in a different way. It's not easy to make a kindly 50 year old German man who has been sourcing his groceries from a Jewish family for 20 years to get on board with slaughtering millions of people.   The kids, they'd work, Hitler Youth were learning all this for the first time, they could be useful. But what could Hitler do until then? Well, he tried making the crazy shit into law. Shop at a Jewish store, and you'll be punished, and the store will be destroyed, you could go 'away' as an instigator or traitor. People made their choices.  Skipping ahead, let's look at what happened when Europe was liberated. Regardless of what you had done during the war as a German, you weren't free from the scorn of going with the Nazi flow, so the allies, traumatized by what they saw while liberating the camps, rounded up the nearby populace, and made them tour the camps. Made them look at what they'd been purposefully ignoring. The open pits where hundreds of bodies lay, the gas chambers and the piles of human hair and gold teeth. So they'd know what this ethnostate really cost.  This is why Never Forget became the anthem of the war, this is why it's illegal to lie about what happened in Germany, why fascism worries the shit out of most people. Add what happened in Russia, Cambodia, Italy and Japan during the war into the mix, and you've got yourself a damn good reason to not be in favour of fascism.  Plus, even if none of that impacts you, fascists use fear to drive their regimes, and going along with their crap just proves you're scared. White supremacists, or whatever terminology you want to use, are SCARED. They claim the white race is superior, but they're scared of it being erased, erased by the existence of other humans.   That's hilarious. The existence of brown people makes white supremacists AFRAID. How does that even factor into the narrative about the strong, proud, white, dominant people? You scared that if white women choose brown men, that it'll demolish your existence? Mixed race love can beat the supreme people? Really? All I have to say to that is LOL.  Fascism is for uneducated and scared people. The most incredible thing is, for this überhöchste race, is the one who went around pillaging and raping the brown people in the first place. So are the current white supremacists mad at their progenitors for creating the first Euro mixed brown people? Or are they mad that those people fought against oppression? The European peoples all profited off other races. I'm just curious about which part went 'wrong' according to white supremacists.   They want an ethnostate. Ok. Where pray tell? You can't have the Americas. Natives still exist - despite the great efforts of the supreme whites - and they have dibs. Surely they wouldn't try to displace the Natives, considering how often they bitch about the Jews making their ethnostate in Palestine. I mean, are they the enemy, or the people they want to emulate?   Sooo... What about their actual homelands - though most whites are a thorough mix from multiple homelands - in Europe? Well, those nations are full of immigrants too. Many from nations that were pillaged by Europeans. They had enough to get by, most countries had great riches, and they were taken away and brought to Europe.   So some of those people followed their riches to Europe. Maybe you shouldn't have taken all that shit in the first place? Then they wouldn't have gone there? Hmmmmmm?   But whatever. Fuck history, right? White immigrants telling other immigrants that immigrants aren't allowed in the country. That's what's happening now. So the US can steal the northern bits of Mexico and turn them into states, and then tell Mexicans they aren't allowed. That's what's happening now. But yeah. Go ahead and follow the super successful blueprint Adolf fucking Hitler left.   Lol. Blame the Jews. That's original. Is anyone going to explain these things to me, or could it be that no explanation exists, because white supremacy is a joke and whiteness just means 'African humans fucked Neanderthals' and 'we don't need melanin in the north'? Could that be it? Maybe the fascists are just miserable little cunts who don't even have the power to improve their own shitty little lives, but dream of wielding swords like Vikings and don't want to know how nonwhite they actually are, and just want to be treated like royalty despite never accomplishing a goddamn thing to deserve it? Maybe?"
"you're my new favorite youtube channel. also, just saying, as an aside... yeah, these people don't have a fucking monopoly on European history (which is basically what you said in other words). Trying to invoke the names of european philosophers only get me to think 'huh.... that dude would hate you'"
"There were a couple things about this I found interesting.  I've been defining Fascist a bit broader than you have. You make it sound like if you're not a self aware white nationalist, connected with millennial alt-right cliques or racists who are comfortable with Nazi or KKK iconography, you're not a fascist. But I think Fascism doesn't need any of those things, least of which is self-awareness.  I use Umberto Eco's essay 'Ur Fascism' as my inspiration for recognizing fascism - and I apply it to our history and culture. Stripped down what I'm trying to say is: There aren't a couple million millennial alt-right fascists in the US, our problems are much bigger, both new and old. a) If you would support a fascist leader, you're a fascist.  In the right circumstances, that's nearly 100% of the Republican party by now - because all you need to have fascism is a populist movement against the left.  When a hundred million Americans already grew up using the word 'Liberal' as a swear word, already have been mis-educated have wrong definitions of every political word from Socialist to Communist to Marxist, when the most common American use of the word 'Marxism' is to mean the Nazi-origined conspiracy theory 'Cultural Marxism', and when the country is quickly falling out of the first world because - remember your quote by Lee Atwater 'you talk about cutting taxes, policies which hurt black people more than white people' - when all of our policies are inferior because they've been chosen for that specific quality that they hurt black people MORE (but hurt all of us in addition)... and finally when we no longer have a working democracy because the attitudes that allowed Jim Crow have blossomed into contempt for real democracy, THEN (finally) THEN you already live in a fascist country. Trump didn't introduce our system to fascism, he is just an example of the veneer wearing off. b) Hitler got his inspiration for anti-Jewish laws from American laws.  We fought the fascists but even at the same time our country didn't start in a better place than Germany, we have always been dithering around extreme racism and white supremacy. c) You go online and it may be that a 70 year old tells you that the Democrats should all die. She wouldn't recognize a Kekistan flag, but she grew up with a right wing press, right wing politics, right wing church and she watched Fox News all day. Everything in that right press is slander and it created this hatred for some fictional image of everyone outside that ecosystem (mislabeled as 'the left') - and that's fascist.  d) also everything in that press deliberately disconnects people from knowledge.  People are taught that all journalism is fake, that all education is fake or even satanic, that all expertise (apart from a few right wing fakers such as 'Libertarian economists') are fake, everyone who isn't in their little clique is part of a conspiracy even the whole world press.  Now maybe they do that so that they can sell people on the idea that pollution shouldn't be fought, or that they should allow themselves to be financially exploited .. but once again once someone is indoctrinated against knowledge and to hate outsiders, they're already fascists. e) and finally we have politics where 'money is speech' and 'corporations are people'.  This means that money counts more than people do, even with the less fascist party, so even if we were magically transported back in time till before Obama's dark face scared all of the racists into crawling out from behind their rocks, we were already in a system where the economic and political definition of fascism completely applied, even before the populist hate, populist anti-leftism, populist authoritarianism and racism had an embolism. f) so Trump came along and demanded to be a gas lighting authoritarian despot in a country that was already fascist in every other way.  If there were no self-aware millennial racists, I'm not sure we could tell the difference."
"i think the alt right is a very small population. im a conservative and i have never come across them. and i have no interest in preserving 'white culture' we just want immigrants to come here legally like our families did"

"Wow, what a great compilation of strawmen you got there."
"Yes. I do believe Nazis have a right to free speech.  I agree hate speech should be constitutionally protected.  But as demonstrated by the Boston Police on the Common in the weeks following Charlottesville, no one has any right to a megaphone.  Natalie Wynn pushes forcefully into the shrapneled edges where paranoia blends with all the ways liberal democratic values can be turned piercingly against themselves by deceitful malefactors and . . . most alarming of all . . . the clueless.  Us.  Yes, we are all a bit racist. We are all a bit fascist. We are all a bit Nazi . . . little Hitlers lurk inside us all. And this brings up the importance what the Muslims call “jihad”.   I’m not familiar with an equivalent term in Christian or Jewish theology - or at least none come to mind. ( . . . ? . . .)   Some Marxists groups talk about “self criticism”, but Wynn is, to my mind, engaging in what even atheists might recognize as a ”spiritual struggle” where there are no sure certainties except this very dangerous and very necessary “warfare”.   What’s portrayed in this video is a chilling struggle which leads one on towards an infinity of snares and pitfalls. And as frightening as is all this grappling with self, identity, agency, and essence, what can be more loathesome and horrifying than an identity based on hatred, superiority, or the crushing of human hope? Because that‘s what racism and fascism and Nazism is about: the crushing of human hope."
"Miss points can we collab I hate fascism"
"I just found out about this channel a few days ago by watching Shaun, so I‘m currently on a Contra Points binge. Let‘s just say that I didn‘t expect to see Kotori (the anime character shown in the video) in this video. I‘m really mad right now, because fucking Nazis are using her picture. What a bunch of fucking retards. She‘s the most compassionate and caring character in the entire series and always tries to be nice to everyone, the exact opposite of what Nazis do. These retards shouldn‘t share anything about Love Live in the first place because real fans always stood up against racism. Love Live fans joined anti right-wing protests which were organizrd by ex yakuza. Unfortunately there‘s no English news site that reported this, but I managed to find someone explaining it on reddit.  https://i.redd.it/llf8yhznaav11.png  I wish those yakuzas could visit this idiots from 4chan too."
"is this a joke??????"
"I'm so glad to have  found the one channel made by a white man that isnt a racist, you are the ONLY one in the world! Congratulations for recognizing how flawed your own genes are and rising above them in order to point out how flawed the genes of all white man are..thank you so very much."

"There is indeed a lot of paranoia but also stawmanning showing here. To be fair, you admit it and I respect your honesty and self-awareness on the former point."

"I think that just disregard all those not leftists as unable to recognise nazis or as unenlightened is politically very unhelpful to your cause and seems rather elitist"
"Fascism was a tool in order to achieve Nazism it wasn't Fascism itself. Fascism had less to do with racial pride and more with national pride. Mussolini's The Doctrine of Fascism is a rather quick read and you can see it was about using national pride and authorization in order to control the public. To be honest, Libertarians are the least fascist of all political groups including Democrats. Here is a excerpt that sort of gives you the general idea, 'Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of the State, which stands for the conscience and the universal, will of man as a historic entity. It is opposed to classical liberalism which arose as a reaction to absolutism and exhausted its historical function when the State became the expression of the conscience and will of the people. Liberalism denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts'."
"Recently, Bannon was blocked by protestors from 'debating' at the University of Oxford, and oh boy, did the liberals and centrists react in the same way they historically have. Even people like CosmicSkeptic blasted the protestors for 'suppressing speech they don't agree with'. I used to read history books and ask myself, how could this have happened?. Now I wonder if this route is simply an inevitable outcome, an Achilles heel of democratic nations who protect free speech."
"8:26 particularly horrifying that president trump has openly declared himself a nationalist just recently, in addition to all the other dog whistles he's been emitting. this is a tough time to be non-white, non- hetero, or a lefty, in America."
"my god, i started bursting out laughing when there was the conspiracy soundtrack over the close up on trump's hands XDDDDD"
"how is fascism the belief that you don't want an overly sized amount of immigrants in your homecountry? I am a nationalist, i believe in my country which is Sweden. My country is failing because of socialistic programs, huge amounts of immigrants. I live in the country you people use as an argument for  the left. It's not all flowers here, a high rape count (mostly by you guessed it, immigrants), high criminal rates compared to some years before. Our healthcare is failing, our education is worsening, really, fuck off."
"Been looking at both sides to educate myself. Never been too politically involved but shits getting to bad for me to sit back. I still feel more republican than anything but I wish to learn more to better my party instead of feeding into the broken system."
"What about legitimate conservatives? What about us queer conservatives who share *some* political values with the fascists? It seems unfair to me that because fascists are using conservative political as a means to their racist ends, that those right leaning political ideas are labeled as fascist. Just because a group of racists hide under the umbrella of the Republicans doesn't mean that the Republican ideas are inherently racist"
"Facism isn’t based in White Supremacy.  Japan’s government during WW2 was partially based in facism and Japan isn’t a majority European nation. I just think you should’ve just titled this video “ How To Recognize a White Nationalist” or “How to recognize a White Supremacist”"
"My only regret is that I have but one like to give"
"9,000 fascists disliked this video."
"Please tell me this head in the sand crazyness is satire ?"
"Your definitions of fascism are . . . wrong . . ."
"Hmmm... Im about... 15% fascist I guess. I do dislike zionist jews (not all jews though) and their cronies (most politicians). But I dont beleive anything can be done about it, so I live my life best way I can. Political ideologies are a lot of times destructive (communism,fascism...) and I dislike how they skew pagan symbols (celtic cross,slavic wheel,black sun,swastika),it is completely distasteful. So,fuck them. The best thing is social democracy and even that could be improved if people were smarter."
"I did give some of your videos my time. I started with the JP one which in all fairness is good constructive criticism all around. I do believe beyond everything he is a good salesman and he does the things he does on purpose for his own personal gains so hence you had a fairly objective approach on that video I decided to go on - tho I was quickly dissapointed about your approach with other topics. You're really rash and hasty when it comes to outlining new topics that cover the 'right' and that's why probably you'll never quite grasp the concept of being a right wing person opposed to the left wing person that you are. I can't say that I've experienced the full spectrum of ideologies, that would be really a big fat lie, but I can say I've walked among both sets of given people, values etc. and I can attest that some of the things you do say about the right/left even are very true things, but a lot of it, is just horsecrap, honestly, especially all the bullcrap about the white ethnostate, christ, such a fucking longshot, we're not in nazi germany anymore.. Sure, I do a agree that a lot of obscure right wing peasants think that's the way to go around but that's what you need for a cause - an idealistic purpose  - When I say true right wing people play 8 D chess and move their own as resources for the benefit of the society around them, i'm not joking. That's what we do, that's what I do. Sometimes you have to. I really strive to believe that true right wingers, extreme right wingers differentiate themselves from the ones you portray. I personally consider myself a heavy right wing person, probably we're in total contradiction in lexic and rhetoric, but truly, at heart, we all want the same things and to be fair that's fine. Some people move to the right wing part to further those ideas of idealistic society due to the repression they feel in their everyday life from the left, thing that doesn't really happen with the right..honestly, I have tried to spot that kind of discrimination while working for right wing viewed employees and I did not experience any (while at the time I was a filthy subhuman immigrant in MA, a place where right wing people should despise liberals right? cause that place is the epitome of leftism and blue state ideology) but that was deffo not the case, not one fucking bit, the only backlash came from the other side - did not bother me really I lost hours and money because of some half ass joked about Hillary) I think it's a natural shift, and what can the left do is try to strike a balance, honestly, we need the right as much as we need the right, i'm fully aware neither one of those in excess would work in our current times, maybe in a sci-fi environment, sure, but not the real world. If you believe that the world is about a good/evil fight between the left and the right I really pitty you because you're just being used by both sides, be it that you're a right wing/left wing, you're a peasant. Most of the great intellectuals from both sides had a lot of converging points and a lot of them in a void i assure if if given the chance to talk it out,  would find a lot of potential collaboration grounds between and bring out the best of both worlds but that's not how the world works sadly and some people will and have to I believe that - have to go to extreme lengths to pursue those goals. I've met a lot of people that 'don't show' their power levels, and for good reasoning, the right is mistaken for nazis when in fact they just approach the world in a Machiavellian way which sometimes is needed. You will get lied to, you will get persuades, you will get subverted for the furtherment of each respective side - the left/the right - but that's the nature of things and I think it's justified all things considered. I might sound like a centrist, but I do know my position here and as I said, I reside on the right side. I strongly wish and believe that some left leaning people see the world like this. I'd go as far that people that do that probably go hand in hand and collaborate in ways that we can't imagine when people from both sides come along and plan for the people they represent. Both sides have its flaws, the left is hilarious with its angry feminazis, the right is down right dumb as fuck with their rednecks - the list can go on. My dream is that one day the world will be absent of pointless subjectivism, from both sides! I believe that is the root for the cancer that plagues our society. I strive only for moral integrity based on objective moral values."
"'I used to crossdress ironically before the full thing.' I understand this line of thinking completely, but it's missing a crucial part. When I dressed as a woman 'as a joke' one time. I really liked it. Meanwhile I can use some themes ironically, which provoke disgust in myself all the time. How the 'joke' makes me feel is a good indicator of how I feel about being that thing.  As it turns out, I don't even make jokes, or make extremely few, about being a fascist, or a nazi. And almost all of the times I do, I feel depressed if they're successful, because they don't represent who I am.  And I've done a lot of very 'evil' impersonations of things 'ironically'. In some cases, they were just pretending to be something to grasp it better. The point remains.  If your edgy joke makes you feel like shit. It's probably not what you think is right."
"meh. It seems the right and the left are in a symbiosis to recruit us poor centrists to strengthen their communities."
"What in the name of sweet Jesus is speaking? What is it, exactly? Some kind of abstruse satire, a narrow in-house joke, or a genuine cross dressing bender? 🤢  Whatever it is, it is stomach-churning and unwatchable.  Yeech. Yuck."
"I'd consider myself a radical centrist. IE I have no problem with crushing Nazis through violence (the people doing it, not the gov) but I do so without being a commie."
"4:01 links? 😂 jk"
"If it is that difficult to tell the difference in their code language... maybe it is not worth spending time on decoding it. What if we fought against harmful ideas by simply spreading our own ideas in an articulate yet relatable way? Isn't that what centrists do after all? Debunking the hypocrisy behind extremist ideas by just thinking and acting in 'realist-humanist' manner? I don't think general paranoia and constant public announcements of alienation from obviously ridiculous ideologies is very attractive to 'normies' either..."
"This reminds me of american horror story: cult"

"Honestly, I'm not a fascist, but I lean more on the right... what do I say now?"
"This video was absolutely perfect, there's so much diversion from the right especially when they call lefts fascist when fascism has always been the Alt-Right response to Leftist thoughts."
"James usslup is not a fascist"
"You lost me with pepe is a fascist symbol"
"Well, your premises about fascism are wrong. Which... makes the rest wrong as well. Fascism is the use of State to create specific rights for specific corporations (social, politic, economic, whatever), which includes many contemporary 'progressits'. You should have read 'The doctrine of fascism' first."
"Only white transgender that could fool me 😁"
"I love it how the Nazi propaganda video shows the Bayeux Tapestry and then proudly proclaims, 'SAXONS!'   Erm...no. No, no Saxons. You had the Anglo-Saxons (not the same thing) fighting the Normans. Nazis are idiots and I'm a pedantic nerd who majored in Old English."
"They somewhat effectively used these strategies against the caravan. It isn't talked about at all anymore. Our racist president sent troops to the border, who don't have anything to do. They won't be with their families for thanksgiving.. because people a thousand miles away are looking for asylum."
"what if they just killed themselves like they were thinking about before turning into nazis?"
"Holy fuck the ok and up pointing emojis, I didn't even connect that to Trump's hand talk until you played the video!"
"17:44 really creeped me out"
"LOL everyone is hypocritical today. How diversity became the norm is hilarious."
"scary music"
"The combination of all criteria you proposed will most likely be made by fascists. But one or two of these don't make fascists. Overuse of 'apparent' dogwhistles is pretty stupud, because if the ok sign is fascist then you have no boundary on what you can call fascist and what not. Fascists do exist, but you can't just identify them by what you feel they are actually saying. There should be objective criteria that in an ideal world even a robot could identify a fascist. I respectfully disliked the video because of this overuse if dogwhistles. Still love your videos, they give great insight into the left, especially important nowadays where most people on the left scream racism without juatification, because they 'aren't obligated to explain it'."
"I dont speak German but I can if you lke"

"'you will not replace us'  holy shit, these cucks are really snowflakes."
"OK lady you are full of shit. First off, let me start by saying that I am a libertarian conservative. A right winger, but about as far from authoritarian and fascist as you can get. Now then, that out of the way I want to say that of course I am proud of who I am as a person. I am proud of my people, my race and our glorious history (I am Bulgarian if you wonder). That is the one thing no one can take away from you as long as you don´t let them. I will never shy away from the fact that I find meaning and purpose in those things. I have found brothers who reflect my views from black people to inuits from the northernmost parts of Greenland. People who have the maturity to realize that being proud of your genes and heritage does not translate into hatred of any kind. People who are sick and tired of the politically correct bullshit that prohibits such pride. Because one of the best feelings in the world is the sense of belonging to a clan and a race with which you share so much in common. I guess you would call me a fascist or nazi, and to that I have only one thing to say: when you have seen your friends slide towards violent right wing ideology and brought them back from the brink of that hateful chasm by beating some sense into their thick heads through words, then and only THEN can you judge me. At the end of the day call me whatever you like, because I simply do not care. I know where my heart is and I know what I have done. You have not even walked a mile in my moccasins and yet you are ready to slap a sticker on me. Well, bite me!"

"Okay but where did that polkadot dress come from and where can I get one?????"
"The problem is that I as a social democrat am also concerned with preserving the western cultural heritage, if your go to strategy is to attack buzzwords/symbols that are ever more abstract you will inevitably hit people you don't want to and cuase collateral damage. I'm not stupid enough to become a nazi for it, but there are plenty of people who will feel affected and villanized. This is counterproductive to the goal of eliminating faschism, it cannot be done by equating everyone who agrees to abstract terminology with hitler."
"I first saw your video on incels from a Facebook group where you were shortly introduced as being 'the most wonderful and the most beautiful'. Well, they forgot to add 'the smartest' too! I love your videos and the whimsical style. Not only you present serious, sometimes grim topic in an easily understandable way, they're actually... fun to watch. Who'd have thought you could say that about a video on fascism!"
"You, and the entire trans movement, are doing more harm to the democratic party, and the liberal platform, than you can possibly imagine . . . you are suffering from a dysphoric mental illness and no amount of hormones or psuedoscience will change that.

"As an East-European the hints on Soviet Russia are rather disturbing. We I get it most of the Western World doesn't understand that the Soviets were just as bad as Nazis... But still. As a social democrat from a post-socialist country I would kindly ask: please don't do that, many of our ancestors were deported and murdered by them. Let's make a left-sided movement which once and for all denounces also the criminal regimes from the left such as USSR, Maoist China etc."

"Saw your video on Incels and I realized you were pretty smart and well researched fellow trans slightly left centrist... untill I found this... the points you are trying to make can't be argued against because they claim anyone who argues with them is a facist, that's non-sense.  Buying into the 'dog whistle' stuff is going to *subliminally* make you see white nationalists/nazis (not facists, you defined it wrong) everywhere you look, and that's not healthy for debate.  Keep attacking centrists and claiming the left is a beacon of purity incapable of facist ideas, it worked great last election! /s"
"I'm a centrist but I aknowledge that the far right is much more dangerous than the far left"
"This is an old video now, but I want to point out that the Charlottesville marches were the most successful disinformation campaign in recent memory, thanks in large part to who we now call the crying nazi who spent most of his public time spreading the idea that communism was somehow on the other side to whatever they were pretending to be for. Essentially they were trying to frame it as Nazi's vs Commie's. As you said this in this video there are certain dog whistle phrases and anti communism is one of those, when in fact communism in practice is almost identical to fascism and naziism. Young people now seem to not realize that fascism was the practice of WWII Italy, Naziism was the practice of WWII Germany, and Communism was the practice of WWII Russia. They are all different and distinct, however they all derive from the same basic policies and practices. In this same video you talked about how, if you aren't careful, you could unwittingly help spread alt right views by not being clued in and you really did that at the end. You may have known what you intended was the joke, but the rise in literal communism after that rally was huge. It is important you let people know the truth, that communism is an alt right tool to get liberal people into fascist ideologies and ways of thinking about humans that don't reflect the value of human life, choice, and freedom. It is important to know that communism doesn't strive for equal rights."

No 'United The Right' rally has ever killed or maimed someone, they don't go out of their way to silence people and use people destruction and false accusations to do it. I like your videos mommy, but the way you defend Antifa is kinda sick."
"I still really struggle because at the moment the political left is making no sense to me at all (or at least very little) and it’s also very true that it’s too easy to label someone as alt right or racist whatever you want to say, and this is a serious issue which is giving power to the alt right so “detecting” an alt right person I don’t think is going to be helpful... Basically I think the issue is so many of the things true for the alt right can be so easily perpetrated by someone completely innocent of that agenda, so calling them out on it is just going to frustrate them."
"This is also why I love the European model of obscenity laws (call me un American), but I don't like people going around saying kike this or kike that, because I am one, and  it offers nothing but pure hate, and encourages festering wounds of racism."

YOU.... 'Shifting position.....!!'"
"my brain doesn’t wanna believe that people are like this and go this far to deceive people"
"Just because fascists don't value anyone else's rights doesn't mean  we shouldn't either. Much of what you've said here can be applied to anyone  with unpopular ideas.   I absolutely despise the rightwing, but I'm not going to support a leftwing that promotes it's own racism and hate groups.  That does not make me a centrist or a fencesitter."
"I am so angry...that I didn't find ContraPoints sooner. Binge-watching commences...NOW."
"As a cis white male, the alt rite should all get fucked and die."
"❤"
"this is my first contra video. im in the middle of my struggle currently to resist falling into alt-right nonsense, but im also very much not a leftist in many ways, (or maybe im just once again in a phase of my life where politics will become a big thing for me and i learn alot more about what is and isnt 'leftist') but overall i just want to say, i just turned 28. ive been all over the political spectrum. lately its seemed i just want all the screaming and raging to stop. because its on both sides. i just want some peace and quiet. shoot me into space or something."
"YouTube recommended me one of your videos and I’m so glad. You are so intelligent, creative, beautiful, and you actually make quality content. Subscribed af"
"Didn’t listen to anything you said  Not because I’m ignorant or in denial but because I was too focused spending the whole episode trying to figure out if you ran out of lipstick halfway through or if it’s just the lighting"
"I watched this video a million times and I always get this nagging question: why not use the same techniques but against fascism and capitalism for that matter?"
"I still agree with giving everyone free speech, even though fascists use it for their own means.  Because their ultimate goal is still to destroy it. It's our goal to maintain it."
"I love your dress in this video"
"ЗА ЗДОРОВЬЕ    ('na zdorov'je' seems to actually mean something different, if a Russian speaker can confirm this)"
"So..... Am I not allowed to point out the hypocrisy of Antifa shutting down free speech? Because It seems like something fascists would do to groups with opinions that oppose their own."
"11:49 I don't think those two things are at all similar, there are many documented cases of Antifa 'going ham.' While statistically white people should be more afraid of police violences than those of African decent. Unless you're saying that both are unfounded beliefs in which case, I would agree"
"Seeing that this video was published last year makes tons of sense. A year ago fascists thought that the general populace would reject overt gesturing or speech towards that of a white ethnostate, or nazi imagery, or that leftists would be able to sway the 'normies'' opinions on things. It's become more clear with the passing year that this is no longer true, and that the right can cling to power even if they're being up front about their intentions. Normies want normalcy above all else and preserving it means sifting away the elements of society that aren't incorporable into an ad for kia or chili's. The fact that ads reflect this so much and become recursive to the culture itself means that not only do we have elements of fascism but of a hyperfascism (portmanteau of 'hyperreality' and 'fascism')."
"When I saw the original 4chan post about making the OK symbol a dog whistle, I wondered if the anon truly thought of it alone and capitalized its innocence, or if anon was influenced by the small series of unique hand gestures Drumpf has used since his publicity peak. I couldn't tell for certain until the recent 👆(flipped) replacement.  I'm now 85% sure they're creating allusions from Drumpf, which personally helps me dispell the ambiguity. Until they stop pulling from his repertoire, it should be easier to tell who may be taking the conservative stance too far.  As of yet, I have not seen true Drumpf fans or moderate voters immitate any behavior from him unless heavily encouraged, so I kinda doubt that anyone other than extremists would use it as a wink and a nod to each other."
"I think you do not give enough credit to centrists."
"This video is so fucking important. If I could wheatpaste it onto every wall in my city I would, but instead I'll just share it everywhere. Thank you."
"This sounds  more like racism, for me facism doesn't imply facism"
"How to spot a communist, if he votes for american labor parties, he may be a communist, if she attends leftist rallies, she may be a communist, if he openly critizizes capitalism, he may be a communist, if he denies being one despite doing one of the aforementioned 3, he may be a communist, if he does all 4 of these, he is surely a communist- how to spot a communist 1954, to oppose feminism, to support rightists, to appreciate western civilization, and to take pride in ones heritage and nationality are often to be used as reasons to call one a nazi, and to support the right or 4chan means you are the alt right. truth be told, they both suck,"
"I can't help but feeling like content of  this nature helps reinforce the 'everyone to the right of Stalin is a Nazi' meme of the left. It's why I don't even feel comfortable with that label anymore, it's as if there's no space for nuances anymore. Just the same tired old script."
"I think you use fascism and White nationalism interchangeably"
"Je suis complètement perturbée par le titre et la description en français."
"I am a bit confused about your definition of fascism. Where did you get it from? As far as I know, Fascism does not need to be antisemitic, for instance. I may be mistaken, but it seems like you are not differenciating between Nazism and fascism, but there is surely a difference. Grateful for every answer!"
"Fail. White ethnostates already exist... in Europe... Quite naturally with no fascism or other straw men involved. You really have no idea. How about saving yourself the effort and spelling out your idea in 5 mins rather than making videos that make you look like a try hard that debunks themselves?"
"I was a part of the alt right after I was a radical feminist. I know it sounds crazy but I went from one extreme to the other and so I have to say this. There are extremists in every group, and whatever group you're a part of is not innocent. This is why I'd encourage everyone to drop their labels whether it be feminist, libertarian, alt-righter, incel or whatever it is you identify with. Stop putting yourself into a group and defining yourself around it. Take your values and make it your own through whatever wisdom you can find. And I know you won't be easily definable after but let me get this straight, you don't have to be anything this world tells you to be. You have to live true to your values, what you believe is right and don't conform to something just because you want to feel included into a group"
"Isnt it a bit naive to say that all centrists are naive?"
"Im pissing myself watching this video. #altrightpepeftw"
"... wait... didn't the OK symbol get revealed to be a dog whistle dog whistle? Like... an intentional attempt to grab the attention of people looking for fascists with something completely innocent that literally everybody uses?"
"Jesus I always knew Lauren Southern is a far right asshole, I never thought in a million years she's a fascist. But when I saw this video then looked back at some of her videos about 'western culture' and the 'white ethnostate' I realized holy shit.. she's a fucking fascist"
"Same bastards, different name"
"I just wanted to make this comment to say, you're all retarded, everyone antifa, the alt-right, the right, the left, SJWs, anti-sjws, feminists, anti-feminists, fascists, communists, you're all retarded. All of you sound like a bunch of frothing at the mouth rabid Dogs who just want to rip one another apart. You're all wrong this is all dumb, you're dumb, i'm dumb, we're all dumb, fuck it, i quiet.    Sincerely a centrist who is frustrated and fed up with politics in the current year."
"I don’t understand, why are they trying to “preserve western civilization “ if they have Europe ? Isn’t that these neonazis/alt right/etc’s original homeland?? Since the United States is based of off different nationalities; is it because they want most of the power and control they had before?"
"a rose by any other name, would smell as sweet. a nazi by any other name is still a dick."
"uhhh that's not facism, that's nazism"
"conclusion:  - don't speak to fascists, because they are not interested in your opinion - so don't take interest in theirs. - it is ok to silence fascists because they don't care about free speech - critisizing problems that go along with 'refugees' is wrong, because it might be exploited by fascists someday to incite racism  ... i could go all day long with that, but i will keep it short to save you and myself the time: problem is: your definition of fascism per se is wrong. Where did you get it from that fascists are racists? I mean you are truly speaking of german national-socialsm (aka. Nazis), but pinning a italian fascist label to it.  Fascists are people who have - a strong leader - like beating people up who oppose their opinion - gather around an exclusionist ideology  do you see a pattern?"
"For the record, a person who espouses Fascism a la Perón or Mussolini wouldn't agree with any of the three defining positions you offered.  They're a good pick for the purposes of this video but it is perfectly coherent to reject racism and remain fascist."
"The only thing I disagree with is that I don't think fascists are just white, straight people  *cough* Milo Yiannopoulos and current day Israel *cough*  Also I love you aesthetics"
"The thing that confuses me about anti-multiculturism is the fact that white people brought black people here as slaves then built a country on her injustice, they go on to conquer other lands then set up military bases there but they hate the idea of other people being here in the states? Like Japan can't use their own military and America has bases set up there. Does this not sound unusual? South Africa's under the control of white people, where a genocide of black people occurred in the 60's. White supremacists paranoia about immigration is strange, especially since they stole America from the natives here.   Amazing video btw."
"I wont sugarcoat it, WE ARE ALL FUCKED. Its only gonna get worse. I live in Oklahoma though where 9 out 10 people I interact with are racist/ homophobic/transphobic, including my own family and thats soul crushing. So  I might be a bit cynical."
"Disagree 100%. The more you push fascists out of the debate, the more you de-platform and censor them, the more radical and violent you make them, the more they retreat to their echo chambers to whine about how they got their free speech rights violated (and the people will side with them, at least on that). But if you confront them face to face and dismantle their ideas (as you should be able to do with ease), then some light is shed on them, and their mask falls instantly. That's how fascism was kept in check for 70 years.   But when political correctness stifles the debate, every group becomes more confined, more isolated, unable to find any frame of mind outside their echo chamber and thus becomes more radical. That's what a free marketplace of ideas is, not the collection of non-intertwined echo chambers that Youtube, Facebook and Twitter are. That's why free speech was invented. Paranoia is not the answer."

"Hey Contra, I love your videos and you (mwah kisses) but I feel you were a bit off in the video.  1. I feel you failed to describe the overall political climate surrounding immigration policy/open borders, the situation in the EU, the rise of Trump etc. 2. Examples of incompatibility of cultural values of beliefs between people immigrating to the country and the country’s democratic and constitutional values, e.g Majiid Nawaz (a Muslim BBC broadcaster) discussing a large-scale poll in the UK showing over half of muslims stated homosexuality should be illegal again (he was not happy with this btw) 3. Disparaging centrist positions (maybe you did this ironically or some shit you sass queen) but advocating far-left rhetoric when it comes to topics like this just seems like it stifles public and political discourse, and as you aptly described yourself, the left kinda sucks at proposing pragmatic and well-thought ideas and discussing them in a rational manner, say compared to 4chan covert alt-right white supremacist guy 4. Perhaps discussion of a far-left far-right feedback loop or something, I’m not as smart as you and there’s probably a better term to describe this but hopefully you get the gist, where the antagonism and shameless promotion of these ideals spurns reaction from the other side and creates more extremes at either side"
"How to recognize a piece of shit : a white man who dresses like a woman and spits on the ones who are standing for the interests of white people"
"I noticed this kind of horseshit in hardcore gaming spheres in the early 2010's.  Especially the 'shroud absolutely everything in so-called humor for tactical retreat purposes', even when it is things like extremely serious doxing campaigns aiming to destroy people's lives and attempting to get people with histories of serious mental illness to kill themselves.    Honestly, the actions of admins/owners of these communities set the stage for this shit to proliferate out of control and into mainstream culture and politics.  I noticed an almost complete failure of those in power to actually discern any of this and to use any kind of discretion in dealing with it.  This certainly wasn't often due to sympathies in my view, but sheer ineptitude.  In fact, I would say a majority of the people/groups were more 'leftist' in character than I am.  A perfect example of what I'm talking about is an almost universal intolerance of the 'n word', often bannable for a single utterance.  On one occasion, immediately after the Trayvon Martin incident, an entire group of people created characters with various celebratory George Zimmerman names and proceeded to ramble about how this needs to become the new norm and what a hero this man was.  Admins insisted nothing was violating their rules and depressingly banned somebody for calling one of these dipshits 'faggot'.  I've seen scenarios like this play out so many times it makes me sick and I am still in awe of the irony I felt when reading admins then admonish spectators with something like 'we do NOT tolerate racism or sexism in our community!'"

"I am a fascist and I don't fit any of your claims. I believe in what the Italian Futurist believed which was fraternity of nation, belief in the inherent good of modernism, Fellowship of Jewish Population which is what Mussolini was into before Hitler gained his ear, and authoritarian syndicast corporatist Democracy (the idea you should vote for your boss instead of your government).  You are talking about not even Nazis but contemporary Nazis. Unfortunately your misconceptions about Fascism are like many of my old right wing misconceptions about Communism from when I was technically what I was during my White Nationalist days when I would call everyone socialist a Communist."

"Holy shit, I think I'm in love."
"One of the biggest problems I have arguing with hardcore conservatives and trump supporters in person is their long list of alternative facts. If I don’t know literally everything about the subject, they very easily tell me some “fact” they heard and make me look stupid in front of the group or crazy if I tell them they are wrong. The other day one of them told me that the KKK are Democrats... Like they just forgot that they openly supported trump and there was big controversy because he refused at first to denounce their support. But they are always so sure that they know what they are talking about, and say mistruths and false statistics so confidently that it feels impossible to “win” arguments with them."
"Your formal reasoning is impeccable!👯👼🌈"
"How to not be crazy or think crazy: You act on actions and statements as they are, not what you think they may be. Reasonable people don't care to be neo-nazis. They are exceptions, just like rapists, murderers, cannibals, arsonists, gang members are in the USA. Unless they are saying something that is actually stupid or doing something that is actually stupid, IGNORE IT. They literally cannot gain significant ground. Stop feeding into the insanity. It only makes it worse."
"When you remove far left and far right, there is more than just centrism left. People that aren't extremists care about free speech regardless of if someone is saying something dumb or mean. It's not that they don't see it, it's that they don't care because it's literally just seen as stupid and people that aren't extremists want stupid people to out themselves. It shows who they are and then those things can be critiqued and destroyed.   It's like roaches or mice. Do you want them to hide or do you want them in the middle of the floor not moving so that you can deal with them?   Alt-left and alt-right are both unreasonable and unpleasant groups of people. It's why people WANT people like ContraPoints to spout their insanity so that we know what it is and who the followers are."
"Shifting blame? No. The people that say those things want ALL groups, including neo-nazis to stop the violence and use words like mature and civil humans should. It's literally the law. I don't want to see black, white, asian, etc. or any LGBTQ folks to get physically assaulted unless it is in literal and legal self defense. It's like you lefties want the entire country to be plunged into literal war."
"'Some leftists are idiots'... Do you even self aware?"
"So do you think that everyone that uses an ok sign, frog emoji, or milk emoji are neo-nazis? I mean, how would you even be able to tell if they are just using them normally, trolling you because tons of leftists read into everything things that don't actually exist, or actual neo-nazis? I mean, reading into it like so many leftists do, like this video seems to be advocating for, is about as intelligent as people taking the Jewish Question conspiracy as reasonable or valid.   It's almost like people just want something to fight against like ContraPoints is saying that neo-nazis are doing... Is this just a giant larping game to SJWs and neo-nazis? If so, please leave everyone else out of your ridiculous games."
"**Fascism**  Why are you making up definitions? You can have Mexican fascism just as easy as Russian or Indian fascism. It's a political framework, not tied to any specific place or time.  Fascism originated in Italy so your way off from the get go.  By distorting the definition and understanding of it in society you are actually helping fascists. It hurts everyone else that isn't a fascist that is trying to make the country a good place to live for everyone. Do you really want to help fascists by spreading disinformation?   ---  **Nationalism**  I mean, do you far left people not realize there are tons of Black, Mexican, Asian, and other ethnic groups that are American Nationalists? Nationalism means you care about your country, it doesn't just come in the ethnic version.   * Nationalism by definition is: ['patriotic feelings', 'patriotic principles', or 'patriotic efforts'] * Patriotic by definition is: [having or expressing devotion to and vigorous support for one's country]  You by definition don't care about your country if you are not some form of nationalist. It doesn't matter what country you live in either. I'd hope people have a deep care for the country they live in and want it and the people within it to be safe and do well. I thought leftists were supposed to care about people. Being against nationalism means you don't care about the people in the country you live in by definition.   Do you ContraPoints and other leftists that like ContraPoints videos actually not care about the country and the people in it that you live in?   I hope you would care about other people in the country you live in. Like that they have jobs, food to eat, are happy, well adjusted, etc."

"anthony fantano isn't a centrist"
"That's way too narrow a definition of fascism, but certainly it identifies the characteristics of one of the predominant narratives - the more nuanced definition of *_Some More News's_** series on fascism* is I think a superior one, since it reflects the underlying structure of fascism more than the presentation of fascism - which can vary quite a bit.  For an easy example: Obviously not all fascism has to be white supremacist, but it does always involve an aggrandized superiority of the predominant group, who is facing an enemy that is both strong and weak, intelligent and conniving and yet also wondrously stupid - if you are familiar with conspiracy theory thinking, this should be familiar to you. 'illegals are bringing down the economy and control the majority political party! but they're only 0.001% or whatever of the population, we can show them!'

Hence why the fascist tiki torch guys used their tiki torches to beat peaceful protestors.  They are violent and against free speech/ protests.  Here . . I'll help you. Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radical authoritarian ultranationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy, which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe"

"Holy fuckin shit. You are...just...the worst. If being a fascist means wanting to end you....then yep! I’m a fascist."
"1) I think you are mixing up fascists and nazis indiscriminately. It is paradoxical that it is in principle the same 'sin', which you criticized on Peterson. That he is mixing up two things that might look the same from a distance, but in fact aren't: postmodernism and neomarxism. To him, 'all these on the left are the same bastards', to you 'all these on the right are the same bastards'. Don't you think?  2) I liked very much your video about incels, because you described them, criticized them but at the same time tried to understand them. It felt balanced and I would even say you showed considerable wisdom in your approach. But here you are very one-sided propagandist mainad shooting at your enemy without pause and even producing something that looks like a conspiration theory about evil fascists hiding behind masks and trying to take over reality. I think it is a wrong approach even pragmatically - only people who 100% share your position enjoy that and frolick happily in their echo-chamber. But when you produce more balanced videos - I think at least - there is more chance to reach to people in between camps, the 'tired silent majority', who are fed up with polarisation into 'fascists' and 'commies'."

"Fascism is not tied to being white, it is an ideology that can be adopted by any race or culture. The three core beliefs you cited are therefor incorrect."
"I'm not a fascist (and no I'm really not a fascist or right wing) but if we make the broad assumption that one is a fascist based on them being a nationalist or a 'right winger', isn't that problematic? Isn't that like saying all liberals are Marxists? Some kind of vanilla republican is hardly a fascist."
"On the one side, you have those horrible crying SJWs who complain that certain words and societal practices are harmful to minorities and vulnerable social groups. On the other side you have goosestepping fascists demanding their own ethnically clean 'state' (possibly meaning the entire northern American continent and European continent), seeking to deport or otherwise 'cleanse' entire peoples.  I mean, to the layman they sound equally bad, right?   I'm not a shrill combative keyboard warrior, but this juxtaposition makes me absolutely furious. I've stopped laughing it off when people around me moan about SJWs. It's the most common denominator of negativity towards faceless groups of people I've seen in real life and online, even more so than straight up misogyny or racism, and it needs to be called out."
"I almost fell down that dark hole, yikes...."
"I mean, I get the whole video but I come from a country where Socialism was imposed over almost 20 years and they used the same techniques. Which is to say, these strategies are not only theirs."
"At the time this video came out, I was still thinking that ANTIFA was just a rebranded version of the Black Block, which used to obnoxiously show up at other peoples demonstrations just to yell at the cops and break things. And, I defended the rights of the alt-right to speak out on free speech grounds. After all, Nom Chomsky and Emma Goldman were both free speech advocates. But after reading the ANTIFA handbook I changed my tune because I realized that the alt-right is not just saying horrible things, but organizing to do horrible things, and inciting violence is not protected speech. Yes, some folks on the far left can be a little too macho (the women, too) but, that being the case, fighting Fascists is a good use of that energy. Just don't be stupid. If you show up to fight Fascists, don't get sidetracked into breaking windows or yelling at the cops if they aren't doing anything wrong at the moment.   Oh, and clearly the far right understands the imprtance of incremental change, which is why they are winning. So don't mock progressives who work for incremental change as 'reformist ass liberals' or whatever. That is not a good way to make friends or build coalitions. If you are more comfortable being wild on the streets than phone banking, cool, but we need, as the expression goes, 'diversity of tactics.' Peace out."
"You're a white imbecile ContraPoints. Just make a video in which you explain to us why is not good to be a white man, white woman or a white child. The blacks, arabs, hispanics and the rest love to be black, brown or yellow. I want to know why is not good to be white and live in a white country. Thanks."
"I love your content"
"I've said this before and I'll say it again: The idea that all that the US was righteously fighting against in WWII was racism/fascism/Nazism/oppressive ideologies seems like bullshit to me."
"Fuck you Steve Shives you bitch boy."
"Fuck you im a libertarian socialist I will never bend the knee to the oppression of communism, fashisim, or any other ideology that seeks to keep people from expressing themselves and enjoying maximum freedom."
"Fashists and ethno nationalists are different. To me culture is not that big a deal. Fashists are humans too. The best way to destroy them is to mock them not fear them. They want us to fear them. Engage them in direct debate where you call out fallacies, lies, and deflections until you leave them naked in their ignorance in front of everyone. Look I have come a cross a ridiculous amount of 'liberals' who act exactly like fachists including you. I know how fachists work I don't think they are a threat as much as the political establishment to my freedom. They are, however a threat to my freedom regardless, just a minor one."
"The fascist could never achieve there long term goal. Even easily manipulated centrist and conservatives arent dumb enough for it to get very far"
"before I jump right in on my comment I feel I need to explain a little background info. My step brother is Jewish and has a SLIGHT reputation as being a little emotional and snowflakey. Like Tumblr, and that's fine!  I love him dearly and have tried to help him since we have both always struggled with mental health issues, and are both trans.  It's a crazy coincidence,and despite being younger than me I looked up to him in a few ways.  I was always very proud of him.  I realize that he might be afraid but I don't think this justifies all of his ideas.  SO, lately he's been saying things I dont agree with.. he literally told me we should round up and kill right wing folks and Nazis. He echoed this on his social media, so as his sister I felt like I should ask him about that.  Neither of us even know anyone who approves of or IS a Nazi, and we live in the Pacific Northwest. (Very libertarian)  So if he's afraid, this seems a little overboard. i kind of told him that that's shockingly similar to what Nazis might say. I thought violence in the streets against minorities is what Nazis wanted? It felt like a little red flag so i brought it to his attention and he called me a centrist and later a nazi all because I didnt agree that the best solution is to hurt people. I happen to think that right out attacking ANYONE based on their percieved identity is kind of a shitty idea. I feel like that might undermine your point? A lot? I was told that if I'm not 100% on board, I'm a Nazi. And if I'm not a nazi I'm a centrist, which is basically worse.  That all seems ludicrous to me. He then proceeded to ignore most of the things I said and treated me really harshly in front of his friends. Not agreeing with either group of extremists doesn't make me a fucking centrist.  Now it's been two years and he's still  holding a for real grudge over this and he completely cut me out of his life. So as a tiny asterisk to Contras... Points..  Argue with your family members at your discretion. It can rip a family apart over something that might turn out to be really petty later."

"This is brilliant. That’s all I need to say. Glad a friend posted this on Facebook."
"Well, holy shit. Thank you, I was able to spot Fascism in my own father. He showed it up very clearly when I told him I was close to Fidel Castro and to Marxism-Leninism.., that was the breaking point, he always let it be known but in a very subtle way. Not that he is a huge admirer of Hitler or Mussolini or anything like that, he isn't.. he is more like an Argentinian-Fascist, something very local.   How fucking sad, it is a huge let down because our relation is basically broken. Thank you, regardless!."

"I find Antifa too hostile and self-righteous for their own good. The fascists who they fight are smart and know this, appealing to the sensible people that 'hey atleast we don't go around attacking anyone who might seem like a nazi.' But in fact they do the exact same.   The problem is huge and it has no easy solution. Myself, I am a person who believes all people deserve equal opportunity and liberty and nothing else matters to me. If anyone tries to justify the opposite in any way, you are my enemy and I wish to convert you to my side."

I instead suggest the nightly news hour on the local PBS broadcaster that wil tell them about stuff that effects them, especially deceptive things to vote on that seem counter intuitive to want or vote against since they are not slaves to their commercial break advertiser CEO's philosophy. I like to think they value my advice more after I showed them Bernie Sanders vids off of youtube which got them honestly surprised why they didn't hear of him before when they watched and think CNN will make them all knowing."

"The alt right is alarmingly better at broadening their message to attract (especially white) people in the middle. I started out college pretty far left and graduated more of a centrist.

"At first I was a bit skeptical of this video, because your description of fascism was more describing white nationalism/nazism as opposed to fascism in general, but honestly it kind of doesn't matter. There isn't a significant grouping getting people to support the idea of a USSR 2 (USSR was fascist, attempting to use fascism to implement a communist way of life). This was a great video, and very creative. I only just now realized it was over 20 mins. I love videos that are that long but feel short."

"'Don't debate them'. Well sacrificing the 'sacredness' of universal free speech may be worth if it leads to the death of fascism but it could also easily backfire. I guess I am too postmodernist on my views on morality to support something like this. Silencing someone gives you a position of extreme power. As you said people are gullible. If censorship gets normalized in the mind of the average centrist we are doomed. I wouldn't give them so much power and then hope that they will only use it against Nazis."
"Basically many people who use all these semantics aren't actually fascists. Some of them are just stupid fascist propaganda victims. I think that only a few of those people are cunning enough to push disguised fascist propaganda. Still you make many good points"

'Feminism' is not a bad word and maybe someday soon I'll feel comfortable enough to call myself that again. I'm still young, and learning everyday, but your videos really click with me.

"Woah. The thing about Trumps hands..."
"Hi I think this is a good video and contra mentions things people might not realize. However, the idea that you should avoid giving people you disagree with a platform is dangerous and harmful. After engaging in community peace work in northern Ireland I can say that when you see people with other opinions than yours as not worth debating then both sides become isolated and defined by their differences, free dialogue (which is different to free speech as that would include mindless monologue that the right and left seem to like nowadays) is the greatest sort of activism you could do, and yes it is far more difficult and less exciting than shouting at a group of nazis. This sort of pathologizing of ideas you disagree with is destructive, if you assign a derogatory word to an opinion like commie or sjw or fascist it then becomes acceptable not to interact with it, people are becoming petty and badly defined in similar ways to some northern Irish communities and that's a really bad thing that can only be changed through dialogue. Some people are neo-Nazis others just have religious or political opinions which you disagree with."

"Identitarianism is not about hating other people or wanting to enact some sort of genocide against non-Europeans, it's about love for one's people. Attempting to represent any expression of this sentiment as 'fashism' is disingenuous as all hell. Europeans have as much of a right as any people to establish homogeneous communities from which they can decide to exclude whom they please. While there's a handful of tards and larpers, the majority of Identitarians do not seek to rule over other people, they just want to be left alone."
"as an immortal Cybertronian, I have a unique perspective.  The tribes we belong to (i.e. I am a Roman/Saxon) change many times in an extended lifetime, as well as how important or unimportant those tribes are.  This millennium I'm a functionist.  Next millennium I'm a Decepticon.  Later throw it all away and its every bot for themselves.  Sadly, if even WE can't get past tribalism, I don't know that there's much hope for humans."
"'That I wish were more common on the left' You haven't been paying attention then. This is how many far-left movements primarily operate, and it's how they've managed to get many of their end goals ratified. The extreme left is far more prone to this sneaky behavior than any other political group, more so than the disorganized and bombastic far right at any rate. The only road block that may make it seem like the extreme left doesn't do as much of this kind of sly maneuvering, is because the left can't agree on anything overall, and have too many competing movements within it. So while they may lack an overarching organized marching order, the groups that make up the extreme left still make liberal use of this kind of manipulative strategy to meet their activist goals.  Either way, I'm shocked you think this would be a good thing under any circumstances. It's sly and smarmy, a furtive strategy that I strongly disapprove regardless of which ideological group is the perpetrator. I think you're letting your ideological bias colour your perspective here, which is really off putting. Which I guess is pretty relevant, now that I think about it. Hm."

That is, you cannot do something ironically - ironay is only observed in the past tense or from the third person perspective. Hence why its often said 'Americans dont get irony'. Turns out (due to translation / a lack of equivalent terminology) this is also the same for much of Europe.  Anyways, great videos - I'm watching in reverse from one in my suggestions today.

So it’s ok to call all kekistanis fascist because one was but as soon as one BLM supporter kills police you say it has nothing to do with the BLM movement in general, or if hundreds of radical Islamic terrorists kill thousands of people you say that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism.   Do you not see how hypocritical you are?!   Which is it?   You can’t have it both ways and just cherry pick to make yourself always right."

"Hungary and Poland now build fences around their countries. Sweden and Germany are having second thoughts about immigration/diversity...many facist nazi groups are rising up like it was 1927. The Brexit vote in England and the Trump vote shows how white people are becoming much more conservative. So what is a facist? A conservative who just wants to stay white?

"*Problems with this video:*  1:04 You're talking about white nationalists here. You do not have to be white or right wing to be a fascist. There are plenty of *contemporary* post-modernist left wing fascists as well as fascist regimes in the Middle East.   4:07 My appreciation might not be, but future generation's appreciation of European culture IS impeded when they are taught in schools that all cultures are equally good. This is demonstrably wrong with such practices as FGM, ill-treatment of widows, killing of twins and rape victims which are all practiced in certain areas of the middle east and Africa. If culture and traditions are not threatened by increasing immigrant populations, how is western culture going to be preserved by non-westerners? It's not. I have witnessed the replacement of British culture with Middle eastern/eastern European culture first hand. It's not pretty.  4:26 Conflating Nazis and fascists, again, see previous.  7:17 SO WILL NON-FASCISTS. You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater here.  7:47 Being anti-immigration does not make you a fascist. Particularly with the case of the Mediterranean where the vast majority of 'refugees' are 'rescued' closer to Libya and Tunisia. Also worth noting that the EU commission acknowledges that about 60% of so called refugees are in fact economic migrants. It's clear you don't know very much about this situation.   7:53 Using your own argument; just calling someone a fascist does not make them a fascist.   8:07 nice meme  8:55 Saying that western culture is a good thing and should be preserved does not make you a fascist.   9:30 So do left wing extremists. Although I bet that you'd be fine with someone identifying as a communist which is as much of a monstrous ideology as fascism.    10:16 All identitarian groups have symbol fetishes, most normal people like symbols. This is a stupid argument.   10:38 welp I guess Motorhead are fascists lol  11:05 James Allsup is a fascist? Hahaha  11:19 The okay sign/white power meme actually did come from reddit (or 4chan can't remember) as an experiment to see how many people would fall for it. Basically the last 6 minutes have been you saying *'fascists like a thing so other people who like that thing might also be a fascist (but might not)'*. Thank's Poirot.  11:31 This actually happens.   11:54 Black men represent 6% of the US population yet commit over 50% of the gun crime, this is why profiling happens, not because muh institutional racism  12:07 Going by the suicide statistics, the biggest risk posed to transgender people is themselves  13:18 BAN THE MEMES  14:31 the SPLC lmao  14:54 'Violence is worse when people I disagree with do it'  15:04 If BLM is about improving the lives of black people why do they destroy their own neighbourhoods? BLM is just kids rioting with a few hardline sjws egging them on  15:20 Are you denying that violence perpetrated by antifa is bad or even exists? Sure sounds like it.  15:34 Leftist extremists smashing windows, torching cars and beating people up turns people against the left?       M I N D    B L O W N   15:47 I see what you're doing now, you're using examples of arguably sensible economic and migratory statements and associating them and the people that say them with 'fascists'. Then you use weasel words saying something like 'I'm not saying all fascists do/think/say/like this thing but if someone does, they might be a fascists'. Ironic really cause that's the argument you're using to discredit your strawnmen fascists. I'm surprised that most of the moronic clap emoji using commenters lap this shit up.

They were always a little bit on the left on the political spectrum. But pushing them towards the right is not fair. And if you lefties keep doing that, then that is were we end up if we aren't there already."
"The smartest thing modern fascists ever did was to so convincingly disguise themselves as anything besides the absolute enemy of the people they're trying to use.  This is not a common political debate. This is a violent, comics-book level villain trying to use you.  Yes, YOU. Even if you think you're smarter than that, or 'i'm offended' or it's just for fun or ironic or whatever shit they tell you. Don't be a sucker. Don't be used. No matter whether you agree with the left or whatever. I'd rather you disagree than you be some red-skull fanboy without even a lick of a clue that you're being used as a stair step. You've got a boot on your head. Come on."

"Now I wanna make a supervillain who useses thes symbols"
"Very Zionist, CIA, MK-Ultra, setup. Always interjecting sexual depravity and deviancy. A nation deceived, indeed."
"Holy fuck, I was arguing with a fascist without even realizing it. He said defend white culture and I went off the handle and was like 'Which white culture? Europe has 100s of cultures you can't just call it all one culture. Scandinavians would be insulted if they are lumped with the Roman culture.' Now i know he was just being a fascist prick."
"First of all, this is an extremely well crafted video.  But something didn't sit well with me and I couldn't quite put my finger on it until I realized that if you replaced every instance of 'fasist' or 'Nazi' with '(((illumitati)))' or 'Jew' you get the exact same line of argument that anti-semites use to peddle their silly bullshit. 'Illuminati use subtle symbols to manipulate the rubes and brush it off as entertainment' or 'Jews will always deny being a part of whatever the fuck it is they are up to.' To anti-semite conspiracy theorists anyone who calls them out on their shit is a 'pawn' or to the 'Jewish conspiracy'.  Also seem pretty comfortable dressing up in quasi-Nazi garb and wearing rings of nazi symbols. Irony perhaps? Irony is just a thiny disgused dog whiste according to the video.  (((I))) hope you can see how the premise of this video eats its own tail.  Also that condesceding attitude towards centrists can go fuck itself."
"The rhetoric based on dichotomy: 'fascism' vs 'anti-fascism' is driven by fascists who represent themselves as 'antfasciststs'(as W. Churchill has predicted) who's ultimate existential threat is the loss of fascism', cause the whole ideology is predicated on existence of such.  Did you ever try to ask yourself: what would antifascists become if they would achieve their ideological haven? And how will you ever know if you got there? Would a certain laws still be running? Would we than be able to have a free speech, silly jokes and so on. It the left capable of saying at one point, there are no more oppresors and oppressed, or it is a continues process of segregating someone as oppresors. Think about that."

You've popped up in my suggestions before, but (in this video's thumbnail, at least) you look like a woman actually in the alt-right, so I never watched your videos before. I'm really disappointed that I didn't check to make sure, as I'm a few videos in now, and you make some amazing content."
"Centrist here, great vid!  I do sympathize with Europeans who are getting flooded with migrants who seem to be draining their social services.  I am Mexican-Canadian and I bet Mexicans would be pretty pissed off if suddenly millions of people were flooding in from a totally different culture.  Europeans are the native people of Europe, so it makes sense for them to worry when they see 'no-go zones'.   I do NOT agree with though, when people like Faith Goldy/Lauren Rose/Etc. try to translate those European issues into Canada/US, fearmongering about Islam and saying that North America is for the Europeans as well.  Sorry, not the same!  America and Canada belong to the indigenous people."

I was so distracted by the red and green reflections on your eyes and hair that I had to rewing a couple times. Oh, and the maga hat bit was genuinely terrifying. Well fucking done."
"Naive centrist here, apparently. Watched the first three minutes and was like 'oh my god, there are people like that?' But now you're recruiting me into a war. I will not be drafted into your war. I will fight terrible ideas but I will not fight okay ideas just because I think the person might be terrible. I wish there was something in here about idiotic lefties, because let's be real, there are some, they aren't as dangeorus but they certainly drive people towards the right (otherwise the whole 'both sides' thing wouldn't work!)  You are talking about how fascism uses certain tactics to recruit people and then you are using the exact same tactics to recruit people. That is dodgy as fuck!"
"hard to notice next to that pretty face, but that's an Odal rune @10:32, the Othala rune looks very similar and shares a root with the christian Icthys, but is very different in meaning.  the Odins eye and double Sieg runes are also holdovers from the second world war that these clowns use (both of which i have yet to cover the tattoos i have thereof, some of us have the capability to embrace change just like any other group of people as you well know).  had to comment, sorry if this is a repeat but thank you for the content!"
"17:55 This image is burned into the back of my brain."
"Centrist: *Minding their own business in 2014* Centrist: *Sees Left Identity Politics rise in 2015* Centrist: *Sees Fascists rise to power shortly after in 2016* Leftists: 'Geez why are these centrists so gullible. Why would they think our actions contributed to the situation we're now in?' (Note: Centrists are gullible. I was. But there is no denying the Leftists have completely mishandled things."
"This is perhaps a shallow takeaway, but man the 1940s were aesthetic AF."

"i give you 4 years, before you start to understand that 'fascism' isn't a bad word, and point 3 is only for the racists. Oh, and the ok sign was a troll of the left. It started as a game 'let's make the most normal things racist by saying that they are'. And like the simple minded, now milk is a racist statement. I think you read too deeply."

"All conservatives are Alt-Lite"
"The lefts plan didn't work so well with the normies because America major population is not a true native population and a lot of whites would have some associated feelings of white guilt. By the time BLM and Antifa were running the medias narrative had changed, compounded by UNHRC laws coming into force changed the dynamics. The initial LBGT marches went well but the continuation of the war and the appearance of BLM and Antifa conflated the situation,I seen Antifa described from far left to far right all the normies knew was that they were under attack on the streets.Maybe needed some antiwar  protests in there as well SMH. Who ever thought up the strategy needs to go back to the text books."
"Wow ok, no need for the hate. I’ll take my collection of 1990s Tampa Bay Slim Jim glasses elsewhere"

"This is such a good video.  Also, you look so beautiful with blonde hair.  I chopped mine off and dyed it blue.  I sometimes miss being blonde."
"1 minute in and we're already defining all fascism as being White-specific. No, it is not necessarily only with White people; it can be any race. While in the case of the alt-right, yes, it definitely would be concerning White people as the 'supreme' race or whatever, and that all races/ethnicities should be segregated into their own countries of origin. Obviously that's a very wrong and toxic ideology, but places such as Japan (and a large amount of Asian countries, actually) hold similar beliefs to that. A simple Wikipedia read could easily tell you that most of your beginning definitions of fascism are not 100% true."
"The “ok” hand symbol is a fascist dog whistle? Hmm... seems like even Contrapoints got trolled hard."

"totalitarianism is far worse."
"If they want to preserve culture so badly, they ought to remember that kicking fascist ass is a huge part of American and European culture."
"I think I have a way to stop the 'WP' sign. Those who pass around the meme without knowing its context aren't likely to be that attached to the racist undercurrent associated with it. At least, not yet. To them, it's just a fad they can use to look cool, so if we can get them to embrace other ways of making themselves attractive, they will replace their behavior with whatever's next in the zeitgeist. When you encounter the 'OK-smirk', *DON'T* *REACT.* I'm talking radio silence. Play dumb, act distracted, etc.  Don't let them know that you know the bullshit. Instead, react more to the actual positive things they do, personal inside jokes, *a* *e* *s* *t* *h* *e* *t* *i* *c* memes, or whatever else is benign and cool. Millennial racists don't want it known that their new methods of indoctrination can be eaten up by the next lolcat.  If these punkass alt-nazis think they have better social skills than the goddamn socialists, they're _FUCKIN'_ _WRONG!_"

"I have a message for that dude: Leftists are the ones who far more often shut down actual civil debate on issues. (I am conservative on most issues but liberal on some such as pro-choice and pro any 2 single consenting adults allowed to marry each other)."
"fascism seems to be defined by it's methods and aims, not by it's effects, maybe we need a second definition for the latter-sort . using several concepts for one definition doesn't make the understanding any easier,  whatever one's opinions."
"'The OK symbol wasn't a real fascist symbol, /pol/ just tricked people into thinking it was to make leftists look crazy.' Okay, but ironically enough that only supports Contra's larger point that fascists use dishonest tactics to discredit their opponents."

Edit: I JUST GOT TO THE MEGAPHONE LINE HOLY SHITTTTT"
"This makes several good points, but you neglected the role that neo-paganism (otherwise known as 'Wicca' and 'Asatru') has had in popularizing fascist doctrine in groups that have traditionally been the target of right-wing hatred (especially women who consider themselves feminist). Although many neo-pagans are fairly innocuous and well-meaning people who just like to play around with crystals and candles and think that the term 'Gardinarian Wicca' has something to do with gardening, the actual origins of Wicca and Asatru lie in the late 19th Century Romantic movement and the writings of a particularly distasteful German occultist name Hugo Von List. Although somewhat modified after the Second World War (most notably by the inclusion of gay people and elevating women above the brood mare role assigned to them by the original 'volkietch' movement) modern neo-paganism retains many Fascist elements, including its xenophobic and anti-Semitic elements, its romanticized and largely mythical attitude towards history (e.g:that pre-Christian Europe was some sort of glorious pagan Utopia in which the majority of the population devoted much of their time to having orgies and dancing around maypoles until they were somehow overcome by the supposedly inferior Semites and forced to become Christian) its rejection of modern medicine in favour of untrained use of magic, herbal remedies and other 'natural methods', its symbols (particularly the Aramen runes that you'll commonly seen used as tattoos in the Asatru community)  and much of its terminology (the term 'Burning Times' which is commonly used by both Asatru and Wiccans first appeared in the Nazi occult magazine Ostara). Speaking as a person whose in-laws came from Northern Europe and fought bitterly against both Fascism and Communism before they emigrated to Canada, I find these wannabe 'witches' annoying and ridiculous, but inexplicably, there seem to be more and more of them each day1"
"It feels so good to read through this comment section and not see any hate toward the transgender community. It makes me hopeful for our future as a community."
"+ContraPoints The Alt-Right and Fascists are not the same thing. They've certainly got a lot in common, especially in terms of white nationalism, militarism, and cult-like adoration of leaders, but there are important distinctions in terms of views on economics and social liberty. Most of the Alt-right are obsessive constitutionalists who support freedom of expression and enterprise, while Fascists are authoritarians who want to nationalise industries and unions and regulate and censor political expression.  Neither Fascists nor the Alt-Right are necessarily anti-semitic. It's fairly common in practice in both groups, but it's not a part of the definition of either.  There are some fascists in the alt-right, but most members of the alt-right are not fascists.  Labelling someone who is by definition not a fascist as a facist in order to dismiss their argument makes you look like you're either dishonest or stupid. I don't think you are, but that's what it looks like, and it's certainly what the alt-right will want to spin this as.  Aside from that, this is a good video. Quite funny."
"There is a lot of good stuff and some frustrating stuff as well in this. I am a moderate Liberal so the advice and frustration over my way of thinking is interesting. You get frustrated with me at times and I feel the same way (although I think Contrapoint videos are hilarious and you are a thoughtful, funny person) Sometimes it seems like left leaning people are a little more paranoid about revealing the 'true' nature of false progressives and are quick to assume their friends are flirting with the Dark Side rather than considering that by nature Moderates frame prosperity as a balance and they want to make sure that their friends do not go off the rails.  The advice to 'argue with your friends' to 'make them listen..'  is concerning for my personality type because I don't think it gets us anywhere. Well crafted arguments do not change minds. The discussions are too antagonistic now generally and overloaded with complicated ideas that often don't make sense to people who have not been formally educated. The layers of implied meaning are too complex and sometimes obsessing about reading code may not be helpful, it just creates more suspicion. There is too much reading in to words. I would think that the broader picture of how someone lives their life, the close friends they have, the kind of work that matters in a community and is often overlooked speaks more to where someone is grounded rather than stumbling upon a phrase that they didn't know is secret White Nationist jargon. It feels shitty beyond words to be misunderstood, but your point about minorities and POC feeling that way for years is well taken, although I think we would agree that 'balanced' would mean no one is treated shitty.   A moderate Liberal genuinely cares about issues of equality. They want more freedom and less boundaries but they may have well-intentioned criticisms of some of the core driving philosophies of the Modern Left and how they go about realizing their vision. Whether they are a potential Nazi in the making you have to speak to them as a human being and you are going to have much greater success if you do not assume the worst from them. Have a straight forward conversation. This is complex enough and full of so many landmines a productive conversation won't ever happen if it is always framed in a argument format."
"19:05 .................Maybe I'm overreacting but that really does seem weird."
"In viking culture women were equal.  Women could inherit land and titles, hold those lands and titles, choose her partner, divorce her partner without becoming a pariah within the community, have children out of wedlock, fight alongside the men in the shield wall, and handled the house hold finances because vikings believed math=witchcraft.  In fact, seidr (viking witches devoted to Freya) were highly respected within viking culture, to the point that a jarl would HAVE to give his seat as his own table to a seidr if they visited.  Homosexuality was something that just happened and no one cared, same as transgenderism.  PLEASE do not compare these dick heads to vikings."
"I'm just an anarcho-primitivist accelerationist who supported Trump because he is an agent of chaos and leftists always accuse me of being a fascist just because I oppose global socialist government and government as a whole."
"That is not what fascism is or fascists are.....  1.'Everything in the state'. The Government is supreme and the country is all-encompasing, and all within it must conform to the ruling body, often a dictator. 2.'Nothing outside the state'. The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government. 3.'Nothing against the state'. Any type of questioning the government is not to be tolerated. If you do not see things our way, you are wrong. If you do not agree with the government, you cannot be allowed to live and taint the minds of the rest of the good citizens."
"Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radical authoritarian ultranationalism,[1][2][3][4] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy,[5] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe."

"I agree with our statements in this video, but fascism and nazism are about as different as socialism and communism. Fascism is an umbrella ideology that promotes a society with a focus around militias, hence the name, derived from italian 'fasci' - literally 'militias'. Although it is usually used to refer to the Partito National Fascista's version of the ideology - which was largely built around populism - it can also be applied to similar ideologies such as the Legionnaire Movement.  Nazism, on the hand, is a specific ideology developed by the NSDAP and its sister parties with a focus around one strong leader, a society run entirely by a political party and highly obscure racial theory, as well as various other beliefs. Although some minor variations have sprung up, the ideology is relatively uniform.  I would hesitate to call 'american fascism' nazism, in fact, since it seems more focused around populism, white supremacy (but not the idea of inferior whites) and the idea that they are doing some sort of duty, whether it be by 'defending America from socialism' or 'defending the white race', all powered by a feeling of power in numbers or solidarity.  I'm happy to hear any disagreements."

"if the speech incites violence or illegal actions then it is not covered under free speech rights"
"Simply Brilliant."
"Interesting that you said fascists constantly shift their terminology and throughout the entire video you puked a thesaurus to try and sound intelligent, it's like when ugly people take photos at specific angles or in better light or next to an uglier friend, you say words that you think will make you sound intelligent as you babble on and on about stuff that really won't matter in ten years but it's painfully obvious you want to be an entertainer."
"I agree fascism is bad but I could never support violence against people. If a group uses violence against a group that wasn't bring violent then I don't want to associate with them."
"coworker told me about the ok symbol's alt meaning today.  What happened to this planet???"
"Watched a few of your things with similar themes and i have to say, that gestapo outfit is so fucking awesome i think it broke my brain. And loved the rest of these videos too.."
"Most of this could be mirrored by the left and Communists!"
"i dont know how white people can classify themselves as 'the west' when frankly indigenous peoples are the actual west - and southwest of europe is the continent of africa (largely poc) while northEAST is where russia resides, the original homeland of the term and people known as caucasian. so really 'the west' is an intensely stupid concept when you try to use it to mean white people."
"Ok, dude."
"what about Islamic fascism tho?"
"What fascists believe:   Describes White Nationalism. Fascism is a lot more interesting and a lot more policy based than this"
"Until you do a video about people part of the 'dark web' who #walkaway and who are African-American, trans, etc....I just don't take any of these vides seriously. You make the same generalizations as every other leftist about why people dislike those policies. Show me and others who don't relate to any particular political party / ideology but dislike the cultural fascism of mainstream liberal culture that you are on the right side of history."
"So, as self-identified centrist, let me voice my thoughts:  Firstly: Yeah, kinda offended by the fact the fact that you see me as a baby. I can think for myself and don't need anyone checking if I'm still good.  Secondly: The 'paranoia' of leftists have made (online) discussions rather hard: Story time! When de 'black lives matter' movement first gained traction. I was a tad confused. I was told that you should never discriminate by race, but here is a group that prides themselves (seemingly) in distinguishing people by colour. So I commented on it, but immediately got 'identified' as a racist myself. Only later did I find out about the 'white lives matter' movement and that my accuser must've thought of me as one of them.  I only felt resentment towards 'black lives matter' after my comment. Not because I've ever had problems with the movement, but because my experience in discussing it have been so bad. AND my question is never answered, or addressed by any left-winger I follow.  If you don't want to discuss (respectfully), the fascists will.  I don't think fascism is as manipulative as you make it out to be. Have you ever discussed a fascists? Because most of them are full of shit. It's only when you're made out to be one, you start to sympathize. Or when a youtuber makes a video in which 3 of the 10 'identifiers' against fascists are also applicable for you."
"Wow deep! Why have I never heard of you before?"
"ugly tranny, not even trying. 0/10"
"Been watching your videos, just wanted to say I really appreciate the work you put into these. I threw a dollar at your patreon, hopefully I can do more in the future, but I just took in a teenager."
"You're gorgeous"
"Hooooooooly crap, fascists  use the ok symbol to communicate with each other? That's my most used emoji! Better rethink my emoji -use."
"Not gonna lie I got suckered in by these strategies back in the day. Shit is insidious and really effective on clueless and listless young men."
"That last part.... you are a genious <3"
"Whats scary is that this talking points are being echoed from social media to real people and they in turn spread them to even other countries. I am from Cuba, and I was talking to a friend that still lived there and I continue to pick up some of these talking points and I have tried to explain to him that he is repeating those talking points...He insist that he came to this same conclusions by himself, something I just don't believe seeing how they are the same talking points."
"I know so many normal and sane people who are either centrists or classical liberals, but have picked up so many alt-right talking points. Talking points themselves are fine out of the alt-right context, but they did lure them in into believing ridiculous conspiracy theories such as the superior white genetics and Africans being mixed with ape genes."
"Look at these dislikes, lmao. Stay pressed nazi scum <3"
"plot twist: what if there is no such thing as centrist but just ironic Facists and everyone else is either a communist or an ironic one???? drop the bombs please👌✌💖🍆🍌👔⌚💰🔫🎂💏🙌💃😭"
"Wtf is this cancerous shite?"
"i think this vod misses out on only one key concept.. fascism is a failure of the left. the left has to do better and more to bring about true rev dang ContraPoint is pretty cute"
"You do a lot of mistakes in here.... Lets begin: 1) It's people of any heritage. Not European heritage only. The perfect example is Israel, where people of Jewish heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as the Jewish race- sometimes dog-whistled as 'Victims of anti-semitism'. I literally used your own words. This is also present in Islamic state, which are indeed Fascistic. Why? They also maintain the Islamic heritage that ought to constitute biological, cultural, and political unity towards the Islamic faith together with Arabic superiority. If you didn't know, the Arabic language is holy, which infers that is superior in their perspective.  2) Again, this is only Nazism. This is not even Italian Fascism, or even include the Falange Fascist movements, or even the Mexican Fascist movements. This is not a necessity for Fascism, but only Nazism. It can also be other cultures. For Israel, it is the Arabs and their Islamic faith. For the Islamic Fascist, it is the Western culture and Liberalism.  3) Like Israel is doing, right? Establishing a Jewish homeland by purging the Orthodox Christians, Muslims, and any non-Jewish community. I am being emphatic of using generalization as you are trying to recognize a Fascist, and not a Nazi or White Fascist.  Fascism is a reactionary group toward globalization, liberalism, communism, and also capitalism. They are a ethno-nationalistic dictatorial socialist that can be from the left or the right wing. Yes, Fascism can be left wing even though it has mostly be presented as a right wing. Lets be clear that the American Fascism is right wing, but the Italian Fascist movement had left wing lineage. Meanwhile, Nazism was composed by both together with a hatred toward Jews. Your question would be how can Fascism can be left wing, and to answer it, I will put examples. Imagine you question the actions done by what is suppose to be in essence a social right movement, and if their response is to shut you down, use violence against you, or be immediately hostile to your questioning then you just encountered a left wing fascistic behavior. Strategy 1: meh. Strategy 2: On point, but this is also used by other political movements. Also, Alt-righter are not Nazis. They are Fascistic. The problem is that if these alt-righter believe in a ethno-nationalistic democracy, then the term fascist as a whole doesn't apply to them. Fascist are anti-democratic with no exception. If that alt-righter does not believe in democracy but in a totalitarian leader then you better make the Fascist alarm, because that alt-righter is one. Strategy 3: Fascism is not Nazism, but Nazism is a form of Fascism. Technically, they might be right, but that doesn't mean they are not fascist. I get your point though. Strategy 4: Sure. They use this tactic, but that is why liberals must have immigration reform. And no, letting every immigrant in is not an immigration reform. Strategy 5: And this is why you must let the Fascist speak. The best example is Milo, who got strength thanks to the leftist persistence of not letting him speak. He lost his strength when he was allowed to speak, expressing a condoning sentiment toward pedophilia. It was not the leftist behavior that made him fall, but his freedom of speech. The reason Nazism got into power, and Fascist Italy rose to power was due to the government's lack of action of condemning and attacking their actions. In other words, they rose to power not due to the freedom of speech, but due to the freedom of action allowed to them at that time. It was only the British that took action against the Fascist actions, and held the spread of Fascism in their country.  In the end, yes, one must stop the actions from Fascist, and discredit their views. However, many leftist fail to do this by allowing the same fascistic behaviors of other cultures, and races. Moreover, liberals and leftists are very badly disorganized and even contradicts themselves. For instance, they wish to be heard, but shut anyone that contradicts them. One should allow others to contradict you so you can refute their views. If you can't refute them, or presents a contradiction, then one must organize, fix, or dismiss the view for a better one."
"i have just found these videos and you ar a wonderful, beautiful, intelligent soul and i love em. I have never subscribed so fast. Thank you! ANd keep being great!"
"Denial isn't proof of innocence, but you can treat with someone in good faith and still have skepticism, still push them and challenge them to prove their claims, and still not fall for lies and deception.   The problems with fascism here apply to ANY charlatan or snake oil salesman or religious preacher, there are general skills people need to have to resist getting duped by anyone."

"Alt left was the problem in Charlottesville."
"excellent video. we need more content like this on the left. informative and realistic. love ur channel!! solidarity"
"So, are YOU a fascist?  If anyone who says they aren’t a fascist is in fact a fascist, how does one answer that question in the negative and have it be clearly understood that one isn’t a fascist?"
"Ugh, when you realise how organised the Alt-Right is, how they handle their propaganda, their techniques on thought-manipulation, their 'sneakiness', it's quite obvious why the left is seen as a bunch of 'hyperactive soy drinking snowflakes' or whatever by the public. Either as SJW's or as 'fucking Commies'. Because we don't have these places to organise, to plan, and I guess... manipulate the public if you will. It's all kind of random, without a place to learn debating or to plan real action. Or am I missing something?"
"I like Pepe"
"90 seconds in and your entire premise for the video is completely wrong. Fascists are people who adhere to (and prefer) the tenets of fascism as a political system in a given  nation. What you are describing - what you are trying to label as fascist - is actually white nationalism, which you are also conflating with white supremacy. The fact that you are unable to appreciate the dramatic differences behind these ideologies undermines your credibility completely. Granted, there are nuanced differences and also similarities between these ideologies, but they are certainly not the same.   You do not have to look very far to find black fascists. The existence of black fascists completely turns your description of what fascism is on its head. If your definition were true, there would be no such thing as black fascists. So how do you explain black fascists?  Also, just to clear something up here: Black nationalists and white nationalists are not ideologically opposed. There is a great deal of respect and agreement between the two movements, which completely dispels the connotations of racial hatred that some people love to attach to these movements (although they mostly only like to attach it to white nationalism).  Another note: Fascism is neither right nor left, although I would say that the tenet of a powerful state draws it further to the left than the right. Fascism (in its basic form) places no emphasis on race; rather, it is nation and state that are held in highest regard. To presume that all fascists place such importance on race is equivalent to saying 'All transexuals are mentally ill and will kill themselves after fiddling a child.' This statement is not true for all trans people, but it is true for a small minority. If you take off the part about fiddling kids and only include suicides, then it is true for more transexuals than any other category of the population. So, do we safely assume that trans people are inevitably going to kill themselves and are a danger to themselves and those around them? No. Because it would be prejudiced to do so.  For all these people that espouse lack of prejudice, there sure are a lot of them that have these pre-conceived notions of who people are and wilfully apply them to people that they don't know. The hate continues to spread - and you are a propagator just as much as those you point the finger at."
"Skipped to 3:15, lasted up to 3:17, sending comment, closing tab."
"The best way, in my opinion, to recognize a fascist is what you IIRC called strategy 8, *shifting goalposts and unclear principles*. If you hear something like 'I'm an individualist advocate for free speech', then I'd say that guy *most likely* isn't a fascist because he has stated his positions and principles clearly, and it's something that fascists often refuse to do because they'd later be caught as soon as they shifted their goalposts. Sure, people can be uncertain and entertain many ideas while searching for the truth, but if you see a person doing that *and* simultaneously advocating for something, that's an alarm bell. The same stands for centrists who don't want to *become* fascists. If you have a clear, well-defined worldview and you understand your own positions well enough and consciously remind yourself of them, then you'll be consciously aware of any change that happens. If the change is actually good, like you recognizing something being more complex than you thought, then no problem. If you notice a worrying shift in attitude towards *any* group of people, whether that's the stereotypical jewish boogeyman of the alt-right or the straight white cis male, you need to go outside and get a reality check."
"In recent weeks it has been clear that the left can not win the battle of ideas. Getting people banned is what you do. You're probably low iq as well"
"very good goy! here's a shekel for you :^)"
"2:25 is just we were kangz argument applied to white people, you fucking racist shit head."
"Good video, but isn't fascism, in an abstracted and applicable definition that can transcend context, the suppression of human rights and the willful action towards removing the ability of another group or individuals ability to express their opinions?  I mean racist fascism is a better term for this. I would say North Korea is fascist, and I would say that certain middle eastern countries are fascist. I don't know if it is tied to race, but it is definitely tied to hate for another group. After all, I don't think Judaism is a race.. I'm genetically Jewish, but the Jewish people do not consider me Jewish...  I think there are a lot of fascists out there including the alt right."
"I'm not alt-right by any means but i've usually found people whos beleifs drift to the more 'right' side of thinking generally come across as well informed, cohearent, genuine and inclusive with discussion. In contrast most 'left' seem to fit the narrow mindset of 'if I don't agree with your opinions nothing you say or think is valid' which feels closer to fascism than dreaded 'free speeech'  On that note you're the first left (If you associate as one at all) youtuber that makes thought provoking and well constructed debates that don't feel like someone trying to push some woke agenda down my throat. Humour is also spot on. I love obessing over the hilarity of left-right political videos like these, specifically when Im high on meth.. which didn't mix well with that part at 17:47 with the trump hat which was fucking terrifying to my unprepared addled brain. Fucking thought I entered the twilight zone a minute there. Sub'd."
"It's a shame that google decided not to list the definition of fascism anymore, after fallout from their modification of the term to specify an association with the right wing. Fascism: 1. a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition 2. a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control -Merriam Webster  The most important points of fascist ideology are nationalism, and authoritarianism. So while many members of the alt-right, and many white supremacists are indeed fascists, Not all fascists are right wing, or white supremacists.  Changing the definition of the word to serve the political needs of the moment not only does not solve any of the problems posed by fascism, it also creates confusion around a concept that is more likely to help you win the support of the majority, since the majority 'hate fascism' even though they love America, and blindly comply with authority in most cases.  P.S. Forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism is a tool both sides of the political spectrum seem equally happy to use, as long as it benefits them; this too is a hallmark of true fascism."
"you explained Nazism. heres a video about fascism https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQbFgszFaZg"

"Nice video man"
"I’m a political science student and everything that I’ve been studying so far about fascism is really interesting, and something I don’t think a lot of us are exposed to, fascism isn’t equal to one political belief, not all fascists are nazis, some are hard line communists, or maoists, or extremists of any political identification."
"I don't even know what political label I should put on myself anymore. Am I on the left? But I think socialism is terrible and I really like free markets. Am I on the right? But I absolutely do think that social minorities deserve equal opportunities and should be heard and represented. Am I a centrist? But I'm not really sure what that means tbh. I always viewed them as hypocritical pragmatists without any fixed principles.  Anyway, It seems like I would disagree with you on quite some topics, but this here is an excellent video. Really good work. I don't feel bad about supporting you. You really earned that subscription."
"i've never understood the white nationalist's love of the greeks and romans cus they were... exactly white now. They were very mutlicultural and even 'native' people aren't white there. 'white' is really scandivian germanic peoples and even then, they never had the 'white culture' they try to sing praises of. they confused me."
"Where did ya get your list of those things Fascists believe?"

"I believe that, as a trans woman, welcoming into the country, the very people who believe you should be stoned to death, at once, seems very insane, and also, on some level, which I do not agree with or understand, very brave."

"Important message, well told."
"I find it hard to reconcile my distaste for violence with my hatred for white supremacy and fascist ideology. I want to punch these people in the face, but I have to restrain myself unless they hit me first."
"This channel is like a bad horror movie. Other than that it's completely trite. I love how everybody has their own definition for fascism nowadays. How convenient that we can just transmute terms for our own purposes. That way it could include anybody you want it to! How lovely!"
"I love your videos.  I can only just take so many at one time because the truths you're saying are bitter pills and hurt my heart to know they're real.  Once I'm done with this video, I'mma go watch a whole bunch of Winnie the Pooh.  But thanks, regardless!"
"'Yes, they do have a right to free speech, but they do not have a right to a megaphone and you should not be giving them one.'"

"It won't be certainly Richard Spencer to tell you what is a Fascist"
"Centrists don't become allied with fascists. Socialists like Pierre Laval and Communists like Stalin do. I don't know where you read that but it's false.  Also when you use the sentence 'that's what they want you to hear', you've gone full on, Alex Jones leve, conspiracy theorist."
"Please don't put Voltaire into their sac of shit please."
"I think that fascist video uses Daft Punk - Son of Flinn. I doubt they have permission, just mock up a 'cease and desist' ..."
"Greetings from Greece!  Over here, in the past 100 years, my country has had 2 local dictatorships, and we have been occupied by the nazis! Cool stuff... (not really).  And there has always been resistance to that regime. Many have died in exile, tortured and interrogated, and because the resistance was doing guerilla war, and the nazis didn't know where they were hiding and retaliated, whole villages were destroyed.  Anyhow, we have a few notable composers and performers who sang some very powerful songs at that time. One of my favourites is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceQIwMw7YKI  Which is called 'Fascism'. And it explains how fascism is not something new, and you need to understand it, and in the chorus it says: 'Deeply understand fascism; It wont die alone, CRUSH IT!'  If you ever give it a listen and you like the tune (which may be dated since there are no bass drops or whatever...) i will reply with translated lyrics! Just wanted to share it  P.S.: We have a neonazi party in our parliament at the moment as well... The threat is real here and all around the EU to be frank..."
"You're denying the alt-left? What are the people who drink 'white tears' then? What are the people who want people to stay silent in classes that concern 'black' issues?"
"Thank you for the effort you put into your work - its both entertaining and informative :)"
"Ngl this video was really informative. It makes sense that you would hide overt racism with memes and jokes and stuff on the internet. That being said it does beg the question of where do we draw the line with all this? If they hide behind things we should all have access to, like free speech and dark comedy, where do we draw the line without removing access to those things for ourselves?"
"I think I worked for a fucking fascist. Extra glad I moved..."
"Ok all of the excellent points made in this video aside, when you did the hat switch and stared grinning into the camera it genuinely creeped me out so much I had to look up some kitten videos on the internet >.> but also 12/10 subscribed"
"i love u contra <3"
"lol no, the Kekistani's really are fucking with you.  They're mocking the right, by pretending to be them; and they're mocking the left.... by pretending to be the right.  The fact that everyone from the left seems to think that Kekistani's are 'secretly far right', is playing in to what the Kekistani's want.   Trolled twice over."
"19:44 Well, I'm at least glad you are self-aware enough to admit this.  Many of you leftist/SJWs would call _me_ a fascist based on what I believe and that amuses me, frankly, but I have to ask you:  Why do *you* have an iron cross, SS hat, and black sun ring?  I don't own any of that shit in _my_ closet so I find the irony staggering that me a 'fascist' owns less Nazi memorabilia than you, a paranoid leftist.  But I guess I *must* be a fascist because I'm a Republican Capitalist denying it based on your video rofl.  God I love you leftists... the mental gymnastics y'all try to pull off to justify your skewed reality is frightening at worst, laughable at best.  As always though, very well made video... I just 100% disagree with everything espoused in it."
"Why and how is Lauren a fascist? 'I'm not a fascist'is not only a fascist would say, it's what almost everyone would say. So you cannot define someone as a fascist only because he says he's not a fascist. Could you link some of her videos which are clearly fascist?"

"Videos like yours have helped me transition from a liberal vaguely scared of the left to a proud leftist swidge. Thanks for helping perpetuate the eternal cycle of me cringing at my past self, which means personal growth, I guess. :D"
"I'm late to this party, but thank you for making this. It's unfortunate that many of these strategies are used by people who don't identify as fascists who are 'hiding their power level.'  I appreciate that you said we shouldn't be giving them a megaphone. What do we do with the fact that they many of them have one already, political office?"
"I think I might be a centrist, but I'm not sure. I thought the whole 'Kekistan' thing was hilarious, like, edgy but funny. Does that mean I'm an accidental fascist?"
"Enjoyed everything about this vid except for the ending, where you kind of made it sound like the soviet 'comrades' where like the  good guys compared to fascists. I can't name the all the horrible things the Red Army did during the war, but I definitely know enough to realize, that they were pretty much as bad the enemy they were fighting. The fuckers were even allied to begin with.  Also, I don't remember which country it was, might have been Finland? But I remember that after having pushed Germany out of Russia, Stalin became aware that they were basically gonna win the war, so instead of focusing all of his efforts on pushing the nazis out of all the countries they had gained a grip of, he fucking stopped half way and decided it was time to use this war to expand the Soviet Union a bit as well. For example, when it came to Poland, instead of helping the freedom fighters, he let them all get massacred by a superior German force, BECAUSE the freedom fighters and its leaders were leaning a bit too much towards the Western world and it's culture.   I'm probably just ranting like an idiot, but man, it just felt off, you know, after 20 minutes of talking about how to 'resist' fascism, that you did that whole 'comrade' thing. Idk, you seem smarter than me, so you probably know how retarded it is to praise the Soviet Union.   Am really loving your videos though, I find that my opinions and thoughts are being challenged and I kind of like it. That, and the fact that the way you do your videos, like the 'staging' of things, the cinematography, makes it all seem really powerful, tbh.  Would love to meet you in real life and chat, you seem really cool and interesting.   Have a great day!"
"So the alt-right is basically 'ISIS for white people'"
"So, let me se if I got this right: White people, who have spent the last 500 years invading and taking over 80% of the planet, wanna have a new homeland? Just checking."
"Your roleplays are very amusing :D"
"Do they know that they,,,, already have an ethnostate???? It’s literally the country whatever their ethnicity is from. They try and paint their ideals a thing about ‘ethnic pride’ when it has everything to do with skin color cause they really don’t give a damn about ethnicity. I know like 60 people at my school like this it makes me wanna vomit I swear"
"What frustrates me about current altright language is their gross appropriation of Norse and other Scandinavian symbology, cultures that, funny enough, actually had pretty friendly relations with  Islamic cultures during the Islamic golden age. It's so hard to use or appreciate Norse symbology myself without knowing which symbol might be used by Nazis one day or kkk members the next. At least there are pagan/witchcraft and other antifacist Scandinavian groups doing their best to address this issue."
"Lol, I went from born and raised cathilolic conservative, to moderate centrist, to low-key-liberal-atheist-redpiller-against-'the left'-who-occasionally-k'noodles-with-the-altright, to agnostic progressive feminist lgbt ally/activist over the course of like 3 years.   I'm fucking exhausted."

"Fuggin eye roll to this...."
"Excellent video that should be shared continuously. Love your channel btw. Subscribed."
"is this a tranny?"
"Your logic of linking centrist as “dog whistlers” is a nice little way to justify opposing them and not having to listen to their points You need to stop being so paranoid and you need to realize that censorship will only emboldened those who despise you and if your afraid of being targeted for being trans then maybe don’t make such a huge deal of your identity since it only makes sense to someone that wants to hurt you that destroying your identity is a good way to cut deep"
"Sooooo is your solution to become authoritarian censoring leftist assholes? Cause without the Free market place™️ Solution your only option is to be just as bad in your quest to “bash the Fash”"
"Long story short of my take on this, just don't support shitty policies and fight for the rights of others, and then fascists and all their pretend-to-be-normies hand shakes won't amount to anything. No need to become paranoid obsessively watching their every move. If you're doing it scientifically, fine, but ensure you have the scientific discipline and chops to do it properly, and that you don't go outside those bounds.  Still, I don't agree with the 'don't give them a platform' argument. That's just saying they are too tricky and smart to deal with directly, and I don't believe this. Their traction, as scary as it can be, is really pretty minute if you take a step back. There's no need to give into George H. W. Bush style tactics, and it will almost certainly make things worse, just as the 'War on Terror' has done to Terrorism."
"This is EXCELLENT!!!!!  Keep up the good fight."
"I definitely had a friend like this who seemed like he was getting into the alt-right, and I kept trying to convince myself 'oh, he's not a Nazi, he's just on the shallow end of the far right' or 'he's just a traditionalist' or 'oh, he shares a few of their ideas but not the racist ones' but now that I'm seeing this I realize that based on everything he was probably a major fascist/Nazi who was hiding his 'power level' from me."
"Wow, this video is mind blowing as it unintentionally shows alot of thing wrong with the left."
"Just like marxist professors tweet 'ironically': all i want for christman is white genocide. You should learn to apply those standards to yourself my friend. Selfreflection is truly poor on both sides, the right AND the left."
"Where did you get that definition of fascism from?  Why do you equate the alt right with fascism?  Had you even heard of the alt right before Hillary's 2016 speech?  Your shrill denunciations and laughable misunderstandings make these assholes stronger.  They feed on your feeble virtue signals."
"Marxist degenerate."
"So what's wrong with preserving the western culture and stopping the genocide against western people? The 'new ones' (how they are called by the government) are actually  systematically killing us and it will get worse day by day as it got worse in the past few years.

"The best thing that government has ever done was to restrict & limit itself by relinquishing the “Divine Right of Kings” unto the populace. Human rights that The State cannot quash & is duty-bound to protect from threats, both foreign & domestic. Freedom of speech is chief among these. It is what prevents the government from hindering the thoughts & discussions that the populace can have. Treating centrists as unwitting Fascist sympathizers is an unreasonable position. Humanity has all of the 20th Century to study to see how autocratic governments used force & violence against dissent to maintain power. Not a single good example among them. Only stupid people could possibly believe that Fascism (or Anti-Fascism) is a good alternative to what we in a free society already have, the right to speak what we think out loud. “The violent method is literally the only method through which bad ideas can win.” The more we abandon reasonable discussion & attempt to enforce our ideas through legislation the tighter the noose gets. I much prefer a land of assholes where no one uses violence at all. Than State enforced friendship. It isn’t real & the government is prone to corruption. Make no mistake, the government will use the tools that we give to it in ways we never percieved as possible. Keeping free speech free may be dissonant & not enjoyable, but it is the best option among a plethora of far worse options."

"Hi ContraPoints, great video! I just would like to comment on one thing I think you missed. When talking about hiding behind irony you described it as a uniquely millennial tactic. In fact this isn't new at all. When Mandela was in prison the British conservative party would wear pins saying 'hang Nelson Mandela.' They would claim irony when confronted about it back then too."
"Good video. Sadly facism is one the rise in Germany and the Left is to devided. I fear for the safty of future generation."

"To be fair to Anthony Fantano, I feel he legitimately was using Kekistan as a joke. The guy dismantled Paul Joseph Watson's opinion on art and modern culture and he's done a full video responding to being called alt-right. Anthony definitely seems to lean to the left on politics, he's just in more of the 'I don't see the point in taking part in the culture war' part of the left camp. He makes jokes but he never tells people 'oh, leftists are trying to slander me, trying to tamp down on free speech!' he doesn't claim to be centrist either, he flat out says he thinks alt-right people and Trump are scumbags."
"that guy did nothing wrong"
"I feel like you're a very intelligent person so you must understand that there is no inherently white-supremacist component to fascism, right?    It's just kind of troubling that how many of the things you're listing can be applied to the far left and the idea that you can't (or won't) see that."

"So, I agree with most of what is being said here, but it is really important to drive home that it's a combination of those things that are a real pointer. Take western culture for example; in that frase I include a tradition of the free individual, scientific strife, inventiveness, critical thinking, humanism, exchange of ideas and secular thought. That it what it stands for for me. A continous evolution of ideas that has progressed towards freedom and the seeking of knowledge since the ancient greeks and romans, and which has arguably come to the greatest civilazation this world has seen. The alt right is a threat to that in my eyes. Free speach and truth are fundamental for western culture, and they want to restrict and pervert both, just as much as the theocrats from the middle east."

I'm tired of constantly being given a choice between hitler and stalin by loud mouth extremists who represent almost no one. I choose neither of those two pieces of human garbage and I whole heartily reject any asshole who does."
"You must have a very negative view of people.  do you think people are this conniving?  Are you this  conniving?"
"Well, western civilization will be destroyed by the millions of Immigrants pouring in, that's a simple fact. But, there are genuine Nazi supporters who have it all wrong, they focus their blame on the Jewish elitists despite the fact that literally most politicians are native to their own European countries. Modern Nazis also take on a more extreme view that involves extermination of anyone who isn't part of their culture, this can only lead to destruction. Of course, when streets are full of immigrant rapists and murderers then people will take on these extreme views, it's just the same old shit that's been happening since the dawn on humankind. Just sit back and watch the fire works... Or get blown up by them."
"Soo everyone not liberal?"
"Shots fired."
"I think you can be Fascist without believing in white superiority, for example the Ba'ath party in Iraq. It's also possible to be a Jewish Fascist. You're talking about neo-Nazis and white supremacists.I know the terms Nazi/Fascist/Neo-Nazi/White-Supremacist/KKK etc. often get conflated. I pretty much agree with everything you say in this video with regards to the alt-right, I just don't know if you're using the best definiton of what a Feacis is and it could be a bit confusing. The term was first coined by Benito Mussolini, and he defined it as: 'The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.' It's more about the elimination of the individual in favour of a collective.I don't know, I'm not sure how much the alt-right subscribe to that, alot of Alt-Right types also seem to be into 'Anarch-Capitalism' and 'Libertarianism' which to me appear to be fundamentally at odds with the totalitarian nature of Fascism. I'm sure some of the Alt-Right identofy as Facists, but I don't think all Fascists are Alt-Right and I don't think all Alt-Right people are Fascists. I think alot of the terminology around this is quite confusing and badly defined. The white supremacist stuff certainly ties with racial/national identity side of fascism. I don't know, I'm just rambling."

"Stopped watching after 2 minutes. Your 3 points don't describe 'contemporary fascism' as a concept at all, but a rather randomly restrictive subset of neo-nazism. Then you go on to claim that all three beliefs are false. Well:  1) You can change the label, but it's hard to deny Europeans form a biological and cultural unity -- and that politics are at least closer to each other than to more distant cultures. Funny as well that by your definition, only Europeans can be contemporary fascists.  2) The Jewish mastermind thing is not a consensus at all on the far right. You could argue it's one of the main splits even between different 'fascist' factions. The threat of 'ethnic replacement' for whites on the other hand is a demographic fact that's hard to argue with. Not saying it's bound to happen, but can't it be at least a valid concern?  3) Establishment of an ethno-state is one strategy, and by no means the only one. It seems weird to make this a requirement."

"I thought fashism is a total solidarity with government no matter what (at least - that's how Mussolini - the inventor of fashism intended it to be). Apparentley, the meaning was changed because of fashist (originally Mussolini fashist) goals of the liberal government...   Nice propaganda."
"why are you dressing like a woman"
"I like that you mentioned centrists, Nazis never controlled a majority of the Bundestag following any of the free and fair elections of interwar Germany, Zentrum's votes were needed to end the Weimar Republic, and, well, they did it, they gave in, and the Social Democrats were the only ones left standing in opposition when the communists were killed and centrists folded."
"OK, NO, WAIT! I MUST SAY THIS! I recently had an argument with a white supremacist who posted 'It's ok to be white.' And I fucking called him out for it, and I knew he would call me racist for being against white people or whatever, so I SPECIFICALLY told him that it wasn't what he said that was the problem, it was the context, who was saying it, and the fact that I knew that the only reason it was being said was to be an inflammatory comment, the only person who needs to say 'it's ok to be white' is a white supremacist, because noone else would never even think to say that, they just want something that they can throw into an argument with vague relevance to that statement and get peoples' heads to explode so that they have evidence to point to to say: 'See, SJWs are anti-white, see how they got mad when I said: 'I's ok to be white!. Its fucking bullshit, and you know what they said? They just fucking ADMITTED IT! I was right, and I'm so glad I'm not alone in this knowledge because I felt so alone dealing with these cunts, and noone was calling out their bullshit, but thank fuck you know."
"2:09 I... don't think anyone was saying 'I'm a Roman.' That just seems weird, even for those in Italy, maybe in Rome itself, but definitely not in the farthest reaches of a newly expanded Empire, I mean, maybe there were some, but a universal agreement that the empire that just recently burned your kingdom to the ground is going to be your new adopted identity is stupid, the Empire was always in flux and was at war alot of the time aswell, a uniting force for those in the Roman Empire, sure, but not for the conquered peoples."

"I remember a prominent Leftward leaning writer (Graham Linehan) tweeting about a bunch of people posting the OK symbol, saying it was a dog whistle. I wasn't aware of this stuff at the time, so I questioned it. He told me I was wrong and that I was stupid for questioning it. I half wanted to become a Nazi just to spite him, the arrogant cunt.  Anyway: don't make people feel ignorant because they aren't aware of this stuff. Educate them."

"wow.. this is actually really helpful. ive always been a firm leftist but given my limited life experience and lack of debate skills i often find it hard to rebuke certain alt-right arguments cause i just dont know what to say. well..thanks for giving me something to say!"
"Nobody should ever engage in no platforming or violence because that reinforces the action of taking out your frustration with people you disagree with in the worst possible manner, and it creates a precedent of political violence that will cause opponents of opinion to become opponents of combat, and that is a shit storm waiting to remove all of the rights from everyone because once that gets moving it's a hell of a lot harder to stop. Truly the best way the handle the alt-right in this case is to respect everyone's right to free speech and have those false opinions thrown out by debate not some petty violence and no-platforming. Because once you can no-platform someone else, it becomes a very frightening reality that someone else can no-platform you."
"'If you have a word for a thing that thing must exist.'

Speaking and exchanging money are perfectly legal actions. Perhaps it's because it's illegal to incite violence- then, if its illegal to incite violence, Nazi hate speech isn't free speech. It's an invitation to violence."
"Just a distinction I didn't see throughout the video yet.

"The right and the left perpetuate a longstanding social unrest that has been festering within our country for a century. As of late this unrest had done nothing but get more violent and organised due to the internet. Getting burned by the right doesnt necessarily mean you have a home with the left or vise versa. Identify your biases and form your own ethics and ideals, then use them to get through life. There are so many parts to each side of this self destructive conflict that you cant even say that one side is good and the other is bad. Antifa isnt composed entirely of people who bash other people in their heads with bike locks and set cars on fire, just as how the alt-right isnt composed entirely of fascists. That said, each is very clearly an extreme, and regardless of color or creed a person should never fear a political party or section of our government, but they can and forever will.  This ideological war between the left and the right will only harbor this growing violent chaos until we pull our heads out of our asses and refuse to debate those who will not listen and instead seek to make a synthesis of ideals to better reflect the ideals of our country, this is how racism has been lessened in out country, the civil war only got the ball rolling, we still haven't solved it. We must be steady and calm in our acknowledging of this rising tide of extreme beliefs in our country and seek to mold our it not in the image that we want or think is best, but the image that would best reflect out ideals as a whole, because until we act as a country will will only push ourselves closer to the brink of another civil war.  I dont mean to fear monger, but these aggressions from either side do nothing but increase hostilities."

"The problem I have is with guilt by association. Anyone to the right of Karl Marx is considered an alt-right fascist it seems. Like the suggestion that people in favor of immigration reform must be in favor of racial genocide to create a white ethnostate I don't think is true. Not all people who hold right wing beliefs and values want to shift incrementally into white supremacy and Nazism. It's as if you are either on the extreme left or extreme right with no middle ground, people who are truly in the middle are lumped in with the extremes. We should stop with this black and white thinking."

I will henceforth aspire to be nothing but an Island on which there live people who can't cook for shit, get shitfaced drunk way to often and still believe that the outcome of centuries of incest is a good choice for head of state. Actually, on second thought: do I have to be a Britain or can I also be something nice. Like a New Zealand South Island for example. I mean, the roads on me would suck but at least there would be good wine and a nice landscape."
"Neo-pagan here briefly complaining about fascists/Nazis stealing religious symbols. Another strategy might be to read up on the original meanings of the symbols these assholes are stealing. If you see someone with one in person, ask them what it means to them, bring up the history you've read about it, see if they seem to have any idea. My most used tactic is to ask seemingly innocent questions first."
"FUCKING NORMIES, LONG LIVE KEKISTAN. REEEEEEEEEEE"

"I suggest that what you’re describing is not per se fascism but white nationalism. Fascism is far-right ultranationalist, authoritarian, regimented society characterized by violent state suppression of any form of dissent, and state centralized control of the economy. All fascists are not white nationalists, but essentially the majority of white nationalists are fascists."
"Well I always believed fascism to be a type of absolutism in which total power belongs to the ruler, as well as total loyalty of the people. Fascism is like monarchy, however it is deeply rooted in nationality and the controlling of ideas (forceful and non-forceful). The problem I have with your 3 keys is that number 1 states that those of *European* decent should have a perfect unity. While I most definitely believe that one of fascists ways of controlling ideas is a strong sense of national identity, I also believe that non-Europeans are capable of this dangerous type of nationalism."
"Haven't really seen much stuff on the definition of Fascism in this video vs. what it actually is, so thought I should clear it up. As defined by the creator of Fascism, Benito Mussolini, Fascism is based on three tenants: 1, Everything within the state; 2, nothing away from the state; and 3, nothing against the state. The definition stated here is more akin to Nazism, which is Fascist, but also extremely racist. Contra, your content is spot on with most of this stuff, gotta give you credit there."
"Your fasc look is very androgynous and really hot tbh"
"I'm curious how you feel about non-western fascism. For example, imperial japan in the lead up to WW2. I think fascism takes many forms, and a large part of it should be an examination of the kind of governments that they form."
"'Pointing out racist dogwhistles is a Fascist trap to make you seem crazy' >Goes on to point out subtle racist dogwhistles.  Idk I view it all as an ideological product. The Alt Right has been far too successful in selling their ideological product. As much as leftists might hate this I'd suggest a better understanding of marketing to them. Don't oppose fascism directly, sell ideologies that are fundamentally antithetical to Fascism. Just my own perspective, you aren't going to convince a centrist that a cartoon frog or wanting low taxes = NAZIS. That argument is just DOA to most people dumb and smart unless they are already close allies."

"I feel like a lot of these 'dog whistles' can make people on the left really paranoid that everyone right of them is a Fascist, when in reality many centrist or even conservatives are actually very much against fascist ideals. However, the points made in this video are very compelling, and help me relate to those who call Trump a fascist, as many of his policies and public statements appear as dog whistles to Fascism, and very might well be. Great video!"
"Contra definition of fascism is totally wrong.Fascism in this article explains it for you in a very simple way.  •Absolute power of the State: The Fascist state is a glorious, living entity that is more important than any individual. All individuals are part of the State, but the State is greater than the sum of its parts. All individuals must set aside their own needs and supplicate themselves to the needs of the State. There is no law or other power that can limit the authority of the State.   •Survival of the fittest: A Fascist state is only as glorious and powerful as its ability to wage wars and win them. Peace is viewed as weakness, aggression as strength. Strength is the ultimate good and ensures the survival of the State.   •Strict social order: Social classes are strictly maintained in order to avoid 'mob rule' or any hint of chaos. Chaos is a threat to the State. The State's absolute power and greatness depends on the maintenance of a class system in which every individual has a specific place, and that place cannot be altered.   •Authoritarian leadership: To maintain the power and greatness of the State requires a single, charismatic leader with absolute authority. This all-powerful, heroic leader maintains the unity and unquestioning submission required by the Fascist state. The authoritarian leader is often viewed as a symbol of the State.   Some people use 'fascist' to describe any authoritarian person or government. But as you can see, authoritarianism is only part of the philosophy. Communism under Stalin was an authoritarian political philosophy, too; but Fascism is directly opposed to Communism (along with democracy, liberalism, humanism and rationalism). Aside from the above principles, a Fascist state also typically promotes a private economy that submits to government regulation; immediate (and often violent) submission of any opposing views; the ethnic dominance of its own people and the lower status of outsiders."
"Great video. Now I exactly know how to debate and confront a fascist muslim."
"Why isnt this more public?? I learnt a ton from this video."
"So sorry, but this is ALL WRONG.    'Fascism should more properly be called corporatism, since it is the merger of state and corporate power.' --Benito Mussolini (the guy who created the word 'Fascism')  Do we OFTEN see white supremacy and totalitarianism tied to fascism?  Yes, but we also see it's hand in many other things - like NeoLiberalism, where the state and media-conglomerates have joined at the hip to perpetuate endless war and inequality in the name of Liberalism for such outfits as the DNC.  Fascism is often wealth's hidden trick to undercut reform movements.  Hitler's original efforts in Germany were as much, or more directed at justified frustrations with Nobles spending the blood and treasure of the country on pissing contests and doing nothing to support average people (the NAZI part was originally called the 'National SOCIALISTS' party after all).  But Wealthy industrialists for groups such as Daimler (Panzer Tanks), Siemens (electronics), Bayer (Zyklon B), and such were able to partially co-opt the movement into a war-machine that led to massive profits weather the Germans won or not (much of the money of which is still in these companies and affiliates in Switzerland).   It's easy to hate Trump, but people like Bill and Hillery Clinton, as well as Barack Obama are no less fascist, and effectively sold-out the nation's well-being to banks, media giants and oil companies supposedly in the name of pragmatism and (siding with the winners to win elections), but essentially created Trump, by undercutting the social order that preserved civility in the name of keeping one's job and place in society.     The New Deal was the single most successful and humanizing project in the last 5 hundred years and represented a revolution against Capitalism's aim to fill the power-vacuum left in the wake of Royalty and Religion's failed hegemony.  But as Hyman Minsky observed: 'Stability is Destabilizing'.  and now we are back in the Devil's grip.  'Behind every fascism, there is a failed revolution.' --Walter Benjamin"

"Before I start my criticism, I just want to be clear that I like this video. I'm happy to have education about fascism, even if just for the fact that it may help some poor bastard avoid accidentally falling in with a fascist crowd. What I don't at all appreciate is the denial of anti-fascist violence being equivalent to fascist violence. You are being fooled by communist dogwhistles just as you rightfully believe others are being fooled by fascists. Communists are not actually anti-fascism, they are pro-communism. Being anti-fascist is a cover."
"This is an extremely Americentric look on fascism you're presenting. In Europe, people don't mention skin colour 95% of the time. For them it's their nationality that matters. A Scandinavian fascist doesn't view Slavs as 'our people', so doesn't Slav view Spaniards. America is so hellbent on looking at people's skin colour that they completely distorted this ideology. A proper fascist would not boast about Romans and Danes in the same video, because they are completely different nationalities and cultures.  Look at Varg Vikernes for example. He is an anprim/nationalist who only promotes Germano-Scandinavian values. In fact, he generally has a distaste for Romans, Greeks, and other Mediterraneans, because they have introduced non-Germanic values (Christianity for the most part) to Germanic peoples. To him race is a secondary thing and nationality is the priority. People like Richard Spencer on the other hand think that their melanin levels somehow let them tap into European culture that they didn't grow up with, because the US tends to erase people's ancestral cultures. US white supremasism is far from actual fascism."

"If every racist or right is a fascist, then National Socialism was something completely normal in history.  btw ContraPoints sounds like Kontrakultur, the Name of an identitarian group in Germany. The video was uploaded on September 1, the anniversary of the raid on Poland. The video is 23:33 long, (19)23 = year of the Hitler coup, 33 = 3 x 11 = KKK … OMG SCHEIßE! ÜBERALL NAZIS! WEG HIER!"
"I cant watch a 23 min long video that stars out defending fascism 100 present wrong. Fascism is the belief that the state goes before individuals. What you are defending is a hybrid between racism and nazism."
"Jeebus, paranoia is fucking right. The obsession with dog-whistling portrayed throughout pretty much the whole video (despite the small caveats interspersed) has more than a bit of parallel with conspiranoia, don't you fathom? 'You see, its these signs, they SEEM innocuous because that's exactly what THEY want people to think. To trick them. And THEY are everywhere, manipulating things. But of course if you try to grill it out of them they will deny having any idea of what you're talking about! Pretend that you're crazy! But that's exactly what THEY have planned, to try and make others and yourself think you might be crazy. But its all THEM, and the CENTRIS- I mean, SHEEPLE don't understand. They're playing right into THEIR hands.'  Like, hey, I hope you've chilled a bit since then because that is a bit of a... concerning, road to go down. Maybe the self-important larping of autistic /pol/tards is not the best lens to view the world and human behavior through either.  But maybe me questioning a vigilant (and certainly not obsessive) regard to dog-whistling is in itself, a gaslighting dog-whistle! I don't know that I can deal with that sort of catch-22."

"Nobody has to give anyone a platform. But I think it's important to understand, that attempting to shut down a fascist or Alt-Right person, who already managed to get a platform, will backfire most of the time. Does anyone remember how Milo got famous?  If you deplatform a fascist you give legitimacy to their claims, while also giving them a type of edgy appeal. People seek out things that are forbidden, since their has to be something interesting about it, in order to generate that much opposition (streisand effect). If someone is actually advocating for violence, this obviously doesn't apply. Also punching a Nazi has never changed their believes and should only be a reaction to physical violence."

"I have an iron/ malthese cross tattoo, and I sure as hell ain't no fascist. There are lots of symbols the nazi's stole and Right wing boneheads use.

So I can't shave my head beacause of some wannabe Adolfs who don't know shit? Fuck that."

"The fact that far-right ideologues can't agree if we Greeks are white or not (considering the fact that western civilization is a product of Ancient Greece) is evidence that their ideology is so fluid that basically anybody can be discarded from 'the white race'. For example Jews , Syrians and Turks  are as white as Italians and French. Where do you draw the line of being 'white'?   Plus the anthropological-biological fact that we are all descendants of Africans and we have more differences among others from the same ' race' that from people from other 'races' makes the whole debate a complete joke ."

"I used to be a centrist and watch a lot of more right leaning content because at the time, I felt their ideas were subversive and offered a side of the story you normally wouldn't see, and while there were occasionally some interesting points....in time you begin to realize how big of a circle-jerk the community of 'rationalists', 'skeptics', 'centrists' etc really are. They essentially utter all the same information without ever offering any kind of nuance and go after easy targets to put into 'SJW Cringe compilations' to substitute any semblance of an argument, but I notice they'll tend to steer clear of people like you, Shaun, hbomberguy, and more because they're well aware they'd be going into a losing battle. Just goes to show how afraid they are of being challenged in spite of wanting others to challenge their own beliefs. I thank y'all for making the effort to bring back some actual sense to a toxic place like the internet.   Also, it's pretty ironic how they call out leftists being triggered but the moment a female and/or someone from a minority group gets cast as a lead role everyone on the right just starts screeching loudly. It's almost as if they're... nah I'm not gonna say it lol."

"you said that centrists will align with fascists because it happened prior in history. that's like saying democrats will institute and defend slavery because it happened prior in history.  you said that white centrists who are afraid of (being profiled by) antifa, experience the same fear that black people face when dealing with the cops on a constant basis. could it be there is a 'white centrist' out there who has also been profiled by the police and has that same fear?   I feel like there is a problem with saying this color this, this color that. it creates devisiveness. how about some people are terrible, and some arent. child molesters of any color, bad people right? racists of any color? bad people right? why not accept that there is a wide array of people who have different experiences, and these experiences can and will overlap and transcend race. that's my two cents. I think every American owes it to every other American to stick up for the people to their left and right.   i welcome any responses!"

"If we had an ethnostate... we’d find new ways to figure out who is the whitest or which people are only technically white.

"I'm so stuck with this shit, like I don't hate people on the alt right because I literally can not associate hardly anything they say with reality but I also hate the whole culture on the left of obsessively calling out this bullshittery on the right because its cringey 100% of the time. I hate this tit for tat politics in general but I feel like I need to keep up on it so I can argue against my friends on the right because when I don't know how to answer them saying some dumb shit and I can even look like I condone it and catch shit for it that way. Worst part is I love the alt-right memes like seeing people scream about green frogs is hilarious but in doing that I feel like I'm letting it slide.  Long story short I hate even having to think about this whole 'trump-era' type of politics and I want it to go back to the classic all politicians are absolute twats mentality"
"Your really beautifull ❤"
"As a 'gullible centrist', I have a couple questions:  1. I remember, when reading an article about whether or not Donald Trump is a fascist, there was a line that stuck with me.  I'm paraphrasing, but it was something to the effect of: it is less important whether Trump fits some academic definition of fascism than if you personally find his policies acceptable.  Which has me thinking, rather than trying to recognize all the subtle signs that indicate someone might be a fascist, why not simply determine which policies you do not find tolerable, and target those instead?  This approach deals with real-world policies, rather than people's motivations, which we can never determine for certain without being able to read minds, so it won't give nearly as many false positives.  Also, it is much harder for the supporters of the policies in question to deny their support for said policies than to deny being fascists, giving them much less evasive wiggle-room.  2. I have heard others say that 'bad ideas thrive in darkness', and that the best way to defeat them is to bring them into the light.  While I recognize that this view is slightly naive in its belief that good ideas will always beat bad ideas, I also recognize that trying to prevent others from hearing an idea can sometimes serve to make that idea more appealing, and a lack of scrutiny and criticism certainly doesn't hurt an idea's appeal.  In light of this, why do you think that the best way to deal with fascists is to avoid debating them on public platforms?"
"Crypto-fascist rhetoric reminds me of the Enigma machine."
"The reason fascists, nazis, authoritarians need so many convoluted ways to spread their ideas and messages is because daylight would kill those ideas, they need to poison the body in darkness for it to work. They have weak ideas, simply put."
"2:54 'or any european nationality' - what where do you mean I feel like a lot of white American nationalists say 'Europe or whatever' and have no clue that a lot of Europe... isn't even white. And how massively cultures vary from European country to European country. And how pissed anyone from Europe gets get when you call them 'European'. And how annoyed people get when you call someone who lives in the UK and is not English 'British'... Heck even when you get down to 'anglo-saxon' definition it can get complicated. Where are you from, WASPS? Wessex? Northumbria?!      shit I don't think I'm gonna get far with this"
"This is brilliant! I hope more people see this video!"
"It's worth pointing out that lasting change comes not from a violent approach to dealing with White Supremacists or Neo Nazis but rather a degree of dialogue and understanding.  White Supremacy is by nature a doctrine of isolation, and those who desire it require isolation to make it work. Hatred depends on a false idea of who other people are, such as all gay people being deviant pedophiles, all minorities being criminals and so on. Destroying this isolation is the first step in destroying white nationalism and supremacy, and it happens by plainly demonstrating that their assumption were incorrect.  Obviously this won't work on all of them, but the rank and file who are there for the camaraderie and fellowship can be swayed back to the correct path. Sadly, the SJW approach of violent screaming actually can harden them against this approach since it can instill a distrust of the people who are trying to bring a more positive message forward."

"This has been the best and fairest video I have seen in the subject"
"great video!"
"First video of yours that I’ve ever watched. 100% subscribing and sharing your channel. Thank you!!"
"This video taught me one thing. I already knew the Alt-Right were conniving, trendy, savvy and out to manipulate and lie their way to relevance. They game is old to me and I see through it.   This video showed me that the left are catching on too, and are picking up the some of the same tricks.  Don't think I didn't notice that comment about western civilisation halfway though. I see you too alt left. I'm watching both sides now."
"You  are great!"
"Excellent video. The only part where I would disagree is when you encourage to debate coworkers. Any talk about politics, religion or gun control is guaranteed to backfire on you and will lead to a breeding ground for a toxic workplace. Keep it professional no matter who are you sitting next to."
"HAHHAA LOL.  As a woman, I honestly never found that I felt a connection to that history. I hated learning about ancient Greece, Rome, etc. I feel no connection to those places. I saw the ruins as places that once murdered innocent people and stirred war and brutality in people's hearts, and celebrated their end. I saw my place as history as jut what it was: likely a vessel for european babies against my will. There is no honor in that, and I find it shocking that any caucasian woman would feel any level of affinity with this sort of pro-european rhetoric."
"Then there's no hope to accurately distinguish between a fascist and a right-wing or alt-right point of view..  The 'white/black ethnostate' is probably the only thing that is a slight giveaway but I can't believe that those who praise western culture are very likely to be or actually *are* fascists; or that they don't believe they are but ACTUALLY are. (You know what I mean?)  Also I'm not sure that those who actually speak of IQ results statistics linked to race are actually fascists solely because of reading statistics considering that the IQ test isn't an actual intelligence test but a way to evaluate your education, what you have retained from it and how well you can use it to work your way through problems.   And considering that there seem to be different kinds of intelligence and that IQ results often reflect an individual's rate of monetary/economic/personal success..  Is it so wrong to talk about these differences and about how they have impacted the growths of different countries in different ways? IQ results don't just differ by race but also by nationality etc..  In short, appreciate the video but this seems a bit skewed to one side, can't we all agree that there are bigots everywhere, on all sides?"
"This truth in this video is horrifying, are the more so because the people who most need to heed its message either won't see it, or if they do, they'll reject it out of hand.   I actually know well-meaning people who fall for those 'false equivalency' and 'free speech' canards. Admittedly, I'm not the greatest debater, but the way that I approached it with one person is that we should have a debate about cannibalizing his legs. I told him that I knew that he wouldn't be in favor of the idea, but shouldn't my side of the argument be heard? Besides, he didn't have a problem with eating beef. I'm at least debating the issue with him, cows don't even get that privilege. I even said that I'd be willing to meet him halfway -- we could cannibalize just ONE of his legs."
"I dont know who the blonde is at 8 minutes, but it is ironic that shes got a john wayne super patriot poster while in reality he was a pussy who stayed behind to act and bang the ladies while jimmy Stewart went and flew fucking bombing missions in Europe against the fascists.

"I guess the biggest problem I have with this video is that it assumes that leftists are inherently the arbiters of truth and that it is at all acceptable to assign intent to what people say whether or not they are a fascist. A lot of these ways of detecting fascism can be easily misconstrued, like with a liberal defending hate speech or a conservative who is concerned about immigration, and to dismiss those ideas as proto-fascism and call those centrists and liberals racist and xenophobic or whatever only really polarizes the issues, and ironically comes across as authoritarian and fascist to discredit ideas you don't agree with (which can change at any time and depends on the person). I personally believe we should encourage people to humanize others as opposed to demonize whether or not you agree with them, and part of that is to keep an open mind and to try and understand where someone is coming from to form their opinion.  The two ways I would try to fight off legit fascists would be start a conversation/debate and try and figure out if they are totally entrenched in the ideology or if they are more willing to change their mind. If they are entrenched in ideology, then I would argue its important to give that person a platform and to try and dismantle their ideas for everyone to see, and convince everyone watching that this person is in fact a crazy fascist. I think that allows people to see what real fascists look like and to actually understand what their arguments are and how to debate and disprove them. The alternative seems to be that people have no idea what a fascist looks like and are only capable of calling anyone they disagree with a racist nazi.  If the person I'm debating is a more open-minded fascist (lol?) then I think it would be way more beneficial to convince them otherwise and to possibly win over someone or to at least make them question their beliefs, which to me is way better than the alternative of again, dehumanizing that person as a nazi and trying to aggressively shut them down, which comes across as authoritarian and makes you look bad and the fascist as some kind of victim  Ultimately, I like the Rubin Report, please don't hurt me!"

"@ 4:50 Ayyyy thats my boi shaun. I knew i subbed for a reason. keep up the great work."
"First lemme just say I love your stuff. You put out great, thoughtful videos on subjects I think most people get wrong. For context of where I’m coming from ideologically, I’m a radical libertarian / ancap, though I do pal around with a few Marxists and mutualists and other weirdos.  One point I thought deserved more attention is the idea of an “alt left,” or some kind of analogous thing to the alt right that’s equally ugly or deserving of criticism. I think you brush this away too easily.   Leftists often criticize how right wingers conflate the mildest left-of-center ideas with Bolshevism, and for good reason. But some lefties do a version of this themselves, basically conflating ANY kind of conservatism or nationalism with outright fascism.   Then they declare all “fascists” fair game for violence, and encourage people to attack anybody who falls under that label. That’s definitely a problem. The people who do this shit often suck just as bad as the Tiki torch-bearing race realists.   In some cases it IS warranted to critique “both sides,” even if that sounds lame."
"Yes they do. A megaphone is press."
"Obviously fascists don't value freedom of speech, but the main reason I do isn't really any constitution, but its necessity for epistemology. Like it or not, we cannot exclude the possibility that we are being deceived against fascism by The Evil Genius. So we must allot it its iota of the probability space, and give them the opportunity to improve it."
"Holy shit you actually got 4channed by the okay symbol. Thought you were smart"
"I feel like a good solution to all the confusion over terms (or who's a fascist or a communist or Nazi or conservative or or liberal or SJW) is to revert to very basic rules that you learn as children:  If you have nothing nice to say, don't say it. Don't do it if it's dangerous or destructive. If it's not your yours, don't touch it. Be polite. Treat others as you would like to be treated.  I feel like if you apply these things to yourself and those around you, it's really hard to go wrong. These things can be difficult to implement because life is complicated, but I think they're a good guide to proper behavior. I don't know if people would consider this too moderate, but that is my perspective on the matter."
"I also, about a year ago, was actually veering toward anti- SJW sentiment and now I see I was accidentally, without realisation, becoming indoctrinated with fascist ideas. I think it just shows how easy it is for normal, centrist people (I'm a trot now) to become influenced by white nationalists."
"Fascism has nothing to do with being white. It is the idea that a group of people are superior to the rest. Fascists also believe that their group of people should be the only group in the world. they also believe in a totalitarian way of governing where anything that contradicts or gets in the way of them is crushed. I get my information from what happened under fascist rule. You get your info from the lying MSM who calls everyone they disagree with a fascist."

"I feel like one of the reasons this shit is appealing to White people is, we see other people celebrating their racial identity and often want to do the same, but can't. Wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm not saying that 'White pride' is good, or anything like that. I totally get what's going on here - people who have been traditionally oppressed and vilified are rejecting an ideology that tells them that they're, at best, inferior, and reclaiming a love of their own culture. Whites, whose culture has traditionally been on top, don't need this. But! We're in a position where our culture is kind of invisible; it's just mainstream culture, and it's not something to take personal pride in. A Black artist can be celebrated for representing Black culture, but a White artist represents everybody. Obviously, this idea that White culture represents everybody has negative implications for people who aren't White - it's like your culture is somehow not important or relevant enough to be valued by humanity as a whole. All the same, the only time White people see their race pointed out in media, it's in a negative context, where they're the bad guy, or at least insensitive.  You end up with this situation where White people get a message that, there is nothing good about being White, you should feel bad about being White (and to be fair, while most people don't intend that message, some definitely do). White people have all kinds of reactions to this, from racial self-flagellation ('I'm not like those other White people') to outright rejection of diversity. It doesn't help that many people don't know how to talk about those feelings in a constructive manner, and that the Left is hard on that. Hell, even those who DO know how to talk about it often get shut down. So you've got a lot of White people looking for a positive racial identity, who feel rejected by the Left. On the other hand, here's this group of people who's telling you that there are lots of good things about being White, and that you should be proud of your race. Fascists exploit the hell out of this. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that a lot of them come out of that sense of confusion in the first place.  What do we do about all this? Hell if I know. But I think acknowledging it is a good place to start."

"I feel like I'm missing something... The video talks about fascism as if it's white nationiam, when fascism intrinsically has a definition that has nothing to do with white nationism.  I think that fascism and white nationalism are both terrible, but acting like they are interchangable labels is kinda... Ignorant."
"I think their message gets some traction because, they do get that the ideology of productivity has made life very empty and vacuous. The intro: “who are you? I’m not talking about your name or occupation.” Hits the nail right on the head. When people ask who you are, you first think of an arbitrary word that is supposed to symbolize you and then of what you do to be able to afford stuff. It’s kinda pathetic, our society."

Besides the fact that there is literally no achievable means of creating an ethnostate, and this threat you are touting is literally non-existent, and its rare adherents are deluded and frequently mentally ill... you fully lost me at pepe and the ok sign. There's a difference between being an actual nazi and pretending to be one for the lulz. You fell for it, dare I say, normie?  You're outlining what is truthfully a very loosely-organized ideology of a miniscule self-trolling minority and presenting it as canon, and by implication, as a larger, scarier threat. Stop trying to fucking scare people about nothing. That is what you're doing and it's not helpful. Fucking relax because you got trolled.   The alt-right is a bunch of naive young kids who got trolled by oldfags into thinking the jokes were for real and started to believe in a false ideology that was a joke to begin with. Some older real nazis got trolled by proxy into thinking the whole thing was a serious movement and wasting their time extrapolating at length in fucking delusional chan posts about their delusional plans. That's seriously all it is. A giant joke"

"A really great and insightful video. I have one contention. I consider myself a centrist, or classical liberal, but I don't think that makes me gullible or susceptible to fascist dogma. I have my own ideals, and know why I hold them. It's not a position of naive agnosticism. It is of utmost importance to me that civil liberties are preserved for everyone, and that society remains  open and inclusive. I recognise when people try to undermine these principles. It's not just a theoretical talking point for me. I have a stake in this, as do we all."
"Those „fascists core beliefs“ are not fascist core beliefs at all. They’re beliefs of the alt-right which is in no way fascists. Fascism in simple terms is strong nationalism paired with a hatred of leftist and communists. Also the „core beliefs“ you propose make it seem like only white people can be fascist wich is simply not true"

"2. Euphemism : Have you considered that they identify away from that ideology because it's genuinely the values that they believe in, instead of assuming malicious intent? Okay, so defending western civilization or culture makes you a fascist regardless of your ideology. Great job! Guess i'm a proud fascist despite not believing in white nationalism! Also, mass immigration is a genuine problem that has been poorly managed in Europe. Why would you slander anyone who believes any of these are issues by calling them fascists?  3. Pedantry : Expect asians do have a higher IQ and the nazis did stop existing centuries ago. Why not argue against their points instead of labelling them as a nazi in order to shut down the discussion?  4. Symbols : Homosexuality is legal and nothing stops you from being a queer openly. Not to mention the fact that blacks are not unfairly targetted by the police and get arrested more frequently due to higher crime rates. I don't agree with white nationalists but they deserve the right to speech like everyone else -- this is a free country. This seems like a defense of Antifa's morally bankrupt behavior : that is, to attack viciously those they disagree with as vigilantes whilst the Police are doing their job.  5. Camaraderie : Expect it's true that the Antifa will come after you next. They attacked a WW2 veteran and numerous innocents. Freedom of speech is a universal right and you're proving with this video that anyone can be censored because of these obnoxiously vague guidelines.  6. Comedy : This uses your subjective personal experience as a general tool. Irony can be used as just that : irony.  How do you pick up a jew? With a shovel and a broom. I make jokes about the holocaust because i have a dark sense of humor, that doesn't mean i want it to happen again and likely neither do most people who make edgy jokes.  7. There is a equivalence to be made between violence made by radicals from the left and the right and to suggest otherwise due to a moral highground is absolutely laughable and made me lose all credibility i saw in this video. Violence for mean words is unacceptable and rationalizing it is the stupidest thing a person can do.  Black Lives Matter has led to riots, attacks against private property, actively chanting 'Dead to cops!' In massive street rallies in numerous videos. They are just as radical and to suggest otherwise is nothing more then apologetics for a black supremacist organization. This isn't the alt right being a mastermind against you -- you're just being retarded by normalizing violence.  8. In other words, anyone advocating for restrictions to immigration is secretly calling for the slaughter of minorities. Fuck off. How the fuck does that work? That's just a slippery slope.  9. Expect modern white nationalists seem to entirely support democracy as well as free speech and see it as an important institution. In fact, they seem to support free speech more then you as you have proven by your support for violent organizations. If i want my rights protected as a white person, why would i side with you if i'm being a fascist despite not being a white nationalist regardless for suggesting western civilization is worth protecting? Also, if white nationalists are bigots who can easily be refuted, why deplatform them instead of proving them wrong?  So lets get this shit straight. Anyone who is for  -- defending western civilization -- being ok with edgy jokes -- against violently bashing those you disagree with -- regulating immigration -- not deplatforming everyone you disageee with Is secretly a fascist and secretly being manipulated by evil memelords on the internet. What a load of absolute shit. This video serves as nothing but to demonize the right further and increase political polarization.  And no, i disagree : The religious fundamentalists during the 2000s were refuted because figures like Richard Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens, Bill Nye , ect, debated against religious fundamentalists in open debate. If you want to defeat the alt right, you have to debate against them on the free marketplace of ideas, not silence them."
"Just watched this and the Incel video. Your points are well reasoned and the videos are well produced. Subscribed!"
"I will say that the focus of this video seems narrow, only talking about fascists in America. My nitpick would be that fascists in Bangladesh, for example, don’t have the pro-white focus (they have other ethnic priorities).  I will also say that Black Lives Matter can’t really be called a pure civil rights organization, because it needs to get its house in order quite badly. Some of its leaders have openly embraced the Nation of Islam, an SPLC recognized antisemitic, black nationalist hate group."
"Those football Macho Mugs take me back.  My mom had them of the Denver Broncos, which she drank rum and coke from as she yelled at the TV because the broncos were losing and fucking up in some way.

"I think you don't quite understand the motivations of those you call centrist. It's more complicated than not wanting to be punched in the face by mistake. I'm seeing authoritarians across left and right and while I'm a leftist, I'm also a libertarian. I can't advocate for physical violence against someone for speaking their mind. I can't pass the ideological purity test of the left either, I don't believe in the dogma. I'm a leftist because I want the government to serve its citizens and not corporations, because the most imporant problem we need to fix is poverty and homelessness, because healthcare and education is a human right, because differences in our identities should not indicate the opportunities we have and the lives we will live, because we actually need immigrants because our populations are aging and we aren't having enough kids to sustain a large enough workforce longterm. The pressure to join forces to fight fascism is placed on those who don't conform to extremism'. I'm not going to be swindled by nazis no matter how coded their language is, but the authoritarians on the left aren't using the alt-right to get me to conform to their beliefs out of fear either."

"Classic Goldwater Republican methodology. Nice assessment and commentary on white supremacists, CP. Also,  entertaining in a dry humor way that always gets my attention. I would enjoy a similar look at the authoritarian revolutionary radicals. Now some criticism... I respect this effort and your intellect enough to tell you that as a left-leaning moderate informed by experience as a revolutionary radical in my youth, I am a bit disturbed by your generalizing of centrists into a group of indecisive, ignorant shills unwittingly giving permission to the radical right to act on their fascist, racist ideologies. Fuck that. Being moderate has not stripped me of empathy. Indeed, I could make a good argument for how being moderate requires a deal more empathy than that needed to sustain a position as a partisan extremist. It takes  great, often painful, emotional and intellectual effort to put myself in the shoes of a racist, but if I am to engage them in a conversation that will serve progress in our society then I will at least attempt to do so. Just because one lacks the imagination or nuance of intellect to think that many left-moderates are working against these ignorant ideas in ways that aren't simply to tell someone to shut up and conform doesn't mean they are not. Diversity goes beyond identity, it encompasses all life's complexities, and that includes the manner humans engage other humans. Methinks reductionism is effecting the left with an ignorance of the varied tactics available to a thoughtful progressive activist. They seem to recognize only shouting showdowns as real activism. What child-like uneducated naivety. Likely,  someone of this Ilk is having a tough time wrapping their head around the idea that a self identified moderate is also a progressive activist even as they read this. Meh. Get woke for reals. Think harder and act smarter. Or fuck off. It's easy to set aside trying to understand why racists are racist and chase them out of the open so we can pretend we are winning. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. You lose when you can't challenge the 'true believers' to demonstrate the ignorance of their ideologies in a public forum... in front of as yet undetermined, could-be racists. If you can understand what illogic created the zealot, you can create a stronger argument for eschewing xenophobic tribalism and accepting the human species as the necessarily diverse super-organism it seems to be. Are you so insecure in your position that you fear letting crackpots quack so you can knock them down and show them for what hatemongers they are to those who may be in a situation that makes them susceptible to racist views.  Well, fortunately not all of us suffer this weakness of conviction. Moderate doesn't mean what radicals think it does. We are not without a position (thus left- or right- leaning prefix), we just understand that lasting progress of any kind takes open debate and careful compromise over time. Evolution, not revolution. I understand there are some folks who will call themselves 'centrist' or 'moderate' because they hold no position on partisan ideas, but that is just unaligned. I also acknowledge there are likely a number of provocateurs of the left and right who pretend at being 'moderate' for whatever reason. As an honest left-moderate, I will call out the unaligned and fakes whenever I encounter them... but know that I will do so in whatever manner best suited to the situation, including in ways a less than subtle mind may not perceive. CP, this type of generalizing is something you should be speaking against. Instead you virtue signal to your revolutionary cohorts by using this moderates/centrists are lousy allies trope. Dog whistle indeed. Or maybe you are attempting to shame the unaligned into owning up to their responsibility as a human ape and choose a tribe, and calling out the provocateurs? Shame is one of the more common means of activism these days. If this is the case, it is weak. Shame is easily conflated by the shamed into being perceived as bullying, false dichotomy though this is. I think this an unlikely motivation for your assertion, however. If you are basing this premise on the YouTube and Twitter 'skeptic' set, well... get the heck away from that smarmy, silly mess. Too many gamers with too much regard for their own intellectual prowess and taking themselves far too seriously. Anyhow. Thanks for giving me something to think about, CP. I might disagree with some of what you say and think, but I like taking on my own ideas, testing them through comparing and contrasting them with others'. I truly appreciate it."

You can be a white fascist, but you can be a black fascist, an asian fascist (ever heard of the Japanese Empire?). Finally, only a small minority actually believe in fascism, and an even smaller minority are nazi's. None of which are part of the alt-right movement.

And very professionally done, I especially like having the link to the transcript, never seen that before.  But, alas, small complaint: as a centrist/liberal/idk and actaully idc what I'd be in american terms, the comments about perceived naivity and even collaboration with fashists is mildly insulting, even if it might correctly apply to many. When others often say that antifascism is only that, that would imply it doesn't need to be leftists, which isn't what it comes across like here. So whatever, I'll watch more of your videos and thanks a lot!"

"I use to sympathize with a lot of the alt right rhetoric but as a history buff and after researching the history of fascism and ww2 in general I realized just how toxic these ideas are, especially the process of dehumanization. I never really understood how such simple ideas can influence the most diabolical acts like those committed by the Nazis, Ukrainian UPA and the Ustashe. I really understand some of the radical positions of the left now and think it is a noble cause fighting against these fascists, because i'm seeing alarming trends now that mirror those of the early 20th century, that influenced the rise of fascism."
"Just listen to Alt-right podcasts. They will tell you what they believe."
"So... Alt-Right constantly invites leftists to their big shows (Crowder, Milo, Fox News etc) to get both sides of the argument... But the left should not do the same because they would give platforms to guys who can... Actually what was the point of the video? That they can debate better? How is that a bad thing? (PS: I'm European, so don't go labeling me a 'Trump Supporter' or anything like that, I have never even set foot in America.) But yeah, the left's tactics and double standards seem really shitty to me as an outsider.  Also I could be wrong, but over here we call the fascists 'far right'. From the tone of your video I got that 'alt-right' are just 'far-right' people who can disguise themselves better, which I will again call bullsh!t on. So basically there is no 'right' that isn't fascist secretly or openly? That sounds a lot like just throwing labels to dissuade centrists. You're doing the same thing you're accusing people of doing in your video. Also yeah, you do sound paranoid."

And therefore, they are just as dangerous, if not more so, than the fascist themselves."
"Following the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, the term 'fascist' has been used as a pejorative, often referring to widely varying movements across the political spectrum. George Orwell wrote in 1944 that 'the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless ... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist''. Early in the video, due to the word having virtually no meaning, you give it a meaning to fit the narrative you are making."
"'Our ancestors had a very strong sense of identity. They could say 'I'm a Roman''  WTF?!  Anyone who has studied ancient history knows that Romans were definitely NOT a pure race.

The 'Raping of the Sebine Women' was a celebrated Roman event and a milestone studies in university history courses."

"Loving how many actual obvious fascists came to the comments to deploy the exact tactics ContraPoints warns about. It's funny, I used to find these people frustrating, even terrifying. but they've got a limited playbook, and once you know what it is, they're no threat. The real threat is the influential fellow travelers to these people, honestly. People like Andrew Sullivan and Bari Weiss, like the INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB, like Jonathan Chait and that Podhoretz idiot. The New York Times, Washington Post, Atlantic, New Republic, and other widely read outlets frequently give a sympathetic ear to cryptofascist arguments. With these people, the tactics are working. and the reason is in large part because a lot of moderates are still deeply uncomfortable with civil rights. Also it seems very true that the majority of centrists prefer fascism to socialism, especially the privileged wealthy ones with big media platforms (average commenter centrist, I send love your way and hope you come into light rather than darkness) . Look at how much energy the moderates are putting into trying to knock down AOC! The frothing rage with which they speak about Bernie Sanders! Going across the Atlantic, look at the Blairites in the Labour Party who would clearly rather fuckin' Boris Johnson be PM than Jeremy Corbyn. and they're pushing this whole 'Corbyn is an anti-Semite' bit with the help of the British right wing media. Excuse me, I mean the British media (for my fellow Americans not as obsessed with the glorious omnishambles of current British politics, most of the British media is owned by Rupert Murdoch or someone who shares similar views, and the BBC is more likely to give a friendly interview to Nigel Farage than to anyone in the Labour Party that doesn't hate Corbyn.   The alt-right are chuds we can usually laugh at. but powerful and widely read people are copying some of the messaging. And then when you call them on it, they act all aggrieved. One tactic in the 'Fash-Curious Centrist Playbook' is 'if you call people fascists, it makes you look unreasonable, and then people are more attracted to fascism'. Swap with 'racism', you see that too. Galaxy brains crediting people calling out racism as the real cause for the rise in white supremacism in the country over the last few years. I mean, okay, if someone's offended enough at being called racist/fascist unfairly that they decided to become one, HOW IS THAT ON US? They were faced with a choice between owning up to their shit like a morally decent adult, and going full evil. and they chose...poorly."
"So.. this how to identify a white, European fascist or how to identify a fascist?  Cuz.. you know other races of people have practiced fascism before... Right?"
"Good video, but my problem: it doesn't explain how to tell the difference between someone on the alt-right and a regular conservative even though the two are differentiated. She talks about how fascists use coded speech and dogwhistles to masquerade as regular conservatives, but regular conservatives talk about things like western culture (the line of philosophies which influenced the American Revolution and the creation of the US Constitution- and yes, it's kind of a misnomer because not all western thinkers were even European) and border security (to prevent illegal immigration, NOT legal immigration) without racist intent. Therefore, it seems as though regular conservatives are lumped in with the alt-right. And if she thinks that the aforementioned conservative talking points ARE fascist talking points, what does she consider to be non-fascist conservative values?  If lower taxes, states rights, freedom of speech, border security, and western culture are all alt-right dogwhistles and codes, what is a regular conservative even?"

Who the hell wants a whole world with the same culture it’s boring. Remember use your heart to love your culture and use modern wisdom to know another person’s culture or race doesn’t make them inferior."
"Plus points for humor. Quite refreshing to see that in these often retarded left-right discussions :D I think modern day nazis/fascists (Stormfags :D) haven't learned from history.. The far right will lead people to destruction. On the other hand I think the left is regressive and a world without borders is laughable. Blindly accepting that cultures, religions, sexes are equal, by mantra is lazy. There is a lot to discover. Different people have different traits. Some of them mix well, some of them don't. And you need to know more, and stay rational, make the hard choices, while at the same time remaining human (compassionate). That sounds almost as unattainable as Buddhist enlightenment, but you can strive. Warm and welcoming people can be protected by the cold and cautious. Just saying. Peace.. from some critical guy in the center."

But I’m proud to be a blind judge, I don’t want to be biased in either way. I hate that people in general use these kinds of tactics no matter their motives. I’m just sad that people have to hate. At all. For me even all hate is bad. Because it makes me feel sick to my stomach. All of it. People who hates any other group in society. I wish we could all just talk heart to heart and heal from this... I see how this may make me naive but to me it just seems so obvious. All we need is some love instead of all that hate and negativity.  Shit I just realized what a hippie I sound like... fuck it. I’m gonna embrace it.   I’m a fucking hippie and I wish we’d all just chill out and feel the love, man!"

"Summary:  'Left wing' collectivists and 'right wing' collectivists are radicalized, simple-minded, and absolutely hate each other.    They hate each other to the point where everyone that disagrees with a leftist looks like a goosewalking stormtrooper to them.  You people are so limited in your worldviews.  When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  You cant see that you are the exact thing that you hate.  ______ priviledge.  ______ genocide.   Marginalized ______ communities. The ______ question. ______ power.   ______ pride.    You collectivist loons just fill in the blanks to the same questions, then brawl in the streets over whether 'white' or 'black' or 'gay' or 'straight' is the right answer to the same moronic collectivist identitarian question that you obsess over.    The funny part is that almost 100 years ago when fascism actually became a threat to the free world, it rose to power by baiting left-wing collectivists into public displays of violence, culminating in the burning of the reichstag which was then easily blamed on the communist parties after a history of violent confrontation.  In a sense, the 'anti-fascist' movements in Germany actually HELPED the NAZIs rise to power by generating popular sympathy for the national socialists and a very bad image for the communist parties.  You antifa types are literally  doing the exact same thing, brawling in the streets with 'fascists,' while normal nonradicalized people look on with disgust at what you are doing.  Maybe if you spent less time tearing down statues, burning books, renaming streets and sports teams, and generally trying to erase history, you would appreciate the historic irony here.  You are helping the thing you hate by spewing this nonsense.  At the end of the day, it makes no difference to me whether 'fascists' beat 'antifa' or 'antifa' punches all the 'nazis.'  You are both the same exact thing to me, and I pray to sweet baby Jesus that all of you collectivists never approach anything that could remotely be considered mainstream and remain on the fringe where you belong.  We've suffered enough bloodshed at the hands of garbage collectivist ideas already."

"I may just be a gullible neo-Marxmist-cucklord-Nazi anarchist, but this is certainly refreshing. Keep up the good work!"
"I feel like some of what you're saying about how to catch a lying fascist may do more harm than good. For one, there aren't nearly enough actual secret white supremacist-fascists for any regular person to actually be concerned about trying to catch them in their lies. Second, some completely reasonable, non-fascist people have opinions about limiting immigration. You cant just tell them that theyre lying and that you know theyre lying and that theyre secretly fascists. If you get caught up in accusing people of having secret motives then the conversation can only devolve further. Although there will of course be some people who lie about their intentions, still, the best way to interact with people who you disagree with isnt to assume their motives and assume theyre lying. The best course of action is to treat everybody as if they mean well and believe what they say, up until they demonstrably prove that wrong."

I don't don't give a shit about the white race, I just hate this cause it's so vauge, basically anyone right of ye average SJW type who loves memes and meme culture could fit this."
"Incredible work. I wish I knew you sooner. Cheers from France comrade :)"
"greatness - thank you !!!"
"I love you so much <3"
"Watch Xavier: Renegade Angel. Escape from Squatopian Freedom is a good one. Theyre all good. You should eat a psyche-shattering dose of psilocybin first though."
"Seeing that line of people with torches like *'they've roused the fireworm'*"
"One thing I disagree with. Deplatforming. You mentioned solidarity of the accused, in luring people to them through fostering fear and paranoia of attack, but they can also take it inward, portray themselves as the victim and not just the target demographic as a potential victim. Feeding into their victim narrative, that the crazy lefties just want to attack them specifically, lends legitimacy to their claims that they're victimized, and leftists are all violent and evil. It adds the glamour of the forbidden to them, the appeal of conspiracy (what if they ARE speaking harsh truths?), and most damagingly, lets them plot in relative secret and make it easier for them to manipulate. A movement that must begin and move in crypto only thrives by pushing it into the shadows.  The best way to fight is to drag them into the bright light and expose them for what they are. That 4chan pol post spells it out right there, nothing makes normies recoil faster than a flag-waving nazi.  The more you let the monsters spew their bile, the more people realize 'ew, bile is kinda gross, I think I'll go that way.' They should be baited out into the light, and maneuvered into revealing what they are. Get them to show their power level, so to speak.  Sometimes that'll be harder than others, and particularly clever fascists, the talented propagandists, will need to be taken on by someone armed with a knowledge of reasoned debate, logical fallacies, and facts. Lots and lots of facts they're able to rattle off, and a certain level of political speaking capacity to know hat to say, what not to say, and how not to say it when confronted with a point they may not be fully equipped in that moment to counter without looking foolish. Pick your battles, but they must be battled openly."
"That intro was hilarious!"
"Fascism exists solidly on the left.  Don’t conflate assholes abusing Pagan symbols with actual pagans- and certainly not with Republicans or centrists.  Yeah, I have to say it. I’m almost solidly center- yet I’m simultaneously “Nazi” and “Fascist”."
"Wait ppl actually think that alt-right and nazis and fascists are significantly different?  Look I knew that ppl are stupid but not THAT stupid."
"That gleeful smile in the beginning... 😂😭😂"
"This is a great video but I don’t think fascist is the right word for these alt-right assholes. In my mind fascism and racism are often intertwined but not necessarily the same thing. A fascist wants an autocratic state like Putinist Russia, not necessarily a single ethnic state. A lot of these mother fuckers do want both, but I don’t think it’s necessarily correct to say people who believe in one believe in both. That’s just my thoughts though. Nazi punks can fuck off either way of course."
"i would like if this channel debated the folks at 1971L"
"'Trade pictures of japanese infants' LMAKSJBFJ TRUE"
"I disagree with some premises, like Trump being a fascist and not letting people debate sunlight is the best disinfectant for bad ideas. but a well made video!  Do you think Sargon and PJW are Alt-right? im interested at what level ppl consider people to be altright"
"It's even easier, just look for the people using/advocating violence against any peaceful person speaking any opinion.  Also OK sign is not a symbol of sneaky neo fascists, but A KNOW HOAX perpetrated by 4 chan to ridicule those brave little soldiers looking for fascists in their neighbors, in their friends and under their beds."
"If Nazis started using purple hair to represent would that not just be a total mind f***?"
"Thanks to Wikipedia for putting you on their home page today - this is the first video of yours that I've seen and I am so impressed. Looking forward to becoming more familiar with your channel."
"I'm tired of hearing the same canned 'the-ends-justify-the-means' talk about stopping facists on YT, so I'm just really glad you didn't do that here. Thumbs up!"
"What 'race' would I even be? I look white. Idk I have german, Irish, swidish and native american soooooo....? Not fully white there but sure as hell look it? So I can gain their trust and take them down from the inside >:) lol. But anyway I guarantee most of these Nazis probably have DNA of 'non-white' ancestors just like me and probably don't even know it. No way they're all 'pure European' like come on we've had how many generations???"
"LIked, subscribed, shared, commented."
"If by Western culture, they mean just like remembering or sometimes celebrating non-violent, non-racist, or anything bad, its fine. If it's stuff like raiding other countries, slavery, or Siege craft, then nah, I'm good."
"what if fascism is the key to saving western civilization?"
"Rather a facist then a leftist!"
"You know, I often feel like I'm the one sitting in a raunchy comedy with a bunch of kids where the jokes are going way over their head when I talk with leftists about the free speech issue.  This video is a useful case in point: it's not like your objection to free speech claims, that they are often cynically deployed by far right actors who have no interest in protecting those rights once they gain power, is incorrect.  But this surface-level 'cui bono' analysis is the most basic you could possibly make.  The more nuanced conversations, of who in practice gets to determine what ought to be censored by a particular kind of social approval, to what extent social norms can be influenced by individual people deciding or choosing not to exercise their power in a particular way, and whether  weakening beneficial universal norms to gain a leg up  in this or that short-term skirmish or years-long war, are typically entirely neglected.  One gets the impression that anti-free speech proponents are completely ignorant of the centuries of history and political philosophy that led to the first amendment being passed in the first place.  In short, instead of worrying about the splinter in my eye, go remove the beam in yours, then turn that beam into paper, print some of John Stuart Mill on it, read it, and get back to me."
"Aside all the politics, this is a well thought thru video"
"Contra - you complete me. This video covers 95% of alt-right propaganda and tactics in 23 minutes."
"That is why we, centrists, hopefully will always lean on the right. Because you, leftists, with your prowess in intellectual sugery of any social issue, are as cold-blooded as faschists (probably more cynical) and once grasped the power you would turn the soceity in butcher-jeopardy once again (i am from post-USSR)."
"So now you can have a ethno identity only if you are a minority, right? Or else is oppression?"
"i have to say i agree, people should NOT be giving the alt-right platform.. we are all ANTIFA.. FUCC TRUMP!!!"
"when you replaced the old school luftwaffe with the MAGA hat was pretty effective..."
"This use of /pol/ shows that you're understanding of 4chan is extremely limited"
"This is ethnic nationalism you are describing, fascism is not synonymous with this. Fascists may use ethnic nationalism, but there is more to it to that, like a one party state that controls the means of production and has (theoretically) absolute control over economic decisions. You are complaining that people are 'changing terms' but that's precisely what you are doing."
"Bitch you are so wrong"
"Contemporary fascists do not share those three core beliefs because those are not fascistic in nature."
"Where did you get this absurd definition of fascism?"
"You know those moments when something just ''clicks''. That's exactly what happened to me while watching this, thank you."
"I'm sorry I blacked out for a second looking at your juicy juicy lips...............f me?"
"i couldn't get past the denial of white genocide, videos like this just strengthen the myth whites are somehow free of it. Look at South Africa."
"This is a really amazing vid. Well researched"
"uh... that's not fascism.. that's racism. Wiki anyone? What a moron."
"So is this person a guy? 'She' looks like a guy other than the make-up, hair and clothing."
"Im very sorry but is that a fucking dude?"
"I've just started following this channel. A new favorite! Just the kind of political analysis and commentary i was hoping to find."
"I really like the lighting in this video"
"I get that you feel threatened by heteronormitivity, but your feefees don't trump racial self-interest. Also, you seem a little aggressive. Get your levels checked, trannypoints."
"I think im in love with u"
"So I get this idea of people like Sargon using these tactics to point downwards but is there any proof or a place I can find proof of major people doing this or is all of this strictly kept in a food chain that cuts off those who fall behind because of fucking up?"
"Only a closet member of Antifa can’t see how all the points here can easily be aimed AT Antifa. 👌"
"You may say that you have a connoisseurs eye for detecting fascists but the views you raised at the start are specifically Nazi beliefs not fascist beliefs Fascism in general is very broad and unique to each country it appears in, the main points of fascism in general tend to be Ultra-nationalism, glorification of the military, glorification of the past which leads to, steeping itself in traditions, propaganda, and cults of personality, the whole racial thing is pretty unique to American,German, and English fascists. Edit I would like to amend my previous statement to say that the racial aspect is prevalent in most forms of fascism but each countries fascist group has its own Narrative it's not all anti-semitic and it's not all white supremacist, there are for example Japanese fascists who are neither of those things but are still Racist."
"Actually, the new nazi propaganda touched on a really interesting dichotomy between civic and ethnic nationalism and underscores how icky ethnic nationalism can get"
"Those Nazi videos are so hoaky"
"For the porpouses of this video you are completly right, but please be more accurate with the definition of facism because it really makes it easy for to people misrepresent you."
"I don't buy into the whole 'dog whistle' thing. The problem with it is that people can use it to accuse anyone of being fascist even if they are not. Even if a person has repeatedly disavowed fascism, their words can still be twisted and misinterpreted using this concept. I think we should take what everyone says at face value. Thinking that someone has hidden racist motivations behind the things they say comes across as paranoid. If a person has a racist agenda, then eventually they will out themselves. Beliefs that extreme don't stay hidden for long. So instead of accusing innocent people of using 'dog whistles,' let the fascist expose themselves, which they will eventually do."
"Hey there,  I actually enjoy a lot of your content. I believe you are trying to explain your ideas in a way that they are founded on reason and scholars that have tried to figure stuff out. Most of us all stand on the soldiers of giants that have done a lot of work for us in the past. And I believe that is a good thing. However, I do get annoyed by the way that the word “fascism” randomly pops up to slur political opponents. When I got to this video… which kind of explains why you use the term this loosely, it all starts making sense.   I hope… we both agree on the idea that we like to name something by it’s name as correctly as possible. Slurs start when we hyperbolically use a term with negative load attached to them to smear people (or ideas) we don’t like. When people on the left side of the political-economic spectrum are all branded as Communist Stalinist Bolsheviks, the people branded this way will all go “wait a minute, that’s not what we are, we are…” (fill in any part of the movement that belongs to you). Then the opposition can easily say: “So you are not a Communist Stalinist Bolshevic?... well that’s EXACTLY what a Communist Stalinist Bolshevic would say!!!” (08:00 - https://youtu.be/a1Y73sPHKxw) Of course you will find people that just say that they are Stalinists and openly defend Stalinist ideas.   Also, you will find people that openly say “we are fascists” … which makes it really clear where they position themselves in politics. But I’m willing to agree that certain fascists work under the radar and go all masonry cult wink wink do secret handshake stuff on us. That still doesn’t mean that people are just a fascist because of some arbitrary set of ideas that you describe this movement with.  Within their inner-circle they just say that they are fascists (or what ever they called their fascist movement… cause in fascism there are different movements).  Now “fascism” is a difficult topic. It’s complex and it has the possibility to connect itself to different political ideas. However, we can’t start calling everyone a fascist just because we don’t like what they are saying. It would blur the meaning of the ideology to the point that everyone we don’t like is a fascist and the word fascist has no meaning anymore. Which I believe you are guilty off in your video. According to your definition that you provide yourself… everything things fits and makes sense. But according to historians and political scientists, your definition will encounter problems in a real debate about the topic… and it will undermine other arguments you will make, because your basic definition just doesn’t hold up and smears to much clear non-fascists. It has the potential of you being attacked as a fear monger. The same dynamic you will encounter with “social democrats” that have to push back to the rhetoric of the gulags at the moment they talk about a bigger government for health-care reforms. Which I believe (and hope) we both don’t want to be at.   So what is fascism?  Like I said it’s complex and there is debate between scholars. I will therefore choose to use a work produced by “Robin Te Slaa” who wrote a book in dutch called “Wat is Fashisme?” (translation: What is fascism)  published in 2017. I admit it’s only one source, but he actually makes a synthesis of different authors that have tried to define the movement. He wrote the book to educate people about the movement because the term “fascism” started popping up in the political debate in the Netherlands recently with movements like the one from “Pim Fortuyn” and “Geert Wilders”. He actually debunks the idea that these movements are “fascist” even though under your  definition they can be easily placed there.  So what is the conclusion of “Te Slaa” on how to define fascism (mainly taken from the epilogue of the book mentioned before):  “Fascism is:  1. A European revolutionary radical movement that came to light after the 1st world war that is a countermovement to liberal thought. Being a 3th way between “liberalism” and “socialism” was part of the common fascist rhetoric.  2. Romantic, it’s dreamy. It doesn’t found it’s believes on science or rationality… it creates it’s own myths on which they build a rational discourse. Of course for the outsiders this discourse will always be irrational since they don’t agree on the fables that give foundations to the fascist rhetoric.  3. Utopian in nature (with tendencies of Illusions of Grandeur and fueled by myths)  4. Strives to form a new political elite and a new form of governance/state  5. Above all they search for a new transcendental synthesis of all classes in society to create a new (ethnical) homogenous society. (The idea of a  “New Man”)  6. Exclusive in nature (only for the in group, and what they define as the in group)  7. A mass movement lead by a strong authoritarian elite  8. Totalitarian in nature. The Ideology and ideas of the Fascist elites’ dogmatic ideological views cover all parts of human activity. From the morning to the evening… it doesn’t allow anything to exist next to it (like religion) unless it’s been allowed and (possibly) changed/molded by the fascist doctrine and it’s spokesmen the fascist elite.    Fascism believes:  1. That their ideas will create a new political, socio-economic rebirth of society  2. In total revolution that will affect all aspects of human life. They have this romantic view of violent struggle (war/conflict) where the weak will perish and the strong elite will emerge to lead the irrational masses to a new utopian paradigm. Violence to regenerate society. Sort of the idea that out of the ashes of violence, strong leadership, the fascist idea will give birth to this new utopian fascist world.  3. That individuals and the concept of “a person” is meaningless  4. That “the people” is the unite that is the most important, they are group thinkers by definition. The groups definition depends on the place where fascism existed. Definitions varied from country to country and movement to movement.   5. That “the people” need to be “rescued” from modern life and decadence. The people are “irrational” and they need / long for a strong authoritarian leadership (elite) that will lead them to a better life.   6. That everything that doesn’t fits with the new world view (or the definition of “the people” and the new political paradigm), need to be abolished (literally).   7. Humanism can’t exist under fascism, there is no respect for human individual freedoms or life. Only the group matters and the abolishment of things that don’t fit in this world view need to get rid of, often by violence and murder.    Ideas like: Biological racism, anti-Semitism, social Darwinism, eugenics, extreme-nationalism, “völkisch”-imageries already existed before “fascism”, the idea of another political stream next to liberalism and socialism already existed. So was the idea of a new political elite that will emerge and the coming of the new man (you find these ideas with futurist romantics).   The eclectic combination of all these pre-existing ideas and the abortion of socialist and liberal narratives gave rise to the mass movements that they called “Fascist”. “  I’ve put “ethnical” specifically between brackets. The author names “ethnical” specifically it in it’s epilogue, but he also has an entire chapter talking about the specifics of ethnicity when it comes to defining “The People”. For instance, Mussolini said: “National pride has absolutely no need for racial-deliriums.”, he also denies the existence of “Anti-Semitism” in Italy at that time. (Te Slaa took this from: E. Ludwig – Talks with Mussolini). And I think no one will define “Il Duce” as not being a Fascist.  Therefore it’s hard to put Mussolini’s fascism on the same line as Hitler’s’ National Socialism. Both movements have the same broad lines which the author and me mentioned… but their ideas about what “The People” would be have not always been the same. Hitler was way more obsessed with the pure Arian myth, while Mussolini seems to have more of a “Nation building” idea where more ethnicities living in Italy can all be nationalist patriots and live under his fascism.   Nationalism (and early nation states cause they are a fairly modern phenomena) have tried to create more homogenous populations. To give an example… just look up the banishment of other languages within France during the 19th century to create a more homogenous national identity.   Te Slaa comes to the conclusion that calling people like “Wilders” and “Fortuyn” fascists doesn’t really fit the bill. And although I can’t talk for the author… his definition doesn’t people like “Donald Trump”, “Marine Le Pen”, “Sarah Palin” or “Lauren Southern” either.   A political movement that has been growing over the years, as well in the US as in Europe is “Right Wing Populism”. Which has some differences with “fascism”.  They are not the same! They are easily confused because Fascism and Populism sometimes tend to use the same tactics, some of their rhetoric seems seriously familiar. But they are not the same. To define “Populism” I would like to use the definition given by “Cas Mudde”. He’s a dutch political scientist that is seen somewhat as an authority on populist parties. If you know dutch you can read “Elementaire deeltjes 51: Populisme” (2017 – he wrote this with Cristobal Rovira Kaltwasser) or his English book“Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe” (2007).

I still mess up a bit, but I think I'm getting better a recognizing and engaging alt right ideas and fascist propaganda without getting super emotional and managing to sound rather knowledgeable. Thanks for all you do, keep up the good fight comrade 😉😉"
"I’m terrified that watching this tranny gave me aids."
"I'm not racist or even alt-right, i identify as a rational and practical centrist that has a lot of left leaning views when it comes to the environment and civil rights (ie abortion gay marriage ect) and healthcare but right leaning practical (not empathetic) veiws when it comes to immigration. I just don't want Europe to become majority non-white in the next 100 years, it just doesn't seem right that most likely given current immigration and 2nd/3rd generation immigrant birth rates white people will become a  minority in Europe, which will mean a permanent loss of culture and identity. For example Japanese or Koreans wouldn't want their capital cities (Tokyo and Seoul) to become majority non Japanese or Korean, like London is 45%  white British (this is 2012 data, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-20680565). Overall i believe that multiculturalism is great to an extent that promotes sharing of food, music and assisting in labour shortages but not to the point of eventually replacing the native population. I hope people reading this don't assume I'm a alt-right nazi."

"You have been debunked multiple times and I find it funny how you try to portray nationalists as fat losers. 😂 just look at the Golden one."
"1:11 into the video and you've already made fascist into a racial term. So I guess Gaddafi and Bashar al assad aren't fascists after all! Also ethnic replacement/genocide of one's own population has been used in various points throughout history, in more places than Europe, as a tool to consolidate political power. And this whole white-centric definition of fascist belief is not at all characteristic of fascism, it's much closer to Nazi ideology... which is national socialism... which you could say is the alt left."
"oh ouch, your ignorance makes me suspect everything you say in the video, because right at the beginning, you didn't even define fascism correctly.   It's not a 'white only' thing. How can I trust anything you say when you immediately misconstrue the most vital word in the entire video? You're not talking about 'fascists', you're talking about the people sjws CALL 'fascists'. Those people are sometimes fashy, but there are a lot of fascists among the sjws as well. What the sjws MEAN is a mix of alt-right and poltard. If I replaced every use of 'fascist' in this video with 'poltard' it would immediately be more accurate. But that means that you clearly misunderstood something fundamental about these political ideologies.    I'm very sad that a video like this couldn't accurately describe the most important aspect of the video itself. Poltards are predominantly fascists. But not all fascists are poltards. The worst thing you can do is misconstrue your enemy. It immediately gives THEM the upper hand because they suddenly have the truth on their side.   ARGH why can't I find any decent lefty arguments against the right? it's really bothering me. scares me."

He’s a total fascist and is a totally horrible person who is harming the most vulnerable Filipinos and promotes everything from vigilante justice to having his own “brown shirts”. Otherwise this was a good video. You gave the definition of fascists at the beginning of the video but you only defined it as the neo nazi, white nationalists, ethno centric fascists. There are several fascist leaders through out the continent of Africa.  Overall though, this is very well done and the strategies you show are important to recognize. And as an LGBTQI person i feel like we have to be super vigilant."
"facism and national socialism are not the same thing!...  fascism is when the three social classes within a country work together to achieve a common goal whether it be that one of the groups is socially superior controls another but still at the end of the day working to achieve a common goal so by definition north korea is a facist country  whilst national socialism is broadly defined as monoethnisism basically the definition which you described in your video"

"I think its useful to point out that the 3 examples of contemporary fascist beliefs are not necessarily accurate; fascism, above all else, is an angry, often violent reaction by the dominant demographic against any threat to that dominancy / a feeling that your nation / race is being undermined, as a result of the decline of a nations power and influence. The lines are usually blurred-to-nonexistent. German fascism was mostly due to the rise of socialism in Europe and the simultaneous sharp decline of Germany as a power after ww1 (plus the whole great depression thing). Fascists blamed mostly the the Jews (but also numerous other 'bad people' like the blacks and the gays) for socialism and the loss of ww1 and the decline of Germany. Pretty soon they're murdered 11,000,000 'bad people' and lost ww2. Extreme times led to extreme fascism. American fascism, however, is (in appearance) very different. Fascism in the US is mostly a backlash against feminism and the civil rights movement, and any form of leftism, (SJWs) all of which threaten the dominance of the strait white male. The reason I think fascism has been so popular recently in the us is a combination of economic stagnation, increasing racial/gender/sexual equality and the beginning of the slow decline of the unchallenged supremacy of the United States: Make America Great Again. The biggest threat isn't so much disguised neo-nazism that's still talking about the Jews, but home-grown American fascism that scapegoats feminists, civil rights advocates and leftists, all under the convenient banner of SJWs. Facism is a reactionary way of thinking, not a set of principles, and I think its important people understand that. The times are less extreme than 1930s Germany, and so Is the fascism, but when the US becomes the next British-Empire-in-the-1950s, things aren't going to look pretty."

"If you grew up in the George W Bush, Passion of the Christ era, you remember how much the Right was in favor of censorship. Trump is in favor of criminalizing burning the USA flag e.g.  How can you demand freedom of expression to do Lefty things while denying racists and anti-trans the freedom to do their thing?  Denying that freedom because you're afraid it will incite violence gives the Right the precedent to limit our freedom by arguing the same. What if an assassination attempt on Trump was inspired by Leftist anxiety caused by this video? Would the Right be correct in demanding this content be censored? Hell no.  No doubt words and ideas potentially lead to violence and vulnerable people will receive some of that. But that's the price of freedom that we have to accept so we can then focus on convincing people of truth. I like your video @ContraPoints because you're thoughtful and convincing. I'm a normie and you're giving me more to think about. But the deplatforming and mob censorship that you sympathize with is no way to get me on your side. It's a total turnoff for dudes like me and if you want to win this culture war, you gotta know that those tactics drive me into facist hands."

"But then again everybody else does also that same tactic of trivializing the meaning of things believe me we've had our fair share of we've had our fair share of what is white anyway what is Indo-European even though people don't have any f****** doubt when they are racially attacking raping people and also attacking a racial demographic for by the false accusation of Oppression they sure do know what is f*** is white and Indo European at that point"
"And quite frankly I find a defensive that people find a defensive that a people want to have a racial area for their own people in every other race has this unquestionably considering all this Multicultural experiment is being done on our f****** territory on our nation it obviously is rational to see why the very people that made it won't to maintain their racial stock considering these areas are going to no longer reflect them and constantly bring all racial demographics in conflict and create racial tension"
"And here's the biggest thing that gets on my nerves this person here is dispossessing the fact that she speaks English is culturally Western but wants to disavow culturally Western people and people that very made the very things and culture she participates in except for the fact that I think it's a he and it's a tranny but quite frankly I don't want you in my community but then again this is the kind of f****** thing they want to force themselves on other people if people don't want you around you do not have the f****** right to force yourself on them cuz then you're intruding on their rights your rights should not be contingent on my lack of Rights that is f****** oppression 101 this is ideologically b******* and it's no f****** Wonder we're growing"
"No that's what we call a cock number one but either way the same thing goes it's the same thing over and over again Indo Europeans give give give in their own Homeland people that try to fight against Mass immigration in a homogeneous Homeland are labelled racist Mass immigration takes place then the mass immigration that takes place brings their culture creates racial enclaves and tries to demographic Lee takeover  Because they don't like Western ideas they don't want Western ways they aren't Western people they aren't Indo-European they don't identify with Indo European ways Indo-European people don't want people that are not of their people they're in their own country they have that f****** right and before the immigration takes place they should listen to the f****** people when they say no but they don't they slap them on the hand call them racist and in doing so commit the most racist action of all they're basically creating a colonialism against indo-europeans against their will  They're forcing immigration on a racial demographic in compromising their interest and don't tell me immigration is not a weapon there is weapon United States Navy reports of immigration being used as a weapon to weaken the nation and subvert a culture"
"They are trying to preserve Western culture and the Very Western people because the very Western people in Western culture is being put upon by diversity and people in demographics with various interest and do not like Western culture nor do you want to be a part of it and then you also look at the morality of people moving into a racial demographics homogeneous Homeland and then at which point you have competing demographics for political representation and limited resources in this is from a Harvard study you guys are f****** stupid just so you can eat your God damn tacos you're willing to sacrifice 570 some thousand lives a year in inter racial crime  It's kind of hard to have interracial crime stats when you have a homogeneous Community let's see you talk your f****** way out of that"
"And to be honest what interested blacks have and white spaces like again we we look at this objectively like why the f*** would you want to go there it was too cause discourse it was to cause problems it was too Rebel roused it wasn't about a f******  And when you go attacking people's freedoms and you go forcing Your Existence on someone and you literally go into their areas and force yourself into those areas you're going to f****** be disliked it's not common sense I'm a Nazi I'm not going to be long at a gay rally me going there would just cause f****** problems it would be very f****** disrespectful to them but see here's the thing this courtesy is given to every group but guess what soon enough it will be taken because you expect too Goddamn much out of everyone else and not thinking about giving any God damn thing back  At this point I'm done seeing civility if you got people like this that doesn't they want to look at the symptoms but never want to go to the very source of the matter and dance around it with the dead thick f****** points you know what f*** you you better eat a bullet or get in the oven"
"I mean I'm not going to hide it I'm a white nationalist I really don't give a f*** if you can accept the way that I am then you got the problem not me I don't have a problem with you I have a problem with the morality of integration being based on the oppression of one racial demographics rights and that is the contingent basis on freedom for the other demographics right that's f****** stupid and ideologically a fallacy"
"And everyone does the same thing so what the f***** your point everyone does the same thing everyone's guilty of the same s*** your think you're doing is covertly you don't want to talk about the morality of the 1965 immigration policy being forced on a people not by a vote you don't want to talk about the displacement that it's caused the end of European populations and even at the sign of signing the bill it was stated that it would not cause the effect that it has but yet no one's done anything"

"WHITE SUPREMACY DOES NOT EXIST.  THE FAR RIGHT IS FIGHTING SUPREMACY! JEWISH SUPREMACY IS REAL.  Ovadia Yosef was the chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel.  He had the largest funeral in Israel's history in which nearly a million Jews were in the streets mourning his loss.  These are his words:  “Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel.”  “In Israel, death has no dominion over them… With gentiles, it will be like any person – they need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money.  “This is his servant… That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew.”  “Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat… That is why gentiles were created.”  — Weekly Saturday night sermon in October 2010 according to “The Times of Israel”"

"If fascists take advantage of centrists fear that they will be labeled nazis... wouldn't the best strategy to be NOT saying that centrists align with nazis?"
"This idea that you need to try as hard as you can to ascribe sinister deeper meanings to whatever someone else says (aka looking for dog whistles) is super dangerous.  1. It totally destroys any coherent debate. You can't exchange ideas freely if anything you say is guaranteed to be twisted into a Nazi dog whistle.  2. It creates a level of paranoia only seen in the gang stalking community. The human brain is hardwired to be excellent at pattern recognition. So when you look for a pattern, you're bound to find one. So the inevitable result of looking for dog whistles is that you'll find them EVERYWHERE. The result of that is the delusion that 98% of Americans are neo-Nazi KKK fascists who are conspiring to create a white ethnostate.   Neither of these are hypothetical. Both are serious problems with the left, and we shouldn't encourage them. Yes, it's true that a genuine fascist will rarely reveal that they are one. But this line of reasoning of comically absurd. It is quite literally 'I'm not a murderer' 'That's what a murderer would say!' ... ... ..."

"Some statistics about the homosexual lifestyle and its effects:   One study reports 70% of homosexuals admitting to having sex only one time with over 50% of their partners (3).  One study reports that the average homosexual has between 20 and 106 partners per year (6). The average heterosexual has 8 partners in a lifetime.  Many homosexual sexual encounters occur while drunk, high on drugs, or in an orgy setting (7).  Many homosexuals don't pay heed to warnings of their lifestyles: 'Knowledge of health guidelines was quite high, but this knowledge had no relation to sexual behavior' (16).  Homosexuals got homosexuality removed from the list of mental illnesses in the early 70s by storming the annual American Psychiatric Association (APA) conference on successive years. 'Guerrilla theater tactics and more straight-forward shouting matches characterized their presence' (2). Since homosexuality has been removed from the APA list of mental illnesses, so has pedophilia (except when the adult feels 'subjective distress') (27).  Homosexuals account for 3-4% of all gonorrhea cases, 60% of all syphilis cases, and 17% of all hospital admissions (other than for STDs) in the United States (5). They make up only 1-2% of the population.  Homosexuals live unhealthy lifestyles, and have historically accounted for the bulk of syphilis, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B, the 'gay bowel syndrome' (which attacks the intestinal tract), tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus (27).  73% of psychiatrists say homosexuals are less happy than the average person, and of those psychiatrists, 70% say that the unhappiness is NOT due to social stigmatization (13).  25-33% of homosexuals and lesbians are alcoholics (11).  Of homosexuals questioned in one study reports that 43% admit to 500 or more partners in a lifetime, 28% admit to 1000 or more in a lifetime, and of these people, 79% say that half of those partners are total strangers, and 70% of those sexual contacts are one night stands (or, as one homosexual admits in the film 'The Castro', one minute stands) (3). Also, it is a favorite past-time of many homosexuals to go to 'cruisy areas' and have anonymous sex.  78% of homosexuals are affected by STDs (20).  Judge John Martaugh, chief magistrate of the New York City Criminal Court has said, 'Homosexuals account for half the murders in large cities' (10).  Captain William Riddle of the Los Angeles Police says, '30,000 sexually abused children in Los Angeles were victims of homosexuals' (10).  50% of suicides can be attributed to homosexuals (10).  Dr. Daniel Capron, a practicing psychiatrist, says, 'Homosexuality by definition is not healthy and wholesome. The homosexual person, at best, will be unhappier and more unfulfilled than the sexually normal person' (10). For other psychiatrists who believe that homosexuality is wrong, please see National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality.  It takes approximately $300,000 to take care of each AIDS victim, so thanks to the promiscuous lifestyle of homosexuals, medical insurance rates have been skyrocketing for all of us(10). Homosexuals were responsible for spreading AIDS in the United States, and then raised up violent groups like Act Up and Ground Zero to complain about it. Even today, homosexuals account for well over 50% of the AIDS cases in the United States, which is quite a large number considering that they account for only 1-2% of the population.  Homosexuals account for a disproportionate number of hepatitis cases: 70-80% in San Francisco, 29% in Denver, 66% in New York City, 56% in Toronto, 42% in Montreal, and 26% in Melbourne (8).  37% of homosexuals engage in sadomasochism, which accounts for many accidental deaths. In San Francisco, classes were held to teach homosexuals how to not kill their partners during sadomasochism (8).  41% of homosexuals say they have had sex with strangers in public restrooms, 60% say they have had sex with strangers in bathhouses, and 64% of these encounters have involved the use of illegal drugs (8).  Depending on the city, 39-59% of homosexuals are infected with intestinal parasites like worms, flukes and amoebae, which is common in filthy third world countries (8).  The median age of death of homosexuals is 42 (only 9% live past age 65). This drops to 39 if the cause of death is AIDS. The median age of death of a married heterosexual man is 75 (8).  The median age of death of lesbians is 45 (only 24% live past age 65). The median age of death of a married heterosexual woman is 79 (8).  Homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident (8).  21% of lesbians die of murder, suicide or traffic accident, which is at a rate of 534 times higher than the number of white heterosexual females aged 25-44 who die of these things(8).  50% of the calls to a hotline to report 'queer bashing' involved domestic violence (i.e., homosexuals beating up other homosexuals) (18).  About 50% of the women on death row are lesbians (12). Homosexuals prey on children.  33% of homosexuals ADMIT to minor/adult sex (7).  There is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, known as the North American Man and Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). This is a child molesting homosexual group whose cry is 'SEX BEFORE 8 BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.' This group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades across the United States.  Homosexuals commit more than 33% of all reported child molestations in the United States, which, assuming homosexuals make up 2% of the population, means that 1 in 20 homosexuals is a child molestor, while 1 in 490 heterosexuals is a child molestor (19).  73% of all homosexuals have had sex with boys under 19 years of age (9).  Many homosexuals admit that they are pedophiles: 'The love between men and boys is at the foundation of homosexuality' (22).  Because homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting children. Homosexuals can be heard chanting 'TEN PERCENT IS NOT ENOUGH, RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT' in their homosexual parades. A group called the 'Lesbian Avengers' prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. They print 'WE RECRUIT' on their literature. Some other homosexuals aren't as overt about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into positions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young children (e.g., the clergy, teachers, Boy Scout leaders, etc.) (8). See the DC Lesbian Avengers web page, and DC Lesbian Avengers Press Release, where they threaten to recruit little boys and girls. Also, see AFA Action Alert."
"Here are some reasons to be ALT RIGHT:  FBI: At least 29,437 whites were killed by blacks from 1976-2005 in USA. At least 11,262 blacks were killed by whites in the same period, thus a deficit of 18,175 whites as you subtract 11,262 blacks killed by whites from 29,437 whites killed by blacks. Non-Hispanic Whites are about 5 times the black population so this is a kill ratio of right around 13 to one: 13 dead whites by blacks for each dead black by a white relative to equal numbers but this includes Hispanics as “whites” thus askew in terms of 53% of Hispanics self identifying as white in a survey a few years ago... (FBI, Bureau of Justice Statistics and Census Bureau) ------ “Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery.   When blacks commit crimes of violence, they are nearly three times more likely than non-blacks to use a gun, and more than twice as likely to use a knife.   Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.   Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. 45% of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic.   When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black.  Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.   Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa. - from the website titled: THE COLOR OF CRIME (NEW CENTURY FOUNDATION)   “806,316 homicides in US from ‘65-2004 and 588,611 were committed by blacks; 179,808 were blacks who murdered Whites.  322,526 of these homicides were not cleared & only 483,790 were cleared & of those Whites murdered by blacks, 43,541 were cleared and 136,267 were not cleared.  In 40 years blacks killed almost as many Whites as were killed in WWII, 4 times as many Whites as were killed in Vietnam & 60 times as many Whites as killed in 911 or Iraq – from fathersmanifesto   UK Government Source: Blacks are 5 times more likely to commit violence against a person. Blacks are 4 times ‘more likely’ to commit sexual offences. Blacks are fifteen times ‘more likely’ to commit robbery. Blacks are over six times ‘more likely’ to commit fraud and forgery. Blacks are over twice as likely to commit criminal damage. Black are five times ‘more likely’ to commit drugs offences. More data on UK Enrichment news  Steven Pinker: “In tribal societies, hunter-gatherers and hunter-horticulturalists, an average of about 15 percent of people met their ends through violence. In the 20th century, if you try to come up with a highest estimate you can -- combining all the wars, all the genocides, all the man-made famines -- you get to 3 percent.”   'While poor people of any race commit crimes more often than rich people of the same race, blacks commit crimes at a higher rate than whites across all socio-economic strata.' google this: Mapping The Unmentionable: Race And Crime"

"Very provocative having a trans presenter for this message.  Most norms are NOT educated liberals: they are very uncomfortable with us. And of course the fashies will have a field day: 'See: what did I tell you? They ARE all sick degenerates, poisoning our vital bodily fluids, etc'. I have come to resent the way that both left and right seem to be playing the same game of using minorities as political footballs.   'Advocacy' in all reality represents the act of  painting a target on the back of those who are actually viewed with disdain by the majority.  The association of disliked groups with left politics, once performed by the extreme right, (e.g., the 'Judenbolschevismus' of nazi Germany), is now chiefly practiced by the Left.  This leads to a 'Ghettoisation' of beleaguered minorities and hostility is cultivated toward 'Norms'.  To define someone as  'Trans' often obscures their primary status as 'People'."

"I agree but I have a slight counter-argument. I don't believe these are the strategies of fascists. They are means to an end.  Anyone can use these methods to acquire their goals.  It's just most people who uses them are quite malicious simply because their goals are inherently against the grain.  However, my counter-argument has it's own counter-argument, being against the grain isn't inherently bad.  The truly malicious issue of this method of attack is that it doesn't have any really good counters other then removing ignorance from play. which is almost impossible... (In my mind I have a deep and meaningful point here but in the real world, outside my head, to complete strangers, this statement is meaningless.) That makes me incredibly sad."
"So I'm not even 2 minutes into this video and I can you have already wrong fascism has nothing to do what being white or western culture."
"I think dog whistling works because they're better at marking. Its not centrist and the average republican fault the left are failures at talking to people and representing the interests of people. The racist tend to support free markets over command economies and the left pushes crap welfare. The left needs to stop pushing command economics and state dependency."
"Slavery has existed way before the white people did it. We didn't 'invent' slavery. Do yourself a favor and the rest of us: #walkaway The left are the REAL FASCISTS who want to ABOLISH FREE SPEECH (amongst many other things - like promoting COMMUNISM which NEVER works) basically anyone who does not agree with you. Ending free speech IS fascism please, wake the FUCK UP! Don't think that your not public enemy#1 either just because you are a WHITE MALE in a dress. The left will eat itself..."
"Fascism is a corporativist state under the guidance of a strong leader. An ethonostate is national-socialism thing. Read Mussolini and Gentile books before spouting nonsens you fucking disgusting faggot."
"Even Richard Spencer said in an interview that he doesn’t value free speech"
"nazis stay pressed"
"This video made me a white nationalist."
"Your definition of fascism isn't quite right, not that it's easy to define since there have been many forms. Aside from a will to power and an empire that is based on order, discipline and an artificial hierarchy that's put in place instead of arrising naturally, it mostly derives out of the notion that your group and it's ideas are right and all other' are wrong."
"Dude go on the Daily Shoah, would be a really good debate 👍🏼"
"I just discovered your channel and instantly subscribed. Seeing a well educated women, who does her research, talks about topics I care about and manages to make it all look incredebly pretty just makes my day. I really appreciate all the work you put into your videos! Keep up the great work!"

"why am I on this side of Youtube?"
"I would describe myself as anti-SJW these days. But I'm amazed at how hard it is to convince people who aren't in the SJW camp that the police really do discriminate against black people, and that's bad and wrong regardless of the relative crime rates by population."
"tell the people of europe that these claims are false, tell the people of europe that there is not a anti white multicultural narrative. do you deny that whites are going extinct? what do you think non whites will do with transexules? GFY living in the comfort of generations of conservatism."

"The 👌🏻 hand gesture is not a dogwhistle it was created by the alt right to throw off liberals."
"Got cringy towards end. The whole thing with fascists etc is just goofy. Not gonna flip my shit over it. Gonna carry a knife and pepper spray and call it a day. Covers all threats."
"This is such an important video.  Who's with me?!!"
"Whilst I agree the likes of Sargon are not alt-right, they do help their cause and monetise that help. Sargon had a huge audience and pretends to be left wing, terribly. He's a classic, useful idiot."

"Ok. Yeah. I'm sold on you."
"Love you contra! Keep up the good work!"
"Do you guys not agree that there are big differences between the human races?"
"One thing nobody mentions is how fascism always coincides with a strong hatred of socialism, to the point of promoting violence against it. In fact, in most fascist regimes, the socialists and communists are then massacred.  Hitler slaughtered the socialists and communists, so did Pinochet, so did Mussolini. There were also the fascist regimes in South Korea and Vietnam, the South Koreans genocided hundreds of thousands of its own people who were perceived communists, and the South Vietnamese also killed thousands of its own people who were perceived communists and put tens of thousands into concentration camps. It is not surprising that along with the rise of the right-wing in the United States, we've also seen a rise in the dislike for Unions and desire to bust up Unions, as well as the disdain and fear mongering of socialism on Fox News, Breitbart, Louder with Crowder, etc. Before fascism takes hold, the society is always primed to view socialism as the enemy, so that they can oppress it with bloody violence."
"what do i do if i want to resist fascism AND socialism/communism"
"Holy fuck, I love your sense of humor. Where did you get that mug by the way? I've been looking for something to put my used condoms in."
"oh shit... you don't think fascists deserve free speech?  That's fucked up...  Let's hope neither of you are successful in trying to silence anyones free speech.   You're more alike than you know."
"'I'm not a fascist is what a fascist would say'.... Yep... remember hitler... denouncing that fascism?   I feel like you made a 23 minute video, and don't even understand the basics of fucking fascism.............. c'mon now.  This should have been the easiest subject ever to tackle, but you were too busy trying to look like a Trans-gendered twoface to bother doing any research?"
"If gender is just a social construct, how, exactly, can I tell you have a penis, based on your Adams apple?"
"We also need to teach the difference between totalitarianism and fascism.  Because there is a lot of equivocation around those words. You don't need to be a genocidal totalitarian fuck weasel to be a fascist knob.  I guess that's what they mean by power level.  Beware the genocidal totalitarian fuck weasels children. They're out there."
"Actually, the left IS the right.  You ever read 1984?  You do realize the dictator wrote Goldstein's book, right?  The rich benefit from Socialism, not the poor.  The objective of the right is for people to keep what they earn, be capable of competing, and to have a loving family to help people adapt to the world, because no institution will care as much about you as your family.  The left  calls itself Socialism, and pretends to care about the poor, but uses the fractional reserve banking system to redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich.  Rich people are paid interest just for having money, and poor people are charged money for not having it.  That's the fifth plank of communism/socialism:  Central Banks.  Under the guise of philanothropy, they can create money out of debt, funnel it to companies and charities that they own stock in, and pocket profits as dividends, while passing the debt on to the rest of us through inflation.  With central banks abolished, people would be required to be more frugal, and live within their means, resulting in less waste, products that are built to last, etc.  What you don't realize is that the left (who is also the far right) has brainwashed you into thinking you should support monopoly under the guise of morality.  You also don't realize that at the bottom, everything they teach you is to encourage you to be self defeating.  They want you spending all of your time researching idealogies instead of learning an actual business skill that would enable you to compete; that way they have no competitors.  Even worse, they are encouraging you to opt out of the gene pool by using culture to program you to be gay, trans, or just flat out unattractive to the opposite sex as a Malthusian preventative check on population growth.  Communism, Socialism, Fascism, Capitalism.. its all the same.. the end goal is MONOPOLY.  Total ownership and control of the means of production.  Once monopolies rise to power, it becomes borderline impossible for people to employ themselves;   they must always worship the corporation or pay the price.  To see where the power is, look to who has dominance.  Is the dominant culture leftist, or rightist?  Family businesses are being destroyed on a daily basis.. and relationships are being ruined by promiscuity.  The left IS the right.  It is controlled opposition.  The people who wish to abolish your families intend on keeping theirs, and benefiting them through nepotism.  It wasn't enough for these people to excel at the competition to win at business, they had to cheat and use government to also debilitate their competitors, in order to manufacture subordinates.  I pity those of you who were duped.  As shown in Yuri Bezmenov's Subversion video, in the end you will be shot.  They call you 'useful idiots'.  https://youtu.be/5gnpCqsXE8g  PS  It is a great disappointment to me when cases arise that intelligent homosexuals do not reproduce.  'Alan Turing' types should definitely pass on their genes.  Those of you on the left (at the bottom) are great people.  Your compassion is unrivaled, but it is also your greatest weakness and how you are being manipulated.  The leaders of the left (at the top) are herding you off the buffalo cliff.  Communist/Socialist Million and Billionaires own the majority of all capital in the world.  https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zGDaOj9s4Cw/VYpk5A5bI1I/AAAAAAABDg0/ei-Kkq9BxB8/buffalo-jump-12%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=1600"

"This is the third struggle, Let us crush fascism"
"While Fascists are often racists, being racists doesn't mean your a fascists or visa versa. Well, there's probably a bigger over lap of being racists if your fascists, but it's not necessarily true."
"1:53 IT IS QUITE LITERALLY SURFACE LEVEL"
"I like you. You are a non hating leftist. Thats pretty new to my normie half mislead half agreeing sometimes with both sides filterbubble chaos. You are actually offering info and arguments, instead of blame games and namecalling. Seriously refreshing. I subscribed to you and look forward to seeing more of your content. The nuance and friendly attitude make all the difference. I think the hateful attitude of many leftists and their sometimes extremely small moral scope is turning genuinely good people away from the left. I really hope there will be more people like you in the left with a loving attitude instead of hate and constant moral bashing that has became way to common among leftists and drove me away to center.."
"Was that intro sort of a funny reference to pewdiepie when he did a video and had himself dressed up as a nazi, watching at one of Hitler's speeches and smiling creepily just to try to be edgy? Idk, It was just reminded me of that, because of how strikingly similar your posture was and how you smiled at the TV there. It was funny as fuck lol."

"'Take your claymore in hand and defend Voltaire and blonde children against black civil rights, ya know just like the vikings did.' Haha that line is fucking golden. Plus I own a claymore too so extra points there."
"So a fool who wants for something so much that he/she/it is willing to buy into any load of garbage that supports the acquisition of what he/she/it wants doesn't like fascism. Loves to dole out the authoritarianism, but can't stand when it's nationally oriented. I feel like the brown hordes who hate non-binaries and are just waiting for the chance to dole out some 'righteous' fury aren't going to like the globalist 'community' you want."

"It sounds like a very small minority of largely irrelevant right wing extremist are able to live rent free in your head and have you searching for secret nazis every time you see an image of a blond baby. (This is pretty ironic considering you yourself are blond.) I am atleast glad you are able to admit you are somewhat paranoid but maybe you should consider that your not actually 'woke' but rather a left wing equivelant of Alex Jones."
"But what if someone, you know, legitimately just wants to get rid of rapist?..."
"Contra I don't know how I first ended up here, one day I came across ArmoredSkeptic and was informed of like minded content creators such as Sargon and TL;DR. But instead of going to them I wanted to see who thought poorly of them. And I thoroughly enjoyed the effort you put into each of your videos, content aside just the production is a sight to see. But when I got to this video the first time I thought this was a little too paranoid, and while I sort of understood your concerns I never gave the threat you identified any credibility.  Weeks? Months? Later and I've slowly crawled across the spectrum of youtube, literally jumping from Jeff Holidy to The Alternate Hypothesis and On the Offensive, and then back around to Shaun, Hbomberguy, and even a brief glance in Badmouse's direction. I think I can comfortably say I fully understand where this concern came from. I don't definitively know where I'll end up yet but I can say seeing what everyone has to say, firsthand rather than by hearing from someone else, has been valuable to grasp the bigger picture. Either way, you're definitely a favorite and I look forward to future content from you."

"Even more important than the politics, this video is an outstanding lesson in bad faith actors. One of the profound weaknesses of people who approach issues in good faith is the belief that everyone approaches issues this way. This misconception is a weakness that I see exploited all the time. It's particularly annoying when I see socialists trying to pander to working class whites suffering from 'economic anxiety'. It's like they want people to scrawl 'I am a bigot' in blood across their chests to see the obvious reality in front of them."
"First video I've watched in your channel and I've decided to of binge all of your videos asap. The creativity and information put into this is highly entertaining and educational."
"I don't typically watch political videos because that stuff is dumb but I made an exception with this one. TBH it was pretty boring, but it rocked a lot of memes through out so immma have to drop a like"
"So after watching this video I have learned that: Japan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, India and a never ending list of countries are all fascist."
"ew what a gross tranny lol"
"Excellent video! Love the clear explanations."
"Great video. But the Regressive Left has been guilty of vilifying an entire race, gender, and sexual orientation. White shaming, male shaming, and heterosexual shaming only plays into the hands of the Alt-Right. Diversity becomes divisive when you think it is OK to shun anyone who shares characteristics with the people in power. The male voice does not need to be silenced for the female voice to be heard. Job scarcity and economic insecurity is also a big factor in making people less tolerant of groups fighting for more opportunity. By the way, Trump is the Anti-Christ. Seriously, the man is pure evil and will probably bring about the end of the world."
"Hey, wanna date?"
"I lost a good friend to gamergate. He was a normal, geeky liberal. Now he loved Milo Greek Last Name and Trump.  Gamergate started out as your typical internet drag. Then it morphed into an extreme political movement. My friend made a lot of friends in the community which I first thought was awesome since he didn't have many close people in his life. Then he started parroting whatever they believed, no matter what. Now he's full blown alt right. It's weird watching someone go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole."

"Beautiful video! One of the things the alt right in America does that amuses me is they try to make it sound as if our country is historically white. Have they somehow forgotten all the natives  murdered by white settlers when we came here? In America, if you're white, you or your ancestors were immigrants at some point. Those folks need to learn their own history and accept it."

Whites and our god guns and freedom are all that stand between freedom and a world of oppresion.them replacing us wont make them like us, were outnumbered 10 to 1 it will make us like the rest of the world."
"Your just anti white cause you hang a dress over your dick,  even though 9 out of 10 non white countries would hang you from a rope around your neck until you suffocated.

"This is such a strawman argument. Claiming you know people's true intentions and generalising anyone with ideas from all over the political spectrum into a single group, which you claim to understand. The subtext you claim is false and unsupported by any logical argument. (at least in this video) You do seem well intentioned and funny though."
"Every famous youtube Centrist I know of seems like Right-wingers who don't want to be labled as such, because said people make video after video about 'SJWs' or 'Liberals' or praising/Defending Donald Trump, and not once do I see 'Centrists' Call out rightwing antics. (Sargon)"

Then I slowly got sucked in due to all these manipulative tactics that anti-sjws use. My boyfriend and I can't thank you enough for this video.

"Is the illuminati crypto-facist or crypto-communist? Obviously hollywod is deeply connected to the illuminati, and they're a bunch of communists, which makes me think the illuminati might be as well. On the other hand, the illuminati is also obviosuly connected to the deepstate and the military industrial complex, which is clearly facistic, making me think that the illuminati are facists? Wait! I just had an ephiphany! The illuminati controls both the commies and fash! That's why sargon of akkad is always saying he's a dirty liberal while, at the same time, claiming to be half black and a joining a nazi party! He's clearly a shill for the illuminati, and its showing through because he's always displaying both commie and fashie tendancies! OH MY GOD, I just realized that the illuminati are radical centrists! Holy shit! Spread the word, BD911, don't drink holograms, buy gold! Bye!"

"Generally great points made here, but here's something I'm wondering if you and the likes of Peter Coffin are oblivious to: Those of us who actually believe in free speech (for all people, because that is the only way to believe in it, fucking duh I know) are perfectly aware that the fascists do not share our beliefs, we do not expect reciprocity, it doesn't change how we feel about it and we're only sticking up for other people's rights on principle. Before anyone even starts, this isn't  centrist talking here, maybe not even a liberal, whatever that may still mean. I'm a Marxist."

"16 seconds is all it took for me to get AIDS. God is dead."
"Here is the biggest reason why this video is BS: it equates 'fascism' with 'racism.' One could do that with National Socialism, but not Fascism, which was a pretty nebulous movement.    The Brazilian Fascist Integralism was actually militantly anti-racist, and recruited members from the disenfranchised black Brazilian population. Franco was a fascist, and he did more to save the Jews than the UK, US, and France combined. And Marcus Garvey called himself a fascist at one time.        When you conflate National Socialism with Fascism, you sound just as bad as someone who conflates Communism with Democratic Socialism...well, even more so. National Socialism was a weird phenomenon that was actually at odds with many of the fascist movements of its day, like the one in Austria that Hitler overthrew.     And I am not pro-fascist (I'm a geolibertarian) just pro-integrity."

"This person even signs off with a misty-eyed salute to Soviets. This sick twisted pos loves genocide. These people can never be allowed power again for the sake of humanity!  If the intellectuals in the plays of Chekhov who spent all their time guessing what would happen in  twenty, thirty, or forty years had been told that in forty years interrogation by torture would be  practiced in Russia; that prisoners would have their skulls squeezed within iron rings; that a human  being would be lowered into an acid bath; that they would be trussed up naked to be bitten by ants  and bedbugs; that a ramrod heated over a primus stove would be thrust up their anal canal (the  'secret brand'); that a man's genitals would be slowly crushed beneath the toe of a jackboot; and  that, in the luckiest possible circumstances, prisoners would be tortured by being kept from sleeping  for a week, by thirst, and by being beaten to a bloody pulp, not one of Chekhov's plays would have  gotten to its end because all the heroes would have gone off to insane asylums.   Yes, not only Chekhov's heroes, but what normal Russian at the beginning of the century, including  any member of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, could have believed, would have  tolerated, such a slander against the bright future? What had been acceptable under Tsar Aleksei  Mikhailovich in the seventeenth century, what had already been regarded as barbarism under Peter  the Great, what might have been used against ten or twenty people in all during the time of Biron in  the mid-eighteenth century, what had already become totally impossible under Catherine the Great,  was all being practiced during the flowering of the glorious twentieth century — in a society based on  socialist principles, and at a time when airplanes were flying and the radio and talking films had  already appeared — not by one scoundrel alone in one secret place only, but by tens of thousands of  specially trained human beasts standing over millions of defenseless victims."

"While you probably see this as a balanced take, it's really patronizing to be told that you're only a 'naive centrists' as if my beliefs are secretly being sculpted by the alt-right because I don't know any better. If you really wanted to appeal to centrists, maybe stop saying that their beliefs are just reflections of a genocidal idealogy and aren't really valid. Even if it allows facism to... I don't know, exist? People pick up these talking points and words, not because they're too stupid to realize that they're going down a dark path or some bs, they do it because they AGREE. Can you not realize how toxic it is to demonize an entire viewpoint while still saying that those who agree with it are either facist masterminds or are too stupid to realize that theyre facists? Honestly it's baffling."
"Ah yes, those naive centrists having overlapping beliefs with fascists, how sad! It's not like people support free speech and immigration reform OUTSIDE of the secret fascist agenda. Really, while I get this video, I think it just kicks up fear. This is the exact assumption of conspiracy that encourages centrists to shift to the right when those to the left demonize them for entirely innocent beliefs. You cannot simply oppose reasonable people because you're suspicious of them being Nazis. While this video may not support that idea directly, it definitely adds validity to those who do."
"well maybe white people wouldn't do the things that they do if they were just left alone in Europe and didn't have people constantly bombarding us with s*** and another thing Nazis probably wouldn't have even been made it wouldn't even be an ideology if World War 1 never happened and why did World War 1 happen oh yeah that's right Archduke Ferdinand got shot in the f****** head and then people blamed it on Germans so remember that you don't fuk with an entire nation and expect that Nation to just sit there and take it my Hugo Boss looking way fresher than the Striped Pajamas you're going to be wearing"
"I do co spider myself more of a centrist, but I will concede the biggest difference between the left and the right is that a communist will tell you they’re a communist, and a fascist will not."
"Hmmm... I didn’t know if I’d like this vid when it started, I don’t usually like videos criticizing the behaviors of entire political group, rather than individuals, but the perspective you took against propaganda patterns hooked me. Good point. New subscriber."
"Are you a fascist say no well they you go your a fascist oh if you want to know what a fascist is dont let others educate you because some have they own agenda to push  oh and that docent  make them a fascist just a lair ."
"Well done! (y)  I don't know if responsibilities for the subtitles are on the artist or a service from another entity, but I notice they do not always accurately reflect the actual spoken words."
"You and Shaun are fighting the good fight. I wouldn't hold my breath on the centrists they always lean right."
"So relevant.   We are seeing  these tendencies occur live in our policies."
"This relies on the difficulty of disproving a negative. Someone calls you something and you disagree. And that makes you more guilty? Besides that you have just speculation about their true beliefs? Is there anything more concrete that we can do to figure it out?"
"where's the 'whatever it is you get of to' scene from?"
"I don't have any other issues with this video except that SPLC is completely discredited and facing several lawsuits for slander.  Other than that, use these tools give by this video for good. Just because someone is using the alt-right dog whistles doesn't mean they are alt-right. You have to look into the context."
"HAHA!! Reading from the SJW hand book saying anyone on the right is 'Alt-Right' and a racist POS. All the while forgetting you commie lovers are no better and do the same propaganda shit just like this video. F the 'Alt-Right' and F the 'Alt-Left.'"
"Videos instructing people how to spot actual fascists seem like a good idea that I would support, but watching this makes me think that it might just be too dangerous and divisive. By claiming that the manifestations of a fascist's beliefs are more and more subtle you only widen the group of people that might fit into the label. Not everyone who supports the drug war, a stupid moralistic policy that disproportionately hurts black people, is a secret fascist operative. Many of them are just religious or traditional and find the idea of altering your mind with narcotics abhorrent.  So again, I support what this video attempts to do, I just wish it were more careful about how it goes about it. Accusing non-fascists of being fascists might not get them to start singing Erika (a Nazi marching song) but it will certainly turn them off a opposing fascists or trying to recognize the more extreme people on their side of the political aisle."
"I sense the a heavy influence of the left here. Trying to recapture some of its slaves."
"I used to consider myself a centrist, I am definitely left now. I come from yugoslavia which suffered under faschism, they dont deserve free speach, the only thing a faschist deserves is a beating"
"As someone who would generally consider themselves a centrist/liberal I found this video informative and well made but very patronising at times"
"Hey Contra/Natalie, do you think Lauren Southern is a closet Nazi or white supremacist of sorts? I’ve liked her for the longest time until discovering your channel, now I’m questioning if she is someone to be avoided or not."

"Just found this channel, it's awesome. Insta sub. You are amazing, keep on the good fight!"
"Informative vid."
"Recently left the amazing atheist, Sargon of Akkad, armored skeptic, bearing,  undoomed, and vee Cock.   I remember listening to the amazing atheist when I first started to question my beliefs as a catholic and when I first developed a crush for a man my age. I was horribly confused and felt wrong in my own skin. He made sense and got me to stop being a catholic, homophobe, turn me to believing pro-choice, and other various left leaning stuff that I still hold today.   I never really deeply questioned their anti-sjw videos until I got to thinking like, why are they picking the lowest most broken rotten hanging fruit out there? Because the videos were just getting lazier and lazier, like they googled the first thing that was on their side and rolled with it. Or just go with outdated gut feelings. All of it was starting to fall apart really.   I really don’t know what I want to believe or what’s right but I no longer feel right listening to them. I dunno. Maybe I’ll eventually go back to them or maybe I’ll flip for the better. I just want to be good to myself and others man, and your videos have given me a more clear idea on what I might be looking for."
"As a centrist, I'm real *shook* .  'They have the right to free speech, not a megaphone' hit me a like a brick of tons.  edit: I've created a plague that only keeps growing. Reply to this comment if you're ok with dying a Black Death."

"My only contention with this video was that idiots(fascists) with toxic ideas have to be exposed to reinforce idiots like me that they're idiots. Censoring them appears to only empower rather than diminish( see Milo Y.)and it sucks. I've done my research on these folk (also follow alot of them on twitter/YT) And saw a clear disconnect like what you've shown in this video(determining the fascists to ignorant folk). This vid resonates so much that i'll just be repeating your points in the comments section, so i wont do that and let the viewers watch for themselves. Great video!"
"I found a new channel, thanks! 📦"
"This video actually explains so much. I have been so confused about Sargon, and people like that I liked for anti sjw stuff but they have moved so far right and I'm just like wait I thought Sargon was a liberal? This actually clears a lot of stuff up for me so thank you because I was going down the Sargon alley."
"It isn't conservatives taking away my scholarships for speaking out against my campus for ruining student's lives academically for Facebook posts, and what they say period. It isn't conservatives calling the impoverished great grandaughter of a part black WW2 vet, a half cherokee woman, and a fleeing german jew a rich racist nazi for the apparent color of her skin. It isn't conservatives who make policies running the Sex trafficking capital of the country, my current home, Houston Texas. It isn't conservatives running the ghetto dens of the country for the past 50 years giving empty promises. It isn't conservatives that call one of my black freinds not black enough for working hard to get out of the hood. It isn't the conservatives in my family that have an issue with me being a pot head hippie pagan chick dating an army Colonel twice my age. It isn't conservative media telling the population to hate our country, hate our form of government, and to have race wars instead of pay attention. It isn't conservatives running the state of California driving people out by the hundreds of thousands every year in droves. How to spot a liberal? Their head is the sand."

"I'm a conservative, but by no means am I a part of white nationalism or the 'alt-right'. I value life no matter whose it is, I believe in universal human rights, and I genuinely appreciate   and love to learn about every type of culture around the world. All I want is to start a productive dialogue based on these questions:   1. Do you, personally, believe being pro-American ideals (i.e. the Constitution and Bill of Rights) makes someone a fascist and white nationalist? I'm very curious about why some people link the two.  2. Furthermore, do you personally believe Trump is a fascist and white nationalist, and why?"
"I (((swear))) I'm not a Nazi, I just like to have an exchange of ideas!"

"Apparently the new cryptofash cryptosymbol has dropped and it is 🐻"
"'The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white ethnostate is just nonsense.'  You've got to be kidding. Do you think European culture dropped down from the sky? No, it's the product of white people who lived within white nations that enabled their achievments in the same way that Japanese culture is tied to Japan. Can a thousand whites scattered all throughout a black country really start a space agency? Can their country even have a functioning STEM program in a university for that matter?"

"o hai shaun."
"17:53 Oh hey thanks for the vivid nightmare fuel."
"This video seemed a lot like the Cultural Marxist theroy which is ironically adopted by the alt-right. From what I gathered you were almost conspiratorial with some of the claims. However my biggest issue is how you defined fascism or at least a misunderstanding of the worst part of fascism. I going to try to be careful as I don't want to sound like a alt-right sympathizer but I believe the worst part of fascism is the totalitarianism and the extreme racial intolerance to be more of a scape-goat for the extreme measures. So when critizing a potential fascist we should first look for if they are authoritarian, use white identity politics, or in general anti-individualistic . And second to that should be there oppions regarding race now this is not to say that the racial mistreatment is irrelevant but more along the lines of what the #1 qualifier for a fascist should be."
"Typical cultural-marxist  youtube.com/watch?v=c7as0pFxPYc&t ugly trans, who promotes degeneration."
"22:15 So, Shaun's last name is 'Andjen'? Lol."
"This was a very well done video- entertaining, reasonably argued (I usually just succumb to anger, despair, and grumbling to myself.)  It's easy to tell you're angry, but you don't let your anger get in the way of your logically presented, practical message.  I also appreciate the olive branch and practical advice you extend not only to duped centrists who inadvertently advance the Fascist (and Fash-Lite) agenda, but even to Alt-Right people who want to leave the cults they have been sucked into.  That's great that you mentioned Life After Hate specifically.  These are difficult times but your video makes me feel more optimistic and like people of good conscience can do something.  I subscribed to your channel.  Keep up the awesome work!"
"Your definition of fascism is an absolute joke."
"Funny how the 'alt right2 are talking about conspiracies from the left or people of jewish believe, when they have all those underciver and ilfitration techniques. We should worry about the extreme right conspiracy."
"I loved the videos about the “history of kekistan”. It was so stupid yet hilarious"
"This tranny communist is down right disgusting"
"The amount of long-term planning and manipulation or 'swaying' over the masses the Fascists 'Alt-Right'  has kind of makes me wish those in the left-wing can come up and use similar tactics.  (Not the manipulation or other underhanded tactics the 'Totally Not Fascists'  use but just innovative uses, perhaps to the point of realpolitik limits, to sway and win votes for elections)."
"So basically anyone who touts right-wing talking points are just crypto-fascists and should be considered enemies.   This explains why there are so many antifa that legitimately believe they are fighting Nazis at every. single. rally.  The left absolutely cannot handle nuance. You are so quick to point out the difference between Communism, socialism, and Marxism, when you are accused of being a communist, but cannot wrap your head around the idea that MAYBE there are people who are truly and exclusively Identitarians who only want peaceful race relations.  'Everything is crypto, everything is racist, every white is secretly a supremacist.'   Lmao. This is exactly why the Alt-Right controls the conversation so easily."
"so does that make the  BLM guys fascist?"
"Voltaire was a left leaning political thinker, in his book like Candide he decries and satirizes the brutal and oppressive nature of autocracies , while praising egalitarian ideas such as the equality among all peoples. I can't see the Alt-Right defending that"
"I have no idea if this is a parody or being serious. It just seems like a far-fetched conspiracy theory. Where is the right then?! Please direct me there. What I got from this is that everything from the left is fascist. And all those people are out there to kill you. Anyway, loved the formal.   fuck this means I'm complimenting her to cover up my fascism. And I hate communist for invading my country and killing half of my people.   fuck i'm a nazi I ALSO SALUTE HITLER AS A JOKE  OMG FUCK ME I'M A NAZI AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA now i just need a pug at my side."
"youre talking about white nationalism not fascism"
"You do not get it, do you? You would call me a nazi, and I DO NOT FUCKING CARE what you call me, I will continue my beliefs because I genuinely believe thats the right thing to do, its all a perspective-thing. I dislike you for the point alone that you are a tranny. And nobody can do anything about it. And you are a race-traitor as well, because race is real. Me and thousands and thousands of people think like this. And we strongly believe this is the right worldview, just like all of you leftists believe that you can't be wrong. You cannot change that, everyone thinks he has the moral highground.  Back in time two opposing groups would simply meet on a battlefield and the winner took all. That would solve all of our problems, dear leftwingers and rightwingers.."
"30 seconds in and he (she) is saying fascism is only about race and jews? Lmgao....."
"Shit go's both ways really, all sides have a agenda they think is best and use tactics to push that agenda, right,left,up,down, it's all fucked up now with internet being a somewhat faceless safe place."
"This video frustrates me. I can't think of any of your videos that I don't love, except this one and like one other one.  This video was *the* playbook on how to read the alt-right. You eloquently and concisely outline their strategies and flawed talking points. But then, you essentially advocated for a 'do not engage' stance. Why?! They played the game, lost, flipped the table, then changed the rules. We can still win, even if it is on their terms. If they say 'why can't there be a nation for white people if X country is a nation for Y people', ask them why they would want a 'white nation' in the first place. There is no explanation they can give that doesn't make the look like a racist blowhard. If they say that 'western culture' is dying because of immigrants, ask them how exactly Latino immigrants and their culture are hurting/is antithetical to 'the west'. You beat the alt-right by giving them enough rope to hang themselves with.  When you refuse to debate these people, you aren't denying them a platform. It's quite the opposite. They will make the most seductive, falsehood laden argument they can and we will have offered no response. They will be driven into the hands of /pol/ and the alt-light, and you know what happens next. You can't change everyone, but we have to fight to convince sympathetic moderates to not become unironically fascist.  The thing that hurts me the most is the fact that *you* were the one that made me understand the actual beliefs of feminism and critical theory. I used to be a proud member of the anti-SJW circlejerk, but you convinced me that these things were unreasonable. You didn't call me a nazi or sexist, you didn't refuse to explain your position because you felt it was obvious. You chose to offer an alternate POV and now there is at least one less alt-light bastard on the internet. You have to keep fighting the good fight. They will win, but only if we let them."
"sorry your showing your fascist roots.one of the hallmarks of favism is a complete intolerance for descents view and even the belief that t's okay to assault those who dare to question the sacred belief. you yourself hear are engaging in fascist propaganda.also fascism is not a white thing  fascism is color blind it can be used by anyone. and sorry show me a communist regime that didn't end in depth.. the only way to make communism work is to remove greed from humanity and thats simply never going to happen."
"So how do we destroy fascism by changing the hearts of fascist, and make them into not sh!tty ppl."

"The colorful lights are creepy."
"Is that a man, or a woman? - Whatever person is, that person is trying to promote the idea that Caucasian men do not have the right to organize amongst themselves. - The beratement of the Caucasian male is the topic. - There is a false argument made here. It starts with the incorrect definition of fascism. Then, it labels Caucasian males, today, as fascists, on the basis that they are trying to promote their own people's production,  industry, and expanse. - In order for any group to survive, they must  1. congregate into their own group 2. populate by producing children, and growing a community 3. propagate, through productive industrial production. - All the countries In Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States were formed with this process. They are all maintained through this process. - By the way, here is the correct definition of fascism. Is does not exist in Europe, or the United States, today. -  Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radicalauthoritarian nationalism,[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry and commerce,[3] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. - - Now, we are in the United States.  1. We have an open, and competitive, 2 party system in this country. 2. Industrial production has been continually deregulated, with lessening governmental control in the last 60 years in the United States. 3. Our financial, and business exchanges have been continually deregulated, with less governmental control in the last 60 years, in the United States. - Now, as the Caucasian people in the United States,  1 congregate: organize amongst ourselves 2  populate: grow our communities  3 propogate: grow our industries and financial exchanges, then we will continue to grow."

"You're basing your entire argument off of a post by an anonymous person on a forum. How can you verify they are even truly what they claim to be? On one hand you say if they say 'I'm not a fascist' then they are a fascist. On the other hand you take the word of someone who says they are a fascist to be a fascist. You are basing your definition of Fascism not on historical origins and meaning but on political ideas that may or may not overlap with other groups. This is why the right blows off accusations of Fascism because everyone who wants to cut taxes is, by necessity to your argument, a fascist.  That is called circular reasoning."
"Louis Farakhan and Richard Spencer hate Jews. Suggesting they have the same agenda is absurd.   Anarchists and the Democratic Party both endorse non-binary gender identity. Suggesting they are the same exact thing is fallacy.   You can desire tax cuts and change in immigration laws without being a ethno nationalist.

This whole video keeps making me flash back to like every other Sargon video like the would you kindly reveal from Bioshock."
"i was a republican all my life until 2016, doing my best to fix it from the inside while also fighting far-left liberals from the center.  soon after this video i'm mostly broken from my trump supporting family.  my little brother told me he was alt-right and when i got mad about it my mom called me a free speech suppressing nazi.  the last year and a half have seemed like one long fight over the soul of a country i used to love blindly, and it's not that i'm getting tired it's that i'm getting more vicious.  it would be nice if trump could go away or die or be blasted into space and we could go back to having learned the absolute basics of being a human being like bigotry isn't good"

"1:05 I disagree that fascism has to do with 'the white race' (whatever that is). What about Japan during ww2? What about Chiang Kai Shek? Either group would not gain much traction by going down a white power path."
"So how should society handle conservative leanings that the straight up fascists are trying to use for their goals?   The southerners that I grew up with never saw the confederacy as being something about racism, but rather about resisting government power (whether right or wrong)  I believe most of the hype against a lot of liberal talking points is just that its too new and the public just needs introduced to it. 'Normies' or normal people tend to, and should be, skeptical of new ideas discovering them slowly until finally deciding to accept or reject them. The acceptance part will come easier if the explanation of the new idea (whether actually new or not but new to the individual) is done in kind. Understanding when a person is initially taken aback and slowly shown the points surrounding it.   My assessment is that when someone says 'immigrants will destroy western civilization and rape women' instead of saying 'You racist' As angry as you might get, instead try 'America is a melting pot' Whether is has been or not does not matter as the perception is there and the desire for it is there and 'Maybe they come to us broken, (This is an idea that probably needs some reforming so bare with me.) just remember that white people used to be racist and we changed that culture. We can change them too' Or something to that degree. Whether it is true or not does not matter because it is perceived to be true, and the desire for it is there. Remember that in politics, perception is reality. This may work (with some polishing admittedly) as a sort of political Judo. Let me know what you think if you actually managed to read this text wall XD"
"This is my first video of yours but damn, aren't those boots at the intro fantastic!  At 13:36 you reminded me of a furry that wore ears and a tail to school in football season, basically saying it's school spirit and such.

"Y’all are gonna force me to make a YouTube video about this shit lmao."
"Misrepresentation of the Alt Right will only lead to the escalation of violence. They are, were, and always will be, a reflection of the Social Justice attitudes and relative unrest in modern society. The extreme left ARE the extreme right.   BLM burning down businesses and advocating cop killing and taking over Canadian pride rallies because “there aren’t enough blacks being represented,” these aren’t justifications for the actions of the far right, but rather, an explanation of what is being emulated. People learn from their environment, and then either become or reject their environment, based on how it relates to context and Erickson’s description of identity.   To paraphrase, racial sensationalism (black pride and brown pride and the cultural/racial identity adopted by those groups) has left white people in a vacuum of positive racial identity. Different races “own” various sports, music, dialects, etc. and that’s simply an observation of the current state of Western Culture. That’s where the identitarian tension comes from for the Alt Right. Mystery solved, lmao.   Another important aspect of the emulation lay in tactics.... We, as a nation, just watched the “SJW” variants use violent protest, icons and language, moral paradoxes of cognitive dissonance, etc....   And to everybody’s shock and awe, a generation of Alt Right has risen saying, “Me too.”   The reason why the Alt Right and Far Left hate each other is because they are, for all intensive purposes, a Jungian Shadow of one another. They are the same in regards to culture. They are competing “Leviathan’s” (using the term from Hobbs here) within the same political and cultural ecosystem."

"Why can't I just be white and be proud of that"
"weirdo"
"Good video. Another strategy I've seen discussed and used by white supremacists is to argue with anti-racists online but without the objective of 'winning' the argument; instead, the idea is to stay calm and avoid overtly racist language while provoking the anti-racist into insults and abuse, the theory being that this will make the white supremacist seem like the more reasonable party to any 'normies' that read the argument.  I guess it's all part of the far right appropriating victimhood."

Like, any point they dislike within the ideology is simply 'edgy memes', and the rest is totally fine. It's a modular ideology, where any part can be removed according to one's taste, entirely on the basis of irony. Blows my mind."
"Really well-done video with a lot of insight. I admit I've fallen into some of the discussion traps instead of calling out the fascist ideals behind coded language. Sidenote: That moment at 17:45 where the character takes off the military cap & puts on the MAGA hat gave me nightmares for a day or two."
"I knew a lot of this stuff already but it was very informative. It was very well put together. I love your videos, they are so good at countering ridiculous arguments."
"Mad props for the “Caligula “ clip.."
"I'm a fascist white supremacist.   Do something about it."
"Amazing video.   Also, now I have a lot of questions for some of the people in my life. 🙀"
"Wait wait I've made 'the gullible leftist believe the okay symbol is for racism' I'm not a fascist I just recognized that I was a game I played in Middle School and if i  hold my hand below your waist and you look into the circle, I get to punch you. It's not fascist from my understanding is a meme. Someone who played this game in Middle School got in front of a crowd and was like I'm about to get all of them. Haha"
"But what if all the other people actually do suck?"
"TLDW: Anybody to the right of Bernie sanders is a secret fascist harboring ideas of ethnic cleansing. Top notch stuff you're totally sane and on the level"
"WOW YOU'RE ADORABLE! <3 <3 <3 Love from Russia, comrade, and -- Za zdravie!"
"May I ask what the hell fascism even is anymore? Not that it matters the left is hardly one to talk about the value of free speech since as far as they're concerned the only acceptable speech from whites is: 'I'm sorry for being an innately evil white man (or woman) and oppressing non-whites by simply existing'."
"Don't you think that you are bias against the idea of white or western culture because you would be viewed as a degenerate in it? Your lifestyle precludes you from making objective observations about western history"
"Regarding Trump's hand signs, I don't think it's paranoia to think there's a connection. I just think the connection goes the other way around in that case. What I mean is, it looks to me like the Alt-Right started using hand gestures that Trump used and reappropriated them as their own symbols as a nod to their support for Trump's ideology.  Maybe that's what you were getting at in that clip. So ignore me if this point is redundant."
"When are you idiots going to realize y'all are just as bad as the alt right."
"So is it okay for anti fascists to run around with the hook and sickle on their shirts, In your opinion? . Are you willing to give the left the same treatment when they are parroting basic tenants of communism and left wing totalitarian practices?"
"Discovered your channel today...and now I have to watch every single one of your videos. So educational!"
"How many PhDs does this chick have?!"
"Shadilay!  You really think /pol/ gives a damn about politics?  It's just about trolling and triggering blue haired feminists and special snowflakes."
"When your crypto Bae thinks he is a Vegeta when in fact he just an Oolong"
"very good"
"Human beings will not replace us!"
"I'm rather critical of the Bi-Partisan politics that america is founded upon, and certainly any kind of radicalism; left or right. I've recently gotten into the stratosphere of political and free thinking youtubers, and I just wanted to say that I absolutely love your content. Ironically, the other person i've been fond of has been Jordan Peterson (enjoyed your critiqe on him aswell), who of course leans more towards right wing thinking. Your presentation is wonderful, and your eloquent way of sharing leftist thinking is very much why I enjoy you, much like I enjoy peterson's conservative.  very well considered, open minded, as if you are firmly planted upon your beliefs but not blinded by them. Intelligent person for sure. Definitely one of my favorites out there right now, keep up the good work! (btw you're beautiful)"
"wow. Exceptional good video! Funny, informative and well-produced."
"Man? or woman?   And u don't know what the fuck a facist is u degenerate fuck"
"... Preservation of Western Culture is dogwhisteling to Nazis/White supremacists?  Are you insane?  Having an overarching Identity based on your ethnicity and culture, i.e. being part of a grand narrative is 'defending Voltaire and blonde children from black civil rights'?! I... I would consider myself a centrist, but you seem heavily intent on mischaracterizing people you would not even need to do that to.  You devalue yourself.  Edit: So a Fascist is a Fascist if a leftist decides he is a facist. I mean you basically just took white supremacy, immigration scepticism , Nazism and in-group preference of *one* ethnicity and classified it as 'FASCISM'  I am against mass immigration of Muslims into Europe. I am proud of european Culture and our History. This does not make me racist, a Nazi or a Fascist - And it does not give any fucking Antifa Shit the right to just *decide* what I am now so that they can feel justified in deplatforming me and mine, or beating people that think like me on the street.  You are delusional.  Edit2: WHAT?! The Police are not *DANGEROUS* to Black People. Black communities are UNDER-policed, which leads to mistrust of the Force, leads to people thinking they have to take things into their own hands, leads to people joining Gangs for security, leads to 70-80% of black homicides are done by *other black people*  You are far more articulate than the average public leftist - But you spout the same, borderline racist idiocy they all do. Love the way you frame it though, very enjoyable.^  Edit3: You condemn Nazis. And finish by playing a sowjet anthem. I am amazed. Just. Wow."
"Fascism is left-wing. Any system with a huge dictatorial, redistributionist government that implements violent censorship of opposition and interferes with peoples private lives is left wing, i.e, Nazism, communism, socialism, modern liberalism. What most people describe is a leftist reinvention of fascism."
"Racism is politically neutral unless it violates the non-aggression principle."
""
"On the right wing spectrum I would put conservatives, libertarians and people that believe strongly in civil liberties and the non-aggression principle."
""
"Mussolini was a Marxist and when he transitioned to fascism he was congratulated by Lenin who viewed him as an Ally of the left."
""
"The modern political spectrum was defined by leftists after WW2, the entire progressive movement and modern liberalism would be crushed if more people knew that fascism is actually left-wing."
""
"When the Nazis where making their racial purification laws (Nuremberg Laws) they looked to Americas Jim Crow laws which was entirely enforced by the left-wing democrats ( the KKK was an extension of the democrats). The Democrats and their one drop rule was too racist even for the Nazis."
"On point as always! This is a really clear and useful resource at a time when these strategies are fast conquering public space! Keep up the great work Contra! :)))"
"The ring girl with a maga hat is NOT what i needed at 1 am"
"Props on the HOME song in the credits!"
"Fascists don’t own edgy memes and trolling and Nordic runes!  Fuck them!  Honestly if we could just burn them all alive, that’d be cool."
"The woman on the rally died in part because the antifa protester 'waved off' the perpetrator with a rifle. She was also obese. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz9mKPiDrv4"
"Protofascists are not just naive, I'm afraid. but they can be pesuaded. Good work"
"Pretty sure the 'Nyx' in the Patrons list is Nyx Fears and that makes me happy"
"Haha love that you used the think tank against its self 🎵"
"Wait ... when did the 'OK' sign become a racist?"
"Instant sub here. People like you need more exposure on this platform."
"Let's take on the Nazis. We need to trigger them. No wait don't go away. I'm serious. Make someone angry enough and they tip their hand."
"These are Nazis, not fascists."
"I find it difficult to follow this video when you use words like centrist, but you're really talking about libertarians. And fascist, but you  mean alt right or alternative to the republican party while still being economically right wing (ie ANY crazy fuck with diverging ideas from the GOP). What 4 box grid are you using to describe these people?"
"In some places like South Africa, whites are getting killed off for being white so much in which that many do call it white genocide. If you believe that is right or just backlash or not calling it that does seem reasonable. I know what your talking about, just wanted to say there was that as well."
"Sargon of Akkad is not a centrist. He is sympathetic to things like Brexit and Trump. He has enabled and served as a gateway to the alt-right by using these 'dogwhistles' himself and many of his fans are these dipshits with the Pepe avatars. So from an actual, oldschool centrist: Your views are paranoid and delusional. I would never use words like Western Culture because I know what they stand for. And many on the far-left can get just as tribalist and embrace identity politics and censorious behaviour (perhaps not you, since you allow likes/dislikes and comments) like these monsters on the alt-right do. That's why I consider myself centrist."
"17:53, wow that actually scared me"
"I really like your videos but I thought the point the centralist move to support fascism was a bit generalizing. Could we have some expansion on that point? I also feel that you think the majority of centralists are politically uninformed, why do you think this is the case? (if you think this is the case)"
"It's nice that I've found this video so I can recognise all that's been happening in Hungary"
"Ehh... I haven't decided which one to go for yet. I guess I'll just sit on the fence and agree with both to certain extent. Be the 'superior' and 'rational' centrist"
"I disagree with you about debating facists publicly but overall I think this video is excellent"
"Kotori is a bad example for 'Japanese nymphets' but you're not even wrong so I'll let it slide"
"Perhaps libtard are just  fake leftists?"
"I take issue with your claim that centrists regardlessly side with fascists. For one, 'centrists' tend to be closet partisans or politically oblivious. Like you say later, the oblivious can be caught pushing a fascist talking point and often times the politically oblivious will do this and feel attacked by the far left for criticism of their newly adopted belief. Likewise, history shows that centrists tend to be persecuted by both sides; moderates in Nazi Germany were often sent to camps if they failed to join the Nazi Party, moderate Soviet writers who were anti-communism such as Zamyatin and Bulgakov were censored (or worse if they weren't prominent enough or didn't flee the Soviet Union). Actual centrists tend not to side with the far right or far left, and not out of some commitment to nonpartisanship, but because the language of fascists and antifascists tends to scare away people who aren't already politically entrenched on one side of the aisle. This last part, I admit, is to the fascists' advantage because the subterfuge and innuendo of fascists can seem more convincing than the seemingly paranoid accusations coming from the far left/antifascists."
"17:41 this is one of the most horrifying things ive seen in a while tbh"
"4:43 That's actually a misconception. Most people there aren't millenials (anymore)."
"You end the video by making an ironic joke about being a communist. Per your own logic that means you're flirting with the idea of becoming a communist. Either that or dangerous ironic jokes have other purposes in addition to secretly expressing outrageous opinions, such as poking fun at strawmen that might be made against a position."
"In the end your video does nothing. The more the left attacks white people, the more they will turn to the alt-right, alt-lite, civic nationalists, race-realists or libertarians, it doesn't matter. The overton window is moving to the right again and there's nothing you can do about it."
"Are most countries/cultures in the world facist because they don’t value diversity?"
"Very impressive presentation. Subbed"
"Can you do a video on Stefan Molyneux? Based on this and your JP video, I think you're very intelligent and insightful."
"i hate being a kind centrist that gives people the benefit of the doubt legit this conservative alt media uprising makes politics so confusing and it makes true memeing very difficult just let me MEME IN PEACE"
"@ContraPoints:  This was an excellent video, but I can't help but make a few criticisms.  Primarily, I think it's interesting that you refer to Centrists as being naive or doomed/destined to support Fascists multiple times in your video.  Centrists aren't a monolith, it's a mixture, and the majority of which are a collection of various political positions grounded in Individualism as a basic philosophy of life.  I am one of these Individualists, and as such I have no better orator to point to describe my views than Martin Luther King Jr, himself.  People should be treated as individuals and judged on the content of their character.  As such, I'm about as staunchly anti-Fascist as you can possibly be.  I'm also not naive to their tactics, nor am I in any danger of joining or supporting Nazis anytime soon.  What irks me, as a Centrist, is primarily that the most vocal anti-Fascists like to paint the scenery of the world with too broad of a brush.  Largely because the modern anti-Fascist movement, predominantly Antifa, is grounded in a collectivist philosophy itself of Neo-Marxism.  This makes sense, after-all Antifa began in the 30s as a reaction to rising Fascist sentiments and was predominantly populated by Communists, Anarchists, and other sorts of collectivists.  As an individualist, I cannot in good conscience go out and join in and support the movements and goals of modern anti-Fascism, because it's not so much anti-Fascism as it's anti-Capitalism, anti-Corporation, and generally opposed to systems of power in general.  I point this out to provide some context for another criticism, which is that you fail to mention that many times those on the Left are far too overzealous in their attempts to fight Fascism.  They do paint with too broad a brush, and this has consequences which specifically make their claims in the future suspect.  You mention that no-platforming is a good tactic for suppressing the ways in which Fascists recruit.  Okay, I can believe that.  But I am concerned when I see people like Christina Hoff Summers, Ben Shapiro, and Jonathan Haidt get no-platformed.  I have many things on which I disagree with these people, but the one thing I can't fathom is how anyone could think it's reasonable or logically consistent to claim that a feminist philosophy professor, a yarmulke wearing Jewish political pundit, and a Jewish professor of ethics are Nazis, especially when literally nothing they've said in the speeches being protested remotely aligns with the Alt-Right or the modern Nazi movement.  All in all, I just want to say I support what you're doing trying to pull back the sheet and reveal what's behind the smoke and mirrors of the Alt-Right and modern Nazism.  Anyway, thumbs up from one Centrist who is not naive, but is also not going to become a collectivist anytime soon :)"
"nazi is sooooo 20th century."
"OMG! You are totally fabulous at hilariously cutting through the bs.  You are brilliant!"
"Thx! Spot on"
"Wow, the sheer amount of fascists and white nationalists in these comments is goddamn terrifying."
"I guess white people are gullible and stupid"
"Ok, but isn't a slippery slope to oppose most of these things because they're a stepping stone to something we don't want?  You can't argue against wanting european culture by saying that it leads to ethnic cleansing. Even if it's actual Nazi's pushing for it, the point is to know where you draw the line. I love european culture, but I'd never want to stop anyone else who loves it from coming to my country."
"we don't fuck with alt-right, y'all ain't never been a threat"
"Tfw I’m a libertarian and I think both sides are a threat to my rights and property... I mean antifa shut down Ben Shapiro.. a Jewish conservative.."
"Why can't people just say what they mean, hope others will evaluate their ideas on their merits, and adjust when given thoughtful criticism?  These fucking games are exhausting and destructive."
"This is the first video I watched on this channel and the presentation/humor is very strange the first time.  I'm still not sure if there was some satire or if the whole thing was serious.  Not even totally sure the trans character isn't an act.  But I will say this.  If a fascist is trying to 'infiltrate' us normie conservatives by talking about things we would find acceptable why don't we support these ideas?  And then when he goes a bit too far go 'Nah, bro that part isn't cool'.  Can we not agree with people on some ideas and not others?  Have we been duped and played if we agree with a fascist on anything?  What if agree with a liberal about something?"
"I disagree with the memes point to a degree, I think that it really is just a joke most of the time and it's pretty easy to figure out if they're using a meme ironically or not. At least in my experience with people that use it, including myself."
"well i just use the duck test to figure out wheter someone is a fascist or not."
"The idea that Western culture is inextricable from white people is itself a racist idea. Ben Shapiro says that the idea that only white people are capable of Western civilization is 'white supremacy'. The distinction between the alt-right and the new right is that the new right is about preserving Western civilization but without caring about race, and the alt-right calls the 'new right' cucks for avowedly not caring about race, and then you have people like Ben Shapiro who affirm the Judeo-Christian values of Western civilization and say they 'don't give a damn about the so-called browning of America' (leading to an alt-right backlash against him).  Downvoted for terrible video that massively and conspiratorially confuses terms. There are huge ideological fractures on the right. The Judeo-Christian Western-Civilization values of Ben 'I don't give a damn about the so-called browning of America' Shapiro has _nothing_ to do with race."
"I really love that creepy audio at 17:40, reminds me of Tobacco."
"people often confuse white pride with white supremacy."
"That face at 17:50 will actually give me nightmares holy god"
"Your costuming and set design is amazing"
"See one of those torch flames?  One was forever extinguished when Andrew Dodson committed  suicide March 9.  And I for one think it's a travesty...that he didn't do it sooner LOL."
"there are plenty of fascists who don't care about race i bet. it's not a coincidence classic fascists mirror themselves on Greeks and Romans who cared nothing about so called 'race' not withstanding both fascism and racism are bad, keep the conversation going, you're not going to defeat either ideologie with shunning them. if you fear being convinced by these ideas, have a conversation with yourself"
"You're awesome keep up the good work!"
"I really hope contra's videos spread to more centrist normies. As they say, one third of the people will kill the other third while the last third watches."
"I'm confused. If the alt-reich think the Jews control everything, then who do they think the master race is?"
"Love you  But melon head ain't centrist"

"This video needs to be watch a several times to be memorize, it's that Important."

"Fuck the alt-right, honestly."
"I do love me some pictures of Japanese nymphets"
"as a cis male i gotta say  girl you damn fine"
"shouldve been titled how to recognize a man when he's dressed like a woman"
"Thank you."
"New to ContraPoints, wonder if you guys know PewDiePie's history with the media? He dealt with a bunch of slander after similar displays of nazi clothing/symbols. Wonder if CP ever took shit from the media for this?  White nationalists engaging in obscurantism remindd me of islamists and taqiyya. Guess both have a similar effect as well: Normal people not engaging in this deception will be judged and/or distrusted as well.   That Spencer video was cringy as all hell.  Edit: Wonder where CP is going around 16:40. Anti-fascist strategy is to stop their free speech,  yes, and do you think that's a good idea? It's a good point to remember that the alt-right would not defend freedom of speech if they were in power. But that's still no excuse to silence them. If their ideas and utopian ideals are bullshit, just let them talk, and people will figure that out. I think Antifa and other violent groups are just helping them recruit actually."
"It's shocking how many people don't watch the video, and leave a response where they just use on of the arguments Fritz uses. 'You call EVERYONE a fascist' being the most common."
"You don't seem to be aware that other colors are seriously fascists, talk on that once or at least notice it...I am Who I Am 91% Norseman a.k.a. Viking...I'm more of ...warlord First piss me off I go to war, kill them all eat the wounded and torture the cowards. No politicking...you paint pubs as Nazi's. you're wrong. maybe you're ashamed of being a self hating white tranny I dunno I don't care...I see what you say in a LOT of other ethnicity's"
"Damn girl, you are smart.  Thank you. <3"
"The Roman Empire was a very multicultural state... and for better or worse, they lasted 2000 years."
"The OKAY sign is a a symbol of the Satanists not the racist. Take your illuminati pill already"
"I honestly believe Pepe, kek, the Kekistani flag, the entire thing was about triggering ppl and being being as offensive as possible, hence the Nazi battle flag. Then /pol/ took it for their own and ruined it. ALSO it should be noted that the racist pepe and other extra super offensive pepes were created by /b/ to take pepe back from the normies. But the actual Nazis take it seriously like dumbass normies and because of their numbers have made the entire Kekistan joke into something actually racist. Stupid Nazis ruin everything, can't even show my green pride via Kekistan anymore because of those fucks. THEY RUINED THE JOKE :("
"Do you use the same arguments on black power or other supramacy Groups, I bet you dont."
"Better to recognize a leftist, because the left have all the power in education, media and so on. So you can claim that fascism is the biggest problem, with fascists you mean white right wing. And that it self is quite ironic, because fascism (the founder) was influenced by communism, but maybe we should not go there because your brains usually melts down at that point."
"Contra's kinda hot dressed up as a Nazi..."
"what i dont get about these douche bags is that they go 'our ancestors had an identity' and its like yeah but ALL of those cultures were fuckin psychopaths! We just sorta murdered each other cuz THAT dude was born next to THAT patch of land."
"My favorite thing about this woman's videos is how she uses bigots' own words against them"
"So glad I got out of that shit before I got sucked in. Started with shit like Sargon, and at first I was like 'Hmm, this makes sense, Free Speech is good and all that' and then all of a sudden it's like 'Look at these whiny leftists' and 'muh 2 genders and I'm an apache helicopter' shit, and then it was like 'Hillary MUST NOT win, Trump is better than her' and my apprehension turned into full 'NOPE.avi'."
"Love your channel, I went from 'woke', to 'red pilled' and now I'm not sure where I am cos of you which is great tbh. Can you do video on immigration tho?"
"375/5000 slavery was not a specific value to any particular culture. It was a concession accepted by the human productive system for centuries. It has become unacceptable as well as thousands of atrocities that have already been accepted by mankind. Like cannibalism or other things that humanity understood to be stupid. Conservatism preserves what identifies a nation as such."
"how will the alt right ever recover"
"Been in my recommendations too long. Bout' time I watched it.  Edit: my biggest problem with this video is muddling Fascism with Nazi Fascism. Even if they are both abhorrent, they're not the same thing. The Nazis were concerned with creating an ethnostate, but the founders of this ideology, Mussolini, and Gentile, would never have said such a thing. Saying fascism is bad is fine, but addressing fascism here requires specification. Just call it Nazi Fascism, or Nazism.  However, I think your critique of the alt-right is pretty well thought out, so good on you for that. Reading subtext is important."
"We don't have 'black civil rights'. Instead we have civil rights, because we're not racists. Why are you racist?"
"Then talk to other to discover them and kill them they dont deserve the place they worked to the be out of breath"
"Your definition of facism is totally incorrect it has nothing to do with being white"
"'Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry and commerce, which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe' it's funny how sjw's like this one change the definition to fit their agenda."

"nasdrovia ? Wait, I thought the ring wingers were with the Russians now ?"
"Great video."
"Oof when I keep making these gay fucking comments on retarded YouTube channels to avoid work by creating a pathology that I am somehow an “intellectual” when in reality I just watch too many faggots on the internet talk about nothing while I jerk my intelligence weener til climax"
"Oh SNAP!!' It was on THAT Stupid Cow's channel!!! She was talking some nonsense about how to be a Proper Woman...or something else Equally asinine."
"I just had the Displeasure of dealing with one of these Twatwaffles, talking about how White women, choosing to Not to have kids, while women in the 3rd, 4th & 5th World countries are popping out Babies left & right...was contributing to the 'White Genocide'.....I almost peed myself I was laughing so hard!!! Don't worry, I let him have it as soon as I could compose myself."
"I think I'm in love."
"'white centrists' now that's a new one"
"aw dang, i had hoped that 'Fixing the Alt Right' meant 'fixing' in the 'castration' sense. alas, it's just a group of disgusting racist ideologues worried about their 'brand.'  on that note does anyone want to start a 'FIXING the Alt Right' group with me? i found a castration kit on Amazon but it seems to only have scalpels, surgical blades, and antiseptic. i assume you also need a good braided rope, at the very least."
"Fascists are people who use violence and intimidation to silence all opposing viewpoints.....you know like antifa and college SJW's"
"This is just wrong wrong wrong, white society is worth saving and you cannot delegitimize that effort. Mischaracterizing people who care about their kind as being racists is frankly... racist!"
"Hey contrapoints, I just wanna Say that you look like my light skinned Indian teacher"
"I as a German felt attacked and oppressed when you said 'scheiße'. It implies that all Germans are Nazis and I'm not ok with that.   Jk lol. I'm not a special snowflake who thinks like that."
"I'm a center leftist who, as you put it, 'repeats fascist rhetoric'. I'm not naive about some of the arguments I make also being used to hide fascist sentiment or being aligned with fascist ideas in some way or another, I just don't think they're much of a threat or a widespread problem and I'd rather just confront them where it matters, like on equality, etc. I don't support fascist policies, and I have no problem denouncing racism and discrimination. As long as you're not advocating censorship, I consider you on my side of the free speech issue. Please keep up the nuanced discussion and don't make enemies of us 'naive' centrists. Great content, thank you."
"I love what you said about fascists constantly shifting their terminology. It's one thing that's oddly strange and a little funny about them they claim they're to chafe under and be the alternative to political correctness yet they have enough goddamn names for themselves to give a Berkeley queer studies program pause."
"If you say you aren’t facist: you’re a facist If you make fun of facists: you’re a facist If you’re scuba diving and use the ‘ok symbol’ to let your dive buddy know everything is fine: you’re a facist If you like icecream: you’re a facist  This video is the most insane scare tactic I’ve ever seen."
"you can't dispense any particular talking points just because you think it may fall somewhat in line with what you think are far right talking points. as an example i agree with the lefts opinion that everyone should be treated with the same basic dignity but that doesn't fucking mean i'm just acting as an unwitting mouth-piece for them or agree with the rest of their shit"
"One thing you notice when anyone brings up these truths about the extremes of the RW is that there are many of the more moderate RWers who get angry and desperately try to deny there are ANY extremists on the RW.   They want to try and pin all extremists on the LW, as if RW ideology could never ever become extreme, violent and tyrannical. I wonder if they have to believe this because of the typical binary outlook of the RWer - if anything bad comes from RW ideology that must mean all of it is bad. So they have to deny extremism exists on their side."
"I was young...didn’t have much to do in my spare time when not working and going to school.  One thing I found to kill time was watch videos of the “skeptics” and “centrists”.  People like Sargon, Kraut and Tea, PJW and any others like them.  They truly are the gateway to the far right.  I started talking to some of these far right people...and I realized how dumb they were.  How unbelievably dumb they were.  I started seeing just straight up no hiding it racism all the time and NOBODY was challenging it.  I had realized what kind of online community I was investing my time in and found Contrapoints and Shaun.  Jeez I still can’t believe I ever took those guys seriously.  Honestly they rely on their audience being lazy and naive and that’s exactly what I was at 19-20."
"How the fuck do you be a Britain? 2:43"
"god I used to do the 'ironic crossdressing' thing too lmao"
"I love the movie Caligula!"
"One thing more though.  And understand this critique comes from a newbie at attempting to start up something similar (though attempting a different approach of enlightening a scattered few).  You were remarkably thorough, your technique was entertaining and informative, and if I have only one area of disagreement it would be NOT to invite an Alt-Right (or an Alt Light or a Centrist or whatever) on the show, and here’s why: If you don’t invite a vampire into your house how are you supposed to drive your stake through its heart?  Seriously, you laid out all the weapons and powers an Alt person has and uses.  Why not expose them to their biggest weakness i.e. sunlight.  Even if they’re talented at these bobbings and weavings of rhetoric, you can simply turn a mirror on them and show the audience they cast no reflection.  It seems to me an Alt-righter’s greatest weakness is exposing them for the frauds they are and the beliefs they obviously herald.  We should be pulling the curtains away and allow the sunshine to begin doing what it does best — disinfecting maliciousness.  Correct me if I’m wrong (it being an opinion like the notorious orifice we all have), but I don’t believe I am here.  If you or any of your fans disagree I can handle criticism too.  Just be gentle.  I’m relatively new to discourse here and am not trying to begin the proverbial “flame war”."
"One more thing, I will battle any Nazi or communist until death. You're two socialist movements will never win."
"The alt left are the communist on the left."
"I don't believe the ok sign. I don't think everyone that uses it is a Nazi. And antifa would never come near me. I don't like people in mask."
"I've never heard anyone call themselves an alternative ethno-nationalist, and as an Italian immigrant I'm a little confused as what you are trying to get at. Is it wrong for me to be proud of being Italian-American? Also, can you please explain to me why your perception of a sad life is related to capitalism and what you mean by it breeding a sense of isolation. I am confused by the political unrest that is happening in this great nation, and I would like someone such as yourself or others on this comment board to maybe help me understand things a little better. Sincerely."
"whhhhhaaaaaat are you talking about?"
"Jesus Christ, and people call conservatives conspiracy theorists. You sound like a paranoid lunatic, and hand waving it away as “just what they want you to think” doesn’t make it sound any better. Here’s a tip, if you yourself realize that you sound insane with your rantings about all those secret crypto-fascists and there secret emoji codes, and you can justify that antifa and BLM activists are regularly caught being violent to innocent people who haven’t hurt anyone (like for a famous example the group who showed their “civil rights” activism by kidnapping and torturing a mentally challenged white man), maybe it’s time to take a look in the mirror. What happened to the left that used to be tolerant of people and encourage the melting pot. When did it get switched out for one that assaults people for wearing the wrong hairstyle, that calls for the firing and shaming of even mild critics, that forms mobs to calls for the murder of cops. You and your lackeys are a disgrace to the idea of liberalism, and the idea that your mob thinks it gets to speak on behalf of all women, lgbt people and minorities, and act as the successor to the civil rights movement sickens me."
"Props to Current Affair's Nathan Robinson for turning me on to you. Excellent work. Thank you!"
"Probably the strongest crash-course on Alt Right political strategy I've seen. I'm sharing all day :)"
"As if the paranoid schizophrenics on the far left even needed a push to be more mentally unsound then they are already"
"The far right of the spectrum would be anarchy. Nazism or fascism is basically hybrid of Marxist socio-economic agenda with a racist xenophobic spin (barely that as Marxism in it self is founded around the belief that group identity is paramount and subjugating and disenfranchising a social minority)you can call it alt left if you will.  Leftist policies and agenda along with their positive view on big government usually leads to totalitarian dictator regimes. The racist spin also comes from the left as well remember it wasn't the right wing republicans who fought the abolish of slavery in America but the left leaning democrats. That holds true for segregation and suffrage as well. But some how it's the right that at the blame these days."
"The 'left' has created the alt right and enabled fascists with a suicidal fixation on bitching, identity politics and language censorship, while essentially giving up on positive economic and geopolitical action points. At the same time while monomaniacally focusing attention on race and gender issues, the 'left' has proceeded to actively insult and alienate deplorables. Recognizing these disastrous strategies, elite media actually give them resonance, hence further manipulating discourse to the benefit of neonazis and elites and away from enacting sensible economic policies which would more effectively address race and gender issues than the cryptofascistic identitarian ad-hoc legislation demanded by left activists. These losing strategies alienate the masses and while trying to empower the galaxy of minority identities they actually enable the much more dangerous return to the monolith of majority identitarianism."
"If you follow the left or right... You may as well be a fascist. Both sides are doing it, and it's flawed to think that your side isn't. Fascism is about one thing 'you NEED to believe wear we do, or else'. Also... Would you call yourself a fascist? According to you, if you say no, you're a fascist. So you are basically stupid. Nice try though."
"I love the examples and urging to open lines of communication! Also thank you for making clearer distinctions between freedom of speech and privilege of platform and broadcast. I do think there's another element though to the fascist approach which is that it works to enforce the status quo, so subtle approaches are effective because they are accepted and transmitted by mainstream media. I guess I'm looking for an answer to the obvious question of, if it works, why didn't everyone do it?"
"This is really interesting. As a centerist you've given me a lot to think about. I think you're one of the first leftists who I've seen has acknowleged and understood a lot of the nuances about these issues."
"You look great in a nazi uniform"
"I had that cup when I was 5 and living in Seminole Florida:)"
"You talk an awful lot about what could be called 'classical' fascist behaviour, but what about the core philosophy?  Fascism is about control above all. That philosophy isn't right or left and therefore you CAN have leftist fascists."
"I don't think you've ever meet a fascist there not the most sutble people. But whatever they have to be around every corner of course or you could'nt justify the use of violence on your side."
"NIGGA WHAT THE FUCK THAT 17:54 SHIT SCARED THE FUCK OUT OF ME FUCK YOU ITS 1 AM"
"It's important to be aware of ways you might be being manipulated by fascist people, but be careful,  don't start misdiagnosing fascism. Statements like 'I'm not a fascist, is exactly what a fascist would say'  is fallacious, because someone who isn't a fascist and is being accused would say the same thing.  Rather than trying to recognize people, try to recognize fascist arguments and attack those. Ideas are the source of people, so if you want to destroy fascism attack the idea. Otherwise you'll be fighting an endless supply of people."
"That’s inaccurate, that’s what some (#notall) altrighters believe, fascists had different beliefs, much more focused on economy, anti capitalist, pro labor etc., Mussolini used to be a union leader before he entered big time politics"
"The disco-flashy 'How To Recognize a Fascist' banner was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Great stuff."
"omg you caught the dragon ball reference, can i marry you? lol"
"i undestand the analysis but not the conclusion. specially the part that seemingly condemns everyone who 'helps' the alt right. Just because someone agrees with an 'alt right talking point' doesnt mean that they are indeed fascists or simpathizers. Using the chris ray gun point as an example: just because he sees the dissonance in the way that some cultures are allowed 'racists' attitudes just because they aren't white, doesnt mean that he is helping. and if he is, what should he or anyone do? he shouldnt state his opinion because it could help?, using hyperbole here but its like saying that just because you don't agree with capitalism, i shouldnt use your talking points about capitalism, because im helping the communist takeover. Groups don't own ideas. Thats the whole reason why i hate identity politics, people categorize ideas into different groups or sides. Apparently even the far off communist red army leftists now own LGBT ideals?, or equal treatment of women and races. its fucking stupid. for a huge number of reasons. i mean, dude (using it as a genderless noun), i like capitalism as a system, i hate parts of it, but i agree with the ideals. but apparently that negates the possiblity of me being all for lgbt rights. ideas don't belong to groups. And just because i agree with that, doesnt mean im a lefty or a righty or fuck. i truly dislike emotional or 'hero' arguments, that justify attitudes and ideals just because you are the 'good' side."
"I don't know how I got here but... if I believed whites were persecuted in their own countries in any way (which 'white genocide' implies) the *last thing* I'd do is attempt to establish an ethnostate anywhere, because that would mean all the whites from all the other countries can now be told 'go to *YOUR* country', like Jews are now told with Israel. Establishing an ethnostate is the best way to speed up the alleged white displacement, by encouraging all the oppressive powers of other countries to send their whites to the new state."
"Well shitsky.. I guess I have to watch, like, share, and comment on all of your videos instead of sleeping for the next three days.  This was really good work.  You always do good work (in the four videos i have made it through so far) but this was some next level shit."
"I was pretty pro-gamergate at the time, so I was already rpilled on alt-right stuff. I don't know what changed. Maybe I was un-brainwashed. I don't feel like my opinions or my person has changed, but now I want to take a baseball bat to the side of Richard Spencer's face every time I see a video of him talking. I guess I should say 'thanks.' From the bottom of my heart.  If you (anyone passing by this comment) are the kind of guy/gal who reads 4chan, you're gonna hit a point where you either understand the mechanics of how memes propogate, or you don't. Memes are a weird topic because of their association with internet jokes, but more and more I've realized that you're responsible for the memes you spread. I'm not talking about Pepe, either. Hate is an intellectual virus, and the more you give into it the less 'you' there is. Who's in control? You, or the things you post? One last thing before you go: Let's say we get rid of all the blacks, all the Jews, all the Mexicans and everyone you hate. Alright, we're an ethnostate... and suddenly class lines are redrawn, old racisms adopted. What if you're not white enough?"
"Is this video not akin to McCarthy era red scare propaganda? I can’t help but draw a comparison to “Alt-Right Fascism” from “The Red Menace.” Teaching people paranoia may not be the best course of action for a sustainable republic."
"Fuck me, this blew my mind, good work once again"
"I think the main problem with this video is assuming that facist thought is commonplace in everyday life"
"That's why I stay out of politics, god damn."
"First of all, great video, just on nit picky thing about your use of fascism. Your video equates fascism with white ethno-fascists, when ethno-fascism is not limited by race (ironically) nor is fascism limited to ethnic puritans. Just look at the longest lasting fascist state in Europe, Franco's Spain. It was a clerical fascist state supporting their extreme nationalism with the church rather than ethnic identitarianism. This ideology is present in the apartheid Israeli government as well as the Dominionists movement in the US. These clerical fascist are as much a threat to minorities and 'moral degenerates' as the alt-right and their neo-nazi friends are. It frustrates me to no end that whenever the KKK act up everyone immediately says, 'Ah ha! there's the Fascists!' but when people like Bachmann call for America to become a Christian Theocracy no one calls her out for what she is, a Francoist Fascist!"
"We need to win the argument ."
"I am russian libertarian and idk why this was in my recommended, but i want to make some point. The 'alt-right' is a collective movement which dont like capitalism and want to replace it with some kind of 'socialism for white' , so they are lefties but with different values. And why lefties think that trump and his supporters are racist?) They just want to ban ILLEGAL immigrants(no race matter), not ALL immigrants. You think that everyone who is against immigration is racist, but it is not true. Most of people are against WELFARE for immigrants(which make a lot of sence), not immigration itself."
"Yeah hide dangerous ideas and drive them underground. That will do so much good..."
"But if you take your advice on who is a facist from a third persons point of view without talking to the person in question you have no right to give that label. Just because guilty people denies their crime it doesn't make anyone who wants to seem innocent guilty. In order to be of your concern the person has to at least hold the opinion that force is an acceptable means to his end, or he is not the kind of facist that we know from history at least, just someone who isn't very welcomming and there is a difference. So facist-spotting seems less reliable than actual conversation and listening to establish motives."
"I like how he dog-whistles his commie otherkin at the end of this video.....nice one COMRADE!"
"Why don't you deport all the white people back to Europe? Oh wait, we don't want them here. You USers are crazy."
"Even though we would not agree on alot i have to say i like your videos ^^"
"good and informative vid for the most part, but i don't like this idea that only fascists are isolationist, or anybody to the right-of-center spewing conservative talking points is secretly a fascist. this is why i'm against the idea of 'dog whistles' existing in the first place, at least among the majority.  there's a difference between deductive reasoning/reading subtext and just pure confirmation bias -- it should be noted that this is a tactic constantly pulled by the far-right and white supremacists. i understand that the right-wing is full of fucking retards who couldn't have a real debate to save their own lives, but please don't lump all of us with the alt-right. maybe this isn't what you're doing and i'm just misinterpreting, but this is just the vibe i get from this vid."
"You have perfectly articulated the ideas and problems I had with the alt-right ! Amazing job!"
"It is a very good vid funny thing is this video can also be used for far-left group just as well as the far-right."
"Description of facism is horribly inaccurate (not to mention biased). A simple Google search shows that it has nothing to do with white or Jewish people or even establishing a homeland. The lady in the video is confusing facism with part of the nazi parties political agenda. Any race or class of people can be facist.   Can only assume the source for her information was rational wiki. Can also assume that I'll be called a facist for posting this."
"aaaa thank you for this. I’ve struggled for awhile to articulate how alt right memes are actually dangerous to my younger brother, who thinks they’re hilarious and “just jokes”"
"if you wanted to appeal to the centrists you d only have to stop calling trump a protofashist!"
"And this is why I am so vehemently against the silly concept of 'race(ist) realism' which has become the newest fad in recent months. It really is nothing but good old racism with a new coat of paint in an effort to deny (possible) racism and give themselves an air or legitimacy which more often than not does not go any further than demonizing in particular people of African origin and many non-fascists find this intuitively 'right' even though from a taxonomic, biological and genetic standpoint race is not a very useful term since there is more variance between members inside an ethnic group than between ethnic groups."
"Given contra's opinions on the fascist cause, I will bet Contra despises Israel.  I am sure she opposes the merchant ethnostate.  Lauren Southern is hardly one of us, she is a hair bleaching Jewess."
"They ruined suspenders for me."
"Contrapoints, what about Mussolini? Under your definition of a Fascist, NOT even the original Fascist would qualify! You seem to be playing fast and loose with the facts. If you mean a German Nazi, then say a “Nazi”, not a Fascist!"
"Holy shit finally a YouTube channel that is actually good"
"Why are both political sites such a cluster fuck?"
"My ability to pay attention to you well thought out arguments disappeared when I noticed that your wallpaper looks like an angry clown."
"I was disappointed that after the last comment, the music was not the anthem of the USSR XD, very good video"
"Fascists love fascism until they actually get it."
"Girl, you know how to talk"
"(11:48) While I understand your point, aren't you shifting the conversation to police brutality without answering the question?  One of the problems I see is that some people throw the words 'Nazi/fascist' around really easily and sometimes silence people that in my eyes aren't nazis/fascist (Christina Sommers for example), using questionable tactics (like blocking the door and intimidating anyone who wants to pass or entering and shouting). So that when people call out an actual fascist, I have some distrust in the back of my mind. I also think debating fascist takes away the 'victim of censorship' card and creates the opportunity to show how wrong their ideas are.   While I don't agree with everything, this video is pretty good and gave me some things to think about."
"thank you for this video"
"Fascism cannot be asian?"
"You did a great job! The quality of this video is amazing!"
"A centrist can either be the best or the worst of both sides or a strange combo of both."
"The alt right is garbage, but to think that they are anything more than a few losers is nonsense. Just getting caught up in some memes does not make a fascist. Also, fascism is a spot on the political spectrum that is authoritarian and highly capitalistic. Just being racist or hating some religion isn't fascism, that's more cultural than political. Fascists are basically the right wing version of communists. Richard Spencer pushes fascism, but his racism isn't a part of the fascism, it's a monster all its own. A racist can be a communist or a socialist or a centrist or whatever. Accuracy in what you call others is very important because they can easily brush off things that are at least technically wrong and garner support for having been 'attacked.'"
"If you enjoy Beethoven, you are doing classical music wrong, sorry."
"I can confirm that fascists aren't really using the okay sign very much, but Pepe is still fairly popular."
"Some excellent points made in this video, and so clearly. With great style as well. Good work!"
"Realistically, I understood the Republican dogwhistles and economic policy for what it was. 'Welfare queens' and the dismantling of welfare programs has never been about what they saw as genuinely good economic policy but about hurting minorities. But I never knew Atwater had actually said it bluntly."
"Good video but I think you're missing out on one point. A minority of crazy leftists throw the word fascist around at basically everyone and everything. By doing this they have taken the gravity of the accusation away and are in fact helping the real fascists by doing so, in line with your other viewpoints."
"I love the way you speak about whites like if you weren't white... wait a moment! Are you... (((white)))?"
"You’re a beautiful person"
"This is actual cancer"
"Excellent video"
"Fuck. I think my friend is an alt right noooooooo"
"@contrapoints what that /pol/ak posted looked A LOT like Brazilian Integralism, yea?"
"This video made me moar of a Fascist.  Danke"
"Just a minor nitpick, but I would expect you as someone with a master's in philosophy to know and use the technical economic definition of fascism (the collusion of the state and capitalists), and not the lay definition that you seem to use here in place of something more accurately like maybe 'white nationalism'."
"Fascism isn’t white nationalism but white nationalism is fascist. I know this hard to understand, but try."
"Wrong, Italy was fascist and never had those racialized beliefs written into, that was Germany. Also, Fascism isn’t right wing it actually a little left of center, but extremely authoritarian like communism."
"So three arrows got me to watch your video. I Stand against Fashism and you hit on some good points. But you delivered this horribly. I'm a centrist and you said plenty of things I wholeheartedly disagree with. You're agressive and belitteling. Thank you for your efforts but I'm out."
"As a centurist, why you gotta make  us look bad. I just enjoy memes thats all. I hate facists and commies all the same."
"Yo but straight up your nazi character is really sexy"
"L E B E N S R A U M"
"What the fuck are you even?"
"So wait, debating AGAINST alt-righers isn't okay?  (debating is against after all, otherwise it isn't debating, and yes, Sargon has been disappointing on this front at times).  I personally think it's a valuable arena for people to hear a) both sides of the story, b) the views argued against and c) to encourage the alt-righter to actually show how fucked up their beliefs are.  I think this is especially valuable for fence-sitters to pull the wool from their eyes, and it may even plant the seeds of doubt in some alt-righters' minds.  Otherwise their views are only heard as either a monologue or in an echo-chamber (ALL sides are guilty of echo-chamberism).  I watch and read leftist, centrist and rightist content, in order to get a broader picture, though sadly not everyone does this."
"Love this!"
"I`m a fascist and i don`t believe the three things you mention that the fascist believe. Edit: I don`t believe in a ethnostate (fking races don`t make fking sense)"
"Moron! Fascism is left-wing. Any system with a huge dictatorial government that implements violent censorship of opposition and interferes with peoples lives and free enterprise is left wing, i.e, Nazism, communism, socialism. What people like this describe is a leftist reinvention of fascism.   Fascism is an outgrowth of Marxism, Mussolini was a Marxist and when he transitioned to fascism he was congratulated by Lenin who viewed him as an Ally of the left.   The modern political spectrum was defined by leftists after WW2, the entire progressive movement and modern liberalism would be crushed if more people knew that fascism is actually left-wing.   When the Nazis where making their racial purification laws they looked to Americas Jim Crow laws which was entirely enforced by the left-wing democrats ( the KKK was an extension of the democrats). The Democrats and their one drop rule was too racist even for the Nazis."
"Patrick little has pointed out the people from weesearcher are zionist shills trying to divide the alt right through funding"
"fuck me i actually find these videos entertaining to watch but the type of people that completely infect this side of youtube and the internet are so insincere and lowkey insane it makes it hard to do."
"This shit makes it impossible to defend yourself. So-called fascist:I'm not a fascist  Leftist:that's what a fascist would say!"
"The Weimar Republic redux - you are two sides of the same coin. Interesting that you both use the exact same arguments, 'Oh I know that say this, but they really mean that'. It's fun because you are all programmed for this type of analysis from the humanities, so you have these fun meta wars where reality slips away and you are left with pure spectacle... and your set and lighting mirrors this! Fun."
"This channel's host is a crazy person, right? The likes are from other crazy people, or out of sympathy, aren't they?"
"I just found your channel through one of my friends, and I'm really impressed! Have you though about reaching out to someone with a bit more clout/social media reach? I don't know who it could be, maybe 'Our Revolution' (even if they aren't *that* left-wing)?"
"lmao Spencer and Milo are broke"
"What is this creature?"
"ALT RIGHT gets REKT AND BTFO by EPIC SHEMALE"
"I love love this video and think it’s very important to recognize hidden symbols that are used by fascists. However what is being referred to as fascism in this video is white supremacy and while white supremacy is a fascist ideology but it is not all fascism is, it’s kind of a square rectangle thing. There are plenty of evil fascists who aren’t necessarily white supremacists and who use their own special kinds of speech and symbols completely separate from those of the white supremacist brand."
"The ok sign was literally invented specifically because ppl we're calling everything a hate symbol. It was literally a dare. It's a meme. Christ"
"Idk if that's a girl or not"
"You know a great way to make more facists? Treat non-facists discussing facist memes like facists. Then again this is probably just a crypto-facist talking point right?"
"it's really easy to keep up with these 'cryptic fascist symbols'... just hang out on their forums. it's all out there in the open. no need to get paranoid about it."
"So, let me make sure I have this right. You made a video about how wannabe fascists like Richard Spencer use deception and obfuscation to push their agendas, while spending the entire video trying to poison the well by saying that anything someone says or does in opposition to your ideology is just a fascist ploy, with your primary evidence being an anonymous post on 4chan? Is this satire, or are you actually that malicious?"
"Facisim is the only rational reaction to communism."
"fantastic video, although very disturbing seeing the amount of dislikes and awful comments. thank you for making this tho <3"
"Pepe!"
"That Argento lighting tho"
"on another note though, i live in a very rural town with a massive lack of opportunity. i work at a job with plenty of older guys that are falling into alt-right territory, they’re often 3-6 years older than me and attended some of the area high schools. i can tell that their lack of opportunity is usually what leads them into these environments; as they’re typically lacking any formal education or skills, along with very little social diversity. what are some things to try and drag them out? talking with them seems to turn them defensive, because they’re so distrusting of the news, and usually very anti-science. how do we start pulling people out of the matrix of a full-bodied and all-encompassing conspiracy?"
"wow holy shit... you’re too good at articulating their strategies and exposing their talking points. and you listen to home! you’re going to spearhead a huge wave of leftists that are accurately identifying and pushing back these fuckheads. thank you for this."
"'Your enjoyment of [white culture} is in no way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors or traditions' - Wow, that is an incredibly IGNORANT statement to make! Take a look at the world and take a look at history, please  (3:57)"
"Sweet, I'm not a fascist. Still 'Identitarian', but then, I'm European. I have a valid excuse. Is Lauren Southern a fascist? Quite surprised to see her up there. Brittany Pettibone a fascist?  Wait, you really think this is all fascism... mmm, no. But don't take it from me. Let's see some stuff 'HOPE not hate' did:  https://alternativeright.hopenothate.com/what-is-the-alternative-right  So, I really like it when a radical left outfit does my work for me. Here HNH explains the Identitarians in a way that is, I have to say, quite reasonable and not unique to Europe. Basically, local people actually give a shit about their heritage and don't want to be messed with by outsiders. What a surprise. And hardly fascist.  You are quite right to be paranoid about fascists. I'm paranoid about fascists. I live in France in an area controlled by the National Front, a party that has been working rather hard to be 'traditionalist' under Marine and not 'fascist' as it was under her father. If you're on the left, it might be tempting and low-effort to just throw them together. But that would be making the assumption that movements don't learn and evolve, which they do. Our local mayor is a great guy, he's FN, traditional, pro-local, but no fascist. I'm a foreigner here and I like the strong local identity and the fact that people care about their identity and all that jazz.  From a personal perspective, I'm rather liberal, but also quite ethno-centric. What disturbs me most about actual fascists is the purity spiralling and morality bullshit. Sexuality? Whatever. Drugs? Treat people like they have a problem and maybe need help, not as criminals. If people aren't causing problems leave them alone.  I have some heroes on the Left, but the left has a serious problem with people who are just batshit insane. I used to listen to Yanis Varoufakis a fair bit, he's on the radical left, smart, pragmatic, thinks about real problems and what we might be able to do about them. The left has something to offer when it comes to the future of work and income, economic justice, technology and looking after the planet.  But there are certain things the Left has to drop. The anti-white-cis-male bullshit has to completely stop, like yesterday. White guilt has to stop yesterday. Male guilt has to stop yesterday. Anything to do with guilt has to stop yesterday. It's a cancerous emotion that will lose you support. The whole victimhood culture is toxic and negative energy. If you're not able to make people feel positive, good and worthwhile then forget the whole thing. You might as well pack up and go home.  Give people a reason to feel GREAT about supporting the Left. Now, the American situation is a bit different to over here in Europe, but something I will say about the European Identitarian movement is that it makes people feel valued and worthwhile, they matter, and what they do is appreciated. The left just makes people feel bad, like they're scum. That needs to be turned around. The left needs to sort their shit out pronto and contribute something positive."
"1. Fascism has nothing to do with white people, Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin were both fascists. 2. That's the definition of anti-semitism, not fascism. 3. That's the definition of white nationalism, not fascism. This isn't an honest video, it's an embarrassing try at smearing. This should be flagged as hate speech since you decided to single out white people as the fascist race for some reason."
"'Impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions'  Actually, it is."
"shave."
"The twee visual affectation of the intro almost made me click away, glad I didn’t. Great primer full of clear-cut, easily digestible rhetoric mixed with sly editorializing that effectively sidesteps the expected ‘strident liberal’ cliches.   Subscribing now and looking forward to exploring the back catalogue and future videos."
"This comment section is someone's thesis, up for grabs, what a time to be alive."
"There is a problem with this. In the beginning, she was describing white nationalism, not fascism. Fascism is full state power, anti capitalist, and makes it so that corporations must benefit the nation."
"Your definition of fascist makes it so no other race other than white can be a fascist there for your definition is flawed 10:46 The frog is just a symbol of shit posters 16:38 That is a legitimate defense . 21:48 That was pretty funny because that was the most Bourgeois and marxist thing i’ve ever seen"
"fascism isn't an ideology, its a governmental system: a dictator that have complete power who forcibly suppress opposition and criticism and use violence to maintain his power. It can be black, white, asian, etc, not just white can fall into fascism."
"14:09 Is Sargon of Akkad a centrist .... ?"
"OK sign, pepe and milk are not fascist symbols. The alt-right are not fascists."
"Ethnonationalist arent necessarily fascists"
"If they say that they are not fascists they are not lying. I'm a fascist and Lauren Southern is definitely not a fascist. Real fascists are open with their opinions because proudness is a big part of fascism."
"Critical evaluation. This video is decrypting the alt right so it's fair to apply what fascism is in relation to the alt right, but when you described what fascism is you shouldn't define fascism as something about white people or about western culture. Fascism is about the behavioral beliefs. This is peering into the SJW territory where you take words and construe their definitions to only apply to a certain group of people only. Even if ContraPoints is not oppressive in nature, these talking points enable radicals who act and do the same exact things as fascist in behavior while saying they aren't *insert-buzzword* because it only applies to *insert-group*.  I agree that all of the behavioal charateristics described in the video are accurate, I just see the idea of fascism as a white or western culture thing is the wrong approach. Just like how Contra showed some /pol/ post on how to appeal to the average white person, think of this as the same thing. Don't describe fascism as a white thing, just double down on the bahavioral aspect because behavior is what is what matters."
"As a former National Socialist (Nazi basically), you hit the nail on the head here, codes, subtle hints and symbolism, all true.  Personally for my reasoning for leaving the movement (And politics in general) is that I see it all as pointless, what ideas I've brought to groups would get shot down by overly critical individuals, everyone is a pompous, self righteous fool who thinks their the messiah for their people. So why bother associating with them? They only valued me for what side I picked, not who I was."
"Nicely done. You are super intelligent and cool. These are some important points to remember. Fascism is a poison that we need to eradicate from our culture."
"Many of the tactics you mention that they use are incredibly similar to methods cults use to indoctrinate people... its pretty concerning really."
"Either you are lying Or you are stupid."
"you know you aren't a woman right? your identity is based on a lie conjured by your fucked up faggott brain."
"This guy is so dumb. The tactics he speaks about are overwhelmingly used by the left"
"This person is literally just saying that there are no standards. If someone disagrees with you, you wouldn't be wrong to call them a secret nazi"
"your burning in hell you TransFag"
"I wish everyone in this country could sit down and watch this video. You have decrypted and illustrated brilliantly things that many of us have been noticing but been unable to explain to others. It's so frustrating to see many on the 'left of fascist' majority fall for these alt-right strategies over and over again until you start wondering if people really are on the side they claim to be or if they're just trolls with a hidden agenda. When I see people claiming to be 'progressive' yet all they do is attack antifa and parrot rightwing taking points and start calling people 'whiny SJW's', it really shows how pervasive this fascist movement is and how they can reinvent themselves all over the political spectrum and manipulate those who aren't aware of these strategies. People really need to educate themselves, because this is a pandora's box of evil that these rightwingers are playing with. Anyone with a better than average knowledge of history should be able to recognize the dangers."
"Fantastic work, ContraPoints. Watching your videos helps strengthen my politics in the Alt-Right and consolidates my position."
"Complaints: What Fascists Believe - 1.) No, those are just Nazis. 2.) Again, Nazis. 3.) Once again, Nazis. Fascist believe that a nation / race is more important than the individual, and that a centralized, one-person government led by a dictator. The Nazis are the most common example of Fascism, but they aren't the only example. One could literally point to any heavily nationalistic monarchy and say the same thing. Also, it is not only belonging to European cultures. African, Asian, Middle Eastern, Native American, and a mix of cultures could form a fascist government.  By the way, the Confederate States of America was a Republic, not a fascist state. You state this later in the video, but it still needs to be addressed. They were immoral as all heck, yes, but they weren't fascists.  Also, in response to, Strategy 5: ....It is okay to be white.  In response to Strategy 9: ...You do realize if ethnic cleansing does occur, and it is violent, that all the once sympathizing non-fascist groups will turn on the minority of those people who are actually fascist... right? So, while one can agree on one point, lets say the deportation of illegal immigrants, they can disagree with everything else.  Also, before I get called a Nazi, let me state that the idea of humanity dividing themselves up into skin colors is simply stupid in my eyes. Skin color holds no advantage for anyone, and it is only circumstances that aid a person to a higher position than someone else. So, no, I'm not a Nazi. I'm also not a goat hugger."

"Its Dee Snyder!!  Lol"
"Yeah, i dont like your politics. But i do like your videos production, the logical way you present your ideas and the fact you can tell the difference between centrists/liberals and fascists (so sick of people labeling people like sargon and tj kirk as nazis). Keep up the good work :)"
"The problem is ... we ... those who are white .... have had massive immigration over a short period in an experiment ,. The experiment was started by Pierre Trudeau No one thinks we should racially mix up Israel or Africa or Jamaica . Should we start moving white people into Jamaica ? I mean there is so very little racial diversity in China .... is it time to bring multi cultural experiments in China ? Thing is China India Jamaica is 100 % more or less singular racial cultural in its existence . So it was countries ... conquered by whites who are losing their land and their status of ... overwhelming majority in a singular culture . Britian ruled this land we were all subjects of the Queen the natives driven from us ... were allies of the Queen. We , were alone and alone as Europeans for centuries until ... an experiment was tried. Now we see Europe invaded by asymmetric warfare ... invasion of non Europeans to Europe . So ... if the white population in South Africa as British colonists is wrong How is it right African invaders are in Europe ? The very thing that African hate .... based on race is the same thing that is objected to by Europeans"
"I was down the path of white nationalism and the alt right until I saw this video. Great video"
"'freedom is bad' 'the nation above all else' Didn't the Renaissance, when European culture was at its zenith elevate the individual. Seems hypocritical from an outside looking into the alt-right.  Identity politics is seeming more and more dangerous."

"When Europe and the West is dying, it means the native population is to. When you have a declining Birth rate (Almost every European country) and import hundreds of thousands of foreigners it means the death of it's culture and history. I'm not an Alt-Right member but that's what they seem to be trying to stop. There deaths, I'm not even white but every Race, Culture, and Religion should be spared from extinction."
"So, you appeared to get off by wearing Nazi dominatrix attire; that was to most animation you showed. You are as blind as those who don't see thru the silly Stormfront bullshit.  The biggest difference I see is your group of blind extremists has a lot more public backing as well as a hugely more numerous following.  There IS common ground, unfortunately; the Jews are hated by you both. So brave."

"Don’t you have anything constructive to talk about?"
"I don't think the essence of what you are trying to identify here is connected to labelling specific races as good or bad. I assume essentially the same thing happened when it was the Hutus vs Tutsis In Rwanda. We should be able to recognize it if it shows up again with different labels. You do get to that in the strategies, but all your examples are about the current US fascists."
"Amazing video! Great production and content"
"James Allsup... Is ContraPoints a niece???"
"I agree and find it valuable that drawing attention to Antifa and violent black loves matter protesters is just a distraction from the prospects of what they're fighting. I'm also afraid that these groups will do more harm than good for their cause similar to Malcolm X and the black Islamists. Where they as bad as the KKK and powerful racists? No were they degrading the ideals of nonviolent civil justice protest? I'll let you decide."

"The bit about euphemisms genuinely made me realize that alt-right enthusiasts do this a lot. You gotta call it out as it is. If you follow and abide by the principles of what a fascist is, then you're a fascist. You can call yourself whatever you want, but if you're promoting things like an ethnostate or 'See, I'm a nationalist but-' then you might want to investigate deeper into their rhetoric. I'm pretty glad I found your channel. I don't particularly label myself as liberal, albeit I lean more left. You seem very intelligent and informed."
"According to HuffPo/SJW you are racist because you yourself  is white,  blond hair and blue eyes. Just because you wear dresses but are still a man and white and BLM sees you are white and therefore racist.  SJW sees you as a man, and hate you as the petriatchy."

"2:03 Oh no they brought King Arthur into this. Fuck off with that. :< Though it's possible they just got a sword on a hill thing. Also Rome? Rome... wasn't white??? Do we consider Greek people white? I don't even know... but with Rome being such a hub at the time (Empires do that) I think it's safe to say it wasn't 100% white. Edit: Checked (my history is awful) and yeah during the time of the Roman empire, anyone living in that empire was considered Roman. Even if you discount this, Rome itself wasn't a homogenous culture at all. They adopted new gods or adapted them into their pantheon to better harmonise with the countries they took over."
"I love your channel girl. You’re so rational and make me feel like not everyone in the world is crazy"

"I fucking love your channel!  I wanna be like you when I grow up :3"
"Wrong on all three points actually. A simple reading of Mussolini can give a school kid a better understanding of fascism. you are describing vulgar white Nationalism."
"wrong fascist doesn't mean Europeans are the best or the ' the white race'....... fascist believe in racial laws in ww2 japan was fascist to they believe in that Japanese people were the master race in Asian  they weren't white clearly ..... and ATM there are one or two country in Africa that are fascist... yes in Africa a black fascist country .... the word fascist doesn't mean whites only it can be any race that believes they are higher than others."
"Better dead than red..."
"Wait, is this a dude?  Why is he dressed as a woman?  I'm confused.  Got to about 2 minutes in, and decided I don't want to watch this dude in a dress tell me how evil America is.     Plus, it's just too distracting to listen to him talk.  I'm not a lgbtqfriqcil/e;alkjs df hater, but it's just too distracting.    If you want people to take you seriously, then ditch the colored lights and the trans costumes and just present your case.   fuck."
"I think you're pretty neat. 🖒"
"What a bunch of tripe!"
"Stopped it after 1:30. Your 'definition' is fascism is interely based on your own agenda. Believe it or not, I'm a leftist. I've studied politics and History for the larger part of my life.  This kind of counter propaganda does more harm than good to 'the' cause."
"First they came for the Nazis, and I didn't stand up because I'm not a Nazi. Then they came for me, and there was nobody left to stand up for me."
"You have a very narrow definition of fascism.  Don't get me wrong, what you presented was a common type of white ethnic fascism, but that's only one head of the Hydra.  Fascism qualifies as any ideology or form of government that is totalitarian and nationalistic."

"I love that wallpaper and the lighting of the videos!"
"What an arrogant pile of self-centered bullshit. So of course you and the crowd you are running with are the only ones that can see through the giant coded nazi conspiracy while the rest of the population (especially those with a different political viewpoint) are just too dumb to get it so they need to be saved by the censorship of those that know what's best for them. You can try to hide behind pseudo-intellectual rethoric all you want, but you can hardly disguise the fact that you and the ones you supposedly despise so much are hatched from the same egg."

"I disagree about debating them. Even if you have a big platform you should debate people you disagree with and seek to expose their flawed arguments, and mostly their lack of ethic. You should 'steel man' their arguments and refute them at their core, if possible. And objective win is better than a win by 'people agreeing with you'; not that people agreeing with you is a bad sign, that's not my point, but it excludes the 'oh he just won the argument because people agreed with him and booed me off the stage'."

The totalitarianisms are all the same dog but with different collar.  Deaths caused by:  Hitler: 15 million  Lenin / Stalin / Mao Zedong: 100 million  Idi Amin: 300 thousand  Franco: 150 thousand  And as for the deaths caused by the regimes imposed in Latin America, we do not know very well who to attribute them to, because I think we already know who promoted them ..."

"ContraPoints : YouTube :: Oases : Deserts"
"There's a bizarre use of identity politics in the alt-right. What white person uses the colour of their skin as a key point of their identity? I, and most white people I know, think of ourselves as Americans, Danes, French, Jewish, etc. I don't trust people who pretend camaraderie with me on the basis of skin colour alone."
"First time I’ve thought CP looks remotely feminine although he always looks sweet. I generally agree with this. For a while the alt right was a fairly nebulous entity comprising a substantial majority of young men feeling their way toward an awakening to the vacuity of hard left politics embodied in feminism and critical race and gender theory. The fact that they were called fascist by the hard left is merely confirmation of the aforementioned vacuity of hard left politics. Nevertheless the alt right has now been infiltrated by sufficient numbers of explicit racial identitarians that they no longer are worth including in dialogue as a movement. At least for those with the philosophical consistency to reject identity politics whichever political direction it originates from. Fascists do not include armoured skeptic or Donald Trump. Nor Jordan Peterson just because they are critical of left wing identitarianism."

"Idk if we denied them the platform. Each denial and protest only empowers them. Like the protest their conference at Berkeley, the school were it started the free speech movement is counterproductive. Better to engage and lose on one point in exchange to win 10 other points. Vulnerable people in college should not be a thing; there’s a reason why they got to college. But even there is, at least warn them if the dangers and the dog whistles. Second anti-sjw does not equal alt-right/white supremacy. They do not like the whining and “paranoid”. Admit mistakes where they happen and improve. That will always be better than the alt-right because they will never change. But these actions will prove to centrist and others not with alt-right that you are generally credible and respectful. Don’t and you lose allies. You already lost Cassie; she is not even siding with MRA or white supremacy but also not supporting your cause because of what your side had done to her and lack of listening to some good points from men at MRA. Lastly, please do not jump to conclusions and say we are haters if you are unable to respond to opposition view point. That is probably your greatest strength. Be calm and think about it. Discern and not be on the attack. A hard critique is basically free consulting. Take it and learn on how you can improve the idea and mitigate negative effects, choose to disagree or concede. If not, you will be like Cathy Newman losing to Jordan Peterson on live TV, as she tried to attack him in every moment of the interview.  Edit: I added more things because I seeing your videos more and more, I am seeing the perspective and understandably the paranoid."
"Cry more, soyboys!"
"Excellent. I disagree that Carl Benjamin is a centrist in any world that hasn’t had that darn Overton window shifted severely to the right. Oh sure, he says he’s a ‘classical liberal’ (now another dog whistle for the hard right fellow travellers) and he says he comes from the left. Perhaps by US standards he came from the left, but by European standards he’s always been fairly right wing with a little bit of social liberalism and libertarianism thrown in. Extremes of all stripes tend to go for ‘the ends justify the means’ but as an avowed centrist I’ve noticed this is much more a philosophy of the right. The left’s big  thing is eating it’s own children, a decidedly less successful tactic than a willingness to say or do anything to get what you want. Love the falangist role-play, btw."
"I live in france and im proud of my country people and culture but my god these people are insane who cares if there are more black,arab or white people in the land i love all kinds of people and these idea of a land purely for white people is just insane there is not one country in the world that is pure black pure white or pure whatever the world is just too diffrent and thats beautifull in my opinion"

"How about this?  The Alt Right is a toxic, childish, wannabe tough guy edgelord culture full of a bunch of addicted trolls who have no aspirations in life, no desire to come closer to God or improve their fundamentals in life.  These are a bunch of snobs who spend all day on The_Donald and /pol/ and just post and read memes all day.  They are a negative to any discussion and are a cancer even to the already bad far right wing.  But as bad as the Alt Right is, this authoritarian takeover by those who do not have any value in freedom of speech whatsoever is the real fascism, and this isn't kids playing on message boards pretending to hate Jews and posting memes.  No, what can be called the 'Alt Left,' or perhaps better known as cultural Marxists, believe that all cultures should be treated equally and that there can be no one who holds either a national or ethnic culture above any other, and these people are willing to stomp out any opposition to it.    This authoritarian approach to culture is what sparks the violent group known as Antifa, a disgustingly bad band of thugs who hunt the opposition down and jump them in the same style of the German redshirts.  yes, redshirts, the group people don't seem to mention that fought against the brownshirts, people who were just as violent and ambitious.    So I'll just say this.  I respect all cultures.  I think most cultures have something to add to this world and I am a multiculturalist at heart, but even so there must be some minimal level of assimilation required in society, and freedom of speech means that you have no protection from being offended.  I care about your life, health, and safety.  I don't care if you're offended.    No safe spaces, no trigger warnings, no pronouns, no free speech zones, no banned forms of expression, no laws against hate speech.  This is the United States, not Sweden.  If you want any of those things, move to Sweden."

"I’m just not buying it that you’re entirely resistant to the charms of the Alt Right. Way too much energy expended, almost like an OBSESSION 🤩"
"I think the dangerous part is that underage people are so easily manipulated into the alt-right. It starts with “anti-sjw” channels, but if you never challenge your believes you will just follow that for a long time. And also i think that anti-sjw channels sometimes explain things so much easier than it actually is ,like for example, they usually talk about stupid one off stories that are easy to follow. No offence to you Contra, but i need to make a bit more effort to absolutely understand what you are saying (and im happy to make that effort)  I dont know its just something that popped into my mind"

"Your definition of fascism reduces it down to nothing more than racism.  Fascism was a lot more than that.    Stanley G. Payne, considered to be an expert on Fascism wrote: “Any definition of common characteristics of fascist movements must be used with great care, for fascist movements differed from each other as significantly as the held notable new features in common.”  Payne takes great care to layout just how difficult defining a word like Fascism is in his book “Fascism Comparison and Definition”.  While issues of race and scientific Darwinism were a part of it so was the fact that “fascists were in general more interested in changing class and status relationships in society, and in using more radical forms of authoritarianism to achieve that goal”, which sounds a heck of a lot like modern progressives on college campuses, or in common vernacular: SJWs.  In fact, Payne suggests that the various authoritarian movements on the right (including fascism) was a response to the “intellectual and theoretical triumph of liberalism” (note the lower-case ‘L’).  Progressivism (again the SJWs and the like) is also a response the liberalism (small-L).  The irony, however, of those who hurl the word “fascist” around with such alacrity being ideological bedfellows with their chosen insult du jour, is totally lost on them."

Please keep up the good work. Expose these charlatans."
"The sad but true fact is by their own actions the radical left is seen by most people as they principle threat to liberal democratic values.   We have seen too much of libertarians and right wingers like Christina Hoff Somers and Jordan Peterson being violently shut down after being labelled as fascists. It is the leftists who will feel the wrath of the population long before the 'fascists' do. Do a better job at identifying fascists in the first place and you might persuade people. Try understanding politics before throwing dangerous labels out there"

"So every position in between the hard left and hard right is just nothing? All the positions you mention that the 'fascists' larp w/ are no more than cloaks for fascists? There's no such thing as every incremental notch along the right wing? This is wrought w a fear of fascists allowing a dismissal of ideas based on potential guilt by association You allow centrists their own thing kinda, though you make it clear they're basically nothing.

I also think people running around with their hair on fire because some alt right nut case wants to talk at a college also plays into the fascist propaganda. Let them speak and have a talk afterwards in the same hall discrediting their talking points. That takes organizing and does not invoke the emotional content college kids crave. Be very careful underestimating the importance of free speech. See Norman Finklsteins classes on the topic. (You tube search) I think you would like them. Good video just sharing my thoughts."

"Great video, goy"
"I'm a fascist. No, I don't believe in creating a white ethno-state. I believe that each race is gifted with certain qualities that make them better at some things than other races. I believe that there is a clear and necessary difference between men and women, both mentally and physically. What you are describing is not Fascism, it's some twisted, deformed version of Nazism, and, contrary to popular belief, Nazis aren't Fascists. Nazism is a completely different political standpoint. Does it have Fascist qualities? Yes. The qualities these two ideologies share are limited to traditional family values, an isolated economic system (that is, to minimize or get rid of foreign trade), a necessity for a large and powerful military force, the necessity for a dictator, and the importance of your own people over the importance of others. Fascism does not teach prejudice towards races that aren't white, it only acknowledges the differences between races. Fascists also don't believe that men are superior to women. In fact, in my opinion, it could be said that women are a country's most valuable resource. Well, that and children. They are, after all, the only ones capable of growing a human person inside of themselves. This is one of the reasons that women can't be allowed to partake in deadly combat. This reinforces the idea that women's primary job is to be homemakers and educators, while it is the job of men to be defenders, providers, and disciplinarians. Fascists also believe that democracy is something of a far gone sentiment. I guess the short and sweet version of putting it is: Fascism is the belief in Volk, Family, The Nation-state, and God. And if you believe I'm pulling shit out of my ass, I implore you to read 'The Doctrine of Fascism' by Giovanni Gentile and Benito Mussolini. If you read all of this, thank you :^)"

God damn I hate the alt-right, but I think that you are talking about arguing disingenuously.  I just don't know how you can have free speech but think about all this shit.  Also- talking about centrists like a centrist is an idiot is... umm... infuriating.  I'm a liberal, but I'm really trying to be fair here."
"The alt-right makes my blood boil as much as anyone. Nevertheless, I disagree with the video because you defined 'fascism' too narrowly. Arguably, you even misapplied the term altogether, although I admit the most oft-spoken kinds of bigotry usually do accompany fascism (racist, anti-Semitic, homophobia, misogyny). One bigotry that seems definitively fascist is contempt for weakness (by that society's definition). It sees the world in simplistic Social Darwinian terms of kill-or-be-killed - often applying this to international relations. Thus, it does entail disdain for the weak, the uncompetitive, and anything else that is easily construed as such. Granted, this ultimately does lead to racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, misogyny; but these aren't necessary elements of it. Contempt for the 'weak', 'weird', 'odd', 'defective', 'stupid', etc., and calling for steps to eliminate, isolate, or exploit them seems plenty sufficient to qualify one as a fascist."

"I am a leftist and the biggest problem I have with leftists these days is the fact that leftists in power of influence will always defend these Alt right bastards because apparently 'we need to defend freedom of speech' to the point where the BS,hate speech,hate mongering and lies and fake news these Alt right bastards spew seems legit because no good leftists influential YouTuber will debunk these dogs . But these peoples will never defend the right of eg a Muslim/Christian to spew their hate speech. Shame on dogs like Philip DeFranco defending Lauren southern"
"I would have enjoyed your video more if you had shaved."
"I mean the ideas here are good and interesting, but... you called Lauren Southern and James Alsup fascists. Even using your twisted definition of the word, it’s a huge stretch to consider then anything close to fascists."
"I love conspiracy videos.  Anyone here like Zeitgeist?"
"Kill all commies, got it"
"oh nice generative reasoning. You would have been an effective racist during the 1950s."
"Undoubtedly, some fascists will meet the three qualifications you set out. However, it seems like some fascists are excluded by this definition. Fascism isn't exclusive to white supremiscists.   If you want to talk about white supremacists, as it seems you do, then they should be labeled as such. Fascism includes a strong degree of authoritarianism and militarism and the desire for the state to be the great tribal leader a la Musolini, Hitler, Putin, Saddam Husein, Hirohito's Japan.  White supremacists have various motivations: seeking to establish self pride through group accomplishments, xenophobia, etc. So although some white supremacists are fascists, not all of them are, and likewise, not all fascists are white supremacists. *I picture a venn-diagram*"

"Good video, I agreed with a lot of your points and took issue with others. I took exception to your definition fascism, what you were describing is perhaps better termed as nazism, the definition of fascism being as follows:     Fascism: a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition  Either way, fascism and nazism is a bad idea that should be disavowed   I find that you make unsubstantiated and uncharitable assumptions about 'centrists' as you call them, about their reasons to join or not to join a side. It's not that they are necessarily in between two ideologies, but that they don't like either.  I also took exception to your arguments against free speech. While it is true that allowing nazis to speak allows others to listen to them, it also allows others to argue against them. They might not care for liberal values, but that does not mean that we should not remain true to them, plus,(The whole He who Fights Monsters fable) it's probably better if the public can see the absurdity of their ideas anyway.      As for the people you label as centrists' concerns over Antifa's use of violence, I believe that the concern does not stem from the fact that they are afraid of having violence committed against them, but rather the fact that it is, illiberal, in a sense fascist, and counterproductive in the long run. Illiberal and fascist because of the shutting down of political opponents, and counterproductive because by attacking nazis (as opposed to defending themselves from attacks perpetrated by nazis) they are inadvertently making them more sympathetic to the public, thus feeding into their victim narrative and as your video so eloquently illustrated that's a very bad position for those who oppose both nazis and fascists.  I know that if you read this comment you probably won't respond to it (because this video is a year old, and responding to comment s on Youtube is not a priority, not because you're a leftist and I happen to disagree with you)  but if you've at least read this far i hope that i have been able to give you a better perspective on a different position"

"I’m sorry, but as an italian, your definition of “fascism” is just baffling. You didn’t describe fascism, you described the alt-right. You described some aspects of fascism in europe, but  fundamentally missed out the core tenets that make fascism fascism. Your description is just antisemitic white nationalism... it’s not fascism. It might be what US style neonazis believe, but it ain’t “fascism” on the face of the term. It’s not what Mussolini advocated way back in 1922. Just based on that... I mean... you’re not identifying fascists if you redefine  fascism to argue your point -_-"
"What you are describing is not Fascism but National Socialism. That's like mixing up a Social Democrat with an Anarco-Comunist. Yes, they might agree on some things, but they are not the same."
"No you’re wrong about Fascists. Fascism is authoritarian (anti-democracy) nationalism. Nationalism is the belief that ones own ethic group or culture is better. You can be black and fascist, if you are nationalistic about your race. It also promotes things like Autarky, which was making you country more self-reliant (ie using the Haber Process). Nazism is a branch of fascism, fascism is not nazism."

"Ok, I have good feeling no one will even look at this but I'm gonna say it anyway. As a history nut that has done research on the foundation and developments both Nazism 'National Socialism' and Fascism, that these are two slightly similar but different ideologies. Firstly, Mussolini did not believe in a Racial Theory of any kind, and stated very openly in his writings (unlike Hitler on the other hand) that he wanted to spread his ideology of Fascism to all peoples of all races. You can find this written in his book 'The Doctrine of Fascism' in the first chapter in point 9. Democracy, where he talks about Fascism going on not as a Race or Geological defined place but simply as an idea. Its also good to note that Jewish Fascists were some of Mussolini's closes allies and even admirers. Ettore Ovassa was a Journalist whom was close friends of Mussolini after the Fascist take over of Italy, but I think I have made my point on at least the ideological differences here with Fascism.  But on the other hand with Nazism (A term actually given to the party by Joseph Stalin by the way), where Hitler was very open about his antisemitic view points. Hitler did not hide it, he had no need to hide it. Many people were willing to use the Jews as a scape goat and oppress them. Long story short. So there is that when you are trying to use Nazi and Fascist as if they are the same thing. If you want to question me further, maybe on why the Soviets called Hitlers men fascists rather then Nazis like everyone else, well you can look at the Soviet political infrastructure between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party and you can see why advertising a war on German Socialists would have been upsetting and dividing between the soviet infrastructure.   However on to the next bit, your video does start off on a high note I agree, that video was definitely something pointing something, but considering you don't let us actually see it to the end and just kinda put in 'fascism' as the answer at the end, and don't even give a link to the original video, makes me think your paranoia is getting to you again and you are just jumping the gun. Also you slip slavery in there as if that is strictly a white guys crime, you started bringing race into this not me, but again history lesson; Even before colonials went into Africa Africans were practicing the slave trade on one and another, many of whom were sold in just trade, or captured in wars and then used as servants for the rest of their lives. Native Americans did the same thing, history classes won't teach you this but as they Natives walked on the trail of tears they also brought their slaves with them, and when they would raid caravans out in the wilderness they would take the woman as slaves or wives. The Great Wall of China was also built on slave trade as well, essentially everyone did it because it was a cheap way to get workers and servants, so there is my case if you really want to bring up slavery.  Your next argument your bring up is a 4chan post, which I think to be frank is moronic, you can't even say for a fact that the post wasn't just an elaborate troll or an edgy post. So I won't even touch that because you have nothing to validate that as actually being alt-right, let alone a Nazi. Honestly its not hard to see that there are many elements of the alt-right that are Nazi like, because they aren't secretive about it and they are very overt about it. I remember watching one video about a guy basically going on saying 'See Europe, built by all white dudes. go white people' I paraphrased that of course, but the thing is many of them today and right now are not very subvert with their views, many if not most are very open.  The fact is when you say 'If they act, talk, and relate with 'fascists' then they must be' is very subjective because you don't seem to have a very solid grasp on what that is, especially when you base all of your arguments on potential subvert agendas that may or may not exist just sounds like the makings of potential witch hunts. Using what you said 'I'm not a Fascist is exactly what a Fascist would say' is basically McCarthyism and is the same logic Christians used to persecute countless innocent men and woman for witchcraft, or 'communists' during the Red Scare, until how ironically someone remembered that we have the 1st amendment and the right to belief and religion, which is why we don't deport Communists anymore.     Next you use different terminology, which this I can partially agree, but I think a quick google check and some observation eliminates that pretty quickly, as for criminals, rapists and terrorists. Well I'm not going to argue the statistics, I can if you really want to but not here initially, but again, ask me if you really want to.   the next bit with the terminology with the 'Nazi party hasn't existed since 1945', I can agree I have had people play the terminology game like that pointlessly, however the next part about people wanting a homeland all of their own is an argument I have never heard and again sounds pretty overt.  This next bit with the Runes and the Iron Cross and the Emojis I am just again, going to sum up to your paranoia, because for one logistically there would have to be a way to communicate and say 'Hey, new symbol of the month is X, Y and Z.' Which almost sounds like you are trying to promote a Fascist conspiracy theory, especially when you say that 'they must constantly change so normies don't catch on' just adds fuel to your delusion because this allows your mind to look at just about anything involving a white person that you feel has different beliefs than you is a 'Nazi.' Your next sentiment is rather pointless at this point as you say 'You should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair or because of the Emoji they use' when your entire view on everything you've been talking about to this point is all based on assumptions, that because this person is a Nazi, all of these peoples are Nazis, and because they use X, Y and Z emojis or hand symbols, or meme or this or that, they are a Nazi, there for if people use any of these singularly or in combination then they are possibly Nazis, and then the cycle continues.  Also again, you bring a race issue up into this for no reason but just to squeeze another subject into this, but to cover it, Black people have a different and more legitimate reason to fear cops then other people to fear a tiny minority mindset of supposed Nazis.  You then go on to talk about that just because everyone else doesn't have as precise of an eye for 'Fascists', that they through the label on the wrong people, and that somehow on your highhorse you are a true and real 'Fascist' Hunter. Also more than just people with 'wrong political views' have been subject to youtube censorship, its people who just talk about God in some respect to, or even the subject of the double standard that is around. Censorship has been going on at the federal level for a while, and when the internet came along people were hoping that it wouldn't effect, however recently this has been proven to not be the case. So to label a fear of censorship as purely a Nazi tactic to summon comrades into the 'Fascist movement' I guess is what you would call it, is again just you being paranoid.   As for the memes 'being hard to tell the difference' between people subvertly hiding their ideology behind Irony when people really do it, and saying that is the point, because its hard to tell, again is just paranoia, and just because you gave a personal example of a single scenario, this doesn't mean it is the case for people posting edgy memes. Again you are making an assumption based on paranoia on a witch hunt for 'fascists'.  Your next comment labeling the Kekistan flag as a 'Nazi Battle Flag' just shows your ignorance as well. Sideways cross design goes back as early as the First Reich of Germany, and farther back into Prussia. The early Inspiration for the design came from the Teutons, but in the mid 19th century after the Unification of Germany into the German Empire, now the First Reich (First Kingdom) they had to do a redesign of their flag. The final design for The Imperial War Flag (what its really called)  was made in 1867 https://undevicesimus.deviantart.com/art/German-Empire-Grunge-War-Flag-395149834  So no, Its a German flag design, and many other countries have similar variations of different designs or had at one point. So calling it strictly a 'Nazi flag' is misleading. Also the fact you show the Kekistan flag in that one picture, but censor the Nazi one in the next seems like you are subvertly trying to be misleading under the pretense of trying not to show offensive material (see how I used your own Nazi hunting tact on you just there for a second)   The next bit with the term 'Alt-left' being made up and is just a term to distract and grow sympathy for the alt-right again take this argument in the reverse and can simply say your attempts to say 'There is no leftist equivalent to an alt-right' belittles the violence the left does partake in, making their violent actions seem not as extreme, because there is no extreme left, only extreme right, there for it is ok for me to be very far left because there is alt-right equivalent to the left, therefore I am not alt-left.  So you bring up immigration now, I'm probably gonna sound just like you expect but here it goes anyway. The reason most countries have an immigration policy and not just an open door one is because they want to know who and what is coming over, and why certain countries are more picky then others. Immigration these days is not like in the days of Elise and Angel island, back then people who came here came to America to be Americans and share in a common political and social ideology such as Free Speech, freedom of religion, and self preservation, things other countries did not have as many were still monarchs or very crudely \|/"

"You don't understand fascism. In response to your 'core beliefs' 1. Fascism is not distinctly european and as such that point is null and void. 2. Not true, many fascist groups did not hold anti semetic beliefs. Mussolini himself and his PNF (national fascist party) was not anti semetic and the manifesto of race was a purely political decision to strengthen ties with germany. Many other fascist parties lacked anti semetic beliefs after all, the main reason the monteaux fascist conference of 1934 failed was because some parties were anti semetic and some weren't. 3. Finally, fascism was always based on national identity (ethnic identity) what I mean is an italian identity a german identity etc. Fascists believe in Italy for the italians not creating a new white state. You're using modern neo nazi/white supremacist talking points to try and define fascism. Most fascists today accurately recognize the fact that there is not real fascist movement in the present day. And really not one mention of corporatism? Ever wonder why fascism got votes? Because of corporatism that was a core tenet of the beleif yet no mention in this revisionist's definition. Oh yeah that's a modern piece of alt right propaganda not fascist propaganda. Not sure if you were saying fascism was in favour of slavery or not but if you were saying that: they were not in favour of slavery. Fascism distinctly believed that a people should determine what they did. E.X. africans decide what africans do. This clearly would not be slavery. Plus litterally no fascist party had as it's policy: reintroduce slavery. Most of the people you claim are fascists are just anti immigration right wong populists. Not fascists. Preserving western culture is not the same as a white ethno state."

I was one of the people outraged by the media apparently calling him a nazi over what seemed like relatively innocuous edgy jokes. But I felt that he actually did shift to the right *after* the controversy (his gender wage gap video, etc.). His comments were a cesspool of alt-righters for a long time, 4chan and T_D saw were fucking ecstatic about him apparently showing alliance with them and they flooded him with support.  I think his views are far from aligned with the alt-right, but he's made lots and lots of comments and expressed lots of views that mirror those of the alt-right  I think he helped shift the 'overton window' to the right, and the first controversy around him definitely made me mistrust 'the media'"
"I feel the term Alt-Right is one of the greatest misdirections of all. It is just far right or right (as in not centre right). They get away with being a splinter group that doesn't reflect on their majority then don't do the same for their enemies. No talk of alt-Islam after a lone wolf attack by a nonrepresentational religious nutter...."
"'They should be given a right to free speech, but not a megaphone... some people's lives are existentially threatened by idea'. Yes, idea's can be existentially threatening to people, but taking away someone's megaphone brings SYMPATHY to those who are trying to speak, as does crowds shouting people down, and of course engaging in violence (Antifa). The best tactic to stop fascists isn't in trying to shut them down from speaking or shouting at them. The best strategy is to let them speak to the birds and the wind. Force them to encounter their irrelevancy. Also keep in mind that when people scream at fascists, insult them, take away their mike, etc. you are further entrenching them. Always keep in mind that there are members of these groups who are salvageable, people who will eventually wake up and leave. But if people treat them like shit and try and take away their right to speak you may wind up inadvertently preventing some of these people from abandoning their shitty beliefs."
"I'm 8 minutes in and the fact that you showed a bunch of pictures of Lauren Southern while talking about Fascists is disingenuous and is not helping your supposed cause of actually combating fascism. I'm don't really care about Lauren Southern one way or another but there is no good evidence that she is a fascist."
"Haven't even watched 5 minutes into the video and I am already angry about western culture being dismissed as a 'code' for white people. Western culture is not a dogwhistle for alt right, and if you spent more than 10 minutes researching what they believe in, you would see that they are committed to destroying everything it stands for. They want to get rid of democracy, liberty and violate the basic human rights, all of which are western ideals, in favor of collective and identity.   Alt right is a 'white' entry into the cancerous oppression olympics that the left has created. Both claim that you have to choose a side and join them. Nope, screw that. I don't play your tribal games and I will treat people on the individual basis, not based on any inherent characteristics. You don't deserve my respect, attention or special treatment because of the way you were born, you deserve it by doing something useful and making our world a little bit better. You personally, not any group you may belong to.   Whiny losers who complain that 'affirmative action/immigrants took my job' or 'women are getting paid less', 'employers have bias against my skin color', etc should not seek excuses or scapegoats who are to blame for their failures and become better, more productive people instead. That is the only way to success, pity only gets you so far. Don't complain about stereotypes and biases that others may have, become great and disprove them!"

Limited government is in everyone's best interest. Your agenda if you achieve it will end up being used against the ones that applied it eventually. Stalin was a socialist,  he murdered his own officers after gaining power. 20 million of them for example.  Every major socialist society has done this in the 20 th. Century . They go after their own to establish power as a definite as a exsample to others for compliance.  But typically in the end there are no founders left of the perpetuating power onset .  Fight against Fascism is a cover to hide something more nafarious looming . Look at history in the world of the self proclaimed socialist.

This whole video is a accumulation of convenient scewed definitions to categorize everyone not on the far left a fascist or a puppet/enabler/associate of fascists. The whole argument is based on a arbitrary definition of fascism and on a post on 4chan. Then comes some Alex Jones conspiracy level investigation where one instance of an individual being deceptive gets projected onto everyone for who it's convenient to project that onto. Then the fallacies just continue. The alt-right, aka white identitarians, aka white supremacy is not nearly as big as you make it out to be.   Yes, it would make you taking a stance against them even braver if they'd as big as they are, but they aren't. It's rather pathetic that you desperately try to make them appear bigger by throwing good and honest people under the bus, just to appear braver.  You sound like someone who does not actually talk with real people in the real world. You just observe people on the internet and assume that they are a legitimate representation of the real world. Guess what?! They're not."
"+ContraPoints  I have to correct you here, Fascism and racism is not necessarily mutually inseparable. Fascism is actually much more simple than the first three points; all fascism is is a union between the state and big business. Its very simplicity is one of the reasons its so misunderstood and misidentified.The word 'fascism' is derived from the latin word 'fasces' which was a symbol of Imperial Rome and latin for 'union'. At its heart, it is fundamentally anti communist and its purpose is to unite classes at the cost of class awareness and workers organisation. All other considerations are secondary. Many fascist movements both historically and contemporary lack the racist views of the national socialists. For example Mussolini would grant Italian citizenship to their non white, Ethiopian colonial subjects who 'embraced' Italian culture and values. Italy only embraced the racist stuff later when they needed an alliance with Nazi Germany and Hitler imposed it as a condition, much to the protests of one of Mussolinis Jewish lieutenants."
"why is a transdressed man explaining to me what fascism is"
"*Anyone who isn't an SJW is a Nazi*"
"This is some Communist bullshit"
"Thank you for this useful guide."
"Na zdravlje, comrade!!"
"When saying fascim, do you mean 'modern' fascim ? Because I don't think the japanese wanted to establish a white ethnostate."
"Lovely wallpaper"
"Thats awesome"
"I can't believe I only just now discovered your videos. It's rare that I get to find a part of the community I love and love being a part of that really goes into this much depth about these kinds of topics, and just from looking at the related videos, I feel like I'm going to find a lot more to love. Already can't wait to see more, and I hope ya have a great day!"
"I never thought a tranny would convince me fascism isn't so bad."
"This is the first video of yours Ive watched and im both in love and agree entirely with you"
"This entire video should be labeled how to spot a nice racist."
"If you could stop destroying the meaning of the word 'Fascist' that'd be great. If you could just use neo-nazi or white supremacist that would also be great.   Fascism is really just an authoritarian, economic and administrative political ideology. The main focus of which is to create a strong state behind a strong leader. The only bigotry that a basic fascist would have would be against the people with the wrong ideas and beliefs. So a fascist state can theoretically be egalitarian in its approach by defining the people of the nation as the citizens of the nation, and making it easy to become a citizen as long as you agree with the government. But it's much easier to get a fascist government into power via scapegoating a minority for people to blame their problems on, see Germany. Although mussolini didn't actually start with the antisemitic rhetoric until after their draw to Germany. So in conclusion, fascism only discriminates against people with the wrong ideas in its base form but can be influenced by other things. Lest we forget the same thing can be said about democratic states, like the US and South Africa.  In modern terms: Nazism=White supremacist fascism  Nazism=/= egalitarian fascism   Also the 'I'm not a ___ is exactly what a ___ would say' is an incredibly stupid argument, it can be applied to literally everything."

"Nothing wrong with facism. Facism makes your country thrive! No jewish rothschild bankers needed. To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize ✡"
"Why do SJWs always look like sewer people, weird. Y'all are some scrawny gross outcasts lol"
"No. If you care about even one person of color, or queer person, or immigrant, stand up for that person by ensuring that their ability to voice their opinion without fear of societal-condoned vigilante violence is not placed in jeopardy. Allow the alt-right whatever public platform they are legally entitled to, and defeat their ideas in the public square. If you can't convince the world your ideas are better than those of actual nazis, then you must be dumber than rocks."
"Just because I love my country and family, that doesn’t mean I hate others..."
"Your videos are so cool style-wise (aesthetically I suppose). I especially like the music, lighting and use of that old tv. Good stuff! Also I agree with the stuff you say and you say it well. I might just support you on patreon when I get a job"
"Hmmmm I have to say...I question your power to recognise things. There's just something I can't put my finger on. I just have a feeling you may be a person who struggles with seeing things that aren't really there."

"What does the milk emoji even mean to the alt right though"
"Fascist. You wouldn’t know a.... fascist if one were..... looking back at you from... the mirror!?!?"
"I really like your content. You might consider me a typical 'enemy' because my content is totally original 'poking fun at SJWs' (totally original I know) but  I take no issue with you and actually agree with a lot you have to say. I wish more people on the left were like you. Keep up the good work. I'll probably become a Patron soon because this is really top notch and would love to support you ."
"So I watch the whole thing..... I cannot agree with this video as it deals in absolutes. Only a sith deals in absolutes.  Pepe the frog with context is not always going to be about hate. It has become a symbol of more freedom. It is extreme people that have made it into a hate symbol when used to promote hate.  I see pepe used in all different conversations as mostly a responce to something some one either agrees with or disagrees with. To suggest there is a secret language being used online is absurd. It is like saying the moon landing was fake or the earth is flat.  I for one do not care what you look like, or how you see yourself.  The arguement here makes it very impossible say that a different way of thinking is fascist, which in its self is fascist, a lack of self realization, or choice of your own.  Look at the facts, and make your own opinions."
"Takes one to know one. Misguided, pretentious, regressive drivel like this does more harm than good.  Shame on you."
"There is no white race, there is no globalization, there is no ongoing crusade to 'kill whiteness' as Noel Ignatiev says and somehow blame whites for 'America's Original Sin of Slavery' (the slavery whites fought to end, not start). Got it Contra! Move along. Nothing to See Here Liberals. It's just not there! Just losers being losery - but not when blacks and jews practice ID politics - when they do it it's cool and brave. (eyeroll)"
"Do american white supremacists don't get the difference between asia, africa and america (the continent, the original america). Do they not know they live in the NEW WORLD.  As little sense as that argument makes (completely ignoring economic and social factors and making it all about race, race, race) it would make some kinda sense in europe, but a good bunch of people making this argument are american. Can they explain the difference between the US and latin america then? One got some percent more of white people on past centuries? I mean both have lots of people who are not ''originally'' from there so..."
"After this, I like fascism"
"This is not necessarily the definition of Fascist history books taught me..."
"You're an idiot in a dress. You have no clue of what a fascist is. It's when you remove the individual and replace it with a collective thought forced on others, by ''any means necessary''. When the collective deems certain books, messages or thoughts as ''unacceptable'' and the law is then used to censor people.. THEN you have fascism.. dumbass idiot... which is exactly what the left is attempting to do. the alt=right are getting stronger and stronger every day and the left is imploding because of their violence against others they disagree with.. so goeth the way of feminism with it."
"Is that Riley Dennis?"
"Holy shit, 5:50 pretty accurately predicting the future."
"This creature , whatever it might be, is not only disgusting and unhealthy, but is dishonest. No sane person would expect an honest video on the AltRight from a degenerate like this failed science experiment."
"its that a dude"
"lameee"
"5:30 I watched a French documentary about the jihadists new methods to recruit new members and it sounds exactly like these! They even tell their targets to act as if nothing has changed, to not be 'overtly Muslim', and if even if they were like this in the past, they should pretend they have changed and are back to normal now. Also they are told to  try to spread their 'faith' in a 'realistic' way to other teenagers.  This is terrifying"
"Theryn Meyer is infinitely more attractive, I feel like vomiting."
"Very well done, but I would urge that you be careful when trying to ascertain if someone is a nazi and trying to hide it, as opposed to being a genuine non-racist who holds views that you disagree with. For instance, the vast majority of people who support Western culture, don’t consider themselves nazis. In fact, most nazis would avoid mentioning “western culture,” as they believe race is important, not culture."
"What a load of wilful misinterpretation and paranoia. And what the hell is that definition of Fascism?  It's not even a proper definition of Nazism either, which it resembles more closely. Stop being so deluded."
"good production values tho I like the aesthetics."
"'i'm not a fascist is what a real fascist would say' I disagree, actually a real fascist would start a violent fascist group called ANTIFA!"
"*What incentives do white people have having non-white people living in their countries when there's evidence that:* White people prefer to live in white communities (white flight). People living in diverse communities and mix race children are generally less happy. _Evidence for claims:_  *Argument #1)* There is no evidens that white people genuinely want to live with non-white people. Not even with middle-class asians:  'Sociologist Samuel H. Kye, the author of Segregation in Suburbia: Ethnoburbs and Spatial Attainment in the Urban Periphery, examined segregation patterns in 150 middle class metropolitan black, Hispanic, and Asian ethnoburbs from 1990 to 2010. By focusing on middle-class, as opposed to lower-class ethnoburbs, he hoped to eliminate poverty as a factor for white flight.  In a phone interview, he relays that the relative economic prosperity of an ethnoburb does not diminish white people’s decisions to abandon it. “Across the board, any time you see a significant presence of minority residents, there is a near perfect predictor of exodus of white residents,” he says.' https://psmag.com/ghosts-of-white-people-past-witnessing-white-flight-from-an-asian-ethnoburb-b550ba986cdb   *Argument #2)* People are generally less happy in diverse communities:  'Higher diversity meant lower social capital. In his findings, Putnam writes that those in more diverse communities tend to 'distrust their neighbors, regardless of the color of their skin, to withdraw even from close friends,  to expect the worst from their community and its leaders, to volunteer less, give less to charity and work on community projects less often, to register to vote less, to agitate for social reform more but have less faith that they can actually make a difference,  and to huddle unhappily in front of the television.' http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/?page=full  'In general, people living in areas of lower own-group density experienced greater social adversity that was in turn associated with reporting psychotic experiences.'  'People resident in neighbourhoods of higher own-group density experience ‘buffering’ effects from the social risk factors for psychosis.' http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/201/4/282   *Argument #3)* Mixed race children generally have more problems:  'A new study that involved surveying 90,000 adolescent U.S. students showed that those who considered themselves to be of mixed race were more likely than others to suffer from depression, substance abuse, sleep problems and various aches and pains.'  'Quite a few studies attest in some way to the emotional, health and behavioral risk problems of multiracial adolescents,' he said. 'The most common explanation for the high-risk status is the struggle with identity formation, leading to lack of self-esteem, social isolation and problems of family dynamics in biracial households.' http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/oct03/udry10302003.html  'Children from interracial marriages are about three times more likely to be abused by parents and others, compared to those raised by Korean parents, a government report showed Friday'  http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/117_65916.html  'A new study of Chinese-Caucasian, Filipino-Caucasian, Japanese-Caucasian and Vietnamese-Caucasian individuals concludes that biracial Asian Americans are twice as likely as monoracial Asian Americans to be diagnosed with a psychological disorder.' http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/uoc--baa081108.php  'Mixed-race youth had the lowest mean score and white youth the highest for mother-adolescent relationships and maternal support, the study showed.

"Great vid , really informative , thanks"
"I highly appreciate how you covered this; very detailed and hit from various angles. I will share and like this, as well as subscribe. Your content needs to be spread. Thanks!"
"Subbed, I think this channel will be my binge watch this weekend!"
"I have the same dress. :)"
"👌"
"You need to defeat fascism, in all of its forms, intellectually, which shouldn't be hard because it has no intellectual merits. You need to give people a path out of the Alt-Right."
"Oh, I kind of got 'never reveal your power', but it's a bit obscure... It could use more splainin, like what do they mean by 'power'?"
"Great video!  And funny....  I wonder what will take the wind out of the fascists and make fence-sitters take more responsibility for their thinking.  I've heard so much horse manure -- unbelievable bullshit -- even from educated people.  Fascism has been around for a really long time too.  It's not some new thing.  There shouldn't be a learning curve.  A lot of what you call 'centrists' are middle aged and older.  But fascism does wax and wane.  So how can we make it wane permanently?  I think we need to focus on politics -- that is, elected officials.  So we need to influence voters.  One way is to expose fascists.  They obviously don't want that.  Another way is to move the Overton window.  That's a type of exposure.  Logical arguments have to be made.  For example, fascists often try to deploy phony logic.  One is false symmetries, like 'Nazis are bad, so therefore, anti-Nazis must also be bad. There are a lot of absurd logical templates that lazy thinkers readily fall into without thinking.  These also need to be exposed.  Fascists also use cynicism, which should be unmasked.  Statistics can often help.  For example, Germany accepted the most refugees and Germany is the strongest country in Europe.  I hear fake arguments about Europe all the time.  Varoufakis says there's no refugee crisis in Europe (except countries like Hungary that created a crisis!)  We have to use humor and charisma, just like you do.  We know that jihadi radicalization is caused by anti-immigrant racism; I'm sure many 'centrists' are turned off by people like Bill Maher.  (It should be no surprise he supports Israeli fascists.)  Anyway, thank you for the excellent video and I look forward to your next one!"
"your 3 points are false you are confusing hitlers of shoot nazisme with facisme a similar but other ideologie.  i consider my self facist on some grounds and whould like you to at least know that."
"Wow man you are basically shutting down conversation and acting in very authoritarian ways.  Not good either."
"you are the definition of the word Fascist dumbass"
"Your definition of fascism is very narrow and only defines the specific instance that exists now in the US. It can take many other forms that have nothing to do with Jews or even racism."
"Fascism does not require a geographic location, I have met and spoke to fascists from all around the world, and in the first minute of the video I can tell you have a very loose understanding of the fascist worldview. I would love to talk more but I would like to actually talk, instead of type. This goes to anyone who shares the views which are held in this video, if you want to talk I can give you a discord."
"'Fascist'? Really? The alt-right are a bunch of pussies in comparison with real neo-nazis and fascists. Europe is being destroyed, USA is getting full of antifa-feminazis-soyboys-nowflakes for no reason.  Come to Mexico, your good old neighbor and see the third-world REAL problems, not just bitching around with 'this is fascist, this is fascist too, etc'.

I would really like to know :D"
"This is ridiculous. You're saying that no matter how much someone detests, denies, or even speaks AGAINST fascism, they're still a fascist as long as you say so. Got it. That's hypocritically, the behavior of a fascist."
"Ha! You have no idea what fascism is and you're NOT a goddamn woman!"

"I’m starting to regret my old “LiberalsForKekistan” account I had on Discord. I legitimately thought it was a meme created by some unemployed 21 year old edge lord on 4chan for the lolz and would die off in like a few months because it spread on ifunny (aka the bane of all good in the world) and not some fascist symbol. But, I mean like Kekistan died off in 2017 and was prolly’ replaced by something of lesser quality. (Shadilay is a fucking bop tho)"
"Alt-light?"
"So what's Fascist, wanting a Europe for White Christian Europeans? That sounds more like common sense"
"hey leave the natives and mexicans out of this. They fought very brave and like warriors against us. I have a lot of respect for them. in fact ut took the military to overtake the natives. it honestly breaks my heart to see them fall to alcoholism and have their pride and culture destroyed. however, if you vote democrat, keep in mind that it was the democratic party that enslaved blacks and sent the natives out of their homeland and on the trail of tears. (Andrew Jackson) founder of democratic party. and i apologize for making fun of your english. look at things this way. if you want 2 go the evolution route. why is every country run by blacks, some hispanic, and arabs straight up trash. its evolution. why is every country that whites have run and created successful? evolution. top 10 safest countries are all white and asian countries. most dangerous, black and south american. why is argentina successful? European immigrants. one of the few south american countries thats worth anything. however also realize that there is a race of people who is in charge of the banks, media, education and other key components that is the real problem. they get kicked out of every country they go to. hint hint its not whites.lol"
"0/10 not enough communist propaganda songs"
"It seems like everywhere I turn, I find someone telling me that I’m dangerously close to falling for something dangerous. Whether it’s a religious person telling me I need to be less of a skeptic because my eternal salvation or damnation is dependent on my faith or an atheist telling me it’s dangerous to give unsubstantiated belief systems the benefit of the doubt, whether it’s someone telling me the socialists are everywhere, they’re part of a big conspiracy and they seek to destroy the societal values I hold dear or it’s you telling me the same thing about the fascists, there’s always, always somebody trying to trick me. And if I make the wrong decision because I’m hopelessly misinformed and surrounded by a fucking gigantic web of people all trying to serve some cause that not even they fully understand, then I end up spreading the dangerous idea and becoming part of the problem. Satan will destroy society, religion will destroy society, the left will destroy society, the right will destroy society, YOU will destroy society if you fuck this up, so you’d better not fuck this up, kid. Are you going to be a part of the solution or the problem, because you have to be one or the other. Inaction still advances some agenda. And I want to examine things more closely so I can come to some sort of conclusion myself but it seems like absolutely everything is a giant clusterfuck of fake news and hearsay and rumours and every single piece of evidence presented by every side is constantly being disputed by the others in a seemingly-endless argument, and I could spend my whole life trying to fact-check everyone’s claims and still never get anywhere. And I’m not mad at you or anyone else and I don’t think you’re all just trying to lie to me because the fucking scariest part is that at least some of you are probably right, but I have no idea who it is and every time I feel like I’ve come closer to discovering the truth I just get accosted by my doubt telling me “That’s what they want you to think, that’s what they want you to think” and I just want to be a good person and work to solve humanity’s problems but I don’t even trust myself enough to know what the problems are and whether any particular action is helping or just making it worse and I’m just so goddamn tired. To all of you out there who have the self-assurance to actually take a risk and stand for something: I envy you. Sorry for cluttering up the comments section with that barely-coherent essay-form panic attack. I guess I just needed to get that off my chest."

"Stopped when you marked the defence of western culture as dog-whistle for white supremascism. If people start to call everyone who defends western culture and civilization a racist we are doomed. Western culture is not a white people development, instead is the incremental accumulation of traits and institutions built by completely different societies from around the globe trough history. And is the best agregate culture we've managed to come with to create  widespread prosperity, peace and cientific and technologic evolution."

"I say we go ahead and let all the racists and Nazis pen themselves up in their own little ethnostate somewhere. I mean, that'll just make it easier for all of us to gang-up and exterminate them from the planet once and for all. Now THAT'S some white genocide we could all believe in :)"
"Hum... Regarding the three points of the Alt-Right, I don't see anything bad with the first claim, it's the second and third where things go off the rails. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have and preserve your culture, values, and customs all of which help shape your identity. Why does the left try so hard to strip this away from people as if there's something innately wrong with protecting a society's historical heritage? 'Western Culture' isn't a dog whistle for the white race because culture isn't exclusive to race or ethnicity. Rather they're universal ideas and behaviors which can be applied to any group of people. I want to preserve the Western liberal democracy's of Europe and America because they provide a freer, and objectively higher standard of living. You being a transgender individual should know this better than anyone else since it's one of the few cultures that won't either execute or persecute you.  EDIT: Regardless of your position, I still found the video entertaining and interesting. It's always insightful to see what the other side of the fence is thinking, and I hope you can understand the Alt-Right doesn't have a monopoly on the desire to preserve Western liberal societies."

Yet you don't attack Israelis and Japanese for having laws which protect their racial identity. Why are they no japanese and jewish supremacists?  What a fucking double standard."
"What fascists believe is not at all what you say they do.  I think you mean neo-nazi, or national socialist, because that's the actual subject of the video; which granted needs to be opposed.  It's just factually wrong that the 'ethno-state' and whatnot is fascist doctrine."
"This was really good. I still do see the pepe and Kek stuff as general mockery images that are used by a massively diverse group of trolls and pranksters though... some of whom are fascists. I also think that the populist right is a very complex group, both at the base and 'leader' level. The potential is certainly dangerous but the response needs to be incredibly smart and nuanced... we could start by including honest to god class discussions and analysis into the debates; something the left no longer does in anyway close to adequately; ironically this would be the most persuasive counter argument against fascist rhetoric."

"Breh, Clinton and cronie left are actual war mongering racists.. Left or Right most of elites are white or/and Jewish for a reason and it's no coincidence... It's racism but they hate us poor whites also, just not nearly as much.. Think about it, democrats want poor immigrants to come here, but won't improve schooling. They use systematic racism to hold down non whites while acting as champions against racism to get votes. It's very clear the left (elitists with power) doesn't want them to be educated and instead stay stuck where they are and keep voting dem. It's about power. Everyone is fucking racist, it's so fucked up. The entire system is  a joke, left or right the elites (typically white, Christian or Jewish.. Look how closey related their families are, even Trump and Clinton are related via 16th cousins, every president has been related to one and other ) have the power and won't give it up, except for a few like Obama or celebrities like Beyonce. Yesterday the dems were racist, today its the reps, tomorrow it'll be someone else but at the end of the day we are fighting each other over non issues. Most of us left or right agree on most issues but have been led astray but bullshit from either side. It's madness! Mean while the racist elites which inhabit both sides stay on top out of danger. The same '%1' that made 84% of all generated wealth last year. It's not left vs right or Nazis v Commies.. its rich vs poor and the poor are infighting . #NoImNotAlexJones"

"As an actual fascist I am deeply offended by your complete ignorance of what fascism is and what real fascists actually believe in. Fascism and National Socialism (aka Nazism) ARE NOT interchangeable words. White Nationalism, Identitarianism, The Alt Right, and Nazism are not Fascists. Read Mussolini, Mosley, Dennis, or Gentile’s works to better understand what Fascism really is. I understand you will not like that Fascism is ultra-Nationalistic, Traditionalistic, and puts the groups (National) interests before the individual, but, please, at least understand Fascism has nothing to do with Sexism, Anti-Semitism, or Racism."

"Watch this and you'll be able to recognize all the fascists in this video's comments."

"I can totally relate to the part where she said before she came out she used to cross dress 'ironically.' Before I came out as ftm trans, my school jazz band was all guys, but one of my friends in it who always makes jokes about being really gay and is therefore kind of feminine. I used to say that he was the only girl in jazz band. It was another year before I figured out my gender identity."
"_You just went and said my secret word of the day so prepare for a short rant:_ It's interesting to hear someone say the word 'forgive' talking about politics, namely from the left.  I think it will be an essential word in the time going forward. 'Centrists' react very badly indeed to the more schreechy parts o' the left, and I kinda understand why.   Obviously this is another strategy of the right, but one which hasn't been gracefully defended against at all.  Talking about #metoo the outrage seems to start out at eleven sometimes, leaving no room to differentiate between  unsolicited dick picks and physical abuse. The former can be forgiven. (yes it can, what is the alternative?)  But. You might get the impression that even trivial transgressions will leave you unwelcome in Camp Left forevermore. That you're either using the correct terms and pronouns on the first go, or you're one of the Bad Guys."

"Malcolm X and other true, great leaders of the Black Nation (Which can ulitmately be classified as National Socialism), encouraged Blacks to drop a fake culture...that, yes, was fabricated by Whites, as well as Jews... to embrace their roots. For Blacks this meant a life of crime or degeneracy, for example. For Whites.. Yes.. It does mean rejecting this materialistic, corporatized, modern Maya as well.   If looked at close enough.. This way of thinking.. Oh, I dont know...may stand to benefit Nationalists and tribalists of all races and religions. Diversity is only found this way. Meshing us all only benefits groups of Elites.   Do you truly think these non-whites flooding the US and Europe are actually, TRULY benefitting? What this essentially is, is a gladiator pit. A dog-fighting circle. Force them all inside and benefit from the chaos via international finance and corporate interests. Set the newcomers against natives, hand them distractions and tell them theyre 'united'. Behind the TV shows and sportsball.. Peak behind the American flag to find the true face of it all.  Refute this."
"Just over a minute in and I can already refute your 3 points of Fascism. This isnt a Euro-centric..or 'White Supremacist'... ideology. Fascism exists among all races, and even if you just copy/paste *x color* for White, it can still be refuted that all Fascism focuses on Jews."

"I sympathize with the left because I think that capitalism leads to it's own demise based on theories found in Marx's work. I also think that racism, one of the most appalling yet usual traits I've seen in people of all colors as well as sexism and hysteria based on sexual preferences has to be fought. What I don't get is the enthusiasm for the self admitted neo Bolsheviks who want the system of extreme terror and violence known as socialism (if you're from america and use terminology the wrong way (jk love you and your Yankee ways) that means communism) to be re established. Can someone explain to me why the antifa is treated like the good guys here? Sry for the horrendous grammar and such, not a native speaker."
"1 minute in and you've already wildly misrepresented the political sphere you set  out to 'Decode'. I usually try and give everyone the time to express themselves, but this is just moronic beyond any possibility of argument. You strawman your opposition not only by their views, but down to the integrity of their character, their desires, their very person, and you do so because only then, after you've carefully painted a standard persona for them do your claims start to make any semblance of sense.  I'm not Fascist, nor Alt-Right, but it is painfully apparent that *what you have here is a frankenstein's monster of different beliefs and stances pulled from the right end of the spectrum* and not a representation of what Fascism is. You refer to it as 'Contemporary Fascism' which as far as I know is a monster of your own making. I honestly doubt you ever set out to give a fair representation, I am forced to conclude this is just an effort at demonization and propaganda (where really there isn't even any need to). So, I would advise you to read up on the subjects you pretend to discuss, but that would be pointless."
"“Don’t get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normes”..... I had to pause here because.... doesn’t it look like taquiyah (spelled that wrong for sure)? You know this concept of salafists where you have to act like the “degenerate” culture before attacking it? And those people were screaming “white sharia” in Charlottesville. Interesting."
"your strategy is a recipe for a witch hunt. 'he protests he's not a fascist' That proves he's a fascist!...look he was seen talking xx person on the forbidden list!'.  Example - under your parameters anyone who expresses concern about 'western culture' is immediately flagged as covert nazi..especially if they dare mention anything critical of Islaamic ideology etc.  This means that Sam Harris is a borderline neo-nazi. Strategy 5 onwards is a just an attempt to downplay this possibility."

"'....History shows that regardless...'. That's very slippery of you. I could use the same implication that being a leftist means they'll ultimately side with Communists in some form simply because SOME of them have. There's no 'liberals side with fascists' default either in the past OR now. You can keep trying to attack and shame centrists with that passive-aggressive rhetoric, but odds are they'll detect it exactly as intended: an attack."
"This video was what helped save me from falling in line with the altright shitlords I used to watch. Having someone sit me down and explain these things to me calmly but firmly was really useful, and helped me better understand the sentiment behind the leftist cause. Thank you Mama Contra, for changing my mind~"
"OK here is the problem with the alt right and its that it is silly to accuse everyone who wants to preserve western civilisation to be nazis! Why the fuck wouldnt i want to preserve western civilisation a civilisation that allowes me to ne freeer than any other civilisation! I can openly be gay and can marry someone i can start a buisness and can chose my religion without having to fear negative consequences! But the alt right do not want to preserve western civilisation! Western Civilisation has denaunced and fought theire ilk along time ago so i think it is stupid to paint everyone who is nationalistic or wants to preserve western civilisation as a nazi ! You will not get many nazis this way and all you do is make yourself look deranged in the process minimising your own credibility!  You can only deal with facists if they are showing theire white nativist colors and not with positions that have a huge overlap with other political ideologys!"
"It's hardly fair to imply as you do that Western culture is nothing more than a synonym for white supremacy."

"you are fucking awesome. subscribed!"
"I'll save everyone time: Video starts of with an Absolute lie about Fascism stating it has something to do with race, this is incorrect, fascist societies have been around since before white people left mud huts an bronze tools. Fascism has nothing to do with race it is a Philosophy of Societal Governance which is distinguished by a merge of corporate and state power under a unified banner usually with a Caesar type ruling figure. Fascism is very old and goes back from since before the days of Rome. The Host then Defines activities of white nationalists and several non-cohesive ideologies including ideas from even mainstream conservatism like wanting to maintain western culture and presents them as Fascist. And basically dog whistles to their own pseudo intellectual base, leads the viewer to associate Libertarians, Conservatives, Civic Nationalists and the alt-right to be conflated together and with Fascism. One problem, they all have nothing to do with fascism. Most Fascists despise Alt-right, Conservatives, Libertarians , and lefties alike. All of this is ideological gobbledygook, pseudo intellectualism. Contrapoints is a liar or a pretend know it all brainlet."
"hmm."
"I'd just like to point out that these tactics often aren't propagated by shadowy forums or Discord groups (although those are definitely a thing and they often discuss ways to get people on their side), people drinking the alt-right/fascist kool-aid are more than likely just using what works, or aping the things that they see their figureheads doing. I think that it's dangerous and unhelpful to go into an argument assuming the person that is espousing these talking points is a knowing pawn in the scheme rather than someone who got unwittingly duped. Also, while it might seem like fighting fascism is a socialist or communist preoccupation, fascism is the enemy of EVERYTHING that is not fascism. Fascists, while they might pay lip service to parts of conservative culture or classical liberal  ideals that give them an air of legitimacy, will happily turn on you when they're done with you. It happened in Nazi Germany. They acted like the Jews were the only enemy, like everyone else was innocent in their eyes, but once the Jews were powerless, churches, worker's unions, and all other political parties except theirs were abolished. They are NOT your friend and they will NEVER be your friend. They see you as a tool, and once they are done with you, they will not think twice about casting you aside."

"What's the problem of having at least a tiny little piece of land as a homogeneous white ethnostate? Why can't people have options? Why can't we have both multiracial and racially homogeneous countries? Why every white community must be hunted to the ends of the world? What happened to freedom of association? Lastly, ask yourselves, why is it that when we talk about stopping migration we are essentially talking about stopping non white migration, why is it that only non whites have to migrate for so many decades non stop? The truth is that they will never stop coming because they can't make their own countries great (that's not to be blamed on whites, but on inherent biological factors)."

"Blacks ''civil right'' activists are not just fighting against poverty among blacks, they are fighting for what they think it's best for their own people. White nationalists believe that living with blacks is bad for whites, because they commit more crimes and have a different nature. It can be said that white nationalists are also fighting for what they believe is best for their own people. But only whites are denied the right to go after what's best for whites. The biggest difference between white nationalists and black activists is that white nationalists want separation, though separation can seem bad, there's reasons for whites to desire it. While blacks have no reason to defend such thing as they more than any other minority benefit from living among whites. White societies are advanced and give them special treatment. Lastly, white nationalism is not only about enforcing segregation between the races, it's also about options and identity. In a age where white countries, cities and neighborhoods everywhere are being targeted for diversification by their own government, there's a lack of alternative for whites who prefer to live among their own people, especially for the white working class. There should be multiracial countries for people who like it, but it should also exist racially homogeneous countries for people who prefer their own, that's what a lot of white nationalists defend. While minorities and liberal whites naively defend the cult of diversity, they are merely being tools of the rich capitalists in search for cheap labour from the third world. Rich capitalists want to mix all cultures and peoples, they want to destroy all identity and collectivism to transform everyone in a mass of undifferentiated individuals shopping in a global market.   A country based only in ideas is just another place to go shopping. When everyone is roman, then no one is roman. When everyone is british/german/french/american/etc, then no one is."

"How do you manage to invent so many bullshit and nonsense?"
"So Europeans shouldn't be supreme in Europe? The fact is africans will still have Africa, asians will still have Asia, but Europeans will be replaced in Europe if white nationalists don't gain political power. You say AntiFA attacking random whites due to a ''nazi'' haircut is the same as white cops attacking random blacks, but it's not. If white cops are racial profiling blacks that's because blacks commit much more crimes on a per capita bases than whites. About fascism, almost all nations before the 1900's were authoritarian in their political system, but that didn't bother most people back then."
"Hi Contra, I really enjoy and value your content, including this video. Is it, however, not counter-productive to basically label centrists and classical liberals as fascist allies/sympathizers/supporters regardless of whether they actually do this intentionally, purposefully, or consciously?  I do, for the most part agree with what you're saying in this video, and as such it is giving me new insight in how to spot potential fascists etc.  One other thing I deduct from your message is that the 'fascists' apparently seem to be better at subtly communicating, propaganda etc etc. than the 'left' is. You yourself have in a small sense alluded to this when you compared Milo's vacuous aesthetic vs. Anita's joyless content.  A contention I have with this video is that it ignores the average Jane and Joe that might agree on a talking point (for example limiting immigration) because they fear for loss of their livelihood (aka their jobs). I think it would be fair to say then that these people's concerns are more with being able to have a stable life rather than them being anti-immigrants per se. I would of course agree that these people would be susceptible to be 'played' by those who are anti-immigration. It is, however, an important point to take into account, because if we do not we get 'leftists' shouting the average Jane and Joe are fascists or racists while their actual concern is to provide for their family. This, not surprisingly, is a great opportunity for an actual fascist to say: 'They think you're a fascist for wanting to keep your job', and as such, in part the enablers of the fascists would be the leftists who push the average Jane and Joe away from the left leaving more opportunity for the fascists to pull them towards the right.  Again, I think you're doing a great job of showing a left, feminist, and SJW perspective... but more so than others. I like your Dali and Kafkaesque-horror style aesthetics!  It would be beneficial to 'the left' (broad term) to have a less hostile position towards centrists. As Theryn said about Dave Rubin. He might simply not know about certain issues. Likewise, many centrists and classical liberal have created a mental image of the left/feminists/SJW's as raving lunatics because some of the more vocal people on that side of the spectrum have worked effortlessly to give that image by saying outlandish things, 'Big Red' being the poster child (for feminism) of this. hashtag of KillAllWhiteMen or a professor wishing for a white genocide do not help the general public, particularly the white (whatever the fuck 'white' actually is...) one be supportive of more left-leaning viewpoints, and keep them away  from more fascist-like viewpoints, even if the context in which it was said would make more sense or be logical or sensible in any way. 'Hmmm... it appears that people claiming to be something-something-on-the-left hate my 'ethic background/ skincolor'. This will be a good time for me to support them!' <--- see what I mean? A similar problem is within feminism. One cannot reasonably expect others to accept the idea that 'men need to express their feelings' while an hour later a few dozen proclaimed feminists are posting selfies drinking from their male-tears mugs. Even though the male-tears might, to them, refer to whiny man-babies, the general public will see this as feminists taking sadistic pleasure knowing they made men cry (aka show their emotions). To illustrate; there was this picture of a restaurant sign saying 'Soup of the Day: The tears of our enemies' ...  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, and this is already an old problem on the left, there is a huge image problem that needs to be addressed on a broader scale."

I always were a leftist, an a social democrat, but i found myself getting influenced to be more tolerant with conservatives, and A LOT more permissive.  Because i was watching conservatives basically every day.  Honestly, looking back. It scares the shit out of me."

"1. That's extreme pan-nationalism which is inherently not fascist. To view people of european heritage as a single superorganism/nation is more extreme than even the nazis thought (they limited their nation-state to all germans in all countries). Maybe you're thinking of Spencer and his American separatist ethno-nationalism? Which is closer to nazism than fascism. 2. Fascists are generally not anti-semitic. Il Duce was militantly against anti-semitism. Singapore doesn't care. You're thinking about anti-semitism which is closely associated with german nazism. 3. I have not heard of any such. Again I think you're referencing Spencer and his separatist ethno-nationalist gang."

You can't just take actual specific political parties and their platforms- things that have had specific definitions since before your birth- and simply decide to apply your own arbitrary definition. Wait... Forget I said anything. I'm writing this as your video is playing, and I realize that you are rather an embarrassment. This sounds increasingly like a poor regurgitation of Newspeak indoctrination. did you actually say that the statement 'I'm not a fascist' is exactly what a fascist would say? You understand that that statement and its analogues are classically used as jokes, right? It combines both question begging and circular reasoning. That statement should literally be the bumper sticker for logical fallacies. Screw this, I'm going to watch some more of your videos for entertainment value.

All you do in this video is take legitimate points, legitimate arguments, and worldviews and simply claim it's all a big conspiratorial lie to trick people into installing a Fourth Reich. 'Saying 'I'm not a fascist' is what a fascist would say XD.' Well saying 'I'm not a Marxist' is what a Marxist would say. Claiming you're not trying to replace the whites is what a supporter of white genocide would say. Wow look how retarded that argument is. There are clear distinctions between these groups and you're trying your hardest to blur the lines and poison the well instead of actually have any real argument against these political ideologies. I could make this same video about leftists and claim everything you do is a deceptive strategy to install communism, which by the way murdered millions and millions more than Nazism did. And honestly? If I had to choose which side was really using subversion tactics to enable a genocidal and murderous ideology, I'd definitely be looking at you people on the left. White nationalism or identitarianism does not equal white supremacy, the goal of an ethnostate does NOT require genocide, and in fact many alt right leaders and figures have made this clear, not just in public. In their own circles, articles, and podcasts. You are literally the leftist embodiment of the Illuminati Alex Jones-tier youtube maniacs. You're losing this war, these 'white centrists' are waking up to what's happening and are beginning to think for themselves and the protection of their identity and families. OF COURSE people like you are scrambling to output as much disinfo as possible to stop this awakening. Good luck, may the best memer win."
"To deny the existence of civic nationalists altogether, saying that anyone who wants to preserve tradition and culture is a white supremacist who, as you put it, 'Wants a large scale ethnic cleansing in the long term' is so dishonest and scummy, it's unbelievable even for you.  Let me let you in on a secret: Nonwhite nationalists do exist. I know plenty of Hispanic civic nationalists who you would consider 'alt-right'. Buddhist Nationalism is a major platform in Myanmar and Tibet. Your argument would be on par with me saying anyone who identifies with Marxism wants to eradicate all whites."
"Ok but why is this guy wearing a dress"
"Fantano isn't a centrist, he's an overt leftist. Read his twitter, hear his response to the 'alt-right' accusation about him, and follow his political beliefs. Its pretty clear."

"What the fuck is that thing in front of the camera?"
"2:34 That is a straw man. Please debate more honestly than this, you don't seem like a bad person."
"You must be killed"
"contrapoints youre fucking gay dude. talk about some other shit"
"why do leftists think a guy who doesn't know what his gender is knows anything about politics"
"What garbage. This is why you lefties constantly lump in pro-border Libertarians into the genocidal NatSoc group?"
"what the fuck is that thing"
"Absolutely wonderful video. I hope you reach that 40%."
"Btw, religious conspiracy nuts tell you that the 'okay' symbol is actually secretly a 666 hand sign. Takes all kinds..."
"Okay, what you described at the beginning of the video was White Supremacy and anti-Semitism not fascism. Yes, we ascribe all of these things to Nazis but they are not the same"
"Interesting techniques! Specially the one where antifa would occupy a right-wing speech (not neccessirly fascist) from taking place... Now what would happen if RWs did the same shit now? Where they ruin an anti-fascist march purely to scrutanize the left-wing belifs the hold?"

"Great stuff!"
"17:38 That scene gives me chills no matter how many times I see it."
"Absolutely savage. Love it."
"She's so awesome! I love this video!"
"ahh subbed since i saw that mirror vid on shauns channel bless your heart"
"See here's how little you understand about ethno-nationalists. They have their black counterparts that you said nothing about. This is exactly why white people think they're being discriminated against. This is exactly why people feel the need to join the alt-right. You just assume one is evil because the people involved are white. You don't truly understand this or you would be saying something about the black ethno-nationalists."
"Hi Shaun! 4:53"
"I love you."
"It’s also important to notice how confusing these tactics get when you’re closer to them. I think that many people get tangled somewhere in the blob of people and ideas pushing fascism."
"Your awesome, keep it up"
"lmfao the OK sign was just a prank its been debunked quite a bit. I guess it's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point. If you leave no room for humor you're going to get people joking to push your buttons"
"I know I've been posting in like...  every video I've watched.  Just again, I want you to know you're fricken awesome."
"Your videos are typically great but I just have to point out your definition is not fully accurate. Though there is typically a componant of nationalism and racism to fascism the actual definition per Merriam-Webster is:  'a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.'  This definition pretty much defines it as good ole Benito saw it, and he was the founder of fascism itself.  Your definition of contemporary fascists sums them up as simply cultural purists, jew haters and believers in ethnic state. This belittles their political-economic beliefs. Do you really think, given the chance at success, that these a-holes would not place a dictator in power and merge the corporate oligarchy with state power? Of course they would just like any good little nazi.  Racism and fear of 'the other' are just a means to an end for them.  Sadly it doesn't take alt-righters to do this, trump and his ilk seam to be doing a fine job of instigating fascism already."
"You opened my eyes... I always strongly disagreed with the alt right and fashism but i picked up and duplicated so many of their memes and talking points and unfortunately also some fucked up views without even realizing. Thank you for this video, it really means a lot to me."
"Great vid! The only part I don’t understand is the meaning behind you dressing up like a woman. Is that some kind of alt right symbol?"
"We are in the time that emojis are political simbols, what are we done?"
"Omg I've never looked at a leftist video really this great... Do you always get so much fag hag love in the comments?....man, I really like this channel. I'm alt right, doxed and fired, and I love this. You're right in many ways. And I respect your ideological principal and dedication. There's no debate to have obviously. I think you're a mentally ill boy and you'd say the same about me. So how about this....about we show real love and real compassion. How about siding with each other to split up the empire. Destroy the United States and go Germany 1980s style. A few states in the midweat for whites only, mixed race land with their Zionist leaders in the northeast. With a spot for blacks in the  south east to mid south. And la raza can take California and Arizona. Idk seems reasonable to me and it saves you from 'the existencial threat' traditional whites pose to you, jew or not."
"You're very smart. Its sad really. I just want a place for my people, straight cis people.. I'd say normal, but you know, I'm full of hate....anyway, I just want that and you want a land of the current year continuing on its course. We could have that. I dont hate you and you're not my worst fear. I was in antifa years ago, a Bernie bro months ago. The fact is race is real and it matters to the culture of a country. I dont want what you want. Divorce is the best option. BUT WHAT IS REALLY SAD is that I don't think you'll see that. I think you'll want to punch me and blame white 'centrists' for just acting like white people (ie not wanting to cause social disturbance)... I think you'll keep pushing until the guns come out. And it sucks. Because I dont want you to be unhappy, or uncomfortable, let alone in an actual gas chamber. I just want a space for conservative traditional whites to have on the land they discovered/conquered (depending on the historical timelines), that will remain a reflection of them. There's plenty of space for the whatever it is your goal is ultimately. I just want to have the option for me and others to opt out of this experiment."

"Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism,[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry and commerce[3] that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[4] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I before it spread to other European countries.[4] Opposed to liberalism, Marxism and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum.[5][6][7][4][8][9]  Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A 'military citizenship' arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.[10][11] The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.[10][11]  Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[12] Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[12] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[13][14][15][16] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.[17]  Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist and the term is instead now usually used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe parties of the far-right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th century fascist movements."
"it ok to be white"
"You're really talented and thoughtful. Please keep making videos!"
"offtopic but i really love your mood lighting"
"Does anyone really think that facism is working or would ever work. Are you really in fear of the United States becoming a white nation. What the hell is going on stop talking about Nazis and they have nothing. These race issues are being stirred up. If we were so afraid of Nazis where were they the last eight years. We are all getting spun up on left and right propaganda. Get the fuck over it"
"Crime rates are not consistent across Africa and vary significantly. For instance, Numbeo's 2017 Crime Index has South Africa rated at 75.72 (the 4th highest globally) whereas Ghana is rated at 46.99 (56th globally) (source: https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp). South Africa has by far the most white people of any African country, (source: http://howafrica.com/top-10-african-countries-with-highest-white-population-as-of-2017/), many more than Ghana. For comparison, Norway, a developed nation with a non-white population of 2% (source: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html) is rated 45.69 (61st globally). Tunisia scores even better at 40.94 (73rd globally). There isn't any consistent correlation between race and criminality.   You have no argument unless you can come up with more credible sources that counter the ones I've provided. And no, sorry, numbers are not fake news."
"Not meaning this in an offensive way at all when I ask this. But is the person in this video trans?"
"Why are you in a dress"
"That 4chan post in the beginning is scary. We were lucky to get Trump because hes so dumb. The next fascist will be more like that 4chan poster. It's why we have to strangle that shit in its crib."
"That was an amazing, extremely well researched video. I really appreciate it.  'Yes, I have become crazy. But this paranoia, self doubt, and questioning of your own perception is the psychological consequence of being constantly gaslit by facsists pretending not to be facsists and communicating in code. It's the intentional consequence of that. ' WOW"

"So idubbbz is a fascist?😂. This video has some good points but SJW shouldn’t even be a thing. I have never heard anyone say what about all the white hate. I’ve heard Jewish hate but that’s because they are the #1 hated group in the world. And fascists are people who silence people which is antifa and which is SJW propaganda. The right and left will never agree on this and that is why America is shit. And everyone should have the right to talk as much as everyone else. That is a right that is not given by government or that can be taken away. And this video is all about bashing the president. And she is paranoid. Fascists won’t ever take over America. This is silly."
"Outstanding!"
"According to your superior logic due to the fact that I have blond hair and bleu eyes im a Nazi,  if I deny it then im like the grand wizard of the kkk.  Your reasoning is mind blowing.

"I hope the heavy lids are part of the character. Be good to yourself."
"Still a great video (as usual from you) but I have to confess that (as someone who considers themselves a liberal and/or in some grander sense a centrist) I'm kinda thrown by your use of those terms, given that you often are expressing frustration w/ people who to me are pretty clearly alt-light, or 'hiding their power level', or at least alt-right curious - Rubin, Akkad, etc. These dudes aren't like, David Brooks style centrists getting taken for a ride. They're dude bros whose main political concerns happen to overlap heavily with the dangerous faction they cater too. Maybe their ideological incoherence and/or apathy is what makes them hard to classify, but they're obviously not mistaken and they're definitely not synonymous with what most people (who aren't youtuber libertarians who for some reason REALLY care about having strong borders) consider 'centrist'. Idk."
"Why is he dressed like a woman and wearing lipstick? Sorry if this has been answered before, I'm new to this channel. I'm guessing it's a parody of someone he dislikes?"
"Fascism was created by Mussolini, who was a life long SOCIALIST.  So please spare the idiotic argument that Fascists are somehow 'Alt-Right', when they engage in the very same identity politics of the Left, and have an origin on the Left.  The Left, is their home, regardless of whether you kicked them out, the Right has never embraced them, where as the Left created them.  You're still hustling identity politics to this day, its you're baby."
"What is called 'The Alt-Right' today, used to be mainstream Left.  We have the KKK, created by the Democrat Party, hardly a right wing Classic Liberal group there.  Then we have the Nazis, which literally stands for National Socialist German Workers Party, another Left wing ideology that we crushed.  Again, hardly with Right wing origins.  Yet the Left still embraces communism, and socialism as a platform.  How are you ever going to wash your hands of identity politics?  Its your baby."
"If the left can understand the alt-right's dogwhistles, then they aren't dogwhistles, now are they.  After all, if you can hear the dogwhistle, you must be the dog.  If lefties can hear the dogwhistle, they aren't lefties, they are alt-righters.  Also, changing names of the movement is something the far left does as well - liberals -> progressives -> communists -> socialists -> social democrats, etc.   Constantly changing how they identify themselves in public.  And you're wrong about Kekistan - most alt-rights hate Kekistan.  No wait, hate isn't a strong enough term, they loathe and despise Kekistan.  You should have shown the responses to Spencer's Kekistan tweet - his followers hated it and wanted him to retract and disown it.  In any event, there is a deep fundamental contradiction inherent in the alt-right's beliefs.  A white ethnostate built around any sort of fascist or nazi ideology won't be anything like America 2.0.  Being white isn't what makes a person an American, holding to Enlightenment values does.  Thus all these white ethnostate nationalists want to believe America will be great again when it is white again, but their ideal society won't be built on Enlightenment values, so it won't really be America and won't actually be great.  That said, a lot of people coming into the US, especially from third world countries, don't always cleave to Enlightenment values either.  So the concern is not completely absent merit.  But the alt-right aren't the ones in a position to argue that case.  Indeed, they don't even seem aware that that is the real concern to be had, and they can't be aware of it because their own position is not one of Enlightenment values.  So the alt-right can go pound sand as far as I'm concerned :P  Of course, the far left also has no interest in Enlightenment values, so both the alt-right and the far left need to be staunchly opposed for the same basic reason."
"Sh.. ! So, I'm a fascist :( Dude, you opened my eyes. Now, when I troll, I'll know I'm a fascist. Damn, what a day of mine. BTW, a true woman would never wear a dotted dress in front of a baroque wallpaper. NEVER ! War is coming. Prep yourselves."

"Good vid, but I did not like linking Trump and anti-immigration views  to fascism."
"I'm about halfway through this video, and what worries me is that using these strategies you can easily construe anyone who is further right then left of center as a Nazi. You could even take quotes from every president pre-Obama (and maybe even Obama early in his first term) and quantity them as Nazi's or white supremacists. Just like the echo chamber affected white nationalist ethnostaters, you seem to have built a wall around your beliefs and refuse to listen to those who inhabit any position outside of your accepted range of beliefs, using the term Nazi to protect yourself from any sort of dissent."
"The comments are being censored right?"
"This is great advice. I am a right wing liberal and over the last 4-5 years I have observed that me approaching Leftists is counter productive. Now I just announce my position and let them approach me for a discussion. Nine times out of ten within a year they do a complete 180 in their stance."

"I think you're sounding an alarm about a disaster that isn't happening.  The vast majority of citizens, regardless of whether they may appear to be 'white' at first glance, understand that Americans whose families have been here for 200 years or more are by and large are not pure anything.  Now, it may be subtle, but even families like mine have genetics from every corner of the earth.  As I see it, you are investing a great deal of energy attempting to solve a problem that doesn't exist.  'Fascists' are denizens of the intellectual basement, just like ultra-liberals are.  The center, the middle, is what this country is all about and where its strength is."
"I find your videos to be noneducational and basically full of empty space. You say a lot but don't actual make many points. Just a bad video."

"Subbed. This is really good. Thanks for the time & effort!"
"THE HOLOCAUST WAS A HOAX REEEEEEEEHH! ... got your attention now? hopefully so ;) lets start by addressing the root cause of 'fascism'(by which for the sake of simplycity i'll refer to ultra-nationalist authoritarian conservative groups, which by the way are in themselves quite diverse when it comes to stance on race, economy and so forth). the cause for all extremist populist movements was always caused by a general repression(internal and/or external) or a general feeling of disempowerment. 1920's italy, for example, was a very young, and unadvanced country when compared to other european states, which also consideret it as a joke state for the most part. nazi germany? the loss of ww1 was a great toll for germany's pride and economy, where everyone was poor and mistreated by denizens of the non german world. this maybe begs the question to you, what might have caused the uproar of a great number of far right movements all across the western world? look no further than the mirror. you are part of what is causing all the white populations across the world to raise their heads in disdain for what mainstream media and politics are proposing. whatever you might think about the 'nazis' you are actually part of the reason they have erupted in numbers for the past decade.  now with that out the way, i think we've all overlooked some major problems related to the discussion. mainly the fact that this discussion leads to nowhere, people from all sides of the spectrum will be manipulated by those who really detain power. and no quantifiable amount of political discourses will change the omnipresent problems. no matter the demographic of the majority, we'll still have a great deal of disparity in social status. then there's the obvious fact that no matter what we do we will not be able to keep an international civilisation and economy, namely because it has all gone to shit since the foundation of large scale politics and economy itself, which has always led to exploitation of both the people and the soil on which they sustained themselves.  the western roman empire was in pretty much our same situation in the 5th century, when it comes down to a crumbling economy or of the watering down of the value of the individual that for the most part at the time cared only for 'pane et circenses', or the inherent right to food and spectacle, regardless of merit. sounds familiar? oh and also now we have the monocultures that sustain the world population completely depleting the soil of its capacity to grow anything, plus the massive pollution that derives from that and massive industrial production, or the consumist system based around only consuming whilst not producing anything, et cetera et cetera...  political discussion are really intresting and amusing, but will serve us nothing when all of it will come crashing on our heads"
"Came over here from lacis debate and I love your channel contrapoints! I love the focus on helping the left appeal to the centrist"
"who is this poor human? go and find God before it's too late, you are spitting him nowwñ by dressing like a woman, come on! go and ask for forgiveness"
"It is true , and it works.I have found myself defending people who have alt-right leanings.  I think I was just tired of certain people on the left seeming to take advantage of good will in order to gain power (and yes they are definitely out there).  I was also tired of people on the left looking embarassing/ incompetent. And yes, the left HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS. A LOT. That maybe if they were addressed, the foundation would be stronger, and it would not be crumbling right now.    I think the republicans/ conservatives have a lot of restructuring to do as well...  I also feel like the left has a very ' you're either with us or against us' attitude instead of reaching out to people who are not in their progressive bubble.I still consider myself liberal (not really 'classically liberal' , more left than that ) , but I have found myself starting to shift over."
"Bless you, you god among men."
"Nice tv"
"everyone who disagrees with me is a nazi."
"this is a joke right? i mean, i know you're a joke, but this video? keep projecting your fascist label on the 'alt-right' when they dont shut down your terroristic speach, attack you for your beliefs, or do anything near as grossly fascist as antifa and the like. we arent racist, and most of us cant stand richard spencer. at least he doesn't call for violence tho"
"this video was beautiful"
"AND a Home track at the end? Icing on a great video"
"OK I've tried to give this freak a fair chance but I can't help I am repulsed by boys masquerading as women. If being a fascist is    what it takes to get rid of this plague in our culture so be it."
"This dude really doesn't seem to like the idea white people have a culture haha."
"How does it feel to be a failure as a white man?"
"Why are you equating fascists with nazies? Its quite clear form both the comments of Mussolini and his writings that fascism is not related to race, jews etc. but to ultra-nationalism, corporatist economy and reactionary aesthetics"
"How about defining 'Fascist' other than 'Anyone who disagrees with me'"
"It's OK to be white."
"People are actually convinced you figured something out...  or.. YOU are convinced you figured something out. Dunno whats more commical."
"Fuck. I thought I knew shit. God. This world is gonna burn"
"not gonna lie, i'm getting major fetish vibes from your nazi outfit."
"Ok.... 11 minutes in and you got me. I'm subbed. I kinda was getting a feeling about all this stuff I was hearing from certain people,  but half way though this video going 'oh my god!' from point to point really just made everything so clear. They're a clever bunch it seems, but now I'm more aware. Thank you."
"I'm sorry, this is absolutely not related to any major topic in this video, BUT Here in Russia no one ever says 'na zdorovie' when drinking. We do say so in the same situations English speaker might say 'You're welcome'. However, while drinking we can toast to one's health ('Tvoyo zdorovie'), to health of all people present OR when you refer your companion formally ('Vashe zdorovie') or basically toast to the general concept of health and being healthy and it combines last two with sentiment that people all around the globe would be healthy ('Za zdorovie').  So, in regards to this video particularly, I would like to say 'Spasibo' and lift in your health a cup of alcohol. Vashe Zdorovie!"
"I've just noticed that your wallpaper is made up of angry dogs and pigs and now I can't stop looking at it"
"The reason people are joining the Alt.Right is because of freaks like you. nobody likes a larping communist in a dress."
"This person claims it's wrong to make a 'homeland' for a people.  But, Israel did.  American politicians all support Israel (Zionism), and as a result America is forced to do Israel's dirty work (world police).  So they're causing the wars, and in turn the immigration, but speaking out against that makes someone a fascist?  I have to believe you are simply ignorant or I'll-informed.  The hypocrisy is saddening."
"As a centrist, the left needs strong leaders whom can take on the new conservative arguments one by one just like her. Instead the left throws temper tantrums. The left should always debate the other side with a strong argument like any political party."
"Are there more fascists now than say 20 years ago? If so why? Or are they just more visible due to internet/trump etc"
"I fucking love this human being more than they can imagine. Please let these video never stop you sexy ass bitch."
"I can't believe you're getting trolled this hard by *maybe* a few thousand Nazi LARPers online. Even the RL neonazis are being trolled by them. They just want to see people fight in the streets. Lmao."

"You say quite often 'well, that's what they want you to think' which causes a problem, in that it makes you sound paranoid and like a conspiracy theorist. Not saying you are. Just saying that's how it comes across."
"'Being honest about what we want will make most people instantly hate us.'  Really makes you think"

"I have a question.  If someone found an island that no humans have ever lived on and that person claimed that island as their own. Can they pick and choose who gets to come and live on that island with them? Or does Everyone have free rights to immigrate to said island. ( Note I have NOT put a race to the person who found said island)"

But that isn't the point of recruitment; fascism that's been re-branded and made more palatable scares me a hell of a lot more. Insta-subbed, and once I have more cash I'll def be a patron."

"I'm alt right and I saw nothing here to change my mind.  The right and left both have their baffoons and this is one of the left's buffoons.  Yes maybe living in proximity to some other races isn't dangerous but living in proximity to many of them as a shrinking minority is almost always or at the very least often dangerous and certainly does lead to extinction or near extinction but living next to a nationalist state isn't dangerous when it has to struggle to exist yet a nationalist state with the corrupt backing of a superpower like Israel is very dangerous to it's neighbors.  Everything in this video is hypocritical and not true.  White genocide is real and it is only happening to our countries and no one will really say why.  And Jews are behind it.  Barbara Loerner Spectre.  Yes we do take courage in our heathen heritage.  Why shouldn't we?  Black civil rights and the presence of non whites who often viciously want to take over all the highest places of our society and prevent our young people from reproducing.  Race country and culture ARE combined and it's obvious, everyone knows it.  That's why it's so crazy that leftists don't recognize it.  Double think.  Ready to discard truth in favor of propaganda.  Countries have fluctuated and existed in many forms but they have a common history and heritage, even if there are two dissimilar groups.  We are not living beside others we are being replaced by others.  Just about everywhere on Earth where two distinct groups coexist in one political entity one group dominates and terrorizes the other.  Chinese and Tibetans, Iraqis and Kurds, black South Africans and white South Africans, Israelis and Palestinians, and yes whites and blacks in America until 50 years ago but it is not always that simple.  Blacks were not the only New World slaves (many were white) and their subjegation was often not worse than the fate of many white people at the time it did not somehow benefit every white person and ultimately and even then it only hurt us and empowered the slaves.  They were not left behind 400 years they were pushed forward several millennia and although they did contribute some manuel labor that any one could have done which mostly benefited only a select few rich people but took work from the others but every opportunity the world has today is owed to the foundations laid by the more advanced society/culture created mostly or even entirely by straight white men.  Not to mention the facts that the white man fought a civil war on his own countrymen and even brothers to free the slaves and end slavery while the Africans who sold out their own people still practice slavery as well as some very culturally enriching practices such as militias waging 'rape war' on women and children even elderly, female circumcision, cannibalism, the hunting and dismembering of albinos, raping virgins as a means of HIV treatment!  Also Jews and Arabs and even Indians and Asians still practice slavery and the former two fassilitated the selling of blacks in historic times.  This man accepts some historical facts but ignores others, wishes to never give anyone a platform who disagrees with him, and at the end of the video addresses his fellow leftists as comrades which the Communists called each other and they of course murdered and tortured exponentially more people than the Nazis ever did only whites even as a majority are so self loathing as to deny themselves civil rights and when we're minorities we will immediately have no power, not even of protection, should the other races combine against us which they usually do.  A nation which protects it's racial integrity can exist sanely and peacefully just like all non Western countries currently do.  No ethnic cleansing, no boycotting of good ideas from other cultures, and no weird restrictions to keep everyone non white out.  Travelers, students, and workers can still come but not to the extant that there are constant terrorist attacks, mass rape (which is a hate crime, and the sickest kind), 24/7/365 tourism frenzy and the home group becoming token strangers in the streets of large cities in a matter of two generations.  It's genocide.  The American people 52 years ago wanted the"
"And one other thing - claiming that the Kekistan flag is a symbol of the alt-right is simply hilarious but also very FALSE. The flag is used by a variety of people - who only have one thing in common - they hate political correctness and they think it has gone way to far. Some Kekistanians are former Bernie bros, some are Gary supportes, some liked Jill Stein, others liked Ron Paul and yes a lot of them liked Trump - but as you can CLEARLY see, it is a very diverse group of people who have adopted the flag as there own symbol of rebellion against people, who are the 21st centuries version of the paranoid church ladies of the 80's, (during the satanic panic)who where constantly on the lookout for 'evil' sinners. - who they where sure, were everywhere ;-) - So lighten up people or you just might turn into the thing you feared the most as a teenager -and uptight, ignorant and overly paranoid grownup. :-)"
"Antifa are the real fascist - they use violence as a political method - which is the hallmark of fascisme. You might not like the alt-rights view's and that's totally fair - (even though most of their views are nowhere near as totalitarian and hatefull as u seem to think.) - but at least the alt-right is not running around attacking people willy nilly, for looking or thinking the wrong way. I got jumped at an anti-GMO rally cause i was wearing a red cap.. not even a MAGA hat - but a fucking Massey Fergusson (a tractor brand) cap. - in short: ANTIFA ARE THE FASCIST!"

"I'm a Libertarian, and although I can tell that this person is most likely left wing, it is refreshing to see a video that is intelligible, and serves as a looking glass to the otherside that actually make me challenge my own beliefs. The author of this video seems to have intrigue in the otherside, and has studied them to better understand them. With this ability they can discriminate who their real enemies are, and provides logical arguments against which does a much better job of informing me, and affecting my opinions then a drivel of emotion based upon misinformation and lies about an enemy they know nothing about. The next bit of information I collected about this video isn't too relevant to the rest of which I said above, but I'd also like to commend the uploader's video making skills. The video is generally visually appealing and stimulating to watch, matched with the charismatic speaker and good choice of music. To wrap everything I've said. I was at one point a centrist who wasn't too interested in politics. The actions of the far left wing and the heavily progressive sjw culture worked like a magnet that was pushing me away from them in fear. For some people this magnet pushing them away could lend them to the hands of fascists who make them feel safe and accepted.  I feel the worst thing that people on the left could do is what the author of this video mentions. DO NOT confuse right wing politics with fascism. Libertarians, right leaning centrists, and conservatives do not equate to fascists. Do encourage civil debate, and get to know what other people are like, like I am here. Echo chambers are always harmful. Grouping right wing ideologies as just the same as fascism will only give fascists more power, and lose your party favour."
"In the first 2 minutes already you've mixed up social ideologies and political ideologies. Fascism has nothing to do with white supremacy or antisemitism.

When saying 'I'm not a Nazi' is evidence that somebody is a Nazi, then everyone and no one is a Nazi. You are not talkimg about Nazis. You're talking about everyone who disagrees with the progressive left. This is a way to avoid actual convesation and argument and give yourself permission to dismiss those who disagree with you, and allows the justification of violence and censorship against conservatives or Trump supporters."

"one thing interesting about that propaganda video is he did point out that white people still have a thing we can be proud of, our country. fascists just dont like the things that they have. theyd rather have their ethnostate and a country where nobody has a right to be different than have a country like ours where things are shitty and obviously nowhere near perfect but where diversity is still encouraged and if you try to attack someone on the basis of gender, sexuality, race, etc. youre going to get a bunch of people attacking you and calling you out."

"I liked the video until we got to the kek pepe shit. The kekestani conservatives are NOT the same as actual fascists. There mainly just shitposters with center to fairly right wing ideals. There usually just a bit more authoritarian and right wing then the average libertarian. These guys are assholes but they CERTAINLY aren't fascists. They aren't authoritarian, most don't appear to be racist (I've seen quiet a few hispanic kekistani's), and they aren't pushing for a white ethnostate. Also pushing 'Western Culture' isn't always fascist dog whistling. Like Gavin McInnes and his proud boys are always on the trail preaching the supremacy of western culture but the Proud Boys are filled to the brim with different races and even sexualities...there only stipulation is being biologically male (I don't agree with Gavin on his views of Trans people). I enjoy Gavin a bit but I disagree with him on plenty but he certainly isn't a fascist."
"That was very interesting. Thanks!"
"Fascism has nothing to do with beeing white or a racist. Its just a political ideology like communism. But because hitler was 'fascist'(he actually wasnt he just imported some fascist parts) fascism must be the same as racism. Any country in the world could become a fascist one even a black country so inform yourself before you make a propaganda video"
"this video was great and comprehensive, comrade"
"As for the 'freedon of speech' defense that nazis tend to use, I have a simply response to it:  It is not 'violating freedon of speech' if I non-violently respond to what you said: As a manner in fact, that-Is-Freedon of speech. Freedon of speech on which only one side is speaking is not actually freedon of speech: If we were to go by that definition, Joseph Stalin would be for freedon of speech. Freedon of speech is about debate. On top of that, the First Ammendment is about what the government may or may not to: It forbids-The government-From controlling speech, but it does not means the owner of a private group, ranging from a newspaper to a Facebook page, doesnt have the right to control what is said within such group as otherwise it could create the impression they condone what is being said. On the hypothesis that a nazi( I prefer the term 'nazi' over 'fascist' personally when dealing with white supremacists ) that did not actually harmed or intends to harm non-whites( ... So, kind of like a virgin prostitute, then ) is to be legally held responsable specifically for peacefully expressing its beliefs, you can speak about your freedon of speech being violated. Until then, I am expressing my own freedon of speech: You have the right to your opinion, and I have the right to my opinion about your opinion.  This is probably not going to win over any nazis, obviously, as they arent actually for freedon of speech to begin with. But hopefully, it should at least leave clear to anyone watching the discussion that their argument is bullshit."

"Thats not the definition of fascism. It seems to describe white supremacy/Nazism, which are forms of fascism. Fascism is, in short, authoritarian nationalism often with an emphasis on racism. Its not exclusive to white people. Fascists violently oppose liberalism, Marxism, democracy, and anarchism. Fascism is often a reactionary response to the failings and alienation of capitalism, which Marx predicted and Spencer obviously tried to exploit"

"As long as you treat the alt-left the same. 'Fascist' and 'Nazi' is the most common phrases from 2017. Do you even know what a Nazi is? Fascist and Nazi are not the same thing. The alt-left Antifa group throw piss at people for disagreements, they carry illegal weapons in the street, they destroy statues yet the alt-right are the worst people? Really?"
"1:08 What you say these fascists believe, have nothing to do with fascism.  Fascists, right now, are cults like Antifa who use plenty of force to try and control things.  And say what you want, multiculturalism isn't a great thing, as it tends to great many schisms and can change things for the worse. A example is many of the muslims in europe who don't know they don't live in a islamic state.    Racism, based on what you said, maybe. But not Fascism.   7:50 This is so loose that you can point at literally anyone and say, 'You're a fascist!' Even though you're using the incorrect terminology for what you're actually accusing someone of, it doesn't matter what their answer is, you're going to assume you're correct. Which is dumb, and allows blind finger pointing without much behind it.   11:55 Funnily enough, black people actually circulate a culture that helps keep tension between police and themselves up. And instead of being able to ever properly accept fault when they fuck up, they want to blame the other party. And sadly, while police are at fault at times, there are many many black people committing crimes to such a disproportionate amount to their populace.   14:35 You know the equivolence of fascist violence and non-fascist violence? They're both violence and unexcusable. I've seen Antifa burn more businesses and attack more people than the other side. I've seen black life matter people torture more special needs children than the other side. Their use of violence makes them more fascist than those they claim to stand against.   16:40 That is what the free-speech clause is all about. Trying to suppress other peoples right to speak or gather will be turned around on those who use it one day, and that kind of thing will be absolutely entertaining with it's irony."
"An excellent video. Do you know anyone that's had any success with 'Replaying' the various talking points in the development of the current strain of fascist 'Alt-Right' thought, such as reframing Moldbug in a way that promotes socialist and communist talking points,  or dredging up old LRC / LvMI content in such a way as to demonstrate a clear path of irrational argumentation which led to the present, sad state of so many caught up in the neofascist mindset? I have been considering coming out and entering into such discourse, but simultaneously I'm more of a footnote than foreground type of personality. I think that viewing the development of the present syncretic ideology as an operational flow should help in understanding it as a series of thought formation queues, and that by understanding the flow of thought, which necessarily must be cyclical, we can then pinpoint specific points of argumentation at which to disrupt the flow. By exploiting these inconsistencies we can, while perhaps not convincing or converting, sow confusion, disrupting their rhetorical momentum and apparent vigor."
"This reminds me in a lot of ways ( though obviously not a direct parallel ) to a Sargon video dissecting the spread of 'Identity politics' through college universities.   I love watching both left and right build these boogey men that we must all fear. It's sort of amusing in a way. Yeah sure the alt-right exists and yeah sure Antifa exist, but neither are an existential threat to all of society. They are actually both very tiny minority groups who just happen to be very loud and very obnoxious.   As for dog-whistling. I actually agree with you there. The republican party has been doing that for as long as I've been politically aware so it's nothing new to me. I mean they've used the term 'Thug' for example since I was a teen I'm pretty sure. That being said it's not like the left doesn't have it's own sort of code language that it likes to use. Now whether that's actual leftism or neoliberalism is a whole other question in and of itself, but to pretend it doesn't exist is disingenuous.   I feel like if we really want to solve most of these problems the actual solution lies in our media and the corruption within our political system. The media on left and right play into these issues and divide us to help maintain their power over us, and the corruption within our political system has created a difficult set of circumstances for everyone ( which people of color being the most affected ) and as a result that's built up a lot of the tensions within our society as they look for someone to blame and of course our media points left or right to keep us busy fighting ourselves instead of fighting the powers that be."

"Shut up fucking retarded transgender!!!"
"well done. you put together a great video. After watching, though, I have come to a slightly different conclusion than you. the only way to tell if someone is a fascist is to have a conversation with them. Most of what you analyzed in this video was subtle messaging of fascist intent, and you even acknowledge that perfectly reasonable people accidentally blow these dog whistles, oftentimes using the messaging for its original intent. Really, you can not know what a person believes until you talk to them and dig deep into their beliefs. So what are we to do when we can't have long drawn out conversations with people. Don't assume intent. Evaluate the ideas that they actually express.  Someone argues that every race should have their own segregated ethno-states. Is he a fascist? doesn't matter. The idea is objectionable even if it treats all races equally, because it would require authoritarian measure to implement. Someone likes pepe the frog and kekistan . . . okay . . . I don't care. They're not actually advocating for any policy. The answer is to engage ideas, not people. Anyway, thought this might help you maintain some sanity. . ."

"What you said at 21:25 really resonated with me.  Are you a vegan Contra?  I became one a few month ago and now it really weighs heavy on me all the bigotry and excuses people come up with to continue to be complicit on an eternal holocaust of animals.  The question that finally made me realize that veganism was the correct moral position was, what trait absent in animals that if absent in a person would justify treating that person they way we treat animals.  Basically, you either accept that there is some trait that a human could lack that would justify slaughtering and eating a human unnecessarily as we do to animals, you abandon logical consistency and accept speciesism as valid, or you realize that mass slaughtering animals for reasons you would never accept being mass slaughtered for is wrong.  Carnism is the word which describes the mindset of human supremacy that people operate under to justify their hateful actions towards animals, if you read this Contra I hope you reflect on your own words and get out of the dangerous hate group of carnism and join veganism, if you don't know how to leave vegansociety and vegan dot com have a lot of helpful resources."

Just because the alt-right or fascist do a certain thing that does not mean everyone that does it is alt-right or a fascist. The way I see it Kekistan is an identity for people who hate identity politics, therefore, it tries to parody both social justice and white nationalist behaviour, talking points and catchphrases. Your argument would imply that free press of kekistan is a far left news show because its ironically parodying the young Turks and the Soviet flag. What the free people kekistan are trying to do is taking these alt-right memes and dog whistles and reclaiming them. Btw as an kekistani i see no reason to discriminate based on skin colour, after all every kekistani is green inside. #greenpower #hailShives  ps. I do not take kindly to you insinuating that the centrist are puppets of the alt-right. you naive soul, the far right are in fact puppets of the radical alt-centrist liberal fascist conspiracy to give free helicopter rides to all communist."

But, my mind always drifts back to him when I see the white pride types on television or marching- or yelling online. I'm all for free speech! Even as a tiny mixed woman I've spoken to actual neo nazis who are felons and have swastika tattoos.   But, man, oh man! Why do they never manage to recruit good-looking white men for that stuff? Or atleast impossibly fit ones? Nothing wrong with being average or homely, and I'm all for the chub n' tuck too. I just think as the master race, and one who knows of the splendors and beauty that lies in the white races,  you should have to. Y'know. Prove you wouldn't lose to anyone and everyone on tinder or in a fight."
"Great video. Mostly because of those eyes. Not so much the rehashed pablum of non-argument and snark that you presented as content. But because deep in those eyes I could see a crazy person full of longing for acceptance, a crazy fucked up little boy who wanted a way out, who found a temporary release from his childhood angst, and who now has to deal with the real angst of never, ever, ever finding a man who will mistake him for a woman.  At least you wont have to see the ethnostate."

"I have been watching centrist channels like armoured skeptic recently to broaden my viewpoints. And I couldn't put my finger on what was missing from their arguments on this. This is it. Instant sub."

"Fascism is a form of government and is not any of the things described in this video"
"Serious question: how can anyone legitimize communism/socialism when the ideology has literally morphed into violent, genocidal military dictatorships more times than not? I don't support Fascism either, my family suffered at the hands of Mussolini, but I must say, socialism has never looked much better. I think the only realistic leftist approach would be a direct democracy with similar economic position as now, but with more state run social programs. Far from fascism, but also quite far from any form of Marxism."

"I just found your channel and i really like your production value and thoughts. Buttt please your whole video gets undermined because you dont distinguish the words facism/ racism /totaliarism and nazism!  You seem so informed but cant you do a search on wikipedia what facism is? All you say is 'technically right' but it looks like you have zero idea what you talk about if you miss use the main term in your video."
"Um, yes, Contra, I am a so-called 'free speech absolutist', and proud of it, too. That does not mean I in any way think neo-Fascists contribute much of value to the 'marketplace of ideas', except maybe by negative example. However, I also consider the social cost of censorship to strongly outweigh any benefit, a point well proven by the often malicious use of hate speech and holocaust denial laws in European countries, and conversely, the failure of those countries to stop actual fascist movements. I also will note that at this historic moment, it's SJWs and their Stalinist allies that are pushing a monstrous attempt to roll back strong free speech protections in the US. That makes Antifa and the 'social justice' brats, like the alt-right, a part of the problem in this country not part of the solution."

"Kekistan was made to get AWAY from hate groups. Kekistan was made to fight corrupt ideologies such as communism and fascism. You're nothing but a disgusting authoritarian piece of human garbage. You are generalizing the right as a hate group. That's like me saying every liberal is an SJW radical feminist. I'm not a neo-Nazi and I don't support any fascist movements. In fact, I dislike them. The alt-right is an embarrassment to the right-wing because ignorant liberals like you are generalizing conservatives to be racist neo-nazis. Kekistan was made so people could post freely on the internet without people who are anti-free speech call the post 'hate speech' and say 'hate speech is illegal' (Which it isn't). Kekistan is about freedom, not oppression. So before you generalize a group, take a look at your own, because trust me, the group you're in is weak, pathetic, and the people in it are nothing but a bunch of special little snowflakes."
"This is nothing more than one big equivocation decathlon. The definition of 'fascist' is functionally limitless. If you're concerned about illegal immigration, that's a dog whistle, and you're a fascist. If you think the word 'diversity' on a job application has come to mean 'non-white,' that means you want to commit genocide because you're a fascist, and fascists love genocide. If you're accused of being a fascist by absolutely anyone, it's because you really are a fascist. If you deny it, that's because you're part of an underground conspiracy, and you've been instructed by some 4chan neckbeard to disavow your fascism if confronted by leftist detectives. Don't forget, if some communist 20-year-old outs you for the genocidal fascist maniac that you are, you need to just shut up and take it. If you weren't a fascist, then why would anyone accuse you of fascism?"
"I disagree with your definition of fascism because it doesn't include non-white fascists like the Japanese Empire or (arguably) ISIS. But still, great video"

"Your definition of fascism is completely wrong... What dictionary do lefties use? The definition if fascism is - 'Fascism is a way of ruling that advocates total control of the people. ... Fascism comes from the Latin fascio, meaning “bundle, or political group.” In fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle — one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force.'  Fascism is basically a police state. It has nothing to do with racism, at all. Nazis were a fascist government, but so was Spain and Italy at one point and neither are blonde haired and blue eyed.   Race has nothing to do with fascism. That's like saying democracy means having the right to own guns just because it happens to be in the American constitution. You understand?"

"One is entirely not false and if you look at demographics, 3 isn't false either. I wouldn't consider myself a fascist or advocate for fascism. I just think that the massive demographic shifts in western ( and yes, white) nations is harmful to the host population because it forces them to become 'multicultural' which dilutes their own historical identity and culture. When people like Lauren Southern and James Alsup point these things out it doesn't make them fascists, although James Alsup did say he was open to libertarian fascism which is pretty much what you're advocating for at 17:00 where anti democracy and freedom ideas are silenced but in my opinion, that could be a slippery slope.Also, I don't believe Jews are part of some global conspiracy to destroy the white race but I do acknowledge that they are over represented in higher up positions and there's nothing wrong with that being the case because Jews in average have a higher iq. Keep in mind, when I talk about average iq based on race, I'm talking about average and it is no way to judge an individual. I'm honestly not a fascist and respect other people and cultures, I just don't want places I have ancestry to be turned into multicultural platforms for the world. The post you showed at 18:28 isn't a 'fascist dog whistle'. It's more accurate to say it's a belief commonly held by white supremacists but it isn't exclusive to that ideology and I think it's a bit illogical to ignore the legitimacy of it. I'd also love to talk to anyone about this stuff if you guys want.  Ps: every prominent figure on the alt right condemned the car killer at Charlottesville so it's not really something you can say is celebrated by the alt right."
"I am one of them. The strategies you describe are real, but they are used by all the political spectrum. Nothing especial about it. What really concerns me are 2 things:  1st: What's wrong about it? If someone is against violence, discrimination or any other undesirable behaviour against any person, whatever his/her skin colour is, what is the problem about thinking that multiculturalism doesn't work, or works definitely worse than ethnically homogeneous nations and communities, as it's been more than proven?   What's wrong about ethnically homogenous countries trying to legally preserve such status to prevent ghettos and distrust among members of society based on invisible lines between different ethnic groups?   What about proven significant differences on average IQ between populations? What's positive in sentencing such different population in IQ terms to live together? One of them will have to suffer extra taxation levels and the higher unemployment levels and lower salaries coming with this model of society, to subsidise the other group.   The other group (lower IQ one) will have to be trapped in the welfare system leading to a serious disruption of the way a society should work. People's success no longer depends on how honest, competent or hard-working they are, but how close and serviliant they are to political power. The fucking third world.  Women no longer need to keep healthy relationships with their partners who will provide for them. They can be fucking around the most ripped, brainless, emotionally disfunctional, gansta rap-style stupid unemployed madafakas rather than committing in a relationship with a honest black guy (or whatever the ethnic group is) who will provide for her and their common children rather than being a burden for society making the government and everyone else pay for the results of their sexual urgencies.   In such communities to a great extent, there are no families, there is no love, there is no commitment, there is no emotional attachment between alienated children spending their lifes on day care and their slutty mothers. It is all about pleasing the government or political power who decides what welfare support must be given and to whom.The hell on earth. The big brother. A Stalinist nightmare. But, hey, I guess that is just what you want.  Does awareness on this proven facts make me a fascist? Well, maybe I am. So what? You hate me now? Be my guest. Fuck you.  2nd: Centrists' sensibility. You should think about how such hyper-sensibility was created. How is it possible that when islamic immigrants or members of coloured minorities are statistically overwhelmingly the ones responsible for terrorist attacks or common criminal violence against everyone else, including members of their own communities, there is still this terror to say anything that can be vaguely labeled as racist?  The answer is obviously the media and the propaganda from the globalist elite which is suffering massive decrease in its influence, something that makes me enormously happy. Internet, this wonderful invention is allowing people to network, to be interconnected in a way that allows us to bypass the traditional unidirectional media by which 4 motherfuckers in a meeting room could decide what the stupid mass was to be made to believe, and how their worldview was to be shaped.  Isn't it an obvious contradiction in your discourse the fact that the elites totally support your discourse? In your discourse, there is apparently the innocent, economically vulnerable victims who suffer the atrocious effects of the policies and discrimination of some 'invisible secret nazi elite' But the reality is that economic and political elites totally favour your political position and policies. Do you know why? Because the higher the taxation levels for small and medium businesses, the higher unemployment level is, the lower salaries are, the less educated, more desperate people are, the better for their power position never being questioned and themselves and their family sagas never being removed from power.  Immigration of low-IQ non-qualified populations is just what these elites need to keep wages down, demmand for their companies' products high, social cooperation and activism levels low and independent and small economic activities sabotaged and opressed through taxation in order to economically support the often unaware and unwilling cooperators of the elites.  By doing all this, countries most often are not able to keep their budget balanced, so they need to go more and more in debt, which is great for financial elites who control central banks. They will just print or create out of thin air the money they never had in the first place which will have to be returned to them plus cummulative interests enslaving the entire mankind. This is the evil power you serve. Mostly Jewish, if I may add."

"We need fascism for the following reasons:  Fascists opose moral corruption and embrace personal improvement.  Leftists embrace moral corruption and personal ruin.  We should thus take joy in insults from moral cripples and weaklings who use leftist idology as an excuse for their moral sickness.  Being called a Fascist by moral Untermensch is always a compliment."
"Great work but the 'I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say' is starting to spin out of control. It's going from an important psychological tool to a cheap but effective way to silence opposition within your own ranks. I.e. When another lefty challenges an SJW feminist on their sex negativity, all they have to do is call them fascist. When that person retorts with the natural visceral denial, the ground work for their guilt has already been laid"

"'I bet he is an isolationist not an expansionist  like the Nazi's'.  (America is not the same as Germany) This statement that you made is completely non-nonsensical. It clearly shows that you nothing about history or geography.    The united States geography dictated its strategy. Why do you think the United States joined the war so late? Could it be because their geography made a German invasion near impossible. The united states also controlled tons of resources and large variety and a large amount of oil which as you should know is very important. The united states however,  through manifest destiny has already claimed their 'rightful land' and resources previously.  For the Germans they are a country in Europe that has had a history of war with much of their land lost due to peace treaties. One such  peace treaty was the treaty of versaille which royally fucked over their economy and took a lot of their land in process.  The other factor is the Germany  did not have access to many resources like the states which by conquering Russia that would solve that problem.   Hitlers expansion into Russia makes more sense when you start to think about it.  Have you heard of the Russian stand at Stalingrad against the Nazi? Why would the Russian stand against the German army when with Napoleon their strategy was to burn everything and run east letting Napoleons army starve? The short answer is oil. Stalingrad was the Russian stand before Hitler could take the caucuses which is where Russians oil supply is located. as you should be able to see the Germans had much more of reason being expansionist compared to Germany."

FDR thought this so much that he sent his advisors to study it. Now Fascists are the ANTIFA, but don't get it twisted, ANTIFA are through and through communist. Nazis were also socialists, this is explained in Hitler's 25 point plan. This is why Progressives are the next genocide committers.  On a different point, you really are stupid when it comes to dog whistles and internet trolls. Learn before you speak on these subjects."

"Point 4, all whites are obviously not nazis and nor are all fascists nazis, indeed being fascist is not related to being white, western at all as certainly fascism can take root regardless of ethnic or racial background. The Chinese Great Leap Forward is a good example of authoritarian fascism.  That all whites are not nazis is obvious again and the connotation in the vid is mentioned how blacks feel when police view them as a group unjustly but the stats of violent crime impoverished blacks is much higher than baseline. I kind of wonder how often an officer would have to continually see the same thug culture to avoid general views of that sort. Blind justice while rioting fuck da police probably won’t scale well, conversely the blacks who’re just normal productive citizens get to avoid the issue, who knew.  The response movement from BLM is literally asking for white peoples wealth, not nazis, not fascists, but all white people. Overblown, they can’t recognize this message is itself self defeating much like blocking traffic.  I’m interested in hearing public speakers from these groups, fascists, BLM, antifa in an opportunity to discuss the issues civilly and to reach hopefully some mediation or consensus. At least so they can all fuck off. Having one group assert hate, another rioting, another using violence to suppress protected speech accomplishes nothing. The whole notion of this was to allow good ideas and bad ideas to be put up for review, critique and be relentlessly destroyed."
"Curious point, but what is precisely wrong with Europeans or those of western culture expressing and not wanting to have their own unique culture, ethnic, religion, nation, etc. to be displaced? I can’t imagine the concern elsewhere for virtually any other ‘group’ from a nation to be any different, it reeks of a double standard or special pleading."
"antifa is the most dangerous hate group because it pretends to be anti hate.. they are the real fascists.. white nationalism is horrible but it's not fascism idiot"
"I can't even bare to read the comments on any YouTube videos anymore let alone this one because I know how fucking right it is, and the trolls are gonna be ripe on this one and using the exact tactics and motivated reasoning and coded language she's laying out here. I know cause as a 'whiny liberal' (even though I am a centrist who has supported members of both major parties and the libertarian and green parties as well, but because I have a left leaning bent since I believe hurricanes are caused by extreme barometric pressure and not two tanned ripped gay dudes going to town on each other in the privacy of their own home, I am a 'triggered snowflake' because I am not cool with literal Nazis)I have dealt with these people (and sometimes bots) for years and I come from a hardcore racist southern community, so I've dealt with white supremacist assholes lots, and I have watched some of my own (usually less educated) friends, turn to this ideology. They are not *all* stupid, but the ideology is so obviously bankrupt. It shouldn't be a right vs left thing, it shouldn't even exist here, let alone be a threat, but I can see her breathing heavily, because these tactics *have worked* before. 'Who cares when it is the blacks and muzzies you normie! They won't come for you!' What if I decided to stand with them? When a facist/racist/anti-semite/'identitarian' (or whatever pompous blowdried label evil sadistic tyranny hides behind) is weak, he says, 'You're fine you're safe they're dangerous thugs crime terrorist attack violent leftist triggered normie reeeee reeee reeee.' But what if I decided to fight with them? To say no Muslim, or black, or asian, or Latino, or Inuit, white or rich or poor, (or any label politicians or internet trolls try to use to divide my brothers and sisters)no life is worth more or less than mine, and they should have any and every freedom that doesn't harm their fellow man, and that I would fight and die beside them, to provide them any opportunity I could have and more? When fascism is weak, it says 'We're only going after the threatening ones! Geeze you paranoid crazy!' When fascism is strong it's not an issue. They just label you a sympathizer and shoot you alongside the other captive 'inferiors' or 'criminals' or 'thugs' or whatever concurrent dogwhistles are convenient to demonize them and keep the centrists complacent. You think it can't happen here? Look at our police! Why does a civilian 'peace' keeping force need tanks? Look at the right wing ideology and the insane trolls who espouse it, whom we all know many, usually having at least one in our own family! These are the same kind of people who supported 'the fuhrers righteous quest to handle the Jewish threat to the state'(read: 'president Trumps righteous quest to 'make America great again') and these are the tactics they use and their only weakness is education. Some have no humanity left. These are the militarized ones, hard right conspiracy nuts, that use dog whistles like 'states rights' and 'our culture.' Some are just lazy trolls pleased to benefit from ethnic 'supremacy'(cleansing: that is what it always comes to.) Americans at the zenith of what defines us as a people rejected this ideology with our very God damn fists, teeths, and lives and I will be damned if I would live on my knees in their fucking nightmare 'utopia' fantasy in which the inferiors are appropriately subjugated, rather than die on my feet fighting it. Don't be one of the fucking assholes that slept peacefully while the 'state enemy' is shoved into 'labor camps.' And if you are, be straight about it, wear your fucking Nazi uniform and try to take over. Let's meet up. I will bring my friends, you bring yours. Let's see who has more. The ethnofascism in our country is old, and it has torn it apart before, but my generation is largely rejecting that ideology, and it already lost one civil war. You blow your dog whistles trolls. Blow hard. Like to see the fascist 'white nationalist' march shit in Brooklyn! Fuck fascism!"
"Thank you Jew Drag Queen Sodomite ! Now we know how to avoid fascism."

"this stupid poll smoker thinks we care what Antifa says about us?? LOL IDIOT we don't give a fuck what antifa says about us at their pathetic rallies .. the fact that this perosn has literally tried to redefine an ideology that has an exact and old definition.. newsflash you didn't discover you re transgender..you decdied to dress like a girl ..you still have a dick an even if you don't you still are an XY which make you a BOY and until you can change that you are just a boy in a dress you dim witted nut bag"
"did this man in a dress just call capitalism the same as fascism?? really?"
"uhm no this video might identify alt right nazi or racist but this person doesn't kmow what a fascist is ..nazis were racist snd fascist !! but the 2 arent mutually exclusive !! truly fascism hss been mis-defined .. true fascists believe in government control of the private sector.. the left has screwed with this definition because the real meaning of fascism accuses them without saying another word"

"yeah, Lauren Southern has nothing to do with fascism, because if she was, then she would be on youtube! due to being to o preoccupied in cleaning dishes whilst wearing a black shirt to make a video Ethno-nationalism is completely unrelated to Fascism, Mussolini, the founder of Fascism cared about whether or not you were loyal to the Fascist party, NOT about whether the person her was looking was white, black or fucking green! I argue with 'fascists' a lot, and not once have I ever heard the argument 'the German National Socialist German Workers Party hasn't existed since 1945' EVER! Pepe, has nothing to do with the alt-right, and even less to do with fascists, they just you it to trigger leftist snowflakes such as yourself! Sometimes these 'Nazi symbols' are genuinely solely there for shits and giggles (Pepe and the Kekistan flag are a perfect example of them)!  'Going down to Berkeley to protest the neo-Fascist rally there! nervous but determined to bring back 100 Nazi scalps!' -Antifa member day before one of the Berkeley riots. Nope nothing wrong with this! NOTHING WRONG AT ALL!  No, the fascists long term goal is not to create an ethno-state, that's the goal of the Ethno-Nationalist, NOT the Fascist, there is a difference. I'm going to be clear here: I don't care if what you have to say is the most Politically Correct thing ever, or basically quoting Adolf Hitler, you should still have the right to say it! Because otherwise bad things happen. and до свидания, товарищ to you too."

"What the fuck? You define 'Fascism' as 'White Nationalism'! Yeah, sure the National Socialists in Germany and the Fascists in Italy were fascists and white nationalists, but that was one case. Fascism, derived from the latin word 'fascis', which means 'a bundle of sticks', following that old saying: 'One stick breaks easily, but a bundle of sticks is strong.'. That is what Fascism means. It's not a single ideology, but rather the basis for a political system. Rather than being racist or sexist or anything like that, fascism is anti-democratic (Though even a democracy does require a basic cohesion of the people, without any cohesion, only Anarchy would be left) and authoritarian in the first place. Stalin's USSR was just as much a fascist nation as the Third Reich and the other Axis forces. As for how to recognize a fascist: Do they oppose pluralism? Do they oppose Free Speech and Free Press? Do they oppose basic democratic principles? Do they seek to restrain other people's rights? Do they use violence as a means of enforcing their political ideals? Do they believe people with certain common attributes should to be a unified community, excluding those without said attributes? And, optionally, but very often applicable: Do they hold any racial/national/religious/sex-,class- or political-related goals/biases and seek to enforce these upon others? If the answers to those are YES, the person in question is a fascist. Now, those criteria apply to the National Socialists, as well as many Communist regimes and movements and a certain, ironically-named, terror organisation called Antifa. The mere believe in a thing such as hate speech stands in opposition to the ideal of Free Speech, for it's called 'Freedom OF Speech', not 'Freedom FROM Speech'.   PS: 'All these 3 of these beliefs are false' WHAT? There is no such thing as 'false' in politics. Do you think, people do thing because they want to be evil and want to bad things because they're bad? There is no 'bad' or 'good', there are people who agree and act accordingly to current local moral values and there are people who don't. No political belief is false, because political ideas are not facts. Political ideas are (or at least, should be) based on facts, but they themselves are nothing but interpretations of facts. They can be dumb, they can be ineffective, incomplete, unrealistic, outdated, you name it, but they can't be 'false'. If one is so sure of their opinions that they call other opinions 'false', they are sure to be(come) extremists and, potentially, fascists. Your political ideals don't matter, it matters how you seek to establish them."

"I consider myself a libertarian. The way I see it is that the left is far too fearful of the shadow Nazis so when they see a few of them make the OK sign they think it has some secret meaning and when they freak out about it then the real Nazis make fun of them for it by mocking them. Free speech is something that I agree with and I don't care who is talking or what they say, removing another person from dialog doesn't mean that you are better than them it shows just the opposite. No one should have to deal with the threat of punishment to speak their mind. I don't judge any individual when it comes to race but I think that each state, city, and neighborhood has their own culture that makes them less or more likely to succeed in a capitalistic environment and there are outliers in these communities on both sides. I don't agree with that white supremacy stuff and if minorities start getting hunted down I would gladly pick up my gun and fight to defend them but I don't ever see a day like that coming and for the minor incidents that do slip through I think the justice system does a good job of taking care of it for us. The protests for each black kid that gets shot is stupid because normally they did something to deserved it and being white wouldn't have saved them. There's plenty of videos breaking down police shootings step by step showing why they got shot. I'm not antifa so I would love to hear some counter criticism."

"Fascism is not strictly anti-Semite or race purist, that is an idea adopted by the nationalist socialist of the third reich.   Nazism  ≠ Facism."
"How is it that this guy to be taken seriously about having figured out anything covert or secret. When he can't even be bothered to read up on politics and realise Facism and Nazism are separate and diffrent ideologies and movements. Hitler's Germany was a Nazi state, Italy was Facist. Also, how come he didn't just conflate Japanese people with it all just as easily. Japanese were also part of the Axis. Also, way to get trolled by 4Chan. This sounds like an epic witch hunt. I hope this is meant as satire of the opinions given here. Because it's funny how you don't notice you are a Nazi by your own definitions.

">calling people incessantly fascists  You obviously have no starting clue what Fascism is and neither can't wrap your demented brain around the concept that the people you associate with Fascism don't have the slightest connection to socialist ideas, which are essential to modern Fascism (Mussolini, Hitler, Franco, Pilsudski)."
"1:33 And I don't even have to watch your 'other three videos' to tell you that your assumption is false and have virtually nothing to do with Fascism. 1) Western culture is 'white', that is of European descent; including all its achievements and terrible failures 2) Although I would't call it 'masterminded plot', atheistic and zionist Jews were and are in the center of philosphical ideas that are seeking and teaching the deconstruction of age old cultural societies that until the advent of the 'Frankfurt School' and Freudian psychoanalysis have worked almost perfectly (see: Adam Curtis' Century of the Self; read: Horkheimer, Adorno, Fromm, Marcuse, Habermas -- all except Habermas are Jews) 3) The 'ethnostate' in Europe up until 1965 was the norm. Foreigners mostly came from neighboring European countries and had similar culture and were Europides as well. Returning to this condition is a legitimate demand and does not forbid foreigners of another race to travel to, visit and conduct business in such an ethnically homogenous country.   All these three points have existed in European debates before any fascist movement. These three points are merely the three key assessments of the *Ethnonationalist Movement,* of whom many like to banter with fascist aesthetics in order to overstate their points and drive you unfunny malcontents up the wall.  Therefore, your assumptions are as moronically infantile as your obsession with womens clothes ... perv. The counter culture will rise and sweep you away to the outer fringes of society, where you belong."

"I love the style of your presentation, but I do disagree on pretty much everything you said and most importantly on what fascist is. Also I do disagree with most of the points you argue against. To keep it short I'll just say this- you shouldn't attack identity or some arbitrary defining word (fascist in this case), that's what racists do, instead attack an idea or argument they present. Nothing is inherently evil, but some things are not compatible with some virtues, define those virtue and argue against what hurts them. Lastly, you are racist too, because black, white, Asian and ect. are arbitrary races, color of the skin is no different from eye color, hair color our body type, but have you heard about pear-shaped races? I didn't, so why do we give so much attention to them is it really only because other people do that? P.S. on average members of those 'races' may differ, that doesn't mean every individual is the same."
"I'd rather be a national fascist than a globalized communist. Praise kek."
"You've put a lot of effort into doing just this one video, I have only just come across you in my never ending browsing of youtube. Just want to say thanks for this entertaining, interesting, thought-provoking documentary (documentary yes?) Damn.. you've put some amazing music to this video. One thing I took from this video was to think about speaking up more whenever, if-ever I hear or witness fascism. Obviously, if I find myself in a group of fascist neo-nazis, I'm gonna get the hell out of there, but if I hear something controversial and I know I can perhaps set it right by peaceful debate, I will. Rather listen to the rhetoric spewing forth from their mouth, I'll challenge it. I'm no left activist, I don't identify myself with anything (does that make me a  centrist? I don't even know what that means). I don't really like Humanity anymore.. it's become weird, too involved with in-talk and secret code language. Possibly because of the internet and social media. I grew up before the internet. (80's child). I grew up with Thatcher  battling it out with the Coal miners. Anyway. Cool video, I'll look at what else you've done here. Bye :)"

They want Ireland to be Irish and France to be French.  7:40, 8:30: 'If a person has views that I have preconceived as fascist then they are a fascist and there can be no room for nuance nor further debate'  11:48 How would you know, whitey?

"Left- right meh,i just want to watch the world burn"
"wait, hold on, this isn't the actual definition of Fascism in general, this is the definition of White Supremacy and specifically White Fascism... the general definition though is 'a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce.'   so okay, moving on... as a white mostly-straight-but-kinda-into-chicks-with-dicks cis male, i personally think that white nationalism is an outdated idea that gives me cancer trying to imagine that some people actually believe this would make a better world for anyone.   with that said though, as an extreme libertarian, i would not force them to live next to anyone they didn't want to live next to, so yeah, the white nationalists can all move together and fuck off, i don't care either way so long as they are not fighting people or trying to impose laws to support their whiteness.   people tend to criticize me for not talking about the far right and/or alt right, but this is mostly because they don't really own anything, and very few people even take them seriously, at least no one with any sizable power, and no, don't say Trump, like, Trump may be a fucktard, but he isn't alt right, he is just a fucktard replublicunt, and he isn't the worst ideologue on the right-wing, but i definitely don't really have anything nice to say of him.   ~cries~ i just want people to all become Voluntaryists and end the government ~cries~   by the way, fuck Nazis, i hope they all get cancer. with that said, i do not advocate violence upon those merely speaking their minds. but still, i hope they all get cancer. anyone who actually believes, like, truly believes in Nazism is not welcome in my existence. that is the absolute opposite of my Libertarian beliefs, so Nazis can all fucking go get leukemia.   oh holy shit, you got Shaun to narrate in this video? :O omg, i love Shaun! he is just so awesome, like, he is of the very few leftists i feel like i can take seriously. even though i feel very strongly about Libertarianism, i will admit there are times where Shaun nearly convinces me of becoming a leftist again, but alas, there are too many things holding me back from becoming a leftist again.   sigh... like, like... like... why... why are white nationalists so obsessed with these ideas, like, can they just fuck off? there is absolutely nothing fucking wrong with multiculturalism, but the only thing i must say as a libertarian is that it helps that when people move to close proximity to one another, that they have a sort of chemistry and level of tolerance for each other.   i myself only oppose mass immigration that's conducted by a government, because this costs A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY, but otherwise i have no issue with random people from other lands coming over here via their own means, especially if they wish to contribute and work and be an active member of society.   in fact, i am such a damn anarchist, i would never even report an illegal immigrant to the state, because fuck the state, like, i do not really respect 'country borders' the only thing i respect is private property, and as long as a foreigner respects private property, that is all i care about, like, this whole 'protect the borders' shit makes me roll my eyes.   i don't believe Lauren Southern is a fascist, that is a bold claim. but i will say that she has said things that are questionable and misrepresented information at times, so i had lost respect for her and unsubbed from her channel.   there was this one bitch named Rage After Storm, i followed her online for a bit, but she started some real fucking drama and after considering some of the things she has said, i have a feeling she was secretly a white nationalist with some fascist leanings.   this kind of depresses me because i really thought she was super hot, like, i really would have banged Rage After Storm, for hours even, like, just eating her pussy for hours, but alas, her bigotry made my penis go limp, so i was kinda glad she got chased off the internet because she shit talked one of my favorite bands, Linkin Park, after Chester Bennington killed himself.   i'll admit, a lot of fascists hide behind the satire of Kekistan, but just make sure to have a conversation with someone who went along with the Kek memes before determining if they are actually fascists. a lot of libertarians use the Kek stuff just because they find it amusing, and not because they support oppression or something.   but you do realize Antifa protests against regular conservatives as well? it's not that they are opposing much of actual fascism, but instead are trying to bully conservative speakers, a lot fo the time, without any legitimate counter arguments to some particular speakers.   while i disagree with a lot of what Milo Yiannopoulos says (quite a lot actually), the way the left have dealt with him publicly speaking is absolutely abhorrent and childish. even more so, what was the point of people protesting Ben Shapiro recently? Ben is one of the most logical and even fair-minded individuals i have ever heard of from the conservative party.   i'll admit, i don't agree with everything Ben talks about, which should be obvious since i'm Libertarian, there were bound to be differences between me and him, but even so, he conducts himself very well, and he isn't a total asshole about his ideas, unlike Milo Y. which i can see that people probably don't like how cheeky Mile tends to be.   i find Milo Y. amusing, but otherwise i only agree with him on the free-speech front for the most part, otherwise so much of him irritates me of how flawed his thinking is, i tend to not follow his videos too much anymore because of his contradictions and handful of far right ideals.   but would i call Milo a fascist? not necessarily, but i do think he needs to reconsider his position on certain issues because he has a poor view on immigration and abortion. as for Ben Shapiro though, no way, he is not a fascist, he's much closer to libertarianism than the average conservative.   if you actually take the time to carefully listen to the kinds of things Ben says, and try to understand his logic, you would have to admit he doesn't have any fascist intent. the things he says that i don't agree with are obvious conservative positions, but i wouldn't say he was overtly fascist about such things, it's just typical viewpoints that those on the right tend to have, and are based on their moral systems.   i can't fault someone for having a viewpoint based on their ideas of pragmatism and moral ideals, and as long as they don't plan on causing oppressive laws to be passed based on their ideology, i don't see how they would be considered fascists for expressing their side of things.   Chris Ray Gun's tweet does make a fair point, this is a legitimate question actually... why is it okay for a country like Japan to reject non-Japanese people from immigrating to Japan, but America must be expected to allow anyone? like, this is more a concern about why other countries are not criticized for their strict immigration policies and why leftists do not call those countries out for not accepting diversity.   so like, i'm kinda a weeb, i probably have no right to live in Japan to begin with because i can barely speak any Japanese, but what if i could speak Japanese? everything i learned about immigration to Japan is that you can't, lol... like, they only accept those with Japanese heritage to move there, and there are exceptions, but i heard they are really difficult to achieve if you don't have native Japanese DNA, like, the government has to approve of you immigrating and they are very picky from what i heard.   why is there no liberal movement bitching at Japan for not allowing weebs to move there and buy panties from vending machines like they always dreamed of doing? :'(   in all seriousness, i could never live in Japan. CDs cost 30 dollars, guns are super illegal (you can only have a shotgun or a 'airsoft gun' both of which require registration) not to mention that even though they have very weird and flamboyant pop stars and tv shows, they are otherwise very intolerant of people who look and/or act weird in the workplace or even in school. so yeah, fuck that, lol.   anyways, i think i said my 2 cents.  P.S. you're very beautiful <3"

You and I are pretty much on opposite views and opinions it seems on most subjects, but you seem to be rather sincere to me so I decided to check out your content.

I just wanted to communicate a bit about this video as I watched it to give an honest opinion from someone who disagrees that isnt just shtpsting. I know its a lot, and im not sure it will be read but I recently decided to try and have some dialogue with the other side and see if I can better understand how they see the world, and maybe in the process share how i see the world. Ideally the goal would be for there to be less misunderstanding between both sides which will de-escalate some of the hate that is going on, because we do not need as much hate a division as we have in our country today I firmly believe the only way to stop it is for everyone to try to understand each other instead of just labeling each other (Which lets be honest, both sides do). On the first 3 points :   1.) Western Culture being a dog-whistle for believing race and genetics are what is better. As someone who would identify myself as a Western Chauvinist it is 100% about the culture, especially for America. America, unlike most other countries does not really have a default race. We are and have always been a vast mixing pot of races, religions, and other cultures. The blending of all those combined with the desire for each to escape persecution  created a unique culture of its own that put personal and individual rights as the single most important thing. If someone who is truly a Western Chauvinist thought  it had to do about European Genetics then they could not at the same time sincerely be a Western Chauvinist as Western Culture is mostly from the US and spread to other places (mostly).   2.) I have been a long time browser of the chans, and 'the jew issue' is mostly a meme. Yes, there are some small fringe groups that take it seriously and believe it, but they really had no real presence and were not taken seriously by anyone but their own. I think in the last 2 years a lot of the way the left has acted has made martyrs of some of these people, and that has caused a bunch of people who normally would not remotely even think of joining up with them decide to join up with them. Extremism creates extremism. Its like a pendulum swinging, if that makes sense. The people who think this are White Nationalists, as not all alt/new-right think this, or even a majority.  3.) This is basically the same as 2. Yes, uneducated people do think this. I think for the majority of people (even those on the alt/new right) think this is absurd.   Lets now move on to the propaganda video. I dont disagree things like this exist, but its not just White Nationalists. The left has massive, massive amounts of its own propaganda that is done in the exact same way as this video. Stiring up the pot with ideas that there is this big group of people full of hate, wanting to genocide people for no reason other than their race. Its literally the same message both sides are saying, but with a different target audience. I hate when I see it on the right as much as I detest it when I see it on the left. I felt it used to be a lot more common from the left (mostly due to 95% of the media industry being super left) but recently I feel a lot more of it is happening from the right as well and it disappoints me.   I also noticed one of the tweets you used as an example of a fascist back peddling was bakedalaska. I admit I dont watch much of his content, but I have heard hes around Richard Spencer level of thought. This being said, Im pretty sure he was recently blinded with hydrochloric acid. This was done not in self defense because he was being violent with anyone, but because the person who did it saw him as sub-human (due to viewing his opinions as evil) and wanted to both punish and silence him using force. Extreme force. This to me seems like much more a fascist way to act, in terms of using physical violence to intimidate, punish, and silence a class or group of people in order to promote your own political agenda. This is the same mentality that ANTIFA and BAM have, both well known and well documented as specifically using force and intimidation to push their political agendas. Even if I agreed their cause is moral and ethical, by using these tactics (fascist tactics) it nulls the point. You cant claim to have principles if you do not apply those same principles consistently to everyone. In other words you cannot claim to be against fascism, while committing fascism yourself.. even if you claim you are doing it to fight fascists.   The /pol thread is also a bit silly, if you were intending it to be representative of what most alt/new-righters think or feel. That would be like saying stormfront is what most of us think or feel.   I also do not think dog whistling is really as common as people claim. I think this simply because the amount of people that are racist in America these days is so small and insignificant that there would be next to no political gain on a national level to even do so. I personally see the term dog-whistling as a way to assign motive and make assumptions about what a person is thinking and feels that is not based on what they are actually saying or doing. In other words I feel it is massively intellectually dishonest.   I had to cut this short unfortunately as its getting a bit late and I have a few things I need to do before bed. Once again I disagree with you on most everything, but enjoy the sincere way you are presenting what you believe and why. Sorry for the wall of text, but im not good at putting thoughts to words and wanted to attempt to accurately state my views. When I have a bit more time, I will check out the remaining half of the video."
"This was beautiful. *tear"
"Duuuuuude (i call everyone a dude, to me it does not hold any specific gender), your video is amazingly edited, the lightning is great, the sound quality could be better but the costume fucking sells it forever. You got yourself an amazing product here, really well put together. Props to you for showing the 'skeptic community' how to add quality to their boring-ass content. ♥"
"This dude wants to demonize, not understand."
"You're re win a pass for the reimmigration to the Cuckistan"
"Lol Daaaaaamn what a ruthless channel. The racists and weaklings are furiously pushing the dislike in this one. This youtuber just pulled them from the clouds they had their minds instantly lmao"
"I know you shadow banned/ erased all my comments that were not under others.     Now you can go ahead and allow my comments to prove me wrong."
"Lolli lolli lolli get your fascists here.🤗 You have some good points, but the instance you begin shitting on the bill of rights, you become what you claim to oppose."
"TIL that the Vikings fought against civil rights - THE FUCKERS!"
"i thought it was HOME when it started playing, ah, omg."
"When you read the post about fascist strategy for appealing to normies, I briefly had a similar reaction about wishing the left would act that pragmatically. And maybe in an abstract sense that's still the goal. But the strategy post made a point about normies refusing to identify dog whistles as such and being persuaded by them. I don't think those latent triggers are available to the left in the same way. I think lefty pragmatism may be about building vocabulary, surfacing meaning, and creating transparent communication tools that don't quite exist yet."
"what I'd like to undesrtand is that why if a culture tries to evolve to an equality ideal ? protecting itself from what seems or is hostile to that path , is that fascism, self defense, survival or worthless ? And isn't irony a thing that's standing for itself ? if you fake irony , that's no basically irony , that's a lie (conscious or not). Paranoïa is admitting the limits of  such a  theorem, and in my opinion , could be a ground for a symetric kind of fascism.  I've follow some debates on both side , again as a foreigner , and I still don't understand how shutting someone down by the violence is the most common way to contradict the alt right  , isn't that underestimating the average ?"
"But what do you stand for? You're the fascist. You stand for blurred boundaries but yet nothing much else in particular, and disavowal of anyone who does not subscribe to your dogma. I'll keep on watching, but your conflation of fascism with nazism is already a red flag"
"OK, I've dithered and been reluctant. I really don't like this at all. It punches all the wrong buttons for me. But I just made contact with one 'Cultured Thug' on you tube, completely sold on fascism. And a centrist who is very much listening. I couldn't reach either of course. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpyHFWbcDmo  I will be personally buggered and dead in a ditch before I let the Authoritarian Right or anything resembling Nazism gain a foothold. It has been proved to me many times that the Nazi theory of 'its not your fault it's all a Jewish plot' is too vampirishly seductive to be allowed any breath at all. My government has moves in place to tackle on line hate speech so I don't think anything more than building a better more shining example is needed here in the UK - but the poor bloody Americans !!   What can I do? I don't think my skin tight black jeans and boots will fit me any more, nor would I subject the world to my former youthful self - I was a mess. But inside - same deal.  Enough is enough! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0OzZ3yG3mE"
"Your lipstick is uneven and that's really bothering me."
"This video just flushed the roaches out of hiding, look at how desperately they try to deflect without debating her points."
"Lmao!!!! This video is a joke"
"You're engaging in very muddy thinking and throwing around these accusations so easily. Things are not gonna end well if everyone starts becoming mind readers and assuming what everyone is thinking. I watched your discussion with Sargon and you don't seem to have thought through your principles."
"2:10 'I'm a Roman'  This alt-righter has displayed his lack of historical knowledge. The Roman Empire often assimilated both other peoples and elements from other cultures; there was even an Arab emperor at one point.   13:12 There is a hypocrisy in how alt-righters will write off their derogatory posts as 'jokes', but if a nonwhite person said the same, (or even just criticise white-centric institutions) said alt-righters accuse said nonwhites of being 'anti-white'."
"Nigga"
"Take a shot every time she says Fascist."
"Alt-left is neither a made up concept or a description of people like you, but actually a synonym for movements like national-bolshevism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bolshevism (on the internet shortened nazbol) and national anarchism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National-anarchism ). Donald Trump saw a reportage who briefly named the people who used that word for themselves and missunderstod it as a word you could place on internationalists like Antifa. Alt-left should if used in it's original meaning be read as 'nationalism in likeness of that of the alt-right's combined with anticapitialism, which is widely understood as leftist' rather than 'fascist in the methods but leftist in ideolgy'. So the alt-left concept we are seeing today is built on a missunderstanding of an actual ideological term."
"Are you trans? Or just cross dressing? I'm very confused as to what the point of this is anyways..."
"White am White and happy I am gonna beautiful White kids :)"
"I absolutely love your videos you're hilarious and insightful"
"It's Contra's voice already changing from the hormones? She sounds more feminine than usual here."
"If you want to go through life in constant fear that every white person who disagrees with you is a fascist in disguise go ahead. We will see who gets consumed by paranoia and hatred in the end."
"What do you think the implications are of allowing some forms of political violence and some forms of 'free speech' but not others? When antifa holds punch a nazi meetings they are NOT acting in self defence, they're starting a fight the nazis will be incited to finish"
"I actually made a new kekistan flag based off the American flag,I thank you for noticing the antifa people that are not fighting true facists and beating up people that have done or said noting wrong"
"I support trump BUT do not agree with everything he says. I am not a facist at all, I fucking hate white supremacist, neo nazis, racists, and true facist. Hey people milo and ben are not nazis at all."
"Milo yiannopoulous and ben shapiro are NOT facist is any way. And if the think there are for them having there own political opinions you are a fucking dumbass"
"Regarding 'Should I debate this fascist?' It's probably okay to do if: 1. You have a much smaller platform than they do. 2. Your base are not susceptible (I.E. Your primary audience are Marxists or something)."
"Nice video! You say decent reasonable things in a charming hypnotic tone of voice. (Kinda rare for a yankee youtuber!) I would definitely buy a vacuum cleaner (or a subscription to the L.A. Gazette) from you."
"I'm paranoid too.  Anyone else notice the wallpaper is full of koalas?"
"so that clears up a lot. tho as a centralist i will first congratulate you for being open to talk. we need more videos like this. but now for the pick. 4chan really is not fascists but more sre trolls. the strategy of combating them is ineffective because they just want tbe attention and want to offend you so by getting offended you are giving into their game so best not to feed the trolls. as for neo nazies, i tend to laugh at them because of their core beliefs that skin matters (not a fan of religion either) but antifa and censorship is not the best of ideas to combating those threats (and i thank you for reconising the different positions in the anti SJWs political sphere). all your doing with those strategies is giving your selves bad PR which is not good. also repeating the same strategies that the far right extremists have done to you guys threw history does not help either. racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry is not ok no matter who you are which means the whole privledge thing needs to die. skin colour does not matter. vilionce is not the answer and judge people as individuals. so yeh publicly shaming people with response videos in a respectful way (as in debunk them) is a powerful thing. so let them talk so we can respond in kind. it worked on the extremes of Christianity."
"agreed, fascists use freedom, but in their end goal don't really want freedom.  I keep telling my Asian immigrant neighbors that Trump's supporters are not really conservatives, they use Asians to say, hey, GOP is not racist, but I know Bannon's end goal is not a free nation for all, but a white nation."
"Thanks for decoding this stuff, sorry you had to watch a bunch of alt-right bullshit to do it."
"Lordy, you really need to brush up on your Russian pronounciation xD"
"Thanks for clearing so many things up in this! It has been really awful giving contra just because I kinda felt they were wrong and not being able to give proper arguments :)"
"It's not hard for me to resist fascism, it's very easy... They would have thrown me in a gas chamber. Which is why I see the fascists as my mortal enemy, you must be destroyed!"
"Lefty cucks fuck off and die! One How dare white people want to have a culture of Their Own?"

"OH FOR FUCKS SAKE FANTANO STILL GOING ABOUT IT"
"Most Americans do not want Antifa or the alt right to have any real power to rule their lives. Let them die in their rage."
"(6:50) yeah yeah> this assertion of the 'dog whistle', problem is> libtards can endlessly dishonestly claim  anything they want to be a dog whistle> and convict any conservative they choose of 'thought crimes'."
"5-6minutes in> ive grown to hate you. you are a deluded idiot> you have no idea what an actual fascist is. Antifa and BLM are fascists. fascists believe in using violence against their political opposition> tick for antifa, blm. fascists do not believe in free speech> tick, again. fascists believe in hardcore leftist tribalism> tick. fascists believe judging people not as individuals but by which group they belong to tick..."
"No no no no no sweetie!....you MUST engage them. The free and open battlefield o of ideas is the forum. Love it, hate it...who gives a fuck ?!...that's where the difference is made. Every other avenue had been tried and failed to the tune of > 100 Mil human lives  That's the point of the free and open forum : the good ideas will win out. If you have so little faith in your  own ideas, perhaps subversion and oppression really is your shtick.    And that's why you never did nor ever will have a snowball's hope in hell of achieving anything other than hellish oppression at the point of a gun."
"The problem here is that under these criteria you could identify anyone from centre-left to alt-right as a suspected fascist."
"I'm ok with Gays, Transexuals (the normal kind) and non-whites (as long as they assimilate into our culture, something that doesn't usually happen). I do not like muslims however, and I think we should heavily regulate and prevent immigration from muslim countries. So I guess I am a bigot, but not a fascist."
"Oh, it's a dude."
"Fucking freak...."
"Are you fucking serious with this video are you even a human being and the reason I say that isn't cuz you Queer as a $3 bill it's cuz your brain don't work right you must be mentally challenged"
"Wow those Nazis sure are good at staying under the radar! In fact it turns out Che Guevara wasn't a commie he was actually a Nazi! Just check out this quote: 'The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.'"
"I'm sorry it took me so long to realize how beneficial your perspective is to my life.  Here's I've mainly focused on listening to those I disagree with.  Very educational.  I would appreciate a video on book recommendations sometime for someone who would like their brain to grow."
"When it comes to symbols, how can you tell the difference between the actual fascists who seek to ACTUALLY change legislation 'under the radar' and the people who think it is funny rile people up in forums by acting semi-nazi?"
"LOL!! Nice adams apple!!"
"Speaking of previously innocuous symbols co-opted by fascist, the prime example is the swastika itself."
"Nice try...  Question 1 as you pose could also be worded as such and make just as much sense.  1.  People of African heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as 'the black race' - sometimes dog-whistled as 'Black Culture'.  1.  People of Asian heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as 'the asian race' - sometimes dog-whistled as 'Asian Culture'.  1.  People of Hispanic heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political unity known as 'the latino race' - sometimes dog-whistled as 'Latino Culture'."
"When all the evidence that shows someone isn't something is just more evidence that they are in fact that thing, you've bought yourself a one way ticket to crazy town. This is precisely how conspiracy theories work. Every piece of evidence showing the conspiracy is false, is just another piece of a larger conspiracy. I don't really get the need to 'identify' fascists. Just listen to what people have to say and if you don't like it, tell them why.   You shouldn't want to control what people hear as a way to control what they think. That's more or less the primary concern when it comes to authoritarianism because it's the thing that leads to everything else. It's also your stated stance on speech. It's entirely possible to be one of those liberals or centrists you mention, yet still be entirely unmoved by the right."
"The left makes more 'alt right' members than any propaganda or rhetoric could ever dream of. I hate fascists, and I can't wait until the next antifa gathering so I can go smash some leftist tranny fascist skulls."
"The problem with this video is that it essentially equates white nationalism/racism with fascism when the two are, in fact, separate things.  1) Not all fascists are of European heritage either historically or even in our own times.  Fascism was quite popular as a political theory and movement in the 1920s and beyond in Latin America and Asia for instance. There's no doubt that Balasaheb Keshav Thackeray (died 2012) was a fascist but he was not white.   The Blue Shirts Society in China was fascist.  None of its members were white.  The National Socialist Japanese Workers' Party (国家社会主義日本労働者党 Kokka Shakaishugi Nippon Rōdōsha-Tō) is a Nazi party in Japan.  None of the members are white.  They are all Japanese.  2.1) Some Jews were fascists.  Of the 117 original members of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, founded on 23 March 1919, five were Jewish.  Margherita Sarfatti was an influential Jewish member of the PNF whom Mussolini had known since he and her had been members of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and she had been his mistress, she helped write Dux (1926), a biography of Mussolini. One of the Jewish financial supporters of the Fascist movement was Toeplitz, whom Mussolini had earlier accused of being a traitor during World War I.  Another prominent Jewish Italian Fascist was Ettore Ovazza who was a staunch Italian nationalist and an opponent of Zionism in Italy. 230 Italian Jews took part in the Fascists' March on Rome in 1922.  2.2) Claiming that contemporary fascists want a homeland for whites only automatically means you are directly equating all fascists with all white nationalists.  a) By the same token then, all black nationalists must also be fascists for they too want their own homeland.  b) Clearly many white nationalists believe in a limited republican form or government according to their own words and actions.  Thus, your claim simply can't be true.  You're simply making sweeping generalizations that make no sense."
"Btw, it's ironic how many alt-right trolls came to comment here, not realizing that every one of their comments is a perfect illustration of the strategies so eloquently detailed in this video. You can go through every single one and pair them with one of the things Contra said. It's almost scary how accurate this video was and how the alt-right trolls are so desperate to discredit it only to prove it 100% correct."
"Someone desperately needs to translate this video into German, you are describing with frightening accuracy and clarity exactly what i have observed happening not just in America but in Germany as well.   Now that the alt-right party AfD has won 13% of the vote in Germany and has seats in parliament, it is crucial more than ever to educate the people about the vile strategies and deception tactics employed by these covert fascists. It will not help that the other German parties have vowed not to work together with the AfD, as long as centrist conservatives keep falling for the tricks that these people use, and centrist liberals keep letting it happen by being passive, democracy and freedom itself are in graver danger than they have been since 1945.   And of course (unfortunately) Germany and the US aren't the only ones affected, France, the Netherlands, the UK, Poland, Hungary... these people are working in every European nation to further their racist agenda. In some we have managed to defeat them politically for now, but in others they have been disgustingly successful. Not since the end of WW2 has the threat of fascism in Europe been this bad. We mustn't let this disease spread any further, if we get to the point where we have rehash of 1933 in a European country it is already too late. The disaster must be averted NOW."
"C'mon man, Antifa is just a name they gave themselves. You cannot just defend them by saying 'but it's not as bad as fascist violence because it's antifascist'. There's much more to the Antifa movement than their 'antifascism'."
"19:43 At least she admits she's crazy."

Ad 6) Beware jokes about spells, probably witch says them. Nah, just assume only witch tells jokes like that. Less thinking. Ad 7) We can do no wrong! Ad 8) Ignore witch arguments, its sorcery Ad 9) Only we have right to speech! Crush witch lies!  If you do not agree it means you are naive.   Ugh, this video textbook of paranoia.

"My brain's wig is snatched!"
"This is why the left will continue to lose. You are insane, nothing more.  Whites are the least racist race in human history. Despite what you think, whites aren't the first, only, or last race to have slaves. In fact, we've died to end slavery within our borders, even other's borders; no other nation has ever done that.   The U.S. is the most diverse country on the planet, yet you think it specifically is racist. Go to China and tell the 95% Asian population that they're racist for not having more diversity, you will be shot. Go to the Middle East and tell them they aren't diverse enough, you will be thrown off a building (hell you'd be killed before you could even say it). Go to South America and complain that they aren't more diverse...etc. etc.   You try to call the alt-right Fascists, but the Fascists were leftists and socialists. You can argue about it all you want, ultimately you need mass government to enact Fascism, which is an ideology of the left!   But clearly you aren't an intelligent person."

"To me, fascism is tribalism around identity enforced with violence.   People are gregarious which leads them to feel happy when they are part of a group. They become part of a group when they contribute to a group, leading them to have and feel worth to the group and to being accepted by the group. In return the resulting synergy means every member is capable of extracting and enjoying greater benefits from the environment then they could individually accomplish.   On a smaller scale, this may be observed as groups forming around roles of individuals. The tribe is a group of individuals performing worthwhile roles and the success of the tribe depends on the successful organization of roles.   When a tribe gets large enough that the roles are performed by multiple people, those multiple people form their own tribes, with their organized roles endorsed as structural roles, to perform the function of the larger role. When that happens, the perspective changes and a new tribe forms and the larger tribe is properly identified as the collective, i.e. a collection of tribes.  The members of tribes within the collective now achieve happiness within the tribe by contributing to the tribe's ability to contribute to the collective. Leading to individual worth being invested in tribal worth and that is what creates group identity vs. individual identity.   People should naturally develop such an understanding unless such development is obstructed. The lack of such an understanding results in people mistaking the group for the collective. This leads to being overly invested in group validation as confirmation of worth rather then contribution. It also leads to conflating organization with structure and to the dogmatic support of structure. It also leads to distancing from the objective of extracting benefits from the environment. That gets coupled with the association of said environment to the human environment, i.e. group or society and the extraction of benefits from other people and argument over distribution. That second is what leads to people enacting violence against other people.   I'm not trying to persuade you to my perspective as I believe that anything real, only requires that I participate in developing other people's capacity for understanding, for them to arrive at a similar conclusion. I hope that it's helpful, whether or not you agree. :)"
"Your handler ContraPoints is excellent ...because you have no points...at no point were you even close to reality ...I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul ..after you commit suicide by choking while you jerk yourself ...."
"The end of the world coming today! Repent!"
"Wow.. you've gone off the deep end, Contra. Go fuck yourself"
"Anyone who doesn't want white people to die out and be replaced in their own countries == facist, evil supremacists who must be stopped.   Contra is anti-white and provides no arguments why us white people should embrace our predicted demographic oblivion."
"This was a great argument against white nationalism, not fascism (a.k.a. the use of violence for political means)."
"What was the symbol on the ring at the beginning of the video?"
"So, is advocating for your own group bad?  Is advocating for transpeople bad?  Is ethnic displacement a real thing?  is it good to have the native population replaced?  It doesn't seem like it's great as Native Americans didn't seem to like their replacement.  Why would European Americans be okay with their replacement."
"I can't watch this without staring at your Adam's apple going up and down. Being an antifacist is exactly what a facist would say"
"Im not crazy about your politics but i like your channels aesthetic"
"The definition of Fascism, straight from Wikipedia: Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce.  The Soviet Union were just as fascist as Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, & Fascist Japan. Just because there's no discrimination for a specific race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, or religion, still doesn't mean there's isn't suppression of opposing political philosophies.   Antifa are just as much as fascists as the Alt-right. I mean just go to any Antifa video and you'll see."
"Remember that fascism does not obey necessary a political spectrum. And fascist is not equal to racist as trans is not equal to 'be right'"
"Cool video. I still generally disagree about Kekistan because it was designed to mock the alt-right."
"Another sjw antifa sympathizer.  You can only see the evil on your 'enemies' but you can't see your own evil."
"While I disagree with multiple points in this video, it doesn't deserve a Dislike, much less 4,000.  What the heck?"

"You want multiculturalism but don't want so-called cultural appropriation."
"I'm trying to understand this video. Are you pro-truth or pro-narrative? Please explain."
"Antifa is bullshit. 👌🐸"
"Yes, the metaphor of the sexual innuendo in the comedy with the child is good... But, I don't know. I can't call an adult who repeat entire racist points with a pedantic structured argumentation, a 'misinformed centrist'. I hate children because they have a pass to be awful, because they ARE children, they don't know better. But, that people HAVE to know better. It's their platforms, where they expose what they want us to know about them.  That only shows they are not disturbed by fascist rhetoric."
"eh 'western culture' is barely a thing, the biggest split is maybe between christians and atheists, but nationality and class are also huge chasms, i have nothing in common with an Evangelical from the USA or a French conservative... it can mean total opposites, e.g. is western culture sexually permissive, or is it based on monogamous marriage..."
"That's...not what Fascism is. Fascism is all about hyper-nationalism and rule by the capitalist elite. Racism is often a big part, but it does not need to be.  Good video, but that's kinda an important point."
"You erase rational arguments yet leave up the racist comments .......why is that Contra? Btw, I really appreciated that interview you did. Even though we disagree on some things, that was brave and I would love to see you debate more.    I may disagree with you on some things, but I still respect and like you. I think you are the same way, I hope."
"This guy is retarded, saying fascism is a purely white phenomenon is like saying democracy is a purely white phenomenon. Just cause we created it doesn't mean sheetskins can't do it."
"whenever I talk about the alt right I share this video by default now."
"Although this is somewhat unrelated to the Contra's video, I'd like to point the following out to those who believe that the 'extreme left' and 'extreme right' are equally immoral or violent at the core, especially when people refer to the several millions of people were killed by their own 'communist' countries in the 20th century. See, whether communist transition states succeed to meet its economic prosperity, or fail and lead to the democides we all know about, communism itself is simply an economic philosophy and system, with no objectively negative, violent or oppressive aspects. Whereas fascism ideology inherently consists of systematic oppression, exclusion and imminent use of authoritarian rule.  Compare the two objectively, and one is morally and pragmatically preferable than the other. I am proud to call myself a libertarian socialist or communist freely, in person, for I know and can prove that it is not what the majority of citizens believe it to be.  because we need to spread the innate truth every individual has in the back of their mind but can't come to realize it or admit it: That they, the workers, should control and have influence over their labor efforts and attain all of the value produced from it rather than surrendering it to a capitalist that reaps the benefits. The systemic problems you notice in society, really does stem from the economic power of hierarchy due to the lack of direct democracy). Actual leftists, from my experience, will admit that they are socialists, communists and what not aloud...  Unless, until such revolutionary ideas become 'heresy' over soon time, and have history repeat itself like in the first half of the 20th century, when socialists and real progressives fought for worker rights and human rights, followed by opposition of betrayal to the working class by banning of unions, legalized vigilante actions, police emergency powers, witch hunts and lynchings against American socialists and communists who simply advocated for an objectively better society. It's the 'American Inquisition' NOBODY has been taught in school."
"To everyone wondering what is the core tenet of fascism and Nazism (National Socialism), along with what ContraPoints explained,  Fascism's economic structure consists of private ownership of companies and conglomerates of corporations, with strong legal ties and high regards to serving the state's direction. That is the least free-market capitalism - it's state capitalism to the authoritarian extreme, when capitalism's phase of failure from self-destruction arrives. And it's definitely, by definition and practice, NOT socialism."
"Makes 're-education' video about Fascism...doesn't even know what Fascism is.  Democrats: You are here."
"Here in the UK an ex-British National Party (BNP) activist authored the manifesto of Anne Marie Waters, the far-right activist who is now the favourite to become the next UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader.  Jack Buckby is barred from joining UKIP due to his past membership of the BNP but has been working on Waters' campaign to become leader of the party. Buckby introduced Waters at her campaign launch where he described the manifesto as 'fantastic'.  Metadata on the pdf of the manifesto indicates 'Jack B' is the author of the document and sources close to the campaign have confirmed Buckby is the document's author. Buckby registered the domain name of the website the manifesto is hosted on.  Buckby was a close associate of former BNP leader Nick Griffin. In 2012, Buckby gave a speech, introduced by Griffin, where he explained how it was necessary to cloak fascist ideology in new language to make it palatable to people who may otherwise find the language of nationalism alienating.  Waters' manifesto calls for British citizens to be prioritised over others within the UK, and calls for a large reduction and temporary freeze on immigration. The manifesto suggests some UK residents would see their rights restricted were Waters to ever come to power.  Waters has denied being a fascist but describes herself as a 'nationalist'."
"This video is excellent!"
"great vid thank you so much for making it, yt needs this <3"
"ContraPoints vs. Ben Shapiro debate. Make it happen."
"Dude ,are you high"
"Ewww this thing is really degenerate."
"It's incredibly hard to take you serious when your three points are incorrect regarding fascism. You're conflating Nazism with Fascism. Fascism does not have to have a racial component to it. Fascist Italy placed the country as the most important thing not race. In fact Mussolini thought that distinctions based on race were COUNTERPRODUCTIVE to fascism.  In 1933 he was quoted as saying 'National Pride has no need for the delirium of race.' He only changed his practices on this with the start of WW2 as an appeasement to Hitler."

"I'm quite certain the several thousand Nazis and Fascists in this country believe everything you say in this video. Good thing there are only a few thousand Nazi and Fascist nutjobs in this country that believe in this nonsense, huh? Add in the KKK, well, now we're up to maybe 10,000 out of 330 million Americans. Thanks for pointing out this extremely tiny fraction of wing nuts that believe this stuff. I'll keep my eye out looking for the 1 out of 33,000 Americans who are Fascist, Nazis, and KKK members. You've done a great service to your fellow Americans. Good thing all the other problems in this country have been solved so we can all help squash these roaches. That's if, we can find them."
"I get that this video is marketed to the 'common man' and has to stay more down to earth than your usual artistically nuanced and unreachable racism is bad videos, but unironically saying the word 'normies' is a step farther than anyone should go."
"Easy. How to recognize a fascist: look to the left side of the political divide and see who wants you to stop talking. See, fast than 23 minutes and probably more accurate too."
"Very good video. But some symbols you show, like black sun, celtic cross, thor's hammer and odala rune are almost only used by nazis. If you see people wearing these : no doubt they are fascists. It's a little bit thrickier in small subculture like metal or neopagan, because regular folks can wear tose symbols without beeing fascists (except black sun with 12 branchs). The problem is : nazis are recruiting a lot in these subcultures. I haven't seen a single metal festival without nazi wearing these."
"How badly would this guy get crushed in an actual debate with anyone he is bashing on.  Too afraid to try."
"it's been nearly three weeks, it's new video time!"
"Ignorant and disingenuous."
"This reminds me so much of the creationist movement and its attempts to incorporate religion and state in education by using the facade of 'science' and 'freedom of speech' to hide it. It's really sad to see the atheist community, whom were so savvy to creationist's, being so easily taken in by nazi / facists doing exactly the same thing!"
"In just about every Western nation which has had massive third world immigration imposed upon it against the democratic wishes of a clear majority of that nation’s indigenous citizens/population. Why have these views, which consistently and overwhelmingly strongly favored curtailment of that immigration over time periods measured in generations, been ignored by both liberals and conservatives? Just asking. To Nick (ContraPoints) is everyone a 'proto-American' or a 'proto-Europeans'?"
"I really like your content, it has a really cool sort of old British skit show sort of feel mixed with political discourse. The only real criticism that I would have of your content, that I think is fair, is simply that I am a very stupid person and your big words hurt my thought hole sometimes, especially when mixed with the pace at which you speak. This isn't necessarily a bad thing all the time but I do have to rewind your videos sometimes to understand what the fuck your saying. It may help to include some visual representations at times to better illustrate what your saying or to dumb down your syntax for the less educated viewer, because otherwise its like being an old man trying to gum through a though a tough steak."
"You are defeated by your own logic. If everything is a dog-whistle and we should assume so, then this whole video is actually an ALT RIGHT FACIST WHITE SUPREMACIST DOG WHISTLE  Good job."
"When are you going to have a ACTUAL discussion or debate with someone from the right? These 'straw man' type arguments you make are just going to continue to marginalize and increase the hostility the vast majority of the white youth have for the left while driving them increasingly to rightwing\nationalist politics."
"I have blonde hair an blue eyes. I am a Caucasian. have a Teutonic cross tattooed on my right arm. According to your narrative you have implicated me as a racist, white supremacist, neo-nazi... and we have never met? I think, that by connecting iconography and the genetics that pre determines humans appearance, on such a base level ,to someones political affiliations- is extremely short sighted. You are de-legitimizing people sovereign right, in a free world state, to be Who and As they are. Although you may believe you are helping your cause with your rhetoric you are sowing division and will only further polarise. I think you are disguising an agenda, to create outrage and a sense of impending danger amongst citizens, to further a very small and niche set of political objectives. I am sure that you probably feel that you are the victim of something, and therefore must find a devil to throw your vitriol at, but in so doing , you have become the exact same thing as your supposed enemies."

"That's it...Im out Contra.  This is batshit crazy. Why don't you talk about the fact that the left PROMOTES and FACILITATES EVERY OTHER NATIONALISM (BLACK LIVES MATTER! LA RACA! ANTIFA! CARE) ALL GOOD TO GO!  As long as you're not white (which I'm NOT...so please *smh!* shut up!), it's encouraged to be a nationalist.  Just cant be a white or AMERICAN NATIONALIST which is what President Trump is...An AMERICAN Nationalist.  Big difference! MOST Leftists ARE the FACISTS! THEY ARE THE MOST NAZI-ESQUE PEOPLE THERE ARE! Watever...You are being the total paranoid drama queen!  You were okay with a government that LIED to you and committed acts of treason (Obama/Clinton AKA THE TROJAN HORSE ADMIN) being in power because they pacified you!  It was okay as long as they didn't SPEAK truth!  As long as it sounds good, you're okay with it no matter how horrible the act!  No matter how harmful to our country!  It is all good as long as it is presented to the masses in a  politically correct way? Doesnt matter if they are lying pieces of crap that unconstitutionally governed!  Doesnt matter what THE PISSING ON THE  BILL OF RIGHTS VIA THE GOVERNMENT HURTS EVERY AMERICAN NO MATTER WHAT COLOR WE ARE....AS LONG AS IT IS DONE NICELY? Are you fucking kidding me here Contra! The OK sign?!? Really?  My 7 year old does it...It is part of AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE...ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE USE IT AND IT DON'T MEAN SHIT CONTRA!  I USE IT...I AM NOT A NAZI...NEITHER ARE MY KIDS. Lady Gaga uses it...is she a Nazi...EVERY POP STAR DOES IT...Uh oh...Usually over the left eye...Nazi Illuminati! Mind control of the masses....Desensatizing them! Please stop! These things only have the power that You give to them! You are going WAY OUT THERE. President Trump deserves a chance.  95/100 people that i have talked to feel the same way.  Give the man a chance...He only speaks the TRUTH. ANTIFA IS NOT VIOLENCE AGAINST FACISM. IT IS TERRORISM. IT IS RACISM, BIGOTRY AND THE VERY EFFERVENCENCE OF FACISM!  Your wanting to ban/sensor free speech is DANGEROUS. As much as I hate ANTIFA,  I would fight for their right to spew their George Sorro's paid for HATRED. Same for HIM, SAME FOR ISLAMISTS LIVING HERE, SAME FOR TRANSGENDER FORMER PROFESSORS  (even when I dont like what they are saying!). I dont claim any party...True Libraltarian here that doesn't want big government involvement in our lives. I am a constitutionalist...It doesn't make me a Nazi...Right the opposite. I think every Nationalism is screwed up unless it is American Nationalism within our own country.  Our President SHOULD BE AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST. Why not put away your preconceived  (obviously prejudiced and jaded) belief system and approach this President with an open mind.  Let his actions speak louder than his words 'If you like your healthcare, you can keep it!', because really, that's all that matters. It would make the path to serenity a hell of a lot easier and would be the right thing to do. Everyone deserves a chance. You have plenty of time to be bitter, resentful and whiney if he does something that actually DESERVES it. For now, our President seems to be a Patriot that is doing the best that he can under hostile conditions."
"A little bit paranoid? While you articulate your arguments quite comprehensively you are clearly living in this world where you think fascists, by your definition, are running rampant. They're not. This video is nothing more than a pseudo-clever way of labeling right opposition 'fascists'."
"Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce."
"The maker of this ridiculous video MUST have an incredibly hate-filled heart. I didn't even bother to watch most of this video because of how ridiculous it is. Anyone who questions the status quo is apparently a 'fascist' now. These people are so brainwashed that they will REFUSE to believe the truth when it finally comes out, and it IS coming out. They don't realize they're on the wrong side of this, and since they don't know that by now there's very little hope that they WILL EVER realize they're on the wrong side. And no, to those who read my comment, throw a tantrum, and automatically label me a 'nazi', I'M NOT A NAZI. GROW UP. I believe in free speech, I believe in questioning everything, I BELIEVE IN *EVERYONE'S* RIGHT TO SAFETY, HAPPINESS, AND SUCCESS, *REGARDLESS OF RACE, RELIGION, GENDER, CREED, ETC.* I believe in EVERYONE'S right to free speech, even though you are trying to take my own away from me. GROW UP, and stop believing the fool who made this video. Contra must be SO HATEFUL and BRAINWASHED to have made this video. White nationalists make up a very small amount of people, regardless of the LIES the mainstream media has been telling its viewers. I denounce white nationalists like I denounce ANTIFA, like I denounce ANY kind of bigotry or racial supremacy! I also denounce mass flagging, because Contra has a right to free speech and expression just like anyone else in this country. Just because I don't like what someone has to say does NOT give me the right to try to silence them! Take a step back and look at the BIGGER PICTURE, here!"

"-this video didnt adress the reasons why these ideas exist. everything taken out of context is an aberration of the original material, let me make a question to show my point, and you will understand that there is no violence involved: -Mexicans migrate to the US, people say that they suffer discrimination. But why mexicans dont solve the reasons in their country that create the need for migration? if mexicans cant have personal responsibility on their native lands, why they are recognized as 'fighters against racism' when they reach US soil?"

"~ @12:00 Trying to move Centrists, who are usually the majority of any voter base, through not so subtle 'guilting' (where you mock the concern you assert they have about being confused with Antifa), is something I would strongly encourage you to avoid indulging in. It's a snarky, condescending attitude which is one way the right moves them ('aren't you tired of being told to feel guilty for everything by the left?'...<--- can't emphasize this point enough because you play it out in an otherwise very good video). I think I would've advised against the end too. I get it may be funny to an academic, but if you're going to point out the crazy-making, gas-lighting stuff, certainly don't use it 'ironically'."
"Contra.... honestly you should have just gone with the rad NES game but whatevs... Contra, the 'White Race' is not the same as 'Western Culture.' One is a race and one is a culture. Western Culture, Contra, is antithetical to fascism because Western Culture spawned from the enlightenment and the enlightenment birthed values. Fascism was not only NOT one of the values birthed from the enlightenment, but the antithesis of fascism, personal liberty, was birthed by the enlightenment. The enlightenment, Contra, and subsequently western culture, HATES fascism. Because at its core, fascism is inherently collectivist. And individualism has a tendency to tell collectivism to stick it's dick down a raw sewage drain.   You really need to hang out with Sargon more."

"This video showed me the depths of the conspiratorial paranoia on the left. Milk really is just milk and maga hat wearers are not the evil spawn of satan. No wonder so many sjw types call everyone a nazi.  What is the politically correct term for western civilization? Asserting that term is a  'dog whistle' for white supremacy is an example of language weaponization. There's nothing racial about the west's philosophical underpinnings or traditions. Race has nothing to do with the  rule of law, due process, freedom of speech,  human rights,  science, individualism,  liberal democracy,  and free markets. I'm going to continue to use the term western civilization or westernism.  You have no right to redefine words that get in the way of your political agenda. Nor can you have kekistan, it's too funny, I won't let you take it from me.  The far left is about as creepy as the far right and you all are utterly blind to that fact. Congratulation on achieving equality of creepiness, but please swim back to the safety of the center of the pond. You should know that almighty KEK awaits you at the center of the pond and will protect you from the dangers lurking in the murky waters on the extremities."

"Um... don't look now, but FASCISTS is a fine description of the ones removing historical monuments across the country."
"Everything is fascist"
"In the beginning of the video, you describe white supremacy and white nationalism, NOT facism"
"Fascists are people who...   - Claim Jewish people or insert other race here are responisble for all evil under massive world wide conspiracy.  - Claim human rights should not exist.  - Claim that everyone who isn't them is sub-human or beta.  - Claim state run media is better than freedom of press.  - Claim freedom of press is: 'The enemy.'  - Claim people with lesser intelligence and more need should be killed to: 'Clean out the inferior gene pool.'  - Claim checks and balances should be abolished.  - Claim for peace whilst going to rallys armed to the teeth whilst making threats.  - Claim that ehtno-nationalism is a good thing despite the fact there's not one in existence.  - Claim peaceful ethno-nationalism is possible. (It's not, it's a guise to garner support for an abhorrent idea that wouldn't have gotten mainstream support.)  - Claim cultural appropiation is the same as actively killing entire groups of people in a genocidal movement.  - Claim entire races should be genocided to protect their: 'own'.  - Claim that only White Genocide is the only genocide that actually exists and that any others throughout history were not real.  - Claim that we shouldn't be able to hold them or their leader accountable.   If you don't do any of these things, then you're quite clearly not a fascist.  On the other hand if you do these things whilst attempting to claim how you're somehow: 'Not a fascist', well then... You're a fascist."
"Antifa colors. Red blackNazi colors. Red black. Hmmm"
"All this video served to do was instruct people afraid of a caricature to call others who use broadly conservative/right-wing symbology and terminology 'fascist', a rather loaded term, thus making them prime for violence and depredation of any sort, no matter how legitimate their concerns and no matter how much veracity their claims exhibit.   You're a very smart dude, and honestly, it hurts me a little bit to see you so leftist, and so aberrant, as though you hate your existence and people. I just can't quite fathom the essence of this desire for self destruction and the need to abrogate any sense of belonging or duty to your people.   What you do is noble -- I will admit, though paradoxically, as I find it disturbing and suicidal -- but you have to see that the current trend of white guilt placation and amelioration for all these different groups isn't going to end once we're a minority, or once statistics are at parity; we're going to be a despised, endangered minority, beleaguered by people who have enmity for us; people whose impetus in life is retribution for racial historical grievances.   I don't expect you to imbibe this sort of thought and to preach it, but please understand this potentiality is what the Altright is in opposition to.   We want to secure for our people health, economic viability, and safety in perpetuity, not the subjugation and destruction of other peoples."
"The toast to the Left really should have been followed by Auferstanden aus Ruinen.    You might have #triggered Kraut and Tea!"
"Fascism has nothing specifically to do with the first three things that you mentioned. It has nothing to do with white people or Jews and it has nothing to do with western culture. Fascism is '1 often capitalized :a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.'"

"I think I have a thing for men who wear a dress and makeup. ^^ This made me horny lol. And he's got a hypnotic voice. Are you French??"
"I feel like this video is threating white supremacism and fascism as synonyms. Fascism is not that simply. For example the apertheid South-Africa certanly wasn't a fascist state even tho it was racist and awfull. The racists who want to keep our individualistic democratic sociaty, but just as a white patriarchy aren't really fascists."
"I am a fascist"
"You had some good points at the end.  The Big fear with all this anti-wrong think is people making mistakes.  You are probably smart enough to know when you can be sure.  But many are not that smart, just look at Evergreen college.  Sorry for all the posts, it was just easier for me to comment in sections instead of all at once,"
"What's with the insulting of centrists in this video?  It's ridiculous.  Centrists do not become allied with fascists, they are opposed to fascists.  Saying crap like that pushes people away, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"Relating it to other feats does not make fear of antifa invalid.  Antifa has gone after non fascists, they go after people who disagree with them.  Antifa commit political violence, which makes them dangerous scumbags.      This video seems to be going after people for wrong think, which is dangerous because unless you can read minds you can easily make a mistake while trying figure out what people think.  Ironically this type of thing seems very fascist.    You convinced me awhile back about systemic racism, but this is just wrong."
"I continue to be happy that Contra is in the world."
"Can you talk about strategies worth co-opting from the new right wing?"
"Shaun. Awesome."
"do you have a feminine benis?"
"Ah I see. Fascists everywhere. Under your bed, hiding in your closet. Etc etc. lol How many of us came here from Sargon?"
"IT PUTS THE LOTION ON IT'S SKIN!!!!!!!"
"It is my right to be proud of being white. Just like it is ok for blacks to be proud of their race."
"Watch this video again, but substitute 'degenerate commie' for 'Fascist'."
"I didnt listen/watch the vid - but that's a dude right? I mean, she was born a man?  My name is Otto and I like to get blotto!"
"What the fuck is this degeneracy upon which I have stumbled? Is this shit for real?? LOL"
"Good video, didn't entirely agree with all your points but good with you anyways :)"
"Bahahaha I could only make it though 5mins of your bullshit 😂😂😂. Shucks I'm only 2/3 of your checklist that must disappoint you! You think that this is about ❤️ing Beethoven, please child this is about retaking political power in a country that we are the dominate population! That's what this is about, why should one give up political power in a country they started to a foreign, minority and former enemy culture! I gave you 5mins and you failed - too bad, I will always listen to truth but you have none."
"This channel is very underrated."
"You're fucking gay as fuck. Subscribed."
"subbed"
"That music towards the end really got me going."
"That was so fucking astute and informative. Thank you!"
"You did not define 'fascism' in this video but seemingly implies it's any deviation from the modern incarnation of neo-liberalism. This is simply untrue."
"Hey thanks for your channel. You seem to be one of the sane voices on youtube. Keep fighting against right!"
"Downside of debating is when you lose the argument. The upside of debating when you win your argument. I prefer to debate my political opponents. Punching someone only get someone more radicalized"
"Amazing video, I wish I could leave a comment that would equally impress you as your videos do me.. and I wish I had the funds to at least compensate.. But, I lack the finesse or the funds to do either.  I just can at least try to let you know how much I like your videos though.  Thank you Contrapoints, for putting such fantastic videos up.  I really do feel like I am short changing you here, you really do amazing work, my comment hardly does you justice.  /bow /thanks /I'm not worthy"
"pedantry - you did not say this word right. Good video though."
"I think some of your points are good here, but there's nothing really supporting your theory. Yes, racists can lie, but saying you're not racist doesn't make a person racist, their actions will expose them. Keep up the work, the videos are entertaining."
"You can't talk about fashism without some historical contex. It's a reactionary movement to communism. Wich is why we didn't hear about fashists 5 years ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcH00ZC3Df0"
"So many neonazi butthurt comments, thats how we know you made your point. Great video, very comprehensive and reasonable."
"You read a quote from one ugly person on a 4chan board about being more strategic in pursuing a racist agenda and then say, 'I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.'  You also hold up Lauren Southern and her conservative friends as examples of fascism.  FFS.  All the while completely blind to bulls**t from the Guardian about micro aggressions, cultural appropriation and straight out racist hiring programs that hide under the banner of diversity.  You're just as insane as the people you're fighting."
"You know I probably don't agree with most of your views, but I have to hand it to you for admitting that many centrists and liberals are wrongfully labeled fascists, and that many of the so-called 'Alt Right' symbols were originally memes created by centrists and liberals (ie the Kekistan flag) As for ''I'm not a fascist' is exactly what a fascist would say' that's the same type of logic they used witch hunts 'she denied it so she must be witch!' So your damned if you do damned if you don't, you either admit guilt or deny it, but either way your a fascist."
"Contrapoints your face is looking gorgeous in this vid, plus your uploads are on point as usual."
"I'm not a man is what a sick TRAP would say."
"OK if a guy in a dress with make up is anti-fascist well that makes me fascist"
"With the changing of the Subject from Fascist to Jews, I can totally see this video as a 1930's Nazi Propaganda film... Why can't he see the irony here?  -  With all the vague characteristics and demonizing references, like the repeated phrase 'western culture', this is a classic example of Hate Propaganda... not even aimed at actual fascists, but ANYONE who even, roughly, resembles them (ALL Centrists, moderate liberals and conservatives)... and how he can relate Capitalism to the National 'Socialist' government of Nazi Germany, is beyond deceptive and manipulative."
"hur hur hur fascism = bad hur hur im so enlightened both sides are as bad as each other"
"You're beautiful."
"Centrist speaking, came from the Sargon livestream (how do you do, folks), with regard to centrists getting confused by the rhetoric of the far right- I can attest that this HAS happened to me albeit only once and not to a strong degree. If anyone remembers Edgy Sphinx, I know he was somewhat popular with centrists - though a bit more right wing like NakedApe, rather than whoever is more center-left, Sargon, Armored Skeptic. When Edgy did a video that was him reading a folksy parable about anti-semitism however, trying to relate it to immigration, it came off as really weird. I remember one comment saying, 'What? Wasn't this written by someone in the Nazi party?', and I believe his reply as 'That doesn't make it any less true'. It was a bridge too far though, and I don't think anyone who didn't already believe in it fell for it. Let's just say, when he came out as alt-right like a week afterwords, and was basically exiled from the centrist 'skeptic' community, it wasn't much a surprise. Being centrist means you try to live by principles, and you take information from every and all sources and weigh them against those principles. It's really hard for anyone to guide you away to one side or another if they're violating those principles."
"Who´s that poodle looking tranny ?"
"Take out the racist element, EVERYTHING you are saying here can be said about Marxists and the Far-Left... they spew out just as much Hate as the Far-Right.  And for you to equate Moderate-Centrists to Morons, is just offensive (a very anti-SJW thing to do).  Most Moderates and Centrists just don't want to have a lot to do with the insanity of Social Politics.. they'd rather go get wasted than to even think about this BS... and they have that Right!!!  And the ones who do care about these issues (like me), are the only people who hold you extremist at bay, and keep the world from going into WW3.  We see that the Left can be just as bad as the Right... extremists on both sides want total and all-out war, to MAKE the world in the image of their Dogma... it's only us, the Center, the Rational, the Reasonable, who can see and understand both sides, and try to mediate and help you come to a compromise, that doesn't involve taking away our Human Rights and our Freedoms!  If EITHER extreme wins this Battle, the world will be plunged into another Dark Age, where Ideas and Personal Freedom are things of the past...   Years from now, you may be asking yourself how it feels to be apart of the down fall of civilization?  Because, if it happens, it will be people like you who caused it!!!"
"We on the alt right will defeat you. You can't stop us from doing that."
"I actually think you are literally as evil as Hitler!!!"
"'Some plausibility to the fear that moderate centrist have that anti-fascist will come after them next'  DUDE!!!  This is already happening... it's an actual Witch Hunt out there, and the witches are the ones carrying the pitch-forks!!!  Almost EVERY anti-SJW and Skeptic out there are already label Fascist, Alt-Right and Nazi, just to demonize them, so the Far-Left can get more support... and it's working... WTF is wrong with you anyway?  I know you know this, yet you make it sound like ONLY real fascists need to worry about the witch hunt... and, with this video, you are one of the organizers of the Hunt!  Doesn't this put you in the same category as Hitler?!?"
"And HOW does History show that centrist become allied with fascists?  What about the U.S. right before WW2... and ALL the (dare I say) 'Allied' Nations?  What about before the Russian Revolution?  The American Revolution? The French Revolution?  The American Civil War?  The Chinese Communist Revolution?  The Cuban Revolution?  My point is, history shows that centrist can be swayed in 'Any way the Wind Blows'... and, as of now, the wind is blowing Left.  Doesn't that give us (the left) the obligation to steer them in the right way... PEACEFUL way?  Not go around 'punching' everyone they disagree with!!!"
"Lauren isn't a fascist. What she is doing there with 'Defend Europe' is stopping human trafficking. Just because the people involved are not white, does not make her fascist. That group has even teamed up with groups like the Libyan coastguard to stop it. Pepe is also a meme that is in use by everyone from Fascists(Alt-right) to Libertarians(Kekistan)."
"WOW!!! How can you actually believe the stuff coming out of your mouth?"
"All you are doing with this video is promoting HATE... the very thing that you profess to oppose.  If people actually believe all the half-truths in this, they will be turning over every rock, hoping to find the slightest, perceived, fascist micro-aggression.  These 'points' of recognizing Fascists can be used to demonize ANY group or person someone finds offensive, even you.  By inciting individuals and vigilante mobs, to go after ANYONE who possess any of these very vague characteristics or views, most of which have very little to do with real fascism, you are using the same tactics that the actual Nazis used to demonize, round up,  and then exterminate the Jews... now who's the EVIL BASTARD in this scenario?"
"But what is wrong with pro-white fascism?"
"but /pol/ actually hates kekistan"
"I feel like I see this on the left as well. Their talking points are still the same, but they use different words so that it sounds less aggressive. Ex: 'We don't hate white people' and then they treat us like a hive mind. I will say though so you made some really good points in this video."
"Reeeeeeeee!  This is comedy, right?  I'm a proud Kekistani-American.  Normies look out!  Lololol. 😁😁😁"
"These are your heroes. What a bunch of deviant mentalsexuals.  It's a trap!"
"what happens in secret has great power. Thats the truth. We have had freedom of speech and freedom of association since this nation began. We have had hate rallys and nazi marches in our cities because of our freedom. You seem to think theres sudenly a great many people who will join the fascists if they see these demonstrations. I dont know what made you think that, but you are wrong. Seeing what they stand for had made them exist on the fringes and mocked. People wont follow them. But forcing them in the shadows and using forces has caused them to grow. Because they arent seen, people arent sure what they stand for and can be tricked into following them now. Your solution will fail. The answer is to let them rally and let people really see what they stand for."
"Nice chat with sargon,"
"🐸"
"Fascism is when corporations become the government. Your a twit"
"Lol that face after she drinks the alcohol"
"Oh great another person that doesn't know what Fascism is."
"Im willing to bet its the shutting down of fascist speech that caused them to be so sneaky lol"
"Your AC put focus on the wall instead of on your face, and it's super distracting."
"1) they're not Nazis Nazis have an existence since Hitler blows brains out in a bunker  2) one of pol's favorite things to do is to get media to post up stupid s*** as if it was true. Just look up the 9000 penises speech by Oprah.  3) if you want to stop white identitarian movement DO NOT DEPLATFORM THEM you have to a)speak out against all identitarian movements. So you're not seen as a hypocrite.  b) engage them in discussion and logically argue against their bad ideas. Try to stick to principled arguments. If you don't know what your principles are, you shouldn't be in the political Arena. You don't know what you're arguing for.  c) satirize them like this 'you were just edge Lourdes and if this was a decade ago you'd be Emos not Nazis.'"
"Left fights the Right in the streets,.....just like Europe circa 1930s. The powers that be want division. The Left is just as guilty as the Right. Both the Left and Right are essentially the same except for the color of their uniform and flag."
"You're mirror images of one another. You hate horseshoe theory as much as the white supremacists do for 1 reason and 1 reason only: you know it's true.  Your ideas are the same, your accusations toward each other are the same, your goals are the same. You love racial identity, you hate capitalism, you love collective achievement and collective guilt and you despise liberal individualism. The implementation of your goals will see the immediate oppression of innocent people. When your accusations are so broad, there's no such thing as going too far to reign people in. You never apologize for the collateral damage. You're playing the same game but you're batting for different teams. That's the long and short of it.  I'm biracial, I know that there's no win-condition for me if I play your game. You've lost liberals who know better than to collectivize blame and guilt to an entire race of people.  The best chance a person like me, a biracial person who's dating a trans biracial person, has at surviving this is fighting the both of you with words, while we still have a liberal society where that form of conflict is sacred."
"The classic 'you don't know what's in your best interest,' thesis.   Lmao this is why liberals hate you people. You're funny Contra, but I won't accept either 'forgiveness' or 'acceptance,' from a person who has nothing but condescension for the people they're trying to recruit. Thanks but no thanks. Stay frustrated."
"has anyone ever successfully 'Shamed' someone into a different political stance? This attack on the moderate in current politics for being idiots working for the other side is sicking"
"I agree with most of your points but I think that some of them only really applies to the US"
"Hey contra, I don't really agree with a lot of your views, but wanted to say thanks for  doing the debate with sargon. We needs more discourse."
"Keep in mind OP is a dude who dressed like a girl and has a very fucked up view of reality   Although he makes a well orchestrated opinion, think about what this person is doing at this very point in time. I guarantee you it's not something normal"
"I am here for one reason.  How dare you submit Hitch to the editing techniques of Winston Smith's employment requirements.  You have your very own Ministry of Love, how adorable for you. Christopher did far more than you have done dear lady, when you get back from Iraq, Iran and North Korea, I'll be very interested in reading your experiences.   Try a little Kafka and Bowie."
"So instead of trying to find out why they feel threaten by diversity, why they think their culture is at risk, we should just reject them based on guessing they might be alt-right? Let me guess, you're a feminist. I remember a time when the biggest concern for trans people online were fetishists, now we also have to worry about shills posing as us and the people who pick up on their talking points. No such thing as right, or left or center. This is just what comes out of the disinformation budget, it's how division is encouraged."
"apropos of nothing, I really love the lighting and aesthetics in this video, looks cool as hell"
"This gives me genuine anxiety and im usually not an anxious person"
"Saw you on sargon, i dont agree with you but you came across okay so im subscribing to you x"
"Damn this is entertaining but so ignorant. Such a shallow argument."
"I really enjoyed your conversation with Sargon. I appreciated you honesty even tho I dont agree with either of you all the time. Just nice to see dialog."
"I came over from the Sargons podcast you did to try to help explain the alt-right, white nationalists etc.   For starters I'm a  white person born in Europe. To be honest with everyone, I find myself more and more becoming a 'Euro-nationalist'. Please let me try to explain why a lot of 'white' people I think are going down the white nationalists path.   I think most aren't racist or hadn't been racist until recently. Rightly or wrongly you guys have bashed 'white' people, so I ask you, what is normal human behaviour when you do this to any group? It's what you're seeing with these people. I'm happy to debate at a later stage the lefts seemingly hated of anything western but I'm coming here honestly without 'trolling' to try and explain from the other side. For instance in South Africa their leaders openly singing about killing white people and the murder rate of white farmers there is shocking  (plus raping babies) and I hear nothing from the left about that example of extreme racism. So of course that type of thing also leads to 'whites' wanting protection in a group that talks about defending them. I'm not excusing what the whites did in South Africa before hand but the left made sure everyone had known about it and rightly so (also as a side note most black south Africans aren't native to the south and actually killed 90% of the peaceful  native bushman).  Anyway, why I see myself as I do now? Every other group of people can be native (Aborigines, Native American etc) but Europeans aren't seen as the same. Do you guys say, 'shit, not many whites in the middle of Africa. That makes them so racist'?   So for the long post."
"Just watched your podcast with Sargon and you earned my respect. It's not often we see these discussions become honest. I'm with Sargon that removing freebies is the way to solve poor people issues. I do agree with your point regarding that some times you need preemptive violence to stop violence from escalating. Your example of a KKK group provoking a black neighborhood was a good example. I think it's legal but it is not exactly a good idea. It's inciting violence so I wouldn't blame whoever stopped these guys. Sometimes you need to use common sense.  Seems like mobile doesn't have an easy way to send private messages so I guess this will have to suffice."

"This morning I answered my door after the postman knocked. At first I didnt notice and then I realised that he was wearing a green tie... green like Pepe the nazi frog.. thats when I realised that my postman was a fashist, so I threw boiling water in his face... served the Nazi right"
"Not only did sargon stomp you, you also got caught advocating for political violence. Good job contra, ya piece of shit."
"What's up with your lighting?  All your shots are multicolored and dark. Reminds me of my fucked up childhood for some reason. I do not enjoy that. You get a thumbs down from me. 👎"

"Cool story bro. Got any citations there lil fella?"
"Oh, and by the way, -- I'm a Socialist!"
"One of my favorite videos by you yet! Ive come across all of these points in speaking with people."
"You are misrepresenting what Fascism is. The United States has been Fascist for a long time under both Republican and Democrat administrations alike. Fascism is essentially where the Corporations control the state and where there is a Nationalistic element to it as well.  As far back as 1823 with the formulation of the Monroe doctrine and its extension by Hamilton you begin to see the national-imperialistic tendencies become policy. With regard to the corporate element, Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a speech in 1961, in which he stated:  'This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.'  Not a single Democratic administration since then has done anything to change this dynamic and policy. In fact, it has gotten worse.   So you can either keep playing the game and working to divide everyone, misrepresent the facts, or you can start telling the truth. The truth is: The left and the right both have their head up their asses and are tools of the real Fascists, which know no political ideology other than more power, more money, and more divide and conquer."
"I don't like commenting on videos about things completely unrelated to the content, especially incredibly superficial things when the content of the video is incredibly important... but damn girl your hair looks SO GOOD."
"As someone who shit posts on 4chan, good video. It seems that some of the people on /pol/ are dead serious in many of their views on Nazism and White Supremacy."
"Love the John Carpenter inspired suspense moments."
"I don't mind multiculturalism, providing the immigrating cultures stfu about wanting special treatment and/or insignificant cases of racism (I do not however condone continuous, malicious and specifically targeted cases). I believe that if you want to live in another country you should respect that countries culture and treat it respectfully, as you cannot expect your culture to be respected if you continuously disrespect others."
"Just saw your chat with Sargon. I disagree with you on a lot of things, but your ability to discuss differences of opinion in a civil manner just earned you a sub."
"This is cringe. I'm not an alt right but this video sure is making me want to join it."
"I don't understand why a 'culture' would be more of an identity driver than your name and occupation."

"K E K I S T H E P O W E R , G A S S N O R M I ES , P E P E"
"I've kinda picked up something a long time ago, but, women in nazi germany had thier rights taken away, and it wasn't easy for women to pick up jobs related to politics, or any job, as Hitler's rise to power marked a change to thier public working life . Which is why so many 'white nationalists' are against feminism, and how the right wing usually uses anti-feminism as a way to draw more young boys into fascism. I thought you could shed a light on this, why right wing youtubers are usually anti-feminist"
"'You people wouldn't know a fascist even if he sited in your faces'."

"Degenerate"
"The iron cross is the emblem of the modern german army, fuck you for saying that this is a racist sign."
"I can't 'Like' because there are just too many issues.  There's no real attempt to define 'fascism' other than as a form of racialism (which is inaccurate and ahistorical nee Sternhell's and Griffin's definitions), there's an unnecessary attack on centrists (not that such a connection should not be explored), and a denial that an 'alt-left' exists, when from I'm sitting in the UK, it definitely does."
"Hey ContraPoints are you a fascist? No? FASCIST.  LMAO you can't even see how your own logic can be used against you"

"Why are you wearing a wig and a dress? Aren't you a boy?"
"Eughhghhh. What are you?"
"First one of Contra's videos that I genuinely appreciate, though it comes with one massive caveat: The definition contained within does not at all describe fascism.  It describes a white supremacist movement in the West.  Fascism is a right wing authoritarian philosophy by which the police state governs our everyday life.  Fascism proper doesn't respect race, but rather it is primarily concerned with state.    Both actual fascism and the faux-fascism presented here are evil though.  Taking the rest of the video with that grain of salt, it was quite well done.    Cheers."
"fuckn normies"
"He/she didn't describe a fascist. It described a white nationalist. Not even close. It just made up its own definition for fascist."
"The how to resist section is seriously required viewing. Awesome job summing up practical ways to be an ally to those you care about who are marginalized (and why we all should). Thanks for making this!"
"A friend showed me this video when we were talking about how a large part of our American society is quick to defend Neo-Nazi's with the 'free speech' argument and how we both thought that was bullshit. Thanks for teaching me more ways to watch out for Alt-Reich idiots!  Subscribed!"
"my cat is fascist!!!"
"Your horrendous description of fascism lost me and I'm only 90 seconds in.  You purposefully described white nationalism when defining fascism in an attempt to absolve radical leftist thinking and censorship as fascism.  What a disingenuous video."
"Contra are you a capitalist?"
"Great video!"
"That feel when people call you a fascist for having the same opinions your grandfather who literally fought nazis had."
"holy shit, you're fucking great!"
"Is it just me or did the definition of Fascism change just out of no where within the last few years...  went from Authoritarian uber-nationalism to basically National Socialism, bit confused with that."
"This degenerate, what a filthy rat"
"I love all the work you put into your content, your videos are always so high quality. Thanks for doing what you do!"
"how the fuck would you know, 'that's how black people feel all the time'? You made some hilarious vids.. now you're just another us vs. them, either with us or against us. I can tell who is against my ideology, yea, 'cos they disagree with me. THEY're all fascists, or THEY're all marxists, right? THEY're all lying, deceitful etc."

"Reading these comments is disheartening. The left try to appear morally superior to the right but all I see as a centrist is that both groups are scum. You are nothing but collectivists, looking to introduce your biased power structures into society and overrule anything that doesn't agree with you. You are doing everything in your power to destroy individualism with identity politics and destroy western civilization. The alt-right completely ignores and even encourages atrocities from far-right wingers and the far left (comments here included) completely ignores the heinous things groups like BLM and Antifa do. Oh, but the alt-right are worse! But the Jews are worse so I'm justified in my actions! You're both making excuses for the horrific things you do while normal, everyday people are caught in the crossfire.  BLM invaded Pride Toronto and forcibly got the peaceful police participators kicked off the parade. I haven't seen any leftists ever mention this. There's several idiots in this section defending them as 'bearers of equality'. What a sack of shit. The left has a serious axe to grind against ALL WHITE PEOPLE, and that's not an alt-right thing to say. It's a fact. I applaud any white person who has stayed neutral in this war of ideology, because the leftists are certainly doing everything they can to push you to the right.  But sure, yeah, let's listen to 'moderate' leftist pseuds like ContraPoints and Destiny who comprise like 0.00001% of the leftist movement. They know what's best for us. They got us, brah. No one has us, not the alt-right shitsmears who want to turn us into hateful creatures or the radical leftist shitsmears who want to turn us into hateful creatures.  Vote responsibly. Vote intelligently. Vote for moderate candidates. Push these two groups of scum out."
"Lols. Morons that are inclined to see the world divide between the good, the middle and the evil are cumming buckets as you feed them with this bull. So GRINGY! * blushes * i do not need to point out all the flaws, exasporated stereotyping born and superbred in a echochamber. This is why centrists prefer 'nazi' reasoning and defending supposedly nazis is in fact not their very ideology but the protection of civil liberties while leftists stereotypes of antifa scum have been embraced by leftists are the ones running along hitting wrongthinkers with bikelocks. And contrapoint denies being a fascist: fascist exposed."
"Can you do a video where you thoroughly debunk 'The Mantra'? I'm well aware that it's Nazi propaganda, but it's a piece of propaganda that way too many people seem to fall for. If we're going to prevent conservatives and centrists from being duped, that's probably a good place to start."
"Contra, I love you, but that fucking trump hat clip was actually terrifying"
"Love your videos I know this request will probably be buried within the comments section but I really hope you make a video about 'fact based, right wing criticism videos'  What I mean is that there are videos against my viewpoints made that challenge my core beliefs yet their evidence is so huge, and so well cited that I can't a way to crowbar a counter argument. Let's take for example stephen molyneux's 'Untruth about Trump' series. Where Molyneux uses cited statistics and news articles showing the accusations leveled toward Trump and how they were untrue. An example being how Trump said he saw Muslims celebrating 9-11, the media blasted his comments for being racist (which I do remember happening) yet Molyneux shows footage and articles of Muslims celebrating 9-11 that are properly dated to show how Trump was right and yet corrections to these allegations were never shown. The video is full of examples like these and while the right has frequently shared them across the board, the left has been quiet. If the videos were so full of logical fallacies and untruths then your most mundane keyboard warrior would be attacking these vids left and right yet still to this day a proper article or video rebuttal has yet to be made. Giving off the impression that the left is hoping the videos are ignored thus strengthening their validity.  It's these situations I hope to see you tackle with your knowledge and wit."
"Excellent walkthrough. Really helps me frame some of my own thoughts on this, and addedan. Also, sick burn around 12:50 :) Question - Steve Shives recently referred to you a 'she'. You have earlier mentioned not caring (even made a video about it, unless I misremember), but do you prefer she/her pronouns now?  Oh, and if anyoe else reads this, feel free to tellme what pronouns CP prefer - I'm not sure if they even read their comment section"
"They are taking advantage of a real problem: Immigration. So long as the left continues to completely ignore the issue, they are going to win the arguement Contra. Billions of poor live in this world and we are stupid to think bringing people here is going to be the long term solution. We need to help people where they are at."
"Yeah, I'm definitely siding with the 'fascists' now."
"What transgender has been manipulated into today has made it into a threat against ALL of society in several avenues: Attack on Free Will, Sexuality, Sexual health of the populate, drug culture expansion, and attempted wealth distribution of the middle class with it's politicization into socialized medicine. I see the truth, and I will forever work hard to divide the identity/condition from the leftist social and political agenda. For this transgender woman values the power of truth.  Why are we listening to this Basement Dweller's badly passing transgender woman's (possibly CD) opinion?   Go diddle your gurl stick in your Mom's basement and look up at a glass ceiling and fell the bern as you wonder what could of been.  I am Proud to be Transgender, Republican, and Trump supporter!"
"great video!"
"You look like Jamie Clayton from Sense8! haha And your perception of Anthony Fantano and Chris Ray Gun is pretty point on. Pretty nuanced"
"What's with the close-ups on chess pieces at the end? Is there a reference or meaning I'm not getting?"
"How to identify a fascist. .Inflate the definition to a ridiculous degree .Spin around for 30 seconds .If a person is in your view, Congratulations on finding a fascist, now go beat up that old man!"
"The alt-right arent fascists, they are just people who want to meme u ignorant fuck"
"Ok, why do I always see this trope everywhere... Russians do not say 'NA ZDOROVYE', and there's no one true translation of 'cheers'. Instead, the 'toasts' are actually meaningful and relate to circumstance. E.g. on the 3rd of semptember I drank 'To the beginning of academic year!'. In this occasion you might toast 'За культурный Марксизм!' (to cultural Marxism) or whatever. Yeah, it's complicated, comrade."
"Oh so thaaaats fascism ?! The real, true definition of fascism hu? Great work dude, Im glad we all know what fascism is now . very informative."

"'Don't debate them because then you're letting them speak which is a problem, don't think, just call people fascists; and if they for some reason say they are not a fascist, then they are definitely a fascist'.  This is the most blatant hypocritical thing I've seen in weeks. Half of fascism is about the forcible suppression of the opposition. Yet, this 'intellectual' argues for that. I long for a world in which people could think for themselves instead of buying into glib drivel."
"yooooo i couldn't even concentrate on what you were saying because you look so much like a dude lol"
"- So I have to hate America, its culture and everything that makes it great to not be a fascist? you are out of your mind! - Anti-fa strategies are shutting down marches a rallies and censoring different ideas?, sounds pretty fascist to me! - In the end you are a communist, no wonder why you hate America and everything it represents."
"What if I am a moderate and like the alt right."
"You described white nationalism, not fascism.  Perhaps you should actually open a real history book after you get your dress fitted.  We will have an ethnostate, Jews are trying to wipe us out and degenerates like you have no place in our society.  I don't care if you call me a Nazi, better to be called a Nazi and be breathing than be a PC corpse, try that on when you grow up and really  think about things."
"Beyond Djibouti there are no Fascist left in the world, and there hasn't been since Italy was defeated in WWII  Nothing you mentioned has anything to do with Fascism. Beyond that, each of the points you said the Alt Right believe, are actaully true despite your claim."
"I hope this comment somehow gets through to the creator. I consider myself largely sympathetic of the alt right, or at the very least, ethnonationalism in general. I enjoy having sincere discussions with left wingers because it gives perspective and broadens my worldview. This video was very disappointing, and profoundly flawed.  Those three points of definition listed in the beginning... from where do they come? What source do you go by? Yourself? I'm sorry, but I can't think of any contemporary scholar who would agree with you. I read a recent book (written by a leftist) outlining all the opinions of people like Griffin, Gentile, Payne, Sternhell, Gregor, Passmore, Paxton, etc... none of them would share your sentiment. Look them up. Actual scholars on the ideology should know more about it than self-proclaimed antifascist youtubers. Fascism is a revolutionary and authoritarian form of nationalism, based on a corporative economic system, national unity, collaboration of the classes, militarism and state glorification. Those are the necessary criteria. Fascism is not about thinking of whites as a unity, fascism is not belief in and subsequent revolt against white extinction, fascism is not the desire to create an ethnostate. Your definition is incredibly reductionist and completely made up. It forms an extremely poor basis for the rest of the video.  What standard of quality do you set for the rest of the content by frequently referring to people or groups as 'fascist' without explaining why or how (even going by your made up definition, it would still be preferrable), and constantly arguing from what amounts to little more than pure speculation? '99% of fascists don't call themselvess fascist' -so you think you have the perfect formula for discerning 'the real fascists' in such a ridiculously absurd case? Even you should understand how laughably vauge things are getting. 'They will claim they aren't white supremacists but still have white supremacy as a goal' -how? From where do you get this? Is it physically impossible wanting whites to have their own countries without considering them innately superior? We did it for the vast majority of our history. But after 1945 it's permanently impossible because you say so?  Your argument is but one giant conspiracy theory. 'Fascists have been lurking underground since ww2, conceiving the perfect strategy for taking over while constantly denying their true nature, and then, once they're in charge, they're gonna show who they really are and gas every minority in existece! And ONLY we, the poor, demonized leftists and antifa's, will be able to stop them'... Yeah, sorry, I am not convinced. The official name of the Berlin Wall was 'antifascist protection wall'. Countless innocent east Germans were shot, surpressed and separated from their families and loved ones in the name of 'antifascist protection'. If anyone manipulates language, it's the left. You will keep claiming anyone remotely nationalist is a fascist, you will keep terrorize them and their families, no matter how wrong you can be proven to be, because your bitter worldviews consist of grand, mythological narratives that justify all sorts of reprehensible behaviour, in the names of symbols and labels."
"Nah, we use irony because lefties wont debate. And its fun to trigger those prone to triggering. Kekistan is a hate group according to the SPLC... its over we won."
"What is even that thing?"
"you are a disgusting tranny lmao"
"Holy Dark Mother!  Contra, this was your most watched video! Twice as many views compared do your average video! Did something happen that I wasn't aware of?"
"The free speech section sounds kinda like 'You goddamn centrists with your principles! Free speech isn't important, you should censor bad people because they hurt people's feelings!' Because that's not a slippery slope or anything...."
"My god, I finally got through the whole thing, and it's hard for me to believe someone of your intelligence could do so much for the ethnonationalist cause. You've made even blue dog democrats out to be secret fascists. You briefly talk about 'leftists being fooled' into adopting policies that fascists like, usually we just call that 'the law' - but you can't help but betray your marxist roots when crafting these criticisms. It's always very convenient to leave out the fact that YOUR personal views on the subject are typically AGAINST the law of the land. Is this not STRATEGICALLY misleading people? As if to say that the DEFAULT position is actually AGAINST the law, and is a very small detail that the whole world agrees on EXCEPT FOR 'fascists.' You attack 'centrists' and 'skeptics' as if they are too stupid to see what fascists are, as if YOU are intellectually above them and smarter than them. You should tattoo Pepe on your ass cheeks, that's how helpful you really are. We appreciate your hard work and hope for more 'explainers' like this."
"Is someone who says 'We need borders' a fascist? According to your video, it's a strong cryptofascist dog whistle. It's like you're overthinking this and trying to larp as part of the underground railroad, yet at the same time you create the exact environment where people are going to accuse eachother of racism and fascism. No one can watch your video and walk away thinking 'Well, next time someone says 'we need borders,' I'll politely ask them probing questions.' You know that this doesn't happen. You know what DOES happen. In fact, my response to this is VERY VERY cryptofascist. Why? Because I'm not 100% agreeing with the leftist hadiths, that's really all it takes to become a fascist. What else makes you a fascist? Silence or not having an opinion at all - because white silence is oppression."
"I'm an Earthling."
"There's no need to be covert about racism, we'll let the left continue digging their shiv into all white people. The idea of 'strategy' is silly, the entire reason we're having this conversation is the incrementalism and marxist rhetoric mainstreaming from college campuses. This is a balancing act that has no possibility of ever going away by hammering 1 side more than the other, it doesn't matter how many Charlottesvilles or red army stonings occur. We could try dialing the rhetoric back to the 90's where MJ told us it didn't matter if you're black or white, but the first to cry foul will be intersectional feminists."
"Loveeeeeeeeeee it!!"
"'Vikings' didn't defend a 'race' - in fact, they couldn't care less about abstract concepts such as 'races' - but sadly, since Wagner hijacked Nordic Mythology it has been used as a ideological tool! --- Great video by the way...."
"Yooo"
"What the fuck is this thing talking in this video?"
"Contra I do hope you read this.  It is incredibly disingenuous to paint the 'both sides' argument as a dog whistle for fascism.   This is because you've painted a false dichotomy with fascists on one side and people who simply oppose fascism on the other. You justify the violence against the alt-right by saying more options are on the table when opposing an ideology that could lead to enormous casualties and I understand that. The problem is that much of anti-fa's explicit goal is to promulgate anarcho-communism which in the end leads to just as many casualties. You also argue that fascism is more likely to succeed but I also think that is false given how economically illiterate most of America is by that last election.   Almost every argument you make in this video to justify antifas actions can easily be used to justify the actions of the people who appose anarcho-communism and therefore apppose antifa. Communists don't admit to being communists. Communists use dog whistles to hide their true intentions. Communism will inevitably lead to violence just like fascism they're two sides of the same coin so I think saying 'there were bad people on both sides' is a very fair thing to say. And I think its incredibly disingenuous for you to act like antifas only goal is to stop fascism."
"So any ethnic group that seeks to defend their heritage is considered fascist?  Anyone wanting to defend their parents, siblings and children is also a fascist?  The free-market homogeneous United States in 1900 is as fascist as the state-socialist homogeneous Nazi Germany?  Isn't the fascist ideology based on a socialist state and censorship, which is very akin to communism?"
"Good video, keep up the good work 👍🏼"
"Please stop smoking! Your voice is like sand paper in my ears!"
"your part about symbols is very misleading imo. As example, the Iron Cross is very common in Germany as in other eastern and middle European states (germanys army insignia, medals and orders like the Order of Merit or the Pour le Merite). The frog and pepe also aren't alt-right only, and the Milk emoji started as a satire of Identity Politics."

"Nothing like giving Black  and Latino people, the right to be openly racist while saying, 'bad Whitey, you suffer from white fragility.'  You people are the ones creating this backlash with every bit of your hatred of the White Male. So fuck you."
"I usually beat my friend when accusing antifascist of being the same as WW2 Nazi's.  Centrist are all the same,  viva the far-Left!  Centrists are all racist idiots that refuse to get on the leftist's side. Freedom of speech should be censored since FDR refused immigrants fleeing the Holocaust and put their own people in camps.   So,  duck you and pick the left's side less you find Antifascist being shut down and in another WW2."
"Do you honestly think there are more white nationalists or facists than there are liberals, conservatives and centrists? seems mad to think that, and seems even more mad that this small minority can trick the large population"
"I think we also must define what exactly is and isn't free speech."
"What's wrong with being a fascist? All fascism means, according to dictionary definition, is: 'An authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization'.  All governments of the world are authoritarian in one way or another (USA doesn't have true democracy given how the electoral commission has the final say over the popular vote). To be Nationalistic is to put the interests of your nation first - hardly a novel or controversial thing by any means. 'Right-wing' merely means conservatism, and social organization well that's self-explanatory.   So, ContraPoints , care to enlighten me as to how fascism is 'bad'?      Furthermore, 'white'/European genocide (going by the United Nations' definition of 'genocide') is very real and at this stage, almost irreversible. European races have a right to preserve their respective races, cultures and native national identities just like any other racial group of people."
"Yes I am a white supremacist. I want white people, and to be more specific the Swedes (which I am part of) to remain the majority and thereby preserve self-determination in their ancestral homeland, Sweden.   It's good that weird trannies and leftist like yourself are honest with your ideas. If things turn sour because of the policies you promote I doubt many normal poeple with have any contention with your sort getting a one way ticket to, say Saudi Arabia.   If a multicultural dreamland emerges out of this I'll be more than happy to admit I was wrong all along. Time will tell."
"Wow, this is a pretty informative video.  Thank you for taking the time for making it. I'll definitely  share this video to whoever willing to listen."
"Anyone who does not agree with you is racist, alt-right, nazi, fascists.  You are only for free speech if it agrees with you- otherwise NO."
"Found this on my recommended feed after watching some 'alt-right' meme videos. Makes me go hmm tbqh."
"ah look...kids playing politics..."
"You are the scum of the earth. Enjoy working for the  globalist bankers. What a disgusting world you are helping create."
"This is an excellently made and important video! As someone who has Jewish heritage and has personally known a Holocaust survivor whose entire family was murdered, the chanting at the beginning of the video is deeply haunting. When I feel overwhelmed by events like Charlottesville, people like you who are willing to speak up and make videos such as these give me a sense of hope."
"This is so good, thank you for making it. Also your wallpaper is covered in pug faces."
"Excellent video as always. One thing I would like to say is that online, I always want to join in and point out a lot of these flaws of thinking that these alt-right guys spread, yet I'm not a great thinker. I'm always super-jealous of your ability."
"Fascism is when the government in co-ordination with the corporations uses state power to control the production of the nation... what you are talking about is some form of racial ideology..."
"Ah here we have an example of the fascist transhumanist brownshirt gender patrol. But she's got such good production value! Tens of thousands killed by Islam, one woman run over by a half-retarded man in Charlottesville... Hmmm... Oh that must mean I'm a fascist for pointing that out."
">'what fascists believe'  >only lists thing that the italian fascists didn't believe."
"It's obvious you always have an agenda and lack any objectivity in your arguments. They'll convince intellectual midgets in an echo chamber, but no one else gives a shit. If you had convincing points that weren't riddled with falsities then maybe someone on the right would consider debating you. All of everything you've said has already been countered before. None of what your presenting is wise or revealing in anyway, but I don't expect anything different from a trans pozzed progressive. The funniest part is where you claim 'fascists' don't accept diversity of opinions, which is exactly what you do this entire video. Your side despises anyone who has a different opinion and they're automatically ousted if it doesn't match up to what the far left demands. You label anyone a fascist that disagrees with your psychotic self destructive ideology hell bent on despising all white people who don't disavow X. You gave away your obvious hatred for all whites when you mentioned the ACLU post. Anytime you see a white child it triggers you so fucking bad you have to connect it to national socialism in someway....talk about moving goal posts and mental gymnastics. You despise white people as a whole and think white children represent some form of 'white supremacy.' It's quite obvious you hate your own race and don't hold these same regards up for any other group. Get help, isn't it tiring pretending to be a a victim every waking minute? This entire video can be summed up as 'If you do XYZ you are a fascist, and if you disagree you're a fascist.'"
"lol praise kek"
"Okay I subbed here recently because I find this channel provides a relatively coherent articulation of the social justice outlook that consistently makes interesting points each video, though I usually find my self in opposition to the general thrust of it. I think you are correct (and do a pretty thorough job) in outlining the many ways that fascists cloak their views and propagandise the public by easing them in with more acceptable talking points. But I object to the conclusion that therefore people spouting those less extreme talking points are either crypto-fascists or gullible rubes sucked in by fascist propagandists who just need to be educated on the matter to snap them out of their stupor (it is important to note that 99% of fascists cloaking their views in these talking points does not mean they constitute a large percentage of people who hold those views). What's worth considering is precisely why are those views more acceptable and attractive (as clearly something makes them relevantly different than the extreme fascist views) to large numbers of people? One possibility, worth seriously considering if one wishes to challenge one's understanding of these issues, is that some of those views are actually correct and that is precisely why they are effective at drawing people in and then later the propagandists will attempt to slyly insert their more insidious agenda."
"'incremental approach to long-term goals that I wish were more common on the left' The left invented this, my friend. For the life of me, I will never understand how intelligent leftists get away with feigning ignorace of deep strategy like this. It's sort of like your observation about it being adorable when girls pretend they have no idea how many guys they've slept with. I suppose it has quite a lot to do with the similar refusal to acknowledge the left's hegemonic control of culture, media, and the political landscape as a whole. 'we're the underdogs! No strategy or institutional power here, just nice people with placards! Root for us!'"

"Secret symbols? is this serious or joking? Is pepe really seriously used for secret code?"
"This video's point is negated simply by way of exclusion. It's easy to confirm your bias when that's all you pay attention to; your view and anything that supports it. It's called being...'narrow minded' or 'ignorant'. BTW, not a conservative or religious! Imagine that!"
"I love the David Lynch-isms that you put in your videos."

"Secret Kabal of frogposting milk drinkers who fuck with over emotionally modern liberals are actually a front for the fourth Reich. I'm glad that with all of your study into the rise of 20th century fascism post great war and the subbranches of the mixed economic nation state based ideology punching right through the 21st century via Japanese image boards. Yes! We are what Mosley, Mussolini Codreanu, Primo de Rivera, Dollfuss and Quisling dreamed of when the rise of the fascist state was at hand. Hail!"
"This feels like the most horrible acid trip ever..."
"Wtf am I watching"
"Thank god that you've made this. I'm fucking sick and tired of the blatant racism here in YouTube from these nazi snowflakes getting triggered from people who have different opinions."
"Seriously. How can you find something wrong with 1) if you are not a genocidal maniac full of hatred? Just replace the word white with black or jew."
"It's making a comeback because the left kept insisting that race has to be full and center to everything, of course white people would say, everybody but us? you gave them an issue to coalesce but you seem to ignore it as usual. Also, now that ANTIFA finally is called a domestic terrorist group, will you please acknowledge Trump wasn't crazy to say that we have terrible actors on the left as well?"
"I find it kind of funny how Contra accuses the alt-right of using irony to mask their ideas, but at the end of the video uses the phrase 'comrades' ironically at the end of the video, which by the logic in the video, would make contra a closet communist."
"Most of your points are fair... But you compared ANTI FA to the police and you pretty much patronise centrists throughout the entire video...?"
"LOL Who is this dude?"
"KIDS WHOSE A FACIST? EVERYONE WHO SAYS THEY AREN'T!"
"Mostly right observation on the Alt right. The thing is, something is degenerate and the right is not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"I generally agree with a significant amount of what you've said here. My main concern is that the left has to do a better job of convincing people that they are a better option. When you have a slew of people on one side yelling 'racist, fascist, anti-gay' at you and people like you on a regular basis, but the other side is talking about preserving you and your way of life, it's not hard to understand why the latter is so appealing. Stop the insults, stop the guilt by association, and start being funny, friendly and inviting. Then I can finally stop sitting alone in my little corner and feel justified in joining the debate."
"Love that your videos are all basically short art films with ridiculous attention to detail, the discourse never looked so good"
"This is like a mirror Alex Jones. The conspiracies are strong with this one. 😂 what's the opposite of lizard aliens?  Bird aliens?"
"I used to roll deep with the conspiracy crowd, because I found it hilarious and fascinating as an outsider. That kinda gives me a perspective on how that mind works and as much as I want to oppose the fascist I'm a bit wary on how close this video resemblences the thought patterns behind those videos as well. I know you're right on some level, I've been around but at the same time this video gives me all the red flags I've learned to spot. I side with you though, it's just that this whole situations seems to be increasingly complex and overwhelming, every side seems to own an arsenal of dog whistles and coded language, it's just absolutely overwhelming."

So the sum total of all this is, no matter what they say, if I decide someone is a white supremacist or nazi, they just are, cuz code words and stuff, and I just know because I'm a mind reader, and I'm arrogant and omnipotent enough to 'know', because I just know, you know?!"
"I was on board until you took the emoji dogwhistles seriously."
"Wow you really think people that use the kekistan flag are fascists and not mocking both sides of identity politics with a completely made up identity?  This is fucking sad....keep wallowing in your ignorance."
".....please google Kafkatrap"
"I do agree with what you said, but you must not forget the differences between fascism and nazism. Several times during your video you said the X when you were supposed to the say Y, vice versa."
"I am aware of the strategies you speak of, but what is odd is how is a person to differentiate between that and what this video might also be further control propaganda.  The 'leftist' radicals might use the very same tactics in order to establish a narrative also, such as creating doubt within the positions of centrists, in order to persuade them to join the 'anti' fascists in their holy crusade.  I can just see someone making this same exact video, but for the opposing side, I do not think you realize that you yourself are either a part of something else or falling into the same traps.  I guarentte that these identitirians have similiar theories for the actions of communists and globalists."
"Why the fuck is kek here their whole bit is trolling the far left And right"
"Literal eye aids"
"This video has converted me to the alt-right - thank you"
"One thing that's frustrating is you seem to be aware of WHY closeted racists disguise their racism with race neutral arguments, and how useful idiots end up echoing those talking points.  And yet, I don't think there was enough on how to defeat their strategy, in fact pretty much ended with 'keep up the good fight.' (as if nothing about how that fight is being conducted needs to change)  Usually the seemingly race neutral arguments the closeted racists create and the useful idiots echo are shit on their own terms, you could sidestep looking crazy by addressing the arguments as put and defeating them that way.  I only see figuring out whether or not someone's a fascist as important if they're running for any kind of office or if they're being considered for any level of management position or if you're looking for fascist organisations to infiltrate and observe."
"Brainwashed white dudes in dresses make me question why I care so much about my people at all."
"I never took you for a bigot against religions, why are you using european religious symbols when talking about fascists, you might as well say the christian cross is a fascist symbol, you have no respect for these symbols cultural origins by misusing these images, just like the nazis misused their image. Don't be such a bigot contra and dont justify the nazi scums misuse of these images by mirroring it"
"A ver si al final sí van a ser molinos..."
"Strategy number 8 and 9 are legit. I support free speech, and liberal-humanism idea. Nazis, Commies, religious fundamentalists, atheist/anti-theist, anarchists, SJW, feminists, etc all have their rights to promote their ideas. No one can silence others, no matter what ideas they have (as long as it does not incite violence and/or a baseless accusation that can have legal consequences).  Anyway, on social issues, I consider myself a centrist (by American standard that is, of which in my own country, I'm pretty hard left), and after watching latest development from your country, I agree that the centrist will be lot more sympathetic toward alt-right. The alt-right talking points are more sensible, unlike some SJW and leftist who demands everybody else to adopt their ideas and tolerate their nasty behaviors."
"Gotta love all the commies liking and commenting on such videos. One of the most genocidal ideologies alever attempted lol."
"Extremely good analysis. Describes a lot of the things I had perceived myself about the modern far-right but had trouble putting into words."
"Fascism can arise from any ideology.  I see the left as working towards its own version of Fascism.  When the state makes it imperative for everyone to embrace an ideology that also facsism.  When the left requires complete adherence to its beliefs, and criminalize anyone who isn't entirely in agreement with them, then that's also Fascism.   What you're calling evidence of a fascist alt right, is most likely a totally understandable reaction to the left's current escalation of its insistence that they represent the only moral good.  The leftists are the bullies now."

"This video is something a fascist would make.  Fascism is a tool to achieve an end. The real underlying issue is identity politics. Reducing somebody down to their immutable traits and making judgements or prescriptions based on those traits. So when these people like ContraPoints talk about their identity and how it makes them politically active and valid, its the exact same basic core of the white nationalist movement. George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, was an admirer of Malcolm X... and vice versa. Malcolm X invited Rockwell to speak at several events. Both men were after the same goal, a society where a person is judged on their immutable characteristics first... in their case, race was the trait they wanted judged. They were both after the separation of races. Both men were equally horrific in their ideas and goals. So when ContraPoints and people like ContraPoints talk about 'white privilege' or what 'blackness' means or 'cultural appropriation' or anything where an entire group is judged and ascribed an attribute based entirely on a single immutable aspect of an individual, they are the other side of the same coin of the white nationalists and white supremacists. ContraPoints is Richard Spencer. Kristi Winters is Jared Taylor. BLM is the white nationalist and white supremacists groups. This all comes from the same place, the only difference is the delivery method (fascism vs. communistic means, although there's a hairs difference between them in practice), the players (e.g. whites and white allies = oppressors vs. Jews and non-whites = oppressors), and the power (ContraPoints ideology has institutional control while the white supremacists and white nationalists are on the outskirts). The structure is the same, the yearning for authoritarian control is the same, the acceptance of violence is the same, the logic is the same, the manipulative propaganda is the same... just like George Lincoln Rockwell and Malcolm X. Two sides of the same coin.  So when I say, 'this video is something a fascist would make' I'm being a little facetious. I mean 'fascism' as ContraPoints thinks of it, only in a frame of white identity politics. So yeah, a 'fascist' [white identitarian] would make this because ContraPoints isn't any different from one."
"is this real, this is funny as fuck, symbols? lol"
"if 'fascists' say they aren't fascists, what would a non-fascist say to deny they aren't a fascists"
"maybe look into what fascism is before making a video on Nationalism, not the same thing why is it ok to say that white countries aren't allowed to be white, yet in South Africa (among other non-white nations) white people have to be moved out, white people (Boers for example) who share no culture with other nations btw the 4chan website has many members, not just alt right, theres alt left there too"

It's just sad that we have to keep fighting it over and over."

"Arg god the word fascist and Nazi are severely abused in this video, if a genuine resurgence occurs (in numbers more than one or two flags at a unite the right rally) of something emulating Italian fascism or the NSDAP what are you going to call it? And will people believe you?  Point one even suggests wanting to support or preserve European derived (a true description by the way) western civilisation with thousands of years of history, philosophy and a complex progression through the divinity of the individual and the divinity of true speech via Christianity which developed in to the scientific method and laid the foundation for the moral grounding, individualism, limited government, separation of church and state and civil liberties in most of the west is 'something fascists believe', it's just so far off, fascism being collectivist is a huge divergence from the values at the root of western civilisation, in a way it is a negation of the enlightenment.  That historical root is the reason why you have the moral framework you do whether you notice it or not, either way suggesting people who view discussion of western civilisation as a possible 'dog whistle' for something sinister is not a good idea.  You can still be rooted in history, philosophy and the framework of christian morality while being a classical liberal for example, in fact i would suggest it could strengthen your understanding of it.  I have studied these movements in depth, the NPI has nothing to do with Nazism, that's just factual.  Whatever you think of the above you won't benefit what you're doing by misleadingly misusing terms, you would benefit yourself by having precisely defined terms for every term you use to describe different political movements, just saying Nazi and fascist glares to anyone who's academically studied these phenomena that you haven't put in the effort and also is likely to stir up more hatred between groups  As broader and broader groups of people are labeled fascist, white supremacist and Nazi the more violence there will be from people who feel morally justified in 'punching Nazis' and then the 'punched' groups respond and it will continue to grow from there."

"Someone's been taking video making cues from dreamydiglot"
"(Beware, long and well thought out comment) Okay let's break down this clusterfuck of strawmans. Let's get this out of the way, no, your not a fascist for saying facsict are bad, it's taught to everyone in school that it's bad, so it goes without saying that I as an imigrant don't want any white supremacy or fascism, or communism for that matter.  Now that that's out of our way, what the left does isn't helping at all. Does anyone remember Europe before ww2, didn't anti fascist fight, bomb, and kill people with nazi sentiment, then the nazis' gain sympathy and then they came in and restored order, the communists gave them the moral high ground. the alt-right and their leaders have said that the identity politics that many one the left play directly feed the alt-right and when people in the DNC says that their job is to silence white people, when left presidents says it's a good thing that white people will be a minority in the future because reasons, when colleges and big companies lower or even only accepts immigrants or minorities (basically combating racism with racism) and activity censors dissenting opinions like Google, gives the alt right the moral high ground as the left continues to prove the alt-right's points.   Calling black lives matter a civil rights group is disingenuous at best. They and their leaders have pushed for violence, done many riots that destroyed many communities, and said many things that fall under the category of supremacist speech (be it black or white) Antifa are the communist of the early 1920's that fought the localized groups of nazis that then helped the nazis gain sympathy across Europe. Antifa is the other side of the coin when it comes to the alt-right. the 'alt left' or far left will try to intimidate, use violence, silence dissenting speech, and if given enough power, eventually kill by class or belief as they like to glorify Stalin's actions. The white supremacists want you out of their country or they'll kill you, the communist want you poor and work as a slave for the rest of your life, and if you become successful you'll be killed, same shit different skin.  As for the part where you talk about the alt right using symbols, that entire part is just a conspiracy theory rant. Any group can get any symbol and use it, the alt right, and mostly pol use pepe, milk, and the OK sign to fuck with people like you, to make you paranoid, to make you chases after nothing just so they can laugh at how dumb the entire thing is. Good example was when they photoshopped a Muslim sjw to look like a terrorist bomber after a terrorist attack happened and the next day many news outlets took the bait, to which everyone else that could do the least bit of research laughed at, because Pol are a bunch of bored, autistic, loli lovers with abilities like Liam Neeson to find people and things to then fuck with for fun. Like Pol is the dream team for any company when it comes to marketing and spreading ideas. All in all, the entire section you did on symbols is just so badly thought out that it looks more like a paranoid rant than anything else.  Finally, how to (((fix))) the problem (you can't, but you can diminish it) You let the far right and far left speak about their ideas, let them blast it for everyone to hear, and force them to defend their ideas when people ask critical questions. both sides have existed for a long time and will keep existing, but at the moment the left feeds the right with reason and the moral high ground, and the right feeds the left with racist rhetoric, and it's a vicious feedback loop. For actually positive change both sides would have to change, but mainly the left as they fuel the far right; something said by the far right, their leaders, Bernie sanders, and most people with some common sense and historical knowledge.  So Left, stop being so righteous and virtuous, there is a time and a place for virtue and sympathy or empathy, and it's not all the time and definitely not in government, law, school, or the mainstream. The left needs to stop doing identity politics, stop using violence against speech, stop discriminating against Asians, whites, and sometimes Indians, and stop fighting racism with racism. Stop making minorities into victims then attacking them if they speak against your ideas or become successful. Wanna know why you see race discrepancies, let me explain in the best terms. On average most poor people in America are white, most Asians are really smart, most Indians are successful, most blacks grow up with crime, and most Hispanics have a low standard of living, this is not because of their race, ethnicity, or genetics (except if you have mental illnesses) it's the way they where raised, the culture they grew up in, and most importantly, how they are as individuals. The white man is poor because he doesn't know how to manage money and feels entitled to benefits, the Asian is smart because all they do is study hard as they have high expectations, Indians are successful because they work hard and are scrupulous, the blacks grow up in violence because their music, friends, and culture glorifies gang culture and victimization, the Hispanics have a low standard of living because they don't care for education or planing for the future. This is something I noticed in my school, city, and friends, not some statistic or crazy far right man screaming at me, this is what I have seen in the multiple countries I've been to and in my mostly minority city. It's great to see an ethnic African come to the US and become successful, be a doctor, get ahead in life, do college, even though they got here knowing nothing like my parents, that proves the far right's race realism thing is complete bullshit, the black Americans struggle because of the victim culture, the native African thrives because they know what real suffering is and don't have this victim complex, it's a beautiful thing to see that this county is still the land of opportunities if you're willing to work hard and not give excuses. The right should get their heads out of their asses and do some self reflecting to see how dumb some of their ideas are (((climate change))) and how bad their current leaders are, and that goes to the left too.  What we should do is stop trying to make everyone equal and just try our best to remove obstacles from everyone's life, treat everyone as individuals, follow the words of Martin Luther King Jr and see people for who they are, not what they are, and most importantly, SELF REFLECTION. reflect onto your culture, your values, your ideas, reflect on everything you're doing and ask why and if that makes sense in a bigger context.   TL;DR: this video is crap, uses way too many strawman, and oversimplified everything. The left feeds the right and the right feeds the left creating the political division. And most importantly, just treat people as individuals, be fair to all, and actually do some deep self-reflection every now and then...    also 'don't be evil' (tm)"
"Well I just found out im a fascist"
"'Do not debate them' This is cowardice and only reveals a lack of conviction which translates to lack of substance. If you genuinely believe your arguments are better, then you not only could but should stand to debate.  Your defeatism and running from the debate is precisely why the supposedly nefarious yet nebulous so-called 'alt-right' has risen to prominence in the first place. You're afraid that putting your best intellects up against theirs will result in an inevitable loss of intellectual or political territory. But frankly, you have to have extremely shitty arguments to be afraid of theirs. I watched Roland Martin debate Richard Spencer and Spencer just embarrassed himself. Martin isn't even particularly bright, and yet he cornered Spencer on almost every topic.  What I am saying is, if Martin can do that, then just about any high school debate team member could.  Now imagine if Martin was too afraid to debate Spencer. This would just be an enormous missed opportunity resulting in another forfeiture of intellectual/political credibility.  The only thing you have to fear is when your chosen warrior (think of the trial by combat scenes in Game of Thrones) is very obviously weak and struggles so badly against their chosen warrior that it makes you want to kick a hole in your TV set. This is what happened when the chosen SJW Trevor Noah was tasked with debating the anti-SJW Tomi Lahren. Granted, it wasn't a formal debate, but it was still a disaster because of how inept and anti-intellectual Noah is. Noah looked almost as bad against Lahren (who herself is no intellectual heavyweight) as Spencer looked against Martin. So yes, when you have buffoons like Noah representing your side, I can see why you're very much averse to debate.  But that doesn't mean you should discourage everyone from debating."

"Fascism demands not only expanded government authority, but also size, and it is implemented through an escalation of either violence or threats of violence. In 2016 only one side was forced to cancel a major presidential nominee's rally, and it wasn't the left. The right had to cancel a Trump rally due to opposition violence including the bloodying of police officer at Chicago.  Yet people act like the opposite is true. Go ahead and try to cite one instance of Hillary having to cancel a rally in a major city (or any city for that matter) due to opposition violence. Until you can do that, the fascist shoe only fits the left.  And btw, I wanted Hillary to win, but I've never been more disgusted with the left as a general movement in all of my life.  These people have turned into belligerent savage cannibals.  The social justice warriors are the most anti-social people in society.  The anti-fascists are the most fascist movement on the modern political landscape.  The so-called liberals are the more illiberal people toxifying the discourse.  The supposed 'progressives' have entered regressive retrograde.  In short, they have become the biggest hypocrites and most resoundingly ineffectual party in living memory."

In spite of this contradiction, this meme is incredibly popular with the Left, who's usually known for their logical consistency and historical accuracy..."

"At 1:12 I already have some objections. I love Western culture, and I think that is is the best in the world. I also believe that people from Asia, Africa, and everywhere else can immigrate to here (the USA) and embrace Western culture while bringing some small cultural elements from their homeland. This can be done successfully in limited numbers. But according to the video I am already lumped in with the Fascists even though I am a classical liberal.   Also, shouldn't the term used be 'Nazi' instead of 'Fascist'? Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini weren't very ardent followers of white supremacy, yet they were the textbook definition of fascist."

It's reassuring to hear there are some out there who are interested in a better world that isn't couched in ideology of division and cruelty. The promise of compassion and humanity remains, but it is up to us to fulfill it.  EDIT: Boy, this comment sure did trigger a lot of snowflakes. Yep you got me! It turns out I WAS the real fascist all along. Please! I’m simply suggesting that I’m in favor of cooperation and compassion over waving tiki torches and Nazi flags whilst espousing ideology couched in ignorance and division. If reading that makes you fly into an angry ad hominem flinging rage, I think you may have some soul-searching to do. But then again, I don’t think anyone comes around to fascism through pensive self-reflection. In my opinion, you “white nationalist” types are being played for chumps by an unscrupulous lot who will happily discard you once they’re through with you. So you go ahead and keep believing everyone is out to get you if that’s what makes you happy, brother. I will continue volunteering and communicating and building in my community, the way I’ve been doing, in furtherance of a better world FOR ALL and not just for those who happen to share the same amount of melanin in their skin as I do (or lack thereof! For the record I’m as pale as they come). I encourage others to join me. We aren’t going to get anywhere by turning on one another; certainly not anywhere peaceful. Good luck to y’all, god bless."

"'Fascism'  The modern left's definition of fascism encompasses well over half of the population. It encompasses everyone who is not a leftist.  You don't accuse people of being fascists because they actually are fascists, you do it because you disagree with them and want to stigmatize them. Whether or not they really are fascists is irrelevant - regardless of whether they are or not, you call them a fascist. According to your diction, fascists are fascists, centrists are fascists, conservatives are fascists, libertarians are fascists, anyone who does not agree with you is a fascist.   Once you have successfully stigmatized them and they are feared by the apolitical majority, that will allow you to completely disenfranchise them - de-platform them, censor them, physically assault them when they attempt to hold political rallies or recruit people to their cause, etc.  Once that happens, you will no longer have any need to acknowledge their ideas - you can dismiss all of your critics as evil, stupid and insane, and the apolitical majority will simply believe you without even thinking about it. Because that's what the apolitical majority has always done, they listen to the loudest voice and assume that everyone else is evil, stupid and insane.  Modern day leftists are brutal and deceptive in equal measure. They will beat you to a pulp, and all the while they will accuse YOU of beating THEM. Your kind can never be trusted, not ever again, not under any circumstances. You can apologize and swear up and down that you've changed all you want, but it won't count for anything.   You've shown your true colors. You have proven yourselves to be utterly devoid of principles. You will do anything to advance your own ideology and destroy your political rivals - this makes you a dire threat to anyone who does not share your ideology.  And once everyone else realizes that you are a threat to them, ALL OF THEM will become threats to YOU. Can you tell me what happens then...?"
"People on the political extremes always use these tactics. Big deal. Most of us agree with some of it and disagree with most of it. Btw, who is this Alt-Right you're talking about?

You should publish it for all to see."
"You know what I believe you are a fascist there's nothing you can do to disprove it because by saying you're not a fascist you prove you're a fascist because that's what a fascist would say.

"This video rubs me the wrong way in a few places, and what makes it worse is that I'm not even completely sure as to how to express it without any risk of being misunderstood, given the degree of paranoia you yourself admit to having.  I guess it just feels a bit to... harsh in general? I dunno, maybe it just hits to close to home, as someone who's kinda in the middle of the major internet social divide. I think it's good to keep in mind that quote from the Matrix 'Denial is the most predictable of human responses', you should always be aware of the fact that people can be turned off very quickly by certain claims, words or attitudes. Whenever hearing some opinion I don't quite agree with, it's kind of tempting to listen for some excuse to dismiss it and the person delivering it, so that I can lump everything in neat boxes such as good opinions, bad opinions, people with bad opinions, etc.  Fuck, I don't even know where I'm going with this, I gladly write really long comments generally, but this video already has some 6000 comments, so I'm not sure what I could properly do with this set-up without ending up writing a damned essay that no one will read. I guess I'll try not to ramble TOO much. I somewhat feel that terms like fascist are being used a bit lightly in this video, it seems demonizing to a point that turns me off. Then again, maybe that's just a bias of mine, since I'm basically the kind of 'centrist' you talk about in the video.  I guess I also feel the need to mention the turn-off I fel upon hearing Steve Shives. Although I do kinda realize that a lot of my dislike of him is largely distain from the 'skeptic' sphere that's rubbed off. I guess that when I calm down about it, I'm not entirely sure quite how I feel about the dude. I still have some fond memories of him. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, I haven't even watched his videos in quite a while, for all the fuck I know he could be more agreeable now.  I suppose I'd also like to mention that I feel like Contra has changed over time. Aside from the obvious. In the early videos I got a sense of you as someone who'd taken a step back, and was taking a critical look at some of the things they used to be more closely associated with. Whereas nowadays I feel more like you're someone who's started getting more comfortable in a new position, and I tend to get kind of uncomfortable with people seem to secure in their position, at least when it comes to sensitive social matters. I tend fear it can be a sign of someone starting to talk with the vocabulary and narratives of one side, alienating others, and that it can lead to seeing others less as people who are to be understood in a human and compassionate way.  Fuck, I ended up writing half an essay anyway. Damn it. Even on the off-chance that Contra sees this comment, she's probably not going to read it."

"The problem here is that by this logic it becomes very very hard to tell if anyone is a fascist. And these labels can be applied both ways to left leaning people as well as right, as long as they don't agree to open borders."
"You described a white supremacist, not a fascist. Fascism is not exclusively white, any person of any race can be a fascist. Race is irrelevant when it comes to fascism, yes fascists often believe their race to be superior but that as said can be said of anyone; white, black, asian etc."

"hey... pssssst..... Fascism doesn't mean Racist. That's why they are separate words, ya know, cuz they aren't the same. Fascism is the rule of a dictatorial leader. A leader who you can't make youtube videos about.. if America is Fascist, why are you still aloud to post youtube videos? Fascism exists in North Korea, Syria, and possibly Kenya.... Just Google 'Fascist Countries today'"
"LMAO if this is what we're up against, I'm no longer worried."
"Everything you're mocking about the alt-right wanting to be around their own or establishing a place for 'their people' is exactly what other groups feel. Just because you feel no real connection to your roots and obviously don't care about continuing your bloodline doesn't mean other ethnic groups have lost that. They will replace what you recognize with something else BECAUSE they are working toward group goals."
"So here's my main criticism of your video, primarily on the subject of dogwhistles:  You say a few times that we should not assume that anyone who uses these dogwhistle phrases is necessarily a fascist, even thought fascists are almost always using these dogwhistle phrases themselves. You recognize the syllogistic fallacy of 'a-->b, therefore b-->a', and so are making the video simply to explain the tactics of these ideological extremists.  There is a problem with this assertion, though: the title of your video. 'How to recognize a fascist'. This is not simply a statement of explanation, this is a statement of instructive practice.   From 7:06: 'So if you want to recognize a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to hear dogwhistles.'  And as you recognize later in the video, it can be very difficult, perhaps nearly impossible, to distinguish between an actual white supremacist using a dogwhistle phrase such as 'Western Culture', and a non-white supremacist talking about 'Western Culture' plainly. So the question becomes, how DO we tell the difference between the two? How can we recognize the fascist apart from the non-fascist?   This is the critical question of your topic, 'how to recognize a fascist'.   And you don't answer it. You don't even attempt to answer it.  In its absence, the only answer we have left to 'how to identify a fascist' is the tactics you indicated, which were designed to make these extremists indistinguishable ('blend in') from the rest of the populace; 'how to identify a fascist' ends up identifying anyone who uses dogwhistle phrases because you haven't indicated how to distinguish between genuine and disingenuous actors. Without answering the critical question of your topic, you are encouraging the association fallacy you claim to oppose. To one such as myself, your statements about not making the syllogistic fallacy feel more like lip service to rationality than anything else.  Now, in regards to the topic in general: while it's interesting and instructive to see how extremists hide behind 'dogwhistle' phrases, I also think it's not worth paying such deceptive tactics too much attention. The result is invariably a sense of paranoia, which you freely admit to feeling in this video. This constant paranoia is not a good state to be in, and is certainly not where our political climate should go; our already fractured political consciousness is bound be become even more fractured. We start to see enemies everywhere and can't give people the benefit of the doubt. At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, that way lies the Red Scare.  So in closing, I think the very act of trying to 'identify the fascists' is a mistaken one. It seems a far better tactic to identify the ideas being touted rather than focus on identities. After all, whatever someone like Richard Spencer chooses to call himself, his opinions on racial politics speak for themselves. You don't need to identify Spencer as a 'Nazi' to expose him; the things he says do that for himself."

"First time watching one of this channel's videos. Very good stuff (love the style) though I have some thoughts...  6:45 Is that... 22:12 Oh, dear lord...  11:15 IIRC, it was Media Matters that said the OK sign was a white power sign. The Tara McCarthys of the world just ran with it then. Though you are spot on with the defence they use.  11:50 Two wrongs...  14:54 I agree, though BLM are awful. The wrong direction to go in to fix those problems imo.  17:27 Agreed. A number of them have blocked me on Twitter.  17:40 *Holy heck!*  18:25 CRG is awful. It baffles me as to how certain YTers get popular. He offers nothing different. There is no need for him. Like at all.  20:47 I dunno about that. I love hearing stupid people with dumb ideas get what's coming to them. Though I do kinda see your point. (21:04)  21:09 That's my favourite thing to do on Sargon/Styxhexenhammer666/PJW's channels.:)  May have to check out more of your vids."
"Awesome video! The only thing though are the fucking comments. Its 2k17. Stop using 'trap' and calling her 'it'. Like, we get it, you're edgy or something for disrespecting someone's identity. But here's some advice: grow the fuck up."
"It's a maaaan baby!"
"Where are all the Nazis?  Get a life losers!"
"Hate directed at Fascists, Alt-Righters, and anti-Semites is hate speech, and you are guilty. Tolerance means everyone, no matter what they believe, you bigot."
"Hello. Just wanted to let you know you sound like a nazi persecuting muslims. Your video reminds me of when anti-muslims argue that there is no such thing as a secular muslim, and that any muslim pretending to like the West is just a covert islamist committing Taqiya. Your reasoning exudes the same type of un-nuanced paranoia.  Of course some fascists can be sneaky, but several of the things you label 'fascist views' are just typical liberal sentiments, such as defending free speech for those whom you disagree with, and thinking that immigration should have a limit somewhere. The video started out good, but ended with 'everyone is possibly a fascist'."
"So the gist of this video is that you can't trust anyone anymore. Can't trust SJWs, can't trust anti-SJWs, can't trust people with any sense of humor, and I'm certainly not trusting people who were so insecure in their sexual identity that they underwent surgery to 'change' it. So what am I supposed to do instead? Curl up in a ball and wait for entropy to arrive?"
"An all heterosexual, white country would be fucking boring."
"I don't think this person knows what fascism is. I suggest reading a couple books on the man who came up with the idea. Sorry, Mussolini was not a racist. He just hated the Catholic church."
"Whites have been forced to identify as a race solely as a reaction to the influx of nonwhites with a very strong sense of identity coming into their countries. Even if you chose to not see yourself as white, this does not change the fact that non whites will see you as a white person. To say race does not exist and only means skin colour is disingenuous,  positive discrimination for non whites is very real. People will self segregate whether you approve of it or not so it is best to organise society around its natural disposition.  This self chosen segregation can be seen everywhere from church congregations to prison populations, to go against this will always result in agitation and violence.  Whites are not breeding at even replacement levels due to feminism and white countries have uniquely had multiculturalism forced on them.  Whites only make up around 10% of the population and are not allowed to have an identity without being associated with hatred of others.   A nation is a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular state or territory, so the beginning of the end is when separate groups start forming within the nation who have different self interests.  Politics is about how to best organise a society for the betterment of all (perhaps thousands if not millions of people) and to mix this up with the rights of the individual is a mistake as the individual can only thrive and exist in a homogeneous society.  Whites are not short of their own low IQ people but the high iQ blacks of the world should be returning to Africa as role models, bringing their western knowledge with them.  How can someone who is black or asian ever be as british as a white person, even if they speak with the same accent and adopt the same culture.  They may act just as whites do but this does not mean that their descendants will not shrug off their parents/grandparents way of life and understandably seek to find and adopt their racial roots and lifestyle.  Imagine the absurdity if a white person who chose to live in china could ever be considered as Chinese as a racially Han-Chinese native by living in their country for a few generations.  Whites need to start standing up for their identity and recognising that they have group interests, our descendants will rightfully look upon us with shame if we do not!"

Not only that but the irony of that when people of your ilk are constantly calling whites 'white' and then also implying all whites are racists.........   The pure unadultered irony  that SJW's call POC black constantly then in the next breath say 'how stupid for you to identify as white/Polish/Jewish/Roman/whatever.  There's no other excuse for your naivety than just a pure lack of common sense and IQ. 'How dare you use identity politics!' I guess if you call whites racists and white constantly at some point they may just say fuck it and identify as white.  LOL dumb people angry over their own ideology being used."

"I can't tell any of you apart anymore. You are star-bellied sneetches. This phase will end and maybe Contra and Riley Dennis will be among the ones writing books about how they were indoctrinated by the MATRIARCHY and how much of a victim they actually were. I can hear it now..  'I had no idea I was projecting or externalizing guilt!'. 'The compassion sounded great, the money was there and I was weak!'. 'The foxes overrunning the hen house should have been a sign!' Then the idiots can figure out if it was Gender Dysphoria or utter grief that ruined them. Meanwhile both sides were too complacent to stop the dumpster fire of social politics. All sides meet their opposite.. within(paradox of yin/yang)"
"Amazing video... also, damn, ContraPoints, you look beautiful as a man, woman and everything in between. Also also, bless the human made CC.  Edit: ok, except for 17:58, just when I thought Jeff the Killer was behind me, now we have this little treat for those sleepless nights."
"https://youtu.be/g4nnS7AiVtU < another good video dealing with the future buffalo bill here has envisioned for Europe.

On the contrary their lands are now vassal states for international finance and bizarre social experiments."

"Do you seriously think that there is no reasonable argument to be made that *illegal* mass immigration from the third world might have some unpleasant consequences for a country like germany?

"So let me ask you this. What if someone really does want to restore Western values without being a fascist or racist, etc? How could you tell?"
"That part about fascists 'going underground' and being 'more subtle' is something that is discussed at length in the works of Foucault from Spinoza to Nietzsche and their comments and archaeological digs of punishment and discipline in society as central values. While not specifically addressing fascists, Foucault is more honest about what happens when drives cannot be expressed outwardly, once enclosure/confinement takes place, the drives still fire, but ricochet inwards and do not diminish in all cases, they expand in a process of internalisation. It's very rare that punishment actually leads to guilt and remorse, which is required for rehabilitation- rather, our beliefs about punishment, or whatever drives cultures underground, is more the advent of craftiness - 'what terrible misfortune hath befallen me that I should be caught! I must be more careful next time!' is the response."

"My goodness, this video is a steaming pile of paranoid delusions. The alt-left ARE the fascists. They're the ones currently holding power in society and the media, and abusing that power systemically in order to try and silence their opposition. Fortunately, their fascist tactics are starting to fail. And going by Contra's logic, if they deny it, it just proves that they're fascists!"
"The alt right exists for one reason, and one reason only - the constant identity politics coming from the left. For how long did you think you could openly vilify white heterosexual males, and blame them for every wrong on the planet before there was a backlash?  You've poked the bear constantly, and now you're complaining about the results.  The alt right are dangerous because an awful lot of them are gun owners. And if you think you'll win a civil war against them, think again. AntiFa are cowardly middle class mummies boys. Marxist students are too thick to realise what they're doing until it's too late. SJWs are pointless invertebrates.  So congratulations, leftists, you're the arbiters of your own downfall. And you're going to drag the rest of us down with you. Fucking idiots."
"You seem like a fascist to me."
"I tried watching your video, but in the first minute, you managed to confuse fascism with nazi-ism. Please, look up fascism on wikipedia. Here is the link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism"
"What saddens me more than the existence of the Alt Left and the Alt Right is that gifted, charismatic and entertaining people like Contra have opted to politicize their talent and wield it like a weapon because it frankly degrades them them into assuming an expendable role.   ... because like all 'soldiers', when the war is over you'll have nothing to do...  I'm a conservative and I think Contra is brilliant.   But watching this individual waste their talent on a petty, tit for tat squabble is fucking depressing."

"I just want to say that not all people who voted for or support trump are nazis....some people voted for Obama AND Trump, some people liked Trump because he seems anti establishment, some people don't believe anything on mainstream news, some people who support Trump are from lgbt community, some people didn't like either candidate but thought Hillary was the more evil of the two, people of all races support trump. It makes no sense to carry anti hate signs, anti racist, anti violence, then hate an entire group based off a stereotype you created, use violence against people who are not nazis but simply have different opinions, and attack people who are white and put them down for the race they are. And as for the ok sign it's new to me that it means white power, because it also is a symbol people in the occult use meaning 666. Lastly I think more trump supporters than not hate nazis just as much as you do.   It sucks that people allow the 'Elite' to use divide and conquer tactics to rule over and control us. Rather than us all working together...all races all people if we came together we would be unstoppable and that is why the rulers of this world constantly try to divide us into different groups..when in reality we are all more alike than we are different.   Peace and love from a person who doesn't hate trump, does hate hillary, voted for Obama, and is not  in anyway a Nazi nor a racist...and to me make america great is not the same thing as great with only white people....and if that's what you think when you see the slogan...it sounds like a personal problem. Why wouldn't you want the country to be great again and out of the globalists hands if that's even possible....just know that's what a lot of Trump supporters mean when they say that."
"LOL just caught up with your twitter on the 'aestheticization of politics'. Comments I left on 'Cosmic Skeptic' yesterday: _  'I'm not a theist. I would though be interested in what an atheist would think about religious art in comparison to modern art - and by extension how this reflects on atheist views of religion. This is a comment about aesthetics btw.'  '(in reply) I turned down a place at the Royal College of Art and an apprenticeship with the BBC to pursue science, engineering, design and technology (this was a while ago). I read once in an interview of Bryan Ferry (of Roxy Music) about his admiration of aesthetics used by the Nazis (David Bowie went further and even adopted fascist views - which he later regretted), but he made a point to deplore the actions of the Nazis. And yet in many european countries Nazi imagery is illegal to display in public (I don't think it would be allowed in an art gallery either) - but how is the mass slaughter of the crusades at the hands of the christians any different when considering imagery associated with them? I personally can't look at a swastika with admiration (or admire Hitler's ability to lead etc.. even if I deplore him). I also can't listen to Michael Jackson (and other artists - those I listen to is out of blissful ignorance). Art for me is about the intent - what is the intention of modern versus religious art?'  You are thinking about 'aestheticization of politics' in terms of Nazis/Fascists.   In terms of Gender Identity (not directly following on from comments above, but throwing it in as it's on my mind) I'm thinking about the 'politicization of aesthetics'.  Read your comments god dammit - you only have 6,000 of them on this video alone!!!!  DX"

"Right wing violence and left wing violence are two very different beasts. They aren't really comparable but both are dangerous.  Right wing violence is dangerous in the same way radical islam is, where the occasional radical goes off the deep end and rams a truck of peace into the 'opposition' (aka innocent crowd). A small handful of similarly minded radicals will applaud this in the closet, the movement as a whole will denounce them for smearing the 'good name' of their politics, and the public at large will see a hate crime and some even go as far to consider a causal link.  Left wing violence involves a mob of outraged moral crusaders on a witch hunt. And when the radicals throw out the appropriate buzzword and starts harassing people, attacking their livelyhood, or assaulting them in the street, the mob joins in.  I refuse to let the future of my country, or 'western' society as a whole be determined by the victor of a fight between neo nazis, white supremacists & biological determinists who hate everything to do with 'foreign invaders & degeneracy' vs communists, anarchists & sociological determinists who hate everything to do with 'white cishet capitalist patriarchy'. Neither of these collectivist zealots value the individual rights & liberties of the world I want to live in. Both appeal to aggregate statistics to justify why their flavour of discrimination is that of the disempowered victim overthrowing an oppressor, and not the foundational tools of a dictatorial rule.  I'm glad you've laid out the deep right's psy-op tactics in an accessible manner. But there's a fine invisible line between dog whistling and projection. They want you to try and censor then, to assault them, and to catch ad many innocents as possible in the crossfire. I won't fight them on your terms because you're playing right into their hands. The radical left is key to their endgame, not its bane."
"What is this guy talking about LOL"
"All i get from this video is that you can't tell the difference between a fascist and a troll."
"Contrapoints, I'd recommend reading these. You might notice some startling and worrying parallels.  https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007819  https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist151/Nazi/poisonousmushroom.pdf  http://www.master-of-education.org/10-disturbing-pieces-of-nazi-education-propaganda/  Because at the moment, you're just like the Nazis handing out fliers that tell people how to identify the Jews that are oppressing them. Despite the fact that the government is right wing, for now, all the narratives that are flying around are your own. Rape culture, institutionalized racism, patriarchy. I'm not saying I'm a smart person, and I'm not saying you are a dumb person, Contra. I'm saying you should READ. HISTORY. Those that do not understand history are DOOMED. TO. REPEAT. IT. And I for one DON'T want a new Nazi Germany. Especially not when it's MY FAMILY who will undoubtedly end up on the chopping block if these FUCKING MYTHS continue to self perpetuate. History. Read it."
"Are you a fascist?... Liar"
"woah heaps sjw just wanna say that theres a difference between alt right, nazis and fascists"
"Can we just talk about the fact that what Contra is doing here is ANTIFA? This is anti-fascist action. A huge part of antifa work is informing and educating about fascism, what it is, how it functions, how to recognise it and how to fight it, and I've rarely seen it done this well and understandable. Fighting fascists is more than just blocking or attacking the when they'er out in the open and threatening folks. It's gather intel, organizing, educating, networking, debating, outing and so, so much more. And every single part of it is equally important. So I just wanted to say, thank you, Contra, and keep up the good work! What you're doing is really important and I think most of your Nazi-punching comrades actually really appreciate it."
"How ironic"
"Yeah... you have no mental issues at all."
"cos 'im not a communist' is exactly what a communist would say ! lololol"
"Is he the next 45% hero? Boy, oh boy!"
"tfw you fucking love milk but it's racist"
"You have exactly zero self-awareness."
"'or an edgy shitposter hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people' allmost spilled my coffee, don't worry Contrapoints we will gas you last ;) <3"
"every video brings Contra closer and closer to the Paul Joseph Watson of the left, just with more glitter echo chamber level 5000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"WTF was that?"
"they seem to really like blonde little girls"
"Just as I thought you were getting out of your echo chamber, you crawl back in farther than ever."
"This dude is hysterical. I can't decide if its more like homophobia, the actual witch hunts, drug war propaganda, alex jones, david icke or sexual moral panick. Whatever it is, its the most farcical morally puritanical paranoic BS I've seen in a long time. It's like david icke, the witch hunts and a seventh Adventist had babies. I only have one question for this rather bemusing moron - Contra, are you a fascist? Choose your words wisely. hahahaha!"
"When will triggered fascist scum realise that calling her trannie,faggot is not an arguement?"
"Is this dude a Poe?  Seriously am new to this channel I can't tell"
">Western values are incompatible with racial collectivism >You bundle them with an ethnocentrist ideology  because reasons You're not doing yourself any favors by spouting this nonsense.  Oh, and it's not a moral equivalency between fascists and anti-fascists, it's between fascists and anarcho-communist terrorists."
"I find it hilarious that your parody of a nazi sounds a thousand times more reasonable and level-headed than you. I am no not a right-winger, but according to your videos that is exactly what a right-winger would say."
"God this lighting is great I love it"
"Could you please look up for example  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_the_Defence_of_the_Republic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMKA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kataeb_Party https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Liberation_Movement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dh%C5%8Dkai  before you limit fascism to 'whites only'??"
"I figured out that it is more a right winger thing to come to a left wing video in mass and fill it with dislikes  and nasty comments. Most left wingers I've seen don't do such a base act like that. Otherwise Sargon or PJW  video would have a  load of dislikes."
"The ancom Alex Jones, everyone."
"Contrapoints, are you still a communist? Did you delete your old videos in which you openly espoused communism because your beliefs have changed or because you've gone 'crypto'? Do I sense some irony, perhaps?"
"So basically, anyone we suspect of being a fascist are most certainly fascist if..... *(They disagree with our suspicions, deny our accusations, try to explain their own pov or, attempt to propose any sort of counter argument. Therefore, any rebuttal they attempt to make, supporting facts they want to introduce, any theories they entertain, personality traits they possess, behavior they display, ideologies they believe in, norms they live by or, life experiences they've had can be attributed to their corrupt preconceived sociopolitical perceptions. And, are merely the product of the fascist propaganda they've bought into. Accordingly, their pov is obviously void of merit, and likely based upon hyperbolic sentiment. Sentiment which, will only serve to suck the moderate leftist into a casual conversation where the fascist will ultimately use their complacency to indoctrinate them. In hopes that they'll start to agree & come to believe that they're nothing more than a white-guy/gal who's only concerned about the future of their nation, community &/or race. Just concerned, nothing more).* With this approach, we'd do nothing but agree to disagree by refusing to entertain even a single-solitary word, idea, argument, claim, belief, explanation or concern the person has. Therefore, you should just tell everyone that...'anyone we tend to disagree with or, suspect of being a non-leftist IS ABSOLUTELY....A FASCIST'. And so, there's no need to converse with'em. Jeez, no wonder the left is starting to get such a bad rep! Wow!"
"this was extremely educational, thank you so much <3 (can I say, I love the wallpaper - it's gorgeous)"
"I wish this video was played in public schools."
"'If fascism could be defeated in debate, I assure you that it would never have happened, neither in Germany, nor in Italy, nor anywhere else. Those who recognised its threat at the time and tried to stop it were, I assume, also called “a mob”. Regrettably too many “fair-minded” people didn’t either try, or want to stop it, and, as I witnessed myself during the war, accommodated themselves when it took over ... People who witnessed fascism at its height are dying out, but the ideology is still here, and its apologists are working hard at a comeback. Past experience should teach us that fascism must be stopped before it takes hold again of too many minds, and becomes useful once again to some powerful interests.'  -Holocaust survivor Franz Frison, 1988"
"Good Goth, you are so unhinged."
"Contrapoints, are you a fascist? Sorrywhat? No you're not a fascist? IT'S CONFIRMED EVERYBODY, ContraPoints is a fucking Nazi! The logic of your argument is truly bafflingly stupid. 'Educational', You're a joke, a moron."
"There's no possible way for me to take you seriously dude. And, I'm not trying to put you down (more power to you & your personal preference). However, rocking the the get-ups you do, with shoulders & a voice like that...simply screams 'I'm extremely weird, confused & need folks to gasp at my appearance'!"
"LOL What to say? Nice Trolling"
"This should be mandatory viewing in schools. It's excellent."
"creep"
"Diversity is code word for anti-white. This video made me even more happy to be on the far right."

"Inciting, hateful tripe."
"isn't white nationalism just a subset of fascism? like, fascism can arise from any racial or identitarian group, can't it? Like, just look at what happened in Japan, the remnants of which still exist in self-described fascist movements."
"Anyone else notice that these moral panics seem to have an ongoing pattern?  The first youth culture in the 1920's and prohibition. Then McCarthyism and communism. Then the Satanist heavy metal corruption of the youth. Now it's fascism.   Every other one is corruption of youth and corruption of government.  Bowie was right. The ripples change in size but never leave the stream of one permanence."
"Are you a fascist? No? That's exactly what would fascist say.  Sorry, but Kafka's 'The trial' is not suppose to a manual for... Like anything..."
"The definition at the very start of the video are wrong, that's not a good sign."
"So YOU are a fascist by this definition."
"I suggest a better title:  How to Create a Non-Falsifiable Hypothesis."
"Ok, I figured it all out, countrapoints is a nazi pretending to be a commy to drive people into nazism. If you need explanations I'm here to answer."
"As it communists like Contra don't dog whistle. We know you're anti-meritocracy, anti-democracy, anti-freedom of choice, and anti-human rights.  You can only wear the sheep's disguise of 'muh minorities' for so long. Even the minorities are starting to find out you're actually a slavering wolf."
"As always, the SJW lacks the ability to play even just one move ahead in their mind, before they act. Hilarious. I haven't seen one this good since: - _'Hey! Calling little girls 'Bossy', keeps them from succeeding and pursuing leadership roles. :('_ - _'Yeah! Let's gather some of the wealthiest, most powerful, successful women on Earth, to talk about how they were called 'Bossy' when they were little, to raise awareness about it!'_"
"You know that fascism isn't just a western ideology. And yet you start your video with that fallacy 🤔"
"So is dressing as a Nazi 'ironically' for 'satire' a way that *you* explore the fascist within that you're not ready to own yet?"
"Mommy, why is that man dressing like a girl?"
"'I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say' - ContraPoints, Confirmed Fascist."
"DoctorRandomercam's made a fitting reply."
"The Iron Cross you used in the thumbnail isn't even close to a white supremacist symbol, it's a symbol of Christianity and The German Reich, Third Reich version had a swastika in the middle. Also you should put in the Insignia of the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (Islamic SS division)."
"this video explains a lot"
"Literally none of those definitions denote fascism. Who the hell takes this kind of content seriously?  Contra asked what drives people to his definition of fascism (which is verifiably false). The answer: the degenerate reprobates like Contra and this kind of nonsense content. So much wrong with garbage."
"First thing, you don't get to redefine fascism. My parents and grandparents lived through a fascist south american regime with no legalized racism (some undertones of anti-semitism, but way less than YOU and not in any way written into law or practice), much to the contrary, multi-culturalism was the way identitarianism swept in Getulio's fascist regime. (just so you know, his justification for a fascist regime was justified by the violent communist terrorist, not in the modern sense but in the sense that he terrorized the general population with violence and murder, and I discovered this when I was a socialist through his own manuals. He was more of a monster than getulio was, which was already monstrous, and he was terrorizing the country in the name of communism even before nazis and fascists came up in europe)"
"Educational? I have to laugh...this is utter tripe."
"Within the first 3 minutes you flop back and forth no less than 3 times, so I'm a little confused here.  Is an Ethnic, Religious, Cultural Pride and push to become or maintain your 'Ethnic, Religious, Cultural History' as the dominant culture Fascist or isn't it? If it is, are Muslims and Jews in the Middle East Fascists in their respective countries? How about the Japanese or Chinese? So far according to your video, 'Yes'. I would just like a confirmation or explanation. Also, if they aren't Fascist, why? Because the pushing of a specific races supremacy in a culture and region is nothing new, and I'm curious why 'The Whites' get a special word to describe them... though straight up they don't.  What you're talking about mostly in this are WHITE SUPREMACISTS. Specifically. As if there have never been Fascist regimes in other ethnic states or regions. I know you know better. Not excuse them when they target innocents, but is maintaining a 'white' (Irish, British, Caucasian American, Italian, Scottish, ect.) cultural heritage evil? If so, why allow Native American's cultural heritage to continue, or Indians, or any Muslim or Chinese, or Swahili cultures or traditions? Why don't we just burn all cultures and tradition to the ground if making any attempt to maintain them lands you as a Fascist and thus deserving of death and fire? Despite any claims to the counter? I'm serious here, why don't you don't you go around destroying cultural centers, because these people are all obviously Fascists."
"Capitalism is a mental illness"
"Great video, raised a lot of good points and was very smart. God bless ya."
"The opening 'what fascists believe' was way off. Fascism is the merger of corporate and state power. It does not necessarily entail anti-semitism or white supremacy. Look at Mussolini's fascists."
"so every one a fascist  except you"

"Why do you assume minorities are so weak and so at risk of just being wiped out of this country? They don't need yours or anyone else's protection, except for the protection granted by the rule of law in this great country of ours.

"ContraPoints 'Before I realized I was transgender I used to jump at any opportunity to cross ironically...'  ... Just before this and for a minute after this you try to correlate the use of irony on the topic of Nazism to being a Nazi, where your transition from ironic cross-dressing to outright transgenderism is your analogy...  AND THEN YOU IRONICALLY DRESS AS A NAZI...  But tell me how you're not a Nazi. I'm all ears."
"this is SO GOOD i'm gonna share everywhereeeeeee thank you <3"
"Are you a fascist?"
"You are a bit wrong on a few things, like what is 'Fascism'."
"Congratulations...  You've just been Docced...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl1kw7pOUoo A gallant display of how to tell a veritable word smith, from a communist in shoddy sheep's clothing."

"Wow you are actually insane dude"
"Why do conservatives are always bitching about 'Oh LEFtisTs ALWayS calLs AnYOnE RAciSt' in videos where, the author speaks specifically of white supremacist or the alt-rights and not the fucking conservatives? So the White supremacists and the Alt right are the pals of conservatives ? honestly Im not surprised.   Or its just because they put your 'MAGA' hat in the video?  oooh, come on, you little special snowflake bitch."
"DoctorRandomercam's response:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl1kw7pOUoo"
"I just have one question. Are you a fascist?"
"Take a look in the mirror Ms. Antifa!"
"You really have no clue as to the rise of the alt right do you? How to spot a fascist? How about looking to your neighbour, that holds a grudge from being demonised in his educational years.  You idiots have always told the majority that they are bad for thinking the way they do.  Good luck reaping the whirlwind, fools.  The pendulum swings, and has ever done so."
"Thanks Contra. Now I truly know what a fascist looks like..."
"OMG that was Shives? That discredits the entire video 😂"
"'The centrists side with the fascists' - Perhaps if the left and the communists weren't so vehemently against the centrists there could be non-violent dialogue, less vandalism of small businesses and more allies? This is the issue with identity politics and identitarianism in general; Them or us, there is no middle ground. This seems especially true with the leftists. If you aren't left, you are a fascist or fascist sympathiser, and no, we will not talk, you nazi scum. Imagine if you had 2 people wanting to be your friends, and one just wanted you to add to its collection of friends, and the other made stupid demands of you and told you exactly what to do and what to think and how to do it and think it, who would you choose to be friends with if you ended up with no choice in the matter?  Also, didn't pewdiepie get in trouble for doing the same joke that you did in your intro?"
"18:25 why is it no one actually ever addresses those points? All Contra does is say that it's wrong, but I see to have missed the reasons why."
"You. Are. Amazing. Love it."
"I missed several of your vids. I listened to you on Polite conversations. I thought you were a bit hard on some people I like to listen to. That is OK. That is why I listen to people one opposite sides of things. I was ounce in a liberal bubble. I still am very liberal, but I do not like a lot of what is coming from the far left and right.  You make entertaining videos, comedy that informs and provokes thought.  I was reminded of you channel when dr randamercam did a video that went beyond disagreement to name calling. I decided to have a look for myself. I thank Mike for reminding me of your channel."
"I think you've made a mistake in your opening definition of fascism - at around the 10 mark you use basically the same definition to define white supremecy, correctly  Fascism does account for culture, heritage, and redemption, but it is fundamentally a political structure that leans on syndication and class - race can be employed as a motivational tool, but it is not necessary, and there is nothing inherent to fascism that the 'supreme' race needs to be white - as an example, it would be pretty difficult to read-up on Italian Fascism without recognizing stark similarities with N Korea"

"@ContraPoints I thoroughly enjoyed your video and will check out some more of your past videos.But as a ML, you did forget something we ML's are quite good at looking for is the wealthy industrialists whom bring to the light fascists like Adolf Hitler.So I'll leave you with this 'it maybe good to not just look in front of us, but also behind them'."
"how is this not how to recognize a white supremacist not a fascist this is like making a video on how to recognize an oval and saying things that only apply to squares."

"Woah, it's long haired Alex Jones. Can you just relabel the video 'How To Live In Fear Of Nothing' already?"
"'This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists, history shows that happens regardless'. This is among the most spurious statements I've heard in a long time, in an otherwise great video. I suppose we have a convenient description for what a 'centrist' is that holds across all politicized cultures so that we can pick them out, and evidence of this clearly defined homogeneous group allying with fascists? You can't decry right wing exaggerations but then engage in your own hyperbole. Or to put it another way, if it is wrong for the right to use subversive means to garner support from 'normies'/centrists, it is also wrong for the left to engage in hyperbole to highlight the threat of fascism. We can do better than that, if fascism is wrong then we should be able to show it with facts! Which is something I feel the first half of this video in particular did an excellent job of.  Perhaps you could do a 'decrypting the left' video too, to try to point out some of these unhelpful habits of the left and how they can be avoided for better quality discussion. :) because, frankly, some left wingers definitely need the equivalent of that right wing forum post saying 'here's how not to alienate people from the cause'!"
"Watching a bunch of politically inept people pat themselves on the back for learning something ' useful' from an even more politically inept person that conflates fascism with white nationalism and conflating white nationalism with white supremacy."

"Didn't seem to decrypt the alt-right much.  It *did* decrypt that apparently the 'contemporary' use of the word Fascism has nothing to do with actual Fascism.  It also makes me wonder if there are other -isms being used that don't actually mean the word used and are just being used for evocative response to established semiotics... ((thinking emoji guy))"
"I can see your moustache."
"This video is hyper-conspiratorial, verging on inverted 'targeted individual' levels of ridiculous paranoia (plus 'just a dash' of dissonance).

"Hi ContraPoints; I don't know where to start, . So I guess this is as good as any. You mentioned something to the effect and I paraphrase 'If you ever protected or loved a black or queer person then.....'  I still carry the scar on my arm from 19 stitches. These were needed after I literally prevented a person who I never met before from being stabbed to death at a party I attended.  That person was an attractive trans-gendered woman, who to this day I don't know how or why attracted a sick animal who an hour or so later took out a knife to use on her when he learned all was not what it appeared to be.    No I will not insult your obvious intelligence with any crap about 'gee some of my best friends...' No, I got involved, simply because I could not sit and watch an innocent person, unable to defend her/himself be murdered or seriously disfigured. I would do it again today even though, without knowing me, many members of the LGBTQ community probably would see me as an enemy.  That said I hope you give a few seconds thought to what I will say before you delete it and ban me You and I are on opposite ends of a spectrum and without benefit of meeting and speaking in person, you will consider most likely consider me a fascist. Funny, my grandparents escaped the horrors and brutality of Mussolini's regime, so I did learn from them a  little something about REAL fascism. Please read my full comment, then by all means, do as you see fit, even use my comment as an example of one of the topics you discussed in this video, if you think that, but please read it fully, is all I ask.  First, How can you say the violence of ANTIFA is not the same as that of Hitler's Brown Shirts, Mussolini's Black Shirts or today's Neo-NAZI scum? . All of these groups delusion-ally believed they had / have 'righteous justification' on their side. They wrongly believe they are being defenders of some form of human rights or dignity, when in fact they are simply committing violence against those who disagree with their idea of what is justice and fairness. Oh yes, Hitler, Mussolini they really, albeit insanely, believed they were protecting 'god' knows what human rights. Sorry, but I see ANTIFA in the same light  I am 65 years old, so I do not know much about 'Pepe the frog' or more importantly the significance of the 'OK' finger gesture. Especially as it relates to Trump.  I spent my early adult life as a Mechanical Engineer we used it all the time simply to signal what in today's vernacular would be 'Good To Go' As for Trump, I left Engineering, after inheriting a garbage hauling business. Shortly,  I found myself in a room, with Trump way back in the 80's, representing a consortium of carters attempting to bid on some of his contracts. NO I did not speak to him directly nor did I meet him up close, nor will I tell you what a wonderful person he is, I have no idea as to that.  I only wish to assure you, he used the 'OK' gesture even back then when he addressed the room.d I also assure you NO politics were discussed at this meeting. It's just a habit of his, a particular gesticulation he and many others in our age group use, again to signify 'it's all good' nothing more, nothing nefarious nor political nor ideological.   Finally, why are Trump supporters considered by you to be a monolithic block of anti-Semites, haters of Black People and homophobes? You see I am a third group you fail to mention, not out of malice on your part, you probably don't give us much thought or just lump us in with NAZIs and others who hate. I am a CONSTITUTIONALIST. This last election, we had to hold our nose and support Trump, the others running TOLD US during the debates, they would gut the constitution.    I am sure you find me guilty of using one of the techniques you discussed and as I said by all means use this comment as an example. Why would you fear / be disgusted by people who accept ALL of the bill of rights, not just the ones they like. You see, I detect a growing trend to limit free speech. I hear more frequently people ask for 'hate' speech laws. People seem to forget or were never taught that the 1st amendment exists SOLELY to protect disgusting, offensive and unpopular speech. Do you really think that amendment was only written to protect you from reading a Dr. Suess book aloud in public or reciting the 'Mary had a little lamb , nursery rhyme in the park?? Do you not see 'Free speech for me but not for thee' will be the death knell of everyone's rights?    In closing, you brought up the fact that you were a trans-gendered woman and some how or other implied the ALL on the right hate you for it.  I would have not known nor is it any of my business if you did not bring it up. So I ask you, please don't lump those who love and accept ALL of the constitution as a bunch of haters or your enemy. It is us the same people who scream and clamor for our 'gun rights' who defend your right to live in peace and love who ever how ever your heart and soul dictate. It is us who also defend not only a person's right to fly a Confederate Battle flag but your right to be yourself in public, marry or enter a relationship with whomever  and do so without any fear nor owing anything to anyone for that right because  this is just one of your many rights guaranteed not to be infringed by any government. We live by one rule, if your actions neither harm nor take away another persons rights then you are free to do as you wish where and when you wish. That certainly covers sexual identity and all of its complex and diverse existence.  So just remember, you may agree with ANTIFA today, shutting down the freedom of speech of people who most of us find offensive, but once you go down that path, once you start  denying any group any constitutional right, then you just set yourself up to loose your rights, not now, not tomorrow, but someday when a real monster, not this imaginary one called Trump, does get elected and decides you are offensive, you obviously don't have the same rights as the 'good' people.  I leave you with best wishes, I truly find your videos thought provoking and very well done Thanks for your time Michael"
"Why do progressives always, _always_ , have to be so creepy and disingenuous?"
"You forgot to look in a mirror. The biggest fascists are in the antifa movement. Opposition to free speech or thought is a huge part of fascism. BTW, I wouldn't report your video. Why? Because I believe in free speech even if it is offensive."
"At the end there. You used communist Russian phrases. I'm going to give you the benefit of the  doubt and assume that you were being ironic. However, do you not see how that makes you a hypocrite? The fact that you feel comfortable saying that 'ironically' after saying all that shit about dog whistles and the problem with spreading Nazi memes 'ironically' shows that you either have a double standard for yourself regarding the ways you are alowed to employ irony or you don't see communism as being a threat the same way Nazism is, making it OK to satyrize them but not Nazis. The third option is that you actually are a communist, which I sincerely hope is not the case. How do you justify any of those positions?"
"has the irony of the fact that this sounds like a guide to hunting witches? a fascist will say they are not a fascist, or to put it another way, if she's a witch she'll float, and we kill her, if she sinks, she wasn't a witch and we've just killed her, it's stupid logic that should have been thrown out with religion"

"if you idiots hadent pushed so hard for diversity, talked so damn much about the importance of race and scorned everyone who didnt share the same exact ideas as you then you wouldnt be in this mess your in! rather than let things take its own course in a fluid fashion you decided to stuff in down everyones throats and treated everyone who didnt want part in it bigots! ppl dont like to be forced to do anything some will rebel right away while others takes longer to stir before pushing back!in your idiocy to push your agenda so force fully you have awoken animosity between old factions that might have kept on sleeping and never gained tracktion again but no! funny how history keeps repeating itself! first comes the marxists then enter the nazis... thats what happened in germany before the second great war. be carefull you dont force ppl to take sides that will result in a true repeat. cant beleive this bull! i hate both sides more than i can write here.. marxists and nazis are the same both failed with horrible cost to human life! dont let it repeat please! and you contrapoints arent helping your just making it worse with your ill uninformed  mouth sounds!"
"It's heartening to see the like ratio outweighing the dislikes on this. This resurfacing of open fascism needs to be left in the past where it belongs."
"Btw, the chant 'You (or Jews) will not replace us' IS ANTI  ethnic cleansing, not pro.  This shouldn't have to be explained."
"Not sure if you'd identify me as centrist, or fascist/nazi/nationalist/monarchist/ancap/etc.(I'm not sure anymore, I was just normal guy, and I still feel like I'm just being reactionary to what I see, but my views changed that much is true). But nonetheless, I do believe in preservation of culture, or cultures. Noone should lose their own culture for which their ancestors fought. But, we don't live in paradise, so we have to prioritise(we can't do everything at once), obviously I'd prioritize my own culture first, since it's much closer to me and since I care more about my ancestors than ancestors of others(although I'm not sure if I'd had the same view if I'd be from nation with very unsuccessful culture), on second place would be cultures superior to my own(obviously), that means cultures that are simply better in either achievements or goals, then, cultures that are comparable to my own or slightly worse, the last would be cultures that failed in history, those which didn't develop anything that could be admirable, have the least chance of survival and profit from preservation of them would be very low. Now how can we preserve cultures: one way, and the simplest(not sure if the most effective) is isolationism, the ethno-state as you said, such way is problematic only because it almost assures violence(and risk of war between ethno-states would be eternal) but again: we don't live in paradise, therefore some violence is acceptable, but we should try to choose the least violent way(at least if we don't want revenge, which... I doubt that even relatively extreme nationalists would want, of course there is a risk, but risk is in everything), the other one is being very protective of it(no destruction of monuments, no destruction of historical buildings, no book burning, etc. but also not changing view, therefore, not allowing other views, to ensure that it will last longer than one or two generations), which... probably won't succeed when I consider that some view can be hardly sustained and/or enforced forever, let's say: americans, those who were the most racist not so long ago, are destroying some of their statues and monuments, ffs. in my country we have houses that are far older than their precious monuments(miraculously, considering the wars that Europe went through, I guess what saved those things was respect for enemy/surrendered enemy) and yet they are destroying them already, so that probably isn't the right way. When it comes to other option I can't think of any, and so I must ask you: what way to preserve culture should we choose? Preservation itself shouldn't be a problem for SJWs it's the way to preserve that people find... problematic to say the least. It's the only thing we care about(you probably won't be able to change that), and if there is some peaceful way, then I know at least a dozen of people that you might call fascists and would choose this way(including me). You seem like a relatively smart person so, if you want to fight those who use deception and those who would love to see other races bow to their race(those people are probably part of alt-right, but you know that not even majority of alt-right is like that), then please, give us another option if you know about any, and some of us will gladly choose it. But if you just tell us that we must give up our culture eventually, then there is no point in argument. And if there is no other way, then it will not be pleasant, but we will have to choose that way."

Yeah, sorry but fuck your Kefka trap and your willful misinterpretation of the words of your pet enemies.  Sometimes people mean what they say.  How about you actually try to examine white identitarianism and criticize it for what it is, instead of going the bitch route and calling it something that's easier to attack.   God, if you people weren't allowed to projectile vomit your toxic labels at every moving shadow I don't know what you'd do with yourselves.  inb4 moar salty fashists amirite!1!"

"'I'm not a nazi is exactly what a nazi would say'  So Contra, are you a nazi? What's that? You say you're not a nazi, that's exactly what a nazi would say you nazi!   If you say you're a nazi you're a nazi and if you say you're not a nazi then you're a nazi. If you so much as utter the word nazi then its time to get an antifa beating eh?"
"Hold on. So, if people saying 'I'm not a fascist' is proof that they are...  ever heard of the McArthy trials? the communist witch-hunts? Do we really need to crack open a history book to see why we shouldn't go down this path?"

"When you call us 'snowflakes or 'cucks' or triggered' it doesn't even make any sense, it just makes you sound too retarded to understand the meaning of the terms and just want to copy us because we're cool. When we use those terms to describe you, it actually has truth to it which is why its so effective. You leftards are so pathetic it's not even funny."
"So your political world view is somewhat like this * Left (the epitome of all that's good and noble, with you as the Witchsmeller, a connaisseur of fascism),  * Centrists (not actual nazi's, but gullible sheep who can't make up their own mind or inadvertently assist nazi's by posting opinions you deem wrongthink) * Nazi's (who will never admit they're nazi's, so anyone you think is a nazi, is a nazi, whatever they say).  Anti-ists, such as myself tend to think in terms of 'left-wingnuts', 'rational people I can have a conversation with, though we may disagree (a lot)' and 'right-wingnuts'.  The words 'bat shit crazy' drift aimlessly but incessantly through my mind, watching you describe yourself as the Witchsmeller Persuivant of the Church of the Left. This is, without the shadow of a doubt the most paranoid set of ramblings i've come across this month. All this based on a single post on 4chan (/pol/ assumed for the moment) from some anonymous prick. Hmmm... Now if I were one of these trolls, on the infamous 4chan board, known for trolling the supposedly untrollable, what sort of text would I post anonymously to get the normies *really* paranoid? And you better believe the trolls on 4chan *know* you watch their stuff. Weaponized autism is a powerful thing. Ask the bike lock guy. What's his name, again? Ummm.. Clanton, Eric Clanton. He know about weaponized autism.  ."

"4:48 that lolita reference thooo you nabakov fangurl you"
"You didn't even define fascism correctly. It isn't interchangeable with Nazism, either. If you want to identify and understand fascists, I would recommend listening to and speaking with those who identify themselves as fascists. There are plenty. Just go to 8chan.   By the way, what exactly are you proposing we do once we 'identify' 'fascists', which in your mind seems to be anyone who differs from your ideological orthodoxy? What do we do to them for having ideas different from us? I would say nothing, but then I care about my nation and its constitution. I think I can imagine, seeing as you draw a distinction between 'fascist' and 'anti-fascist' violence.   Careful if you choose to go 'bash the fash', I hear daylight ninjas are considered terrorists now. Probably just as well. The effete trannies and fat women weren't a great fighting force."

"''I'm not a fascist' is exactly what a fascist would say'   You really think anybody is going to fall for these bugs bunny-esque antics?"
"She keeps talking about fascism as if it necessarily implied Nazism, while Nazism is really just one form of fascism.  This will help you find Nazis (which, I suspect, are the most visible type of fascists in existence), but is unlikely to help one detect non-Nazi fascists and the right-wing authoritarian types that bring them to prominence by allowing them to form coalitions with them.    Fascism is a highly syncretic ideology with roots in many different philosophies, including some which are not easily located on a right-left spectrum; some argue that a violent para-military force is a hallmark of fascism, though it's worth noting that leftist organizations were among the first to use them, and while fascists may pay lip service to traditional religions and morality, it is scarce that fascists actually care for either or these things, outside of using them to either recruit or make themselves otherwise more palatable to those who do care for them.  Fascists have also been driven by an extreme anti-materialistic outlook coupled with a desire to experience transcendence through some kind of 'organic unity' imposed by the state and culture at large.  This does not always imply the desire to form an ethno-state, but they are certainly not incongruent with one another (note the fascist propaganda guy she mentions in the film).    Fascists can also be noted by the fact that, historically speaking, they have almost always been dominated by males, and the cult of virility plays a much bigger role in their ideology (and recruiting tactics, mind you) than in any other.  This focus on virility also tends to make fascism a youth-oriented ideology, given that the physical strength and will to do violence which they so readily prize often eludes older men, though older men often seem to function almost as ersatz father figures to the young men who join up with these movements (remember how Milo called Trump 'Daddy?').  Fascists also tend to be more action-oriented than thought-oriented; outside of a few vague goals, they tend to not know exactly what they want, and though they may have proven capable of organizing themselves in order to achieve certain goals, their ideologies are often poorly-thought out and lacking any real definitions or explanations.  The role that symbols and occult practices play in fascism help to supplant fixed meaning (or the illusion thereof) in an ideology which is otherwise bereft of such."
"here is a big problem with this video:  literally everybody that isn't fascist, would say that they aren't fascists, how can you ever tell the difference between a fascist that says the same as a non-fascist? Oh wait i get it, if you first label them fascist, then they are regardless of reality!"
"1:05 So much wrong here. Fascism is a political philosophy based on the central idea that people are stronger united. And you later use 'nazism' interchangeably with 'fascism'. They aren't the same thing.  The video simply uses 'fascism' and 'nazi' as slurs, similar to how people throw around the R-word as an insult."

The term alt left was actually coined by James Wolcott, a liberal commentator in an article in Vanity Faire, as a smear against progressives, socialists, Green Party supporters and anyone who was critical of liberals from the left, trying to equate them with the alt right. It was an extension of the Bernie Bro meme."
"People use Pepe, milk, the OK sign, Kekistan to make fun of nazis and SJWs....It's a giant meme and you fell for it. The one's who say normies have now ruined kekistan memes etc. were the nazis who were too stupid to realize it was all satire at their expense and the expense of everyone. This is all getting so meta I'm starting to question reality, who knows the origins or purpose of any of this shit anymore when you have idiots trying to play at identity politics."

"Gotta thank you badmouse and Shaun and jen for preventing me from becoming a political :p. I became a syndicalist long ago thanks to Chomsky but almost was convinced by the 'leftists' like sargon during gamergate that the left was killing itself ect. I got a little sick of the likes of sargon although when he started ranting and raving about marxist comspiracy theories and and unsubbed. But i kind of felt like i was fighting a losing battle after that and really felt like giving up untill i found your channels. You really made me rethink the ideas that i was fed recently and showed my how badly the 'skeptics' are making mountains out of college leftists sometimes being irrational while excusing nazis."
"I just binged-watched all of your videos! I found you through the laci green and blaire white debates, and I had no idea that your channel would be so funny and dynamic. I loved your point about the difficulty of telling the difference between a real fascist and an oblivious centrist who repeats fascist talking points. It's hard to keep your cool when a close friend or family member parrots insidious and racist talking points like 'black people have a lower IQ than white people'. When I freak out and say that they are being racist, I am just an other crazed, politically correct SJW. =/ It's so frustrating. Thanks for your video!"

"Strategy 5 is a real crap show.   It is very hard as a person of color, to give benefit of the doubt to moderate or left leaning White people. On one hand, there are good folks who have unconscious biases who may not be aware of them. On the other hand, these good folks still seem very reluctant to call a spade a spade even when presented with clear objective evidence.  For example: When presented with evidence that White affluent teens get better treatment in our criminal justice system than poor black, brown ones. You immediately hear the rebuttal that ''NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT RACE' when it CLEARLY IS.   When rallies of people protest the unjustified killing or brutality against people of color, still many good folks sit on the sidelines, saying ''I just don't see why...''  It truly is infuriating. Martin Luther King said directly that the ''White Moderate'' is the biggest stumbling block to progress. They seem to be disturbed by the problem, but not willing to do anything about it."
"'Are you a fascist?'  'No' 'Thats exactly what a fascist would say, to the gulag!'"
"There is an equivocation between fascist and anti-fascist violence.   Why white supremacy is singled out by organizations like the SPCA is a fair question. Fallacy fallacy. Checkmate, faggot. They also called a Muslim an anti-Islamic extremist. How laughable.  People are not distracted by people making demonizing labels for ANTIFA like 'alt-left.' The left does a good enough job of that on their own, alienating center leaning folk. Turns out hurting people doesn't attract much support.  I agree fascists drum up support by telling moderates that they'll come for them next, but that opportunity wouldn't exist if the left wasn't literally doing that.  Also, memes are memes.  Thanks for the video faggot. Make more."
"1:17 #2 Sounds right out of a Saturday morning cartoon lol."
"I enjoyed the video. Nazis are racist socialists. Antifa are non-racist socialists whose ultimate goal is Communism. Neo-Nazis in the USA are against parts of the US Constitution RE racial equality. Antifa is against the US Constitution RE free speech, self defense and Article IV, Section 4. It's my endeavor to understand different views and to not misrepresent others. I'm absolutely against Nazis, White Supremacists, White Nationalists, ethno-nationalists et al. I'm also against Antifa and anyone who makes me their enemy against my will merely because I don't hate myself and don't apologise for being a white, cis-hetero male Christian (i.e. Eastern Orthodox Christian Universalist via GOARC and St. Gregory of Nyssa). Relatives on my left have accused me of being a Nazi. I live a personally conservative lifestyle but, because I am for LGBTQ equality, ending the drug war and for avoiding foreign wars as much as possible, I have relatives who say I'm too liberal. Would you call me a normy or Nazi?"

"I used to make so many nazi jokes when I was a teenager. I used to like the uniforms and nazis in movies like Inglorious Basterds. Of course I HATED racism and fascism. My jokes were a way to be edgy AND to show how ridiculous fascism was. I honestly didn't know that fascism is still alive, I live in Belgium and I was like 'they were beaten, now some people are kinda racist but not like the nazis'. I was fucking wrong, and when I went on the internet I saw my mistake: tons of fascists, neo-nazis, etc. The thing is: if we lived in peace and harmony, nazi jokes would be hilarious; but some people actually think of killing black/jewish/gay people, so... It's pure horror.  Of course when Louis C.K. makes jokes about the jews or when Tarantino films an entertaining nazi, we all know that they aren't fascist/racist. But many times, you really can't tell. I personally stopped that to avoid confusion."

It's people like you who solidified my political stance; one without hatred or emotive response: just sound logic.  P.S I actually enjoy your videos, creatively constructed and produced. Dat opinion tho..."
"fascist. fascist everywhere. Have you seen how Europe has been flooded with migrants from a culture that in the past has tried to dominate Europe hell they siege Rome and Invaded nearly all of south Italy. They have every right to be afraid of the Muslims that's why nationalism in Europe is growing not because of them wanting a white ethno state but because Muslims are known for replacement of population Syria , Egypt and north Africa  were white but with the rise of Islam the populations of those regions were raped. slaved and butchered until they converted or paid the tax that was placed on non Muslims and they did this all threw the history of Islam that is why we had the dark ages that is why we had the crusades and that is why Europe became a fortress.    also Russian? in USA vid are you tying to be a communist?

"I was on 4chan when someone wrote a post to spread the idea that the OK sign is actually fascist. I almost sprayed my coffee all over the keyboard when I saw that this video now sees the OK sign as a fascist symbol. I mean: I was there when this meme was born. I saw it happen. ContraPoints claims centrists fall for it hook, line and sinker. She's wrong. Leftists are. Just as 4chan intended.   To think of it: I was also on 4chan when someone wrote a post to spread the idea that fathers day is misogynist because 'it lasts longer than mothers day' (ghehe). Quite a lot of feminists took the bait. If ContraPoints is consistent, fathers day is therefore really a misogynist symbol.  Perhaps I'll make a meme myself. Post something to spread the idea that people who own cats are fascists. I wonder how long it will take for leftists to start persecuting cat owners, make videos that show examples of Republican politicians who own cats to support the idea, say centrists are idiots for not joining their righteous fight and say fascists choose cats on purpose so they can deny cats are fascist symbols.  Or you know what? Let's make the moon a 'fascist symbol'."

'deceptive strategies used by Alt-Right to appeal to centrists' what do you think you are doing by lumping  people in the same box and demonizing your political rivals and  even using jokes used by people to indicate people's political leaning.

"'People who hang out with Fascists are probably Fascists. Nice guilt by association you got there. You hang out with an awful lot of Communists so I wouldn't go there.  'That's exactly what a ... would say' is the primary catchphrase of the witch hunter.  It's not pedantry to ask for a definition of Fascism when someone says that we should be killing them especially when most of the people saying we should be killing them don't have a definition.  'When you see people joking about being Nazis, it could just be a joke...' It has a 99% likelihood of being a joke, have you been living under a rock for the past 30 years and not noticed that Nazis are one of the biggest sources of dark humor around, especially on the internet.  'the equivocation between Fascist violence and anti-Fascist violence.' Violence is violence no matter what the reason isn't it? And it seems to be coming more often from AntiFascists than Fascists. 'Or white supremacist and black civil rights groups.' If you're referring to BLM the only difference I can think of off the top of my head is that most of the alt-right aren't calling for the death of non-whites/cops.  'Our proto-Fascist president.' Yeah, no.  'Helps to villainise anti-fascists.' Sorry but if those anti-fascists are in antifa, they ARE villains. If your slogan is 'by any means necessary' you are not a good person.  Yeah sure, anyone advocating stricter immigration is a Fascist in disguise, what could possibly go wrong with that outlook?"
"So if someone says they are a fascist, then they are a fascist, but if someone says they aren't a fascist, they are a fascist? Throw everyone under the bus much?"

"My eyes are climaxing with this presentation. This is my new favorite YouTuber and video and person."
"Just discovered you, and you're great! Loving it!"
"This video seems to show a deep misunderstanding of what fascism as a political ideology is. It has nothing to do with white people or Jews. It's an authoritarian form of government involving a dictator, forcible suppression of opposition and central control over industry and commerce. Those are things that are far more related to the left than the right in modern America."
"The Big problem with this video is a lot of this is chasing ghost-level dogwhistles and inflammatory dialogue labeling anyone who has legit reasonable arguments for things like tax cuts, balancing the budget, and limiting immigration to prioritize people who speak the language of the country, as secret Neo-Nazis. Believing the arguments in this video could even lead you to be paranoid and assume EVERY or most conservatives/republicans are secret neo-nazis. The best strategy is to not assume ill-intentions from people who you don't know. The video cries through paranoia on trying to detect vague dogwhistles. What I have to say is... who cares if they are using dogwhistles? The reason why I am saying this is, that it is the actions (such as laws/policies) that really matter. No Republican senator would dream of making something like Jim Crow legal again (they kinda got rid of that in the first place with the civil rights act).  I am a conservative. I don't like, nor am I a Neo-nazi/alt-right/kkk/etc and they don't like my ethnicity last I checked. Them supporting Republicans is more of a weight than whatever votes could possibly be gained from them so it doesn't benefit us and i'd rather have them go back to voting Democrat. That all being said, I can see why some of them vote/support for Republicans as Alt-Righters believe some of Republican policies that Repuclicans want also help the Neo-Nazi goal of  'Protecting the white race'. Meanwhile at the same time Democrat's policies (such as those on illegal immigration, and legal immigration (specifically from non-white majority nations)) are viewed as harmful to 'the white race', yet many conservatives have different reasons from the Alt-Right for a policy that is honest, legitimate, understandably logical that isn't for 'the white race'.   Just because Neo-Nazis support a good policy for a bad motive, doesn't mean the policy is bad or would lead to that bad motive. For an over-the-top ('fictional') example; If there was a new Democrat bill for uncontrolled immigration + federal welfare for all legal/illegal immigrants. Neo-Nazis would be against it because 'muh white race', while Republicans would also be against it, but rather for the legitimate economic, and societal integration reasons. Or another ('fictional') example would be if Democrats forced churches to conduct same-sex marriages, and Christain Alt-righters were against it for being 'anti-gay' while Republicans would be against it for violating religious rights according to the 1st amendment.   Please try to understand that when listening and looking at Republican proposed policies, please assume good intentions first, and don't view it in a paranoid lens of SUPER DUPER SECRET DOGWHISTLES FOR A NEO-NAZI TAKEOVER OF THE USA!!! EVEN THOUGH WE FOUGHT A WORLD WAR TO DEFEAT THE NAZIS!!! .... Even on Donald Trump."
"amazing. keep up the good fight."
"I personally don't feel so uncomfortable about the deplatforming of these alt-right/nazi types, simply because what they are saying isn't actually new. We have already explored the concepts that these people talk about in detail, and have already rejected them, evidenced by the need to use codewords and dog-whistling, and those then needing to be changed when the public rediscovers their meaning.  I feel that free speech exists to express novel ideas that would otherwise be shot down straight away for being unorthodox or offensive, not to simply repeat your views over and over, louder and louder until people do what you want."

"I think you are wrong on this Contra. Sorry but I have to disagree with you. You seem to think that there are millions of americans who will join the nazis if they hear the nazis ideas. That their sick ideas will spread like wildfire. Frankly, thats fucking stupid.  It is spreading because they arent being exposed to the public light. They are being hidden and suppressed out of fear. And thats natural. contra, people like you need to get over this fear, and openly challenge these nazis. Get them in a public debate, let everyone hear what these people are about. Their ideas are so disgusting people will see that, and the public will turn on them. When the alt right has to defend their positions and ideas, they fall apart like a house of cards. Their positions are indefensible. So show how weak the alt rights position are. Thats why they have to resort of violence and we have police for that. we dont need antifa to beat them, and they cant beat the alt right. They can only help the alt right grow"
"Western Culture has nothing to do with race.  Just because something is a dog whistle to you, that doesn't mean it is a dog whistle to everyone, or anyone, else.  Freudian slips like that seem to beg the question, 'Who's the real bigot here?'"
"Wow your production quality is amazing. I totally agree with your message and have shared this video, but I'm sure tons of people do that. I just wanted to compliment you on the really ludicrously good editing and production skills. This is art"
"Aaaaaaand guess what, the only strategy of the Left is to *call everyone fascists...* Great move!   Actually... Nazis used same tactics against the Jews during the Weimar Republic; that Jews will sometimes disagree with other Jews so that it will seem like they're not all working for the same cause to confuse regular people. Hell, even today not even all of them _seeeeem_ to be for Israel, like for instance that Jew Chomsky. You see, they're still all Jews... Well, according to the Nazis. And I guess they're sort of leftie too, since they're socialists and all...  But! Since you just used the same exact same logic as a Nazi, I can only conclude that you are also one. :D I am too, by your standard. _Sigh._ Even if I deny it, I guess it wouldn't mean much after a video like this..."
"This women has read Saul Alinsky."
"Leveraging 'SJWs' patronizing 'normies', 'centrists' and 'liberals' (oh my!) was one of the strategies you mentioned being employed by the alt-right, yet that is exactly what you have done here. This is a disturbing trend I have observed for years: the left has unwittingly help breathing new life regressive ideas."
"Since becoming paranoid is part of their goals, aren't we doing their job for them if we get even a little paranoid -- no matter how 'justifiable' in the constant onslaught of covert memes and dog whistles?  It seems to me -- as a centrist -- that the only way to avoid this trap is to unravel the covert memes and whistles, to explain in simple, friendly terms why it is that a certain immigration policy or tax reform is not as good as it has been advertised -- in a way that the average non-Nazi can understand and relate to. Wouldn't that dull the dogs and whistles a lot better in the long run? Isn't that a way of avoiding the fate of giving them... legitimate grievances, every time a non-Nazi is mistakenly accused of being a Nazi, because of the 'slight paranoia' that you mentioned?"
"Be careful not to use the secrecy of modern fascists as a reason to assume the worst of anyone."
"Paul Joseph Twatson is making you even more famous now, you made it Contra!"
"Here is the one basic (and rather big) problem I have with this video: 1. Because fascists are using apparently non-fascist issues to further fascist goals, 2. It follows that, on the surface, it is hard (perhaps impossible) to distinguish real fascists (who want to advance an anti-black, pro-white agenda) from people who believe in the same answers for those issues for other reasons. 3. Because there are other reasons (other than fascism) why one would be in favor of stricter immigration rules or certain types of tax cuts, not BECAUSE but DESPITE the fact that they hurt blacks more than whites.  Given these points, I fear that the desire to discover hidden agendas and hear dog whistles will lead to a number of issues not really being discussed on their merits, but being simply branded as covers for fascism.  THAT may lead to witch hunts, thought police, etc.... which will please fascists since it will send more 'average' people their way. Besides giving them more propaganda material about how the left 'can't even discuss economic issues' because 'they make everything into identity politcs' thereby 'poisoning rational discussions.'  What do you think?"
"Its twitter says located in Baltimore. Lives in a city with black no-go zones but is concerned about white nationalism."
"Great video. Never fails to amuse me to watch this silly shit, and see you scurry around like panicked rats wondering where the big, hungry Alt-Right cat is hiding."
"Interesting video. Good production value setting up the feeling of conspiracy. I don't think you refuted anything and everyone can give a 'strategy' video of every group which conjures up feelings of artificiality, but there are no real answers here. You can't bring in the middle people you want with such overt propaganda since that has been the media strategy all their lives and is easily seen through. Politics a la advertising by saying words people don't like in proximity to political foes is a losing strategy on the internet where the education base is higher, it only works on television."

What you really should mention is us fascists greatest strength is the incompetence of the left itself. When Wal-mart CEO's and Mitt Romney side with you, you're doing something wrong. The anti-war, anti-corporate left is dead and has made a pact with corporate interests for immigration and minority issues. The average normie finds Antifa disgusting and all ready think 'waycist Nazis' are atleast less violent and hilarious enough less 'authoritarian'. I mean how does this happen? I, who advocate for authority and power as good things to obtain are view as less authoritarian as Antifa by the average normie? You guys suck! hahahaha"
"Well, right in the beginning you start with a wrong definition of fascism - you rather describe the nazis. Racism, ethnic purging and antisemitism are not a core part of fascism but are specific to national socialism. You're welcome."
"Contra i really like you but you have to recognize that everything you described is happening on both sides, and that both sides are as dangerous.   Join  the Radikal Center !"

"Everbody is a fascist except me. Hi from Italy (where fascism was born)."
"I agree fascists don't care about freedom or democracy or diversity. However, simply not valuing high levels of diversity and having in-group preference, and realizing other groups behave similarly doesn't [make] you a fascist. Doing stuff like blocking free speech, silencing all dissent, supporting dictatorship, that makes you a fascist."
"Nothing is being abandoned you stupid tranny. And the Alt-Right isn't Facist, just like all your stupid identity politics its an identitarian movement, but because it happens to be a white identitarian movement idiots like you are shiting you pants that 'The Evil White Man' now has an identity movement in polotics, because if 'The Evil White Man' has one then your stupid leftist control of the political spectrum ends and all this crap that has been shoved down peoples throat by you degenerates for the past 60 or so years ends. Get ready, because you have already lost."
"'They do not care about diversity of opinions' says the person supporting ANTIFA."
"But the left does ALL of these things just using different words. So why are you defending them as if there is any difference? Serious I watched your video twice and everyone you just defended are the same as the people you attack. Anitfa are just the same as the 'Alt-right' as you call them and BLM is as evil as KKK. The only difference is the KKK has been around longer and we understand them. There are an EVEN number of possible victims on both sides.  So I say again, why defend EITHER side?"
"Uhmmm... Contra, the three bullet points at the beginning aren't describing fascists but very specificaly racists. Facism does very often include these three but at it's core it's about rallying people around a common ideology and/or leader and enforcing complete obedience. Then again, I might be thinking about the classical fascism of Hitler, Mousulini and Stalin rather than the hipster nazis of today.  Wait, what does it read on David Dukes website? The KPD straight up used hammer and sickle and not the antifa double flag thingy you dunce.  That was a pretty comprehensive video despite being relatively short. Neat.   Also, a question: did you stuff a laptop into this old TV set or did you just green screened Fritz onto it?"
"Wow! A minute and a half in and you're already wrong.  Your 'Fascist' definition is for Nazis. Not all Fascists are Nazis. Good old Benito had no problem with Jews.  Are you even trying or are the productions costs just too high to do actual research?"

"As much as I liked this, having watched more, I have two main problems with it.  First, you're in this rabbit hole of 'left', 'right', 'centrist', 'normies', which is a world of politics which doesn't really exist in the way you're suggesting.  You're got stuck in the lolrandom memes, which was always the intention for many of those who've flirted with this stuff.  Richard Spencer may have co-opted 'alt-right', but the alt-right *clearly* contains groups who may be chauvinist, may be racist, may be revanchist, may be dickheads, but they clearly aren't all fascists, and far less nazis.  God knows who you think 'centrists' are.  You describe centrists as these gullible, malleable wallies who don't understand Pepe.  This isn't the case and 'centrists' (such a useless term) include these with a great deal of expertise in understanding Nazism and Fascism.  'Centrists' no more get in bed with fascism (as you say) than the far left does.  We've seen the far left support fascists, totalitarians and theocrats time and time again, while liberals stuck to universal principles...  The alt-left *is* a thing, it's transparently political to dismiss it as you do.  Idrees Ahmed writes about it here, we've been using this for some time: https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/8/25/the-alt-left-is-real-and-its-helping-fascists  At the same time, antifa is *not* synonymous with the antifascist movement.  BobfromBrockley discusses this here: http://brockley.blogspot.co.uk/2017/08/what-is-anti-fascism.html (this is a UK perspective)."

"Western supremisty is the outright support of the western values which are embodied in the Bill of Rights in the USA.  When you're to the left of Lennon/Mow it's difficult to see reality that you're on the other end of the horseshoe from the 'nazis'."
"Yes, you are mostly paranoid, and you will be until you understand the psyche of the alt-right. The movement is a collective reaction to leftist insanity. It is anything but monolithic, and it is not puppeteer'd by fascists from the shadows, though they do try, you simply can't control contrarians like that, you can give them ideas but that is all you can do. It's normies with bad ideas that you should watch out for. The Alt-Right has strong ties to libertarianism because of the kind of person involved, they are majority disagreeable, male, and open to ideas, and these traits result in open debate of unsavory ideas.   The goal is to determine what is poisoning the west (eg. women, diversity, atheism, zionists, soy, porn, government, communists, universities, games, Islam or drugs) and what can be done about it, and this discussion is partly for the sake of entertainment. They don't blame themselves openly, instead they shame each other into self improvement and share ideals.   Fascism is the poor man's solution, to smash society back into shape for the good of the nation, to some this is the only way and not doing it makes you a pussy. Ethnonationalism is a similar attempt based on the idea that the outsiders are to blame, some people buy it, most do not want to implement anything radical. You should know that the suggestion of an ethnostate to save white people from genocide is exactly what the Jews sought in Israel, it is a copycat strategy.   A revitalized Christian conservatism for the next generation is what I predict will emerge from this, basically the resurrection of the feminist's most detested 'Patriarchy'. There is a reason the old Conservatism is associated with Christianity, and I have no doubt it will play a large part in it again as this generation rises up to properly take it's place in society, just as they did in the 70-80s period with the New Right. Things will change in this direction for the next few decades, provided there is no catastrophe that would plausibly warrant putting the radicals in charge."

"All extremist ideologues start from the centrist position, be they left in goals or right (many sides, many sides :D ).  In truth, the same way as Anarcho-Syndicalism and Anarch-Capitalism have a similar end result on the libertarian side, Communism and Fascism have the same end result on the authoritarian side. All stories start from the center with ideas about freedom and liberty that all people can accept, than we go towards the ideas which people need most and are most at risk, than we come with ideas which people have ''too much'' and something should be taken from them... than we go into ideas who can no longer be described as human.  It is normal for a centrist to agree with more than 50% of what a fascist would say, and more than 50% of what a communist would say. Right leaning centrist would sometimes agree with 90% of what an extremist fascist would say. The thing is, the trouble is in those 10%. We all like peace, we all like order, we all like the infrastructure working and no violence on the street... problem starts when by ''cleaning the streets'' you mean killing _INSERT UNDESIRABLE GROUP HERE_ .  For me, this slight distinction is one of the biggest reasons why we should have unrestricted free speech. People should be free to spout anything that comes to their mind, as the covert road to totalitarianism is long and hard and most extremist ideologues would fall into temptation of saying what they really want at some point, with millions to see them. Those who have the composure not to ''reveal their power levels'' would spend years promoting social-democracy or the free market, and then they will die, making net good for the world."

Just a question: What about people who use the term 'western values' to mean the values of the Enlightenment and modern western countries (i.e: democracy, equality, tolerance, separation of church and state, free speech, etc..) sincerely and not necessarily as a dog whistle to mean 'whiteness'? Is it fair to dismiss them along with the fascists? Especially considering they may not even be aware of the dog whistle in the first place (otherwise it wouldn't be a very good dog whistle)."
"I the feral pigs hiding on your wallpaper 😀"
"This is a nicely done video, seems pretty fair and level headed viewpoint. However, I wish you would've included a couple links."
"I think this is great, really enjoyed this. I do think that you are using the words fascist and Nazi very loosely though. Your argument is that's an argument a fascist or Nazi would make, well, a historian would do that too...  The arguments and approaches that combat Nazism and fascism are not the same arguments and approaches that will tackle racism, or nativist populism."
"The ACLU ad was a fascist dogwhistle tho"
"You look like a man"
"99 out of 100 fascists will disavow fascism. Delusional. This videos a joke right?"
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  My brain has grown for this channel!!!!!"
"I used to be alt right I used dog whistle racism to convince everyone to vote for Brexit and I now hate myself for it. I don't deserve forgiveness."
"Wait. Has 'western countries' also been co-opted and transformed into something ubiquitously positive for alt-righters? Because I enjoyed using that category to talk about the mostly capitalist, liberal democratic, christian countries that includes large parts of Europe and many of the ex-colonies in the Americas."
"The police are dangerous to black people because black people are 25-200x more likely to commit violent crimes."
"Hey! Centrist here. Great video and I agree with most points, but let's get to the points of contention:  1) Beyond clever word make-up, alt-right people lie a lot. They create fake quotes constantly, like a mother that has a mixed-race baby and because of that feels that the kid is 'not hers'. I know mixed-race parents and young parents in general, they're overwhelmed with love towards their children. They're counting on most people reading not having parenting experiences.  2) The give no platform thing. That's about the worst part (btw, I've seen your talk with Roaming Millennial). The reason that alt-right people can be so effective IS because they're so underground. If people now them, they'll disavow them. Look at Milo Yiannopoulos, as soon as he saw what the alt-right was becoming, he disavowed it. Roaming Millennial's interview of Richard Spencer showed that she is more right leaning them he is, that's very significant. The more you show what the alt-right is really about, the less support they'll have.   These people need every single shred of argument brought to light and analyzed from every point of view possible (kinda what you're doing right now), If a guy like Sam Harris or Jordan Peterson obliterates a guy like Jared Taylor, it will be a blow that the alt-right will have a hard time recuperating from.  For extra research, look into Daryl Davis and his documentary 'Accidental Courtesy', he seems to see all the coded language you see (like the 'again' in MAGA), it didn't stop him from talking to kkk members. And he has a track record of convincing people to LEAVE the kkk, that's more than any youtuber (right, left or center) can brag about.  And how far this no-platforming (or no-megaphoning) of yours goes? You wouldn't talk to Richard Spencer and the like, that's cool, but what about all those misguided centrists you showed off? I've seen Chris Ray Gun and Sargon of Akkad, how willing are you to talk to them? Have you ever talked to them? If you're willing to talk to just a handful of selected people, your own megaphone is much less effective, and you're reaching only people that already agree with you. What about Tim Pool and WeAreChange? Both respectful people that have talked to Lauren Southern and explicitly said that they don't agree with her.  3) Stop being so anglo-centric. You live in 'murica, the internet is worldwide. Not everyone cares about Trump, a lot of people care about their access to an unfiltered internet. Look at your stats, you'll see a lot of people from all over the globe. Some people might 'side' with the alt-right not because they care for some amendment in some constitution that is not theirs, but because they fear that their favorite youtuber will be demonetized or their favorite game will be banned.  4) If dog-whistling and coded language are affecting you so much, stop playing their game!!! Go the other way around, this is one of those cases that the problem is not the message but the medium. Just because memes and sarcasm are the language of the internet, doesn't mean you should be using it, politeness and clarity are still a thing. You know that if someone denounce a symbol as being forbidden, it will just make edgy people want to use it (and by consequence diminish YOUR capacity of discernment).   I don't use pepe memes, not because I think the alt-right 'owns' the meme, but because It makes what I'm saying less clear. Btw, the only way I know about this video is because a guy named ChurchofKek shared it. Hopefully the irony is not lost.  These are my points, hope I've been useful."
"I am an American. Thats my race. I don't id as any one heritage as i am many cultures in one man. While my ancestors were irish, and mostly Scottish, i am a melting pot of many cultures, and traditions, like every American. I am a mixed race individual, although a mix of white races."
"I would use this for any nationalist group that attempts to gain power."
"Antifa and These far right nationalists are fascists."
"The more the left label us as ''nazis'' and ''fascists'' more and more come to our side and even more push to the extremes. It will only help our cause."
"hey you freak/degenerate/Weimarische creation, why dont you debate live an altRightist to show them have wrong they are?   or is it not platform for hatespeechTM/wrongspeechTM policy on this channel?"
"Funny how the left claim to be so logical and that right wings are like sheep and yet they appeal to emotions and labels more than anyone else when they call people ''fascists''/''nazis''/''racists''/''kkk''/''white supremacists''."
"You've broken this down perfectly. As a straight white male TM. You've brought forth the allure of fascism that has taken hold of many rural friends. The real Psy-ops war is being done by the alt-right. Growing up in rural America listening with fox news and rush being on both on at the same time I've began to notice their dog whistles and started growing a hatred at their lies. They want to kill and disempower everyone one. Arguing with white nationalist their end goal is really 'getting rid of the bad white people'(one of the sentiments and many slurs made against me) they don't care about white people. They care about power, they care about maintaining their in-groups cultural and if you disagree with that culture. Which is why this ideology is self-defeating as the in-group cultural becomes more and more inclusive and needs to disempower more and more people.    Eventually this ideology eats itself, look at Nazi Germany and our current administration. Lots of assassination attempts, firing/purging anyone that disagrees with them in the slightest. However the aftermath of its inevitable defeat leaves a lot of dead bodies and property destroyed. Which is why it should be stopped, mixing our culturals and tribes brings peace, unity and bringing humanity closer.  EDIT: I would also like to say I'm sick of this stupid fascist fucks telling me what being a white male means. They don't own my identity."
"Contra, maybe this video will show some of the reasons that people are joining this movement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi1oN1icAYc. What do you think about this video?"
"I really don't think fascists are this smart"
"Thank you for this great video, arguing with other people about politics feels sometimes like playing secret hitler, just without the fun."
"Stellar mind reading. Do you also do hypnosis?"
"'But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.' God, get a fucking hobby you sad fuck."
"I have to call you out @ 20:44 you make a statement that 'if you care about one person of (groups) you don't include Jews. Jews are a major target of fascists. You can't both be a fascist and truly care about any Jew.  I am sure this is an honest omission, but you should be aware of it"
"The alt right is a creation of the alt left. I live in Virginia and went up to the Charlottesville alt right rally and saw BLM supporters, Antifa, Nazi and confederate flag wavers getting off the same buses."
"Dear Lauren Southern fanboys: If she's not a fascist, then why did she tell all her viewers to go join their local chapter of Identity Europa -- a group that specifically DOES NOT ALLOW members who aren't of 'European, non-Semitic heritage' and literally specifies this on their applications? This is not dog 'whistling' anymore -- it's howling.  *Edit: I revisited this thread after two weeks and I LOVE how easy it is to trigger Nazis. PS - 1. 'Aryan' is a Sanskrit word co-opted by Hitler and 2. the most beautiful woman in the world is Jewish; her name is Mila Kunis. 3. Oh and your beloved 'fuhrer,' Adolf Hitler? Also a Jew. 4. White genocide isn't real but if it was, all you'd have to do to stop it is to find someone willing to breed with you. * waits for lovely Nazi comments to continue rolling in *"
"Excellent production values, and kudos for featuring HOME in the soundtrack.  Now I highly recommend everyone look at this video from Noam Chomsky, the father of the Left in America, precisely on this subject, although perhaps many of you are familiar with it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOWi_Aeq_Pw  This is a direct link to where he references dealing with Neo fascists:  https://youtu.be/rOWi_Aeq_Pw?t=755"
"ironic: you claim to be against these tactics, yet you are a communist, and your ilk has been using these very tactics since the 70s to conceal your own extremism from moderates and subvert centre-leftists into supporting your radicalism,  in exactly the same way that you accuse natzees of doing."
"communists are just as bad if not worse when it comes to the values of human life."
"ah man you made us wait until 19:44 to confirm that you are mentally unstable lol... wtf Contra you were making some good points, oh well.... back to the oven memes"
"As someone who follows this stuff really closely, damn I feel like you are a prophet laying down some hidden truth. But I usually disagree with you on almost every video at some point in the video. This time around its how to characterize centrists. First off, the 'centrists' you point out, do hold positions. These people don't identify with any political affiliation because they don't want to play apologetics with an identity. It doesn't mean they don't hold all the views of whatever identity you are labeling them. It just means they are 'anti-identitarian' opposed to 'centrist'  Also, I am a libertarian first when it comes to political dialog(liberal a close second, IRL I say I am whatever the context of the conversation would lead me to be). I am used to my philosophy being misused by people that are hateful or don't understand the talking points they use(see: GOP republicans, tea party constitutionalists, and more recently alt-right). So i really relate when you talk about how fascists use symbolism and dog whistle. GOP politicians have been using small government talking points to bleed poor people and argue for trickle down economics for over 30 years now. But that doesn't mean I am even conservative(I'm not). It just means conservatives sometimes dog whistle my philosophy because they are assholes. Armored skeptic and ChrisRayGun aren't bad people, they are very real people that have legitimate talking points. Assholes have come along and muddied their fan bases and misused their talking points to herd casuals to be slightly more sympathetic to actual fascists. They are in fact victims. Their beliefs and ideas are not invalid because of those assholes. They just need to be more aware of their own following."
"Simply put, the more you try to 'eliminate' fascists, the more you unintentionally create... keep making vids Contra!"
"I regard myself as a classical liberal. I try to step out of my echo chamber and listen to different perspectives. Thats why I am here.   I did not know it but it would seem I am a ‘nazi’ from what you say.  Over half my people were exterminated in Europe by the National Socialists. To the east the communists were no better. Nothing new. 586 BCE the Babylonians murdered half our people. The Rhineland massacres 1096, Edict of Expulsion 1290, massacres of Spanish Jews in 1391, Spanish Inquisition and expulsion from Spain 1492, Cossack massacres in Ukraine 1648-1657, Anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia 1821 and 1906, Dreyfus affair in France 1894–1906.  oh yeah and that detail called the Holocaust that murdered about two-thirds of our people. That ones that were left that is after all the other purges.  The only way to predict the future is to look at the past. Most of the European purging of Jews was when Spain was Islamic 711-1492. Hardly 50 years between mass purges of Jews at anytime. I would NOT want to be living in Europe now. Not with this new massive invasion of Islam!   Maybe I am just paranoid but here goes….  In order to secure the existence of the Jewish people and provide a future for our children we must secure a homogeneous Jewish state.   So does this make me a Nazi?"
"Is that a fucking trap trying to convince me I'm a nazi?  Hahaha what a joke."
"6:46 anonymous interviews are always the most reliable"
"Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas you're not ready to own yet. Wears Nazi uniform."
"So someone who likes western culture is a fascist? That definition seems a little broad. I thought people who live in the west like western culture by default. Otherwise what  are we still doing here?"
"Don't become a tranny if you only fail as a trap.  The purge can't come fast enough."
"She's so smart"
"In short if you claim you are not a fascist you are actual one. Top Kek."
"The lack of self awareness in this video and in the comments is mind blowing."
"You look so pretty in that dress, it's quite amazing. (great video as always)"
"Great analysis in this video! I unpack some of the dog-whistling from Trump (and 'inadvertently' echoed by centrists like the ACLU) in my article 'On Trump’s dog whistling to neo-Nazis: Why Americanism is the incorrect response to fascism', found here: https://danielkbuntovnik.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/trumps-dog-whistle-nazis-americanism-fascism/"
"I think you're definition for fascism is incorrect. 'from the Latin fascio, meaning “bundle, or political group.” In fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle — one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force.' Antifa and the left are facsistic."
"What about spotting an anti-F@scist?  Bloke wearing a dress is the first giveaway... Yikes!"
"a facist can be left or right why are you such mention the ways to identify nationalists ? non of the hints you give will indentify a facist - since a facist is soemone use violence (antifa) to get heared"
"i;m gay"
"great video and also blond hair really suits u"
"you have idendity problems as a tranny - therfor your competence on the topic idendity of white people is lower than zero"
"You basically like a paranoid antisemite but antinazi. Everything is a dogwhissle, don't gaslight me bro!  Contra is basically Alex Jones-level of conspiracy nut. Also nice 'ironic dog whistle' to your communist comrades in video about ironic dog whistles. 'But that's the joke' - you will say, tho we crearly already know  that it doesn't matter to you... Fuck, it's Nazis vs Communists again, aren't we did that already? I'm Russian, both killed insane amount of people in my country, stop this shit you morons."
"You're describing neo-nazis. Fascism is a political system. Most modern neo-nazis aren't actually fascist. It would be more accurate to describe them as authoritarian, kind of like antifa."
"Do you have anything that would give one to believe antifa would accept people that arent socialists or communists? It wasnt the alt-right, fuck the alt right hasnt really convinced me of much of anything really, that convinced me that antifa would attack people like me as well. I agree with your description of fascist tactics but there isnt enough people ousting those who advocate violence against just everyday people."
"Watched first 30 seconds and puked. Absolutely Degenerate cant wait for DOTR."
"The white man shall only eat apples genetically pure in white nations! /sarcasm"
"ContraPoints, I would consider myself a 'liberal' conservative who thoroughly enjoys you and your videos. You offer a very insightful, intelligent and refreshing take on the left's current arguments. This in turn has helped me garner a more rounded and empathetic view of the left and their fears. However, this video reminds me of the anti-communist type fear-mongering that was so widespread in the 1950's. It's like you're making the argument that anyone who has non-liberal views, or anyone who criticises the liberal orthodoxy, or anyone who openly identifies with and cherishes european/western values, is potentially a fascist/white supremacist/neo-nazi. That's fear-mongering at its worst and only serves to create more hysteria and paranoia.  That aside, you're a cool dude and I would definitely enjoy hanging out, boozing and discussing politics/philosophy with you.   greets from Ireland"
"Imagine listening to someone with a mental disorder attempt to deconstruct political beliefs."
"Heh, you're pretty good. You have to admit that many of these tactics are used by you commie/cultural marxists too, incrementalism. Normies like us better tho."
"How do you do all this work by yourself? The production quality is amazing. Great work!"
"Honestly, this feels quite dangerous and may fall into 'everything is facists' area. I believe the western values of enlightenment and individualism need protection. Doesn't mean I'm a fascist.  I still think the best tactic is to simply make fun of them. make the idea undebatable because it is too ridiculous. also, educate people on citizenship. But that would mean people discover how stupid the us system is."
"The dots on your dress look both red and green, which is highly disturbing."
"Nobody is flooding Africa with millions of non-Africans and FORCE assimilating them. Nobody is flooding Asia with millions of non-Asians and FORCE assimilating them. This is happening in ALL White countries and ONLY White countries. It's GENOCIDE! Diversity is a codeword for White GENOCIDE."
"How the fuck is Lauren Southern a fascist?"
"'that's what they want you think.'  'of course they want you think that 2 planes brought down the towers. but it's was a inside job, here's all my evidence'"
"Booooooring. Right out of the gate you make a false equivalence between fascism and 'western culture' and call it a 'dog whistle'.  Honestly Contra, if you can't even get basic definitions right, why should we even bother with your ugly ass?"
"love u contra, really great video. probably one of your best"
"Pure fucking propaganda."
"Excellent analysis as always. One critique though: your definition is of a certain brand of facism, ethno facism i suppose you could call it. There are various other types out there, such as theocratic facism in the middle east."
"They're idiots but they're not really dangerous because they're on the fringe. The danger is coming out of the left right now with it's intolerent tolerance. The alt-right is no more accepted that the KKK, which despite what CNN says they are both groups that have few members and little,if any, support outside of their own group. The attempt at stopping any conversation that runs contrary to the flavor of the week is dangerous. Singling out a group of people and saddling them with the responsibility for the evils of the whole world is dangerous. Large mobs of people that show up to gatherings where their targets have different political views is dangerous.   White supremacist groups do not hold any power or influence, as they shouldn't. The new left (I was with the left up until the point I realized they've stopped speaking and have started dictating) controls the colleges, news media, Hollywood, print, and most of all, every social media platform. They don't have any issue with ruining people's lives for views that aren't even extreme. They show up to speeches given by those they deem 'problematic' and simply shout at them. The definition of oppressed and racist has been perverted by the new left.   The new left is often rife with hipocrasy and gross contradictions as well. We'll just look at immigration real quick since it's still a mess. We don't need a wall so let's just get that out of the way. The new left is doing everything it can to encourage and support those that adhere to the Muslim faith. Why? Because it upsets people they view as the enemy (anyone not on the extreme left and more traditional conserveatives). The Muslim faith is the polar opposite of what the left claims to stand for-acceptance of thoughts and lifestyles across the entire spectrum. All of the evil the new left thinks they see in the west is on full display in any Muslim majority nation. The oppression that the new left thinks they see in the west is written into the DNA of the Muslim faith. Read the Quran. Read the Hadith. Watch the videos that so-called centrist Muslims produce. You think that Trump is a tyrant? If any country ends up with a theocracy, which is the stated goal of Muslims, it's pretty likely the creator of this video would be arrested at best, and killed at worst.   You're all fighting shadows and ghosts."
"What kind of shit dictionary did you get the fascist definition from?"
"First I'll say you could read my comment as exactly what a fascist would say, by your logic, but I ask of you (Contra and you the reader) to clarify (against) the points I make regardless, because that way you contribute, by reaction (if in a polite manner and not calling me a nazi, altough anyone should assume anyone calling anyone else a nazi (or SJW fo that mater) is a troll that likes to see the world descent into a hell of division, as I state further on), to the recentering of individuals away from the right, by giving people responses to the counterpoints I make. that said:  what seems characteristic of the first point and some others in the video is the following:  what you're saying is a lie, and I know it.  this is not a tennable position because the same could be said for left individuals, that in such a same way could be made out to be stalinists/lenninists/communists.  next to that IF nazi's continually keep warping their language to appeal to average population while continually moving more to the center/to what's acceptable to say there will be bigger and bigger overlap between nazi statements and thought of a bigger and bigger part of the population. the problem here is that you can't be so certain at some point that someone actually is a nazi without becoming redicoulous. (what if someone actually believes what he says and is not a nazi, this is the danger of incrementalism. saying you want the people to own companies groups you into the same group as stalin (because by this logic it is something he says aswell) while you (I presume, considering the gulag/history etc, do not agree with all his points) )  concerning the symbols you seem to forget that there is a group of people (who I think are more deplorable than nazi's even) that hear a statement being made about for example the OK sign go and amplify it, not because they believe in it, but to sow discontent/chaos, really, that's 4chans average goal. (Though I'm tempted to say even that sayings such as 'can't you antifa-facists take a joke anymore....', can but not necesarily do belong to this group as well and think this is distributed among both)  also, this seems to disregard the way our justicie system works which works on INTENT and not outcome. is that something you would willingly do away with?  also, you say ironically that if you have a word for this thing that thing must exists, implying it doesn't necesarily does. this is exactly what happend with the alt-right, nobody used the term untill it was coined on TV, they called THEMSELVES white nationalists before that happend, and even /pol/ even moreso shunned the alt-right in the beginning months. so maybe people flock to the banner in the future, who knows.  again, by the logic of the video you could call me a fascists for making all these points, but that would hardly be productive I think"
"WRONG. Look up the definition and stop spouting bull shit. Fascism has nothing to do with Europe or white people as a DEFINITION.  The nearest thing to your three INCORRECT descriptions is National Socialist Germany under Hitler. Any group that is authoritarian and suppresses free speech and Any Dissent with force is Fascist. EG; White Nationalists, The KKK, and Antifa - (Recently deemed to be terrorists) The fact that one is racist and one communist is irrelevant. Communism is Fascist. You are just biased in line with your brainwashes ideological cult. No surprise."
"Listen facists Strategies don't work on centerests it's that normal people never took a neo Nazis serious and they lost there Fuck ing voice decades ago hating blm and antifa is more important cuz the media and some regular people listen to them and don't see how fucking destructive they are. they are more dangerous to the American way. and stop calling antifa anti fascist cuz they are commies they protest under the fucking hammer and sycal. It's a problem. I can't believe I watched this dumb video threw"
"This is awesome stuff and really informative. New sub! As a fellow fan of 60s and 70s counterculture  cinema, also loving the movie allusions. (Or are they dog whistle?)  One thing I would point out, a lot of the positions used by fascists to soften their image ARE genuinely held by plenty of liberal centrists, without malicious intent. Myself included.  Which would make sense, considering the fascists are attempting to tap into the political zeitgeist. So I think it's important to give people benefit of the doubt when those portions are asserted.  There also a conversation to be had about whether the confrontational tactics are actually counter productive, considering that these guys WANT to create the view of false- equivalence, 'faults on both sides' narrative."
"This is why I only date black men and want to have kids with a black husband someday. I never date white guys because they are hate filled bigots."

"Easily the most insightful, intelligent, sociopolitical analysis on Fascism I've ever seen. I feel very enlightened by the concepts explained and examined.  Thank you very much for making this video."
"Stoped right at the incorrect definition of fascism."
"3:35 Homeland bad (left wing), Safe spaces are bad (right wing. All limits on individual rights are bad (centrist). Not that they're necessarily equally bad, but both are bad."
"In conclusion. Identity politics can often show the mindset of an authoritarian who would enact severe policies against others. What gender do you identify as again?  Yeah, we centrists know the problems with identity politics. I wish you would show more insight in to that"
"Idk how it's so difficult for leftists to tell actual fascists from trolls. As an anarcho-capitalist with a couple fascist friends, it's obvious to see who the real fascists are and who are the trolls (I'm one of those trolls)"
"I came with an open mind, but I can't sit through this. You don't even have the basic vocabulary to know what fascism is."
"Great video but you are not asking or answering the most important questions: Why are people becoming disillusioned in the first place and how can it be prevented?"
"The WW2 veteran mentioned in the news clip, didn't fight against anything that is similar to what's happening in the US today. The street battles between the far left & far right in Europe took place before the start of WW2, also the US was late in to entering WW2, they also never had any territories occupied by the Wehrmacht. He would've fought against actual soldiers, part of an actual standing army. Members of which may or may not have been actual Nazis.  Sorry that's a massive appeal to false authority by the News reporter (notice I wasn't criticising Contra's use of that video, but the News reporter herself)."
"1. funny but these 'white fascists' seem to exclude estern Europe as 'true europeans' - even though they are white too. talk about selective bias :D"
"'This is a critical and educational video' LOL nice joke. Literally taking LARPers on 4chan as evidence for your claims. Real nazis dont give a fuck about 4chan, they are/were on stormfront, 8chan, and IRC boards.  Your whole video is just a joke, Kekistan is supposed to be MOCKING nazis by making a green colored krigesmarine flag, the purpose of which is to express the futility of trying to appease minority groups through political maneuvering. It's literally 'We are the oppressed diaspora of kekistan please gib monthly check'. It's been demonstrated to work against clueless liberals who hear you're from some oppressed muslim state and instantly change their attitude to not offend. LITERALLY RECORDED.  8:00 so Contra, are you a fascist? You're such a fucking joke."
"I agree with most of this video (or at least I can follow your reasoning) but I feel that you're reaching a bit when you say that Kekistan is some kind of fascist meme. It really started out very light-hearted and to this day people of different political beliefs enjoy it."
"oh man if 50 cent had a quarter for every gender there is he'd be like ....  oh wait XD,  the only fascist i see so far is the ugly dude in the dress thats an insult to women and men every where lol"
"whats funny is that bernie sanders speaches are almost word for word the same speeches hitler gave, god i love history, it just shows that all leftist are ignorant hypocrites who are the biggest perpetrators of everything they complain about lol!!! oh man i havent seen liberals this up set and crying since conservatives set all their slaves free XD"
"'Yeah, ...like the fucking Vikings', --*white bitch voice* LMAO  I love the sythwave mix with David lynch asethic mix with humor. Keep it up! <3"
"Antifa has been deemed a terrorist organization, but sure the alt-left are the good guys."
"Interesting. So, Contra specifically sets the tone of the video to start with the rise of fascist ideology in the US as a blanket of context, and even refers to the following 3 fascist characteristics as belonging to 'contemporary fascists'.  Yet comments are just cutting out that level of context, and straw- manning the thesis with historical fascists.   Cool."
"Yeah, like the topic wasn't scary enough, then Contra comes out with that creepy face and the Trump hat... I'll have nightmares tonight."
"Are you a man?"
"So people can't joke, or dress up as something or they'll become it like you and trans? So does that mean you are a Trump supporter because you own and wore a MAGA hat?"
"Great video. You should make something debunking 'race realists' on IQ, which is one of their main talking points"
"People want to disavow nazis, Durr they're still Nazis it's pathetic the Alt right is not fascist parts of it sure, but it's like say the left are all commies, honestly I think some people shouldn't be taught about Nazis at all its sad to see them try to make the facts fit their bias rather then being objective."
"Incredibly well-produced and cogent, but I don't understand why you define fascism as white nationalism. Superset-subset, right? There are all kinds of way to be a fascist. And you can be a nationalist without being a racial nationalist."
"The alt right is made up of overweight beta males"
"No intelligent 'alt righter' takes Richard Spencer seriously.."
"Are you a Trap?"
"14:47 'the equivocation between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence.' That's where you lost me. As a decent, non-fascist American, am I supposed to simply ignore the fact that cars get set on fire, store windows get smashed, and peaceful protesters get assaulted in the name of Antifa? Two wrongs don't make a right. Also, what's with the Russian toast to your 'comrades' at the end? Should I worry that it's a Communist dog whistle?

"You left liberal submissive trans homo brown power people want open borders, one world thing to fix third world through some race communist stuff i understand and respect that, but your society is not fulfilling to me i would not be happy.  if you got everything your idealist mind wanted you yourself would still be empty inside.   liberals want to protect minority's yet they have a globalist perspective right?  well then would not ''white people'' be a [minority] in the whole of humanity. the left will use national perspective to benefit them in brown votes but want no borders a world state well if you got the world state, whites would be the minority in it soooo....... ya that's all."
"Well i really enjoyed this video... very nice"
"'I used to cross dress ironically before realizing I was trans so anyone using ironic humor is like me'   So...this entire video is projection.  I feel like you could equally make a mirror parody of this with how lefty memes is all commie subversion."
"I like the video. I still think the nazi's are right the ''issues'' in society can only be solved through direct force purify cleaning making family and state one.  the people are not victims of society, they are the society so if the ghetto selfish perversion continues maybe, its the people who are the sickness and unless you take care of them the issues will manifest generation after generation."

"Mexico has an immigration policy that states that the demographics of the country can never change. So I guess you are calling them out on being fascist? Right? O, they aren't white so it doesn't matter. Got it."
"ContraPoints, I think this video you have made here and the behavior you are promoting has a very dangerous history - such as McCarthyism & paranoia of Communists, but happens all the time in history) . Have you considered the ripple effect of promoting this fear & intense suspicion that anyone who thinks outside a certain box is a secret  Fascist/ Communist/ Terrorist.........see how any fearful person does it? Like not everyone who likes socialism is a Stalanist who wants to put people in Gulags - the crazy Neo-Nazi on a dark corner of the internet doesn't represent the concerns of the whole.  have you ever actually sat down and talked to our advasary - you know like someone like Daryl Davis? Because I think you are just assuming things here a bit, and making out yur advesary is a big boogey-man, like a 'Closet Communist' that needed to be purged in Macarthy's America. It fits the narrative I get from the Corporate Media, but doesn't fit my observations.   Btw - and maybe your talking about a different group here - but I have not yet heard a White Nationalist say they want to take away Black Civil rights in any way (correct me if I'm wrong, PLEASE - evidence though, not fear-based assumptions).Why on EARTH would they?? There is ALWAYS a reason a person wants something. Even with the tragedy that was Nazi Gemany & Stalinist Russia, didn't it start out as people fighting for a good cause, doing violence for a good cause, and hating 'bad people', which was justified, 'because we're the good people', 'we're victims, they're oppressors'. Hmmm..........    Really - I recommend you look up Daryl Davis, I think what you are promoting here is very, very much based on seeing everyone through the eyes of fear & is misleading and will have bad effects for those who follow it, including enabling & promoting political violence (which always results from escalating fear & excusing bad behavior)......and eventually escalates to political polarization, violence and gets worse.  Here is my argument: You are using your fear as an excuse to treat others badly (which you are promoting). But real safety and progress depends on Ethical Principles & standards that apply equally, and tend to grow more kindness & trust between people. What you are promoting here is exactly like McCarthyism, or other fear based political paranoia, only - luckily - you & listeners probably have less political power to do damage.   And PLEASE I am open to discussing, but not insults and unfounded accusations."
"I been wondering this for awhile contrapoints, are you a progressive or a a proto-socialist. Also, have you heard of /leftypol/?"
"See, it's funny because whenever I go looking for the definition of a fascist online, all I see are labels which could just as easily be applied to the Left and Antifa as they could be applied to the right. The fact that (you say) the Alt-Right seeks to unite the white majority under the umbrella of elitist, ethnic nationalism using physical and social pressure is no different to the drive of the Left to unite the populace under the umbrella of identity politics and endless victim narratives.  You'd do well to admit that one side has just as many extremists as the other - in fact, if anyone has more extremists out on the street ready to use violence to achieve their ends, it's Antifa and the Left. Face it - there are no 'good guys' or 'bad guys' here - only people who see things differently and the varying degrees they will take to make that happen."

"Maybe your best video. Also your comments section proves your points for you, so it's like double points. I hope this ends up being shown in schools one day."
"I wanted to give you a chance, and trust that maybe you would tackle this subject with some legitimacy, but considering you start it off with the 'contemporary' fascists sharing 3 beliefs (none of which have anything to do with fascism, rather they align explicitly with nazism), and then use fascism interchangeably with nazism, I was skeptical. And now I see your own pinned comment where you say Kekistan and the OK sign were neo-fascist symbols.... yeah, that's three strikes already.  Also, fascism very explicitly believes in the use of government control over the lives of its nation's people. You'd have to really twist the definition of fascism (even for 'contemporaries') to include advocates for reduced government control."
"are you a men or a woman"
"Facim is not about White Supremacy Facism is a policy in hich private industry is subordinated to The State, but is allowed to continue as private, and in which . seeks an Authoritarian Nationalism. It was created by Benito Mousolini. who was not  Racist, and employed by Franko, who was also not Racist.  Facism is not Naziism.   Also, the OK Sign trump made was not a Facist signal. I saw an End Times Prophecy Vid that claims its the 666 Sign and that Trump is somehow in league with Satan. Its absurd. He just waved his hands and mad ea gesture. Its not him flashing Nazi street cred."
"Stop 👏 strawmanning 👏 us 👏 centrists 👏   We're not the ones trying to find some middle ground between antifa and Nazis. It's centrist countries like Germany under the CDU that actually legally prosecute the fash. The only people making false equivalences between antifa and Nazis are the Nazis who denounce fascism (like you pointed out in the video) so that they can make antifa look just as nazis bad to make *conservatives* feel more comfortable with the Nazis on their side.   I do not like antifa, I don't care that they punch Nazis but the rest of their ideology, anarchism and sometimes 'libertarian' marxism, is what I don't like."
"Where on earth do you get that definition? It also is racist: it only applies to one race; and hypocritical if it doesn;t apply to oneself as well. Actual Fascism traits:  1) A belief that's one group (often racial) should shut down, suppress or oppress another with force. Genocide being the ultimate expression. 2) Political Violence as a tool. 3) Bigotry (the dictionary definition: intolerance to different views). 4) A belief that evil always resides in one's adversary & never in oneself. That is why Altifa is just as facist and a hate group as well. It's hypocritical and dishonest to have a definition that excludes oneself or one's own stances. Isn't it true that all that the disasters like Nazi Germany & Stalinist Russia came about because of a sliding into & justification of Political violence? Compare that to people who actually get get results, like Daryl Davis."
"Well leftists and fascists are not the only reference groups on the political field. I support the thoughts of Ben Shapiro (a jew) and Jordan Peterson. They are anti-marxists for sure but does that make them fascists. Hell no."

"This video should be shown at universities and everywhere else! Recently - 2 weeks ago - in Portugal, a publishing house was made to remove two books - including problem solving, etc - on the (rightly so) grounds they only served to fortify gender stereotypes.   The book for the boys encouraged them to be active, fearless, and presented consistently harder problems focusing on abilities normally associated with men, like spatial reasoning, etc.  The book for girls included topics on princesses, being cute, it encouraged 'social' abilities and, regarding areas like the above mentioned spatial reasoning, it presented easier problems.  The right wingers and the centrists (which, in Portugal, tend to be coward rightwingers) accused the leftwing government of wanting to forbid girls from liking pink. Yeah...no more comments needed.  A 'centrist' blogger said she took her daughter to a bookshop and that she liked a pink covered book and that, in no way, had she forced her daughter to like pink. Yeah, no more comments needed, too.  Thanks for your channel, which I came to know through Shaun & Jen :)."
"Diversity + Proximity = Conflict. Google that. tons of studies proving this. History proves it too   Prove 'diversity is our strength'.   The paper, 'Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability,' proves our points. so does history.  Prove Blank slate. You cant. You can only deny any study that disagrees with you. Usually by citing things the studies already took into account   We just believe what the founding fathers believed minus slavery. 1790 naturalization act says they only want 'White people of good character' America was a nation of European immigrants until the 1965 Hart Cellar act.  'Pepe, milk, the OK sign, Kekistan: all of this is quickly being  abandoned by savvy fascists. Normies have caught on. It's on the news.'        People just get sick of memes. Those are just dead memes. this reveals how clueless you are. A lot of normies secretly agree with us. They see the news lying 24/7. As 'diversity' increases people will be flocking towards us. They dont believe the C'ville narrative at all. You people truly are in an echo chamber of degenerate freaks. Real Americans love us and hate you. You people have no clue whats coming your way."
"Spot on."
"I wish I had billions of dollars to pay people to start riots and act like anarchists. Then say that everyone that disagrees with me is a racist and a neo-Nazi.  Then use social media to put out propaganda to brainwash people into believing dumb things.  It's like a Sim Civilization video game.  I can have the people burn their entire towns down using this method all while I yell Fascists are killing babies in the streets!  They are the problem!  Go get them and kill them!   (Leftism + Identity Politics + Social Media + Bored kids + brainwashing + paying people money to start problems) = Leftist terrorism in the 21st century.  As I said before, racism is real.  That's true, but it's not like the left is loving and wants to be helpful without violence or their own hate either.  The lack of critical thinking is astounding.  Non violence and LOVE that helps improve humanity overall is the best antidote to Neo-Nazism anything else is a distraction at best and a train wreck at worst."
"How to destroy leftest ideology with simple questions...   1) Why is it that ONLY white nations must become multicultural? 2 )How is diversity a strength when historically it creates conflict? (as seen in the US & everywhere in the world) 3) Are ALL these migrants starving & being displaced or are they simply giving up on their country? 4) Why can every ethnic group be proud of their heritage but whites can't? 5) Why must ONLY white people repent for crimes of the past? Do you know world history at all? 6) If white people are so evil & racist why are so many non white people willing to risk death just to get to white nations? 7) Do you truly believe Europe/US will remain world powers if they become minority white? If so why aren't these migrates coming from world powers? 8) Why doesn't poverty create the same amount of 'violent crime' in poor white neighborhoods that black neighborhoods have? 9) Why wherever you see white people leave/relinquish power in an area (Detroit, Chicago, South Africa) it gets worst?  10) Why can a place have 'too many white people' & need to diversify? Why can't a place have 'too many blacks' or  'Too many Mexicans'? 11) If Multiculturalism is a good natural thing why must it be so strictly enforced? Anything naturally good in life doesn't need to be enforced... right? 12) When a Muslim blows something up or rams a car into groups of people you say 'not all Muslims are like that' (the predictable old NAXALT argument) but if a white nationalist dose something in the wrong you condemn not only them but all white people for allowing this to happen...why is that?   The amount of contradictions/double standards & mental gymnastic hoops you people must do to condone hatred of white people being proud of their heritage & wanting to preserve it is sick. Your either too dumb to see it or you truly are evil. You've pushed the degenerate dildo in too far this time & awoken a sleeping giant. My suggestion is you should move to a majority non white nation and see how far your leftists ideology fairs there... & watch how people of color in there own nations treat minorities and gay/trans people, because after all you want more of these people in the US/Europe right?"

"I am a classical liberal. I do not believe in authoritarianism. I believe in the individual. Unlike you, I do not think *ANY* form of collectivism taken to any extreme is practical or good. Unlike you, I do not think that people *WILL* do this thing or that thing based on 'societal pressure.' And, unlike you, I think that the one act that separates sane and civilized people from insane and uncivilized people is the ability to talk to others without resorting to or advocating for real-world physical violence. That is because unlike you, I believe that people have a choice, and that they will not only use that choice but they will surprise even misanthropic pseudo-intellectuals like you when they are given the opportunity to choose to be better on their own.  It's also because, unlike you, I believe people can and do shoulder the responsibility for their own actions, and that is the *ONLY* thing that actually improves the state of the world. Your fear-mongering and snake oil huckstering must make you feel very important. To give yourself over to some cause that is far greater than you alone must give you comfort on some level, but the saddest thing is that you simply will not be an adult and stop trying to turn people against each other. You seem to be doing it because your identity is tied up almost entirely in this image and ideology you have adopted. You can't, or won't, see violence and fear as the enemy. You only see 'the other side' as the enemy.   And all this for nothing more than what, views? On youtube? I really wish it was just your terrible lighting that made me sick. You divide people because you can, and because it amuses you. You aren't looking for solutions to the problems of the world; you are simply trying to leave your mark, regardless of what damage that requires.

I will nonetheless say that we, on occasion,  have to take the risk of debating these maniacal genocide advocates. If we don't we admit that we don't trust democracy. If we admit we don't trust democracy, fascists can swoop right in with their alternative, that they fully believe in, which will be more appealing than if we simply face Nazis head on, rather than deliberately trying to hide their ideology as much as the Constitution allows for."

Prior, I saw it described as an authoritarian form of government where the gov was allied closely with corporations. This is what I remember from High School.  So I just looked up the definition of it on merriam-webster and don't see anything about corporations. Your definition is lot closer to it.

You can be a fascist and not give a damn about Jews. 1:27 - Or about white people.  You guys are living in a bubble from which everyone who doesn't think alike is reduceable to a fascist. Alt-right? Fascists. White nationalist? Fascist? Neo-nazis? Fascist. (The last one is at least half-correct.)   With a make-believe attitude like this you will never understand any of those groups.

Never realize the truth that you are that which you fight."

Both attract collectivist cucks who couldn't stand on their own two feet, use similar marketing strategies and both lead to authoritarian regimes that have caused the deaths of millions upon millions in the last century. Having to pick between communism and fascism is just more Hegelian dialectic bullshit that many people have had enough of already. Like RINOs and neo-liberals there's almost no discernible differences between fascists and commies who both ultimately want to enslave humanity. They just emphasize their differences so you don't focus on what they have in common and give them your support. Screw both of these false dichotomies I'm on the side of liberty and American values."

"Amazing video! I love seeing how your style has changed since I started watching your videos almost a year ago. You are so creative and manage to capture the emotions behind what you are talking about incredibly well. The amount of trolls pretending(or at least partly pretending) to be fascists coupled with the amount of actual fascists attempting to gaslight you and hide behind a mask of memes and irony is sooo frustrating, and sometimes frightening. I think you broke down the tactics used by fascists and white nationalists really well and hopefully it will help some people identify the warning signs, I hadn't known about the emoji thing myself.  Also, that image of Fritz in the Trump hat will haunt my dreams forever now."

"I dont often agree with you Contra. Though I am a Classical/Social Liberal. So obviously ideologically I simply cant agree with Faccism or hard progressivism. I thoroughly beleive liberty and individual freedom are the most important things in a society , so to go against this and silence an individual because of their views (unless they were directly inciting violence, there for impeding anothers individual liberty) is utterly wrong.  While I understand  why many and you think this way, reading between the lines of faccists talking points because that is the only way they'd reveal themselves and of  course it could be quite true that white nationalists/supremicists really do want to resort to violence to get to their goals, but they may not, you simply can't know that unless they say so, but then its not covered by freedom of speech, because it is a threat to violence against a person and or race/ group of people.  And if we shut them down, if we stop them from talking and shove them into the ground do you really think they'll just dissappear? The only way they dissappear is to allow them to see the fallacy in their own argument and the fallacy in their own irrattional fears, and to do this honestly and with facts.  I often hear those of the Alt-right say they fear western values are dying out due to foreigners, that western values are inherently white and that multi culturalism has failed. So take on their concerns, prove either how they are incorrect to come to those conclusions or offer another answer to how to solve these issues they have. And if you can't do that, how do you expect for them to change what they beleive?  Silencing gets us no where. Discussion and debate to come to conclusions about greiviances all political movements bring up is the only way to solve issues or discredit the issues that are brought up.  But anyway, cool content Contra, I like your sort of edgy/comedic spin on things, its cool :)."
"You will always a mentally ill man."
"Loving the shoutout to Life After Hate <3  As someone who was involved with white nationalist groups in Canada in my teen years, and escaped that mentality to become an anti-racist social justice advocate, I also serve as proof that it's possible. But I also advocate for diversity of tactics: calling out bigots, counter protesting them, standing between bigots and minority groups to protect against violent attacks, helping those who want to change their lives/leave the hate groups, tracking and cataloging hate group activities, etc."
"You weak beta bitches think you are quite the revolutionaries huh. Saving white western society from those evil... _white people?_ Wait what??!? You guys are idiots. Good thing you are weak kids with IQs lower that your T score. Jews prey on you low IQ retards who contribute nothing to society by saying you are fighting for something much bigger than yourself, in this case _smashing the fash_ that challenge your jewish masters stranglehold over western society. You are nothing more than traitors, and you will be dealt with accordingly."
"*Puts on 3D glasses* All good points Contra, but it won't actually fight Fascists in the long run, what we need to do is to under cut their selling point, which is literally only one 'White People have no Culture'. Give your average white Joe something to be part of that isn't Fascist and you'll see the dead of Fascism, but as long as they feel stranded, alienated and bored then hate will win. Silence and debating can only get you so far, you need to replace their rhetoric with one of your own."
"I nutted when i heard shauns voice."
"lol that propaganda video was so dumb. ancient greeks/ romans didn't even care about race and barely even remarked on it... slavery wasn't based on race and Rome was an incredibly diverse place (centre of a massive empire) and being Roman was about a way of living not race. Actually incorporating the peoples of territories instead of just raiding them is considered probably what made Rome the success it was. lmao @ fighting to protect/ basing your argument on a wildly af inaccurate historical narrative but then again the ignorance is not surprising because its not really about culture/ history at all and that's why these fucks know nothing about it..."
"I actually liked the video and it covered a lot of very good points.  Naturally, I'm trying to avoid your final sentence from colouring my comment, but I gotta say that militant Marxists are just as bad. Simply labelling themselves as anti-fascist does not miraculously absolve them of everything they do.  Now here's the problem for a centrist like me - I do actually like Western Civilisation and don't want to see it die - the problem I have is that I see nothing from the Left to give me hope... if the Left offered an actual solution other than a road to Communism, then maybe more centrists would give the time of day.  Turning to the elephant in the room that needs to be addressed - some of the issues raised by alt-righters are actually genuine, which is why they initially sounds credible to many centrists... but the alt-right have not come up with any acceptable answers - if the Left was to take this on board and stop shutting down opinions they don't like, we could maybe work out a solution that doesn't involve another genocide.  I don't normally watch your videos if I'm being totally honest (I've maybe literally watched two before), but the title did grab my attention, and by-and-large I feel you did a good job.  Cheers"

"This is funny.  So BLM is fascist!  Funny how BLM cling to the concept of being oppressed.  Their whold culture is about being a slave and they been done wrong, LOL.  We need to fight that fascist group and kill their disgusting culture that they cling to.  Until we all move on and agree that we are all equal under oppression and slavery (EQUAL) there will be groups (BLM) that try to HOG up all the OPPRESSION leaving everyone else with NO OPPRESSION.    This guy wears a dress and I bet he HOGS up all the OPPRESSION cads.  He needs to SHARE and stop STEALING all of the magial OPPRESSION cards.  Until he takes the dress off and let others enjoy the fruits of OPPRESSION, he is nothing more than a fascist :-)."

Great video otherwise, a lot of well spoken points and clearly properly and to the point written scripts.

"You're just another extremist. Fuck your assumed moral superiority. You and the alt-right have more in common then you would dare to admit. Kekistan was created to take the piss out of ALL the scum-fuck identitarians and collectivists, including you and that moron Richard Spencer.   You even say that Kekistan was created to show how absurd identity politics is but then go on to dismiss it as a disguise for hate because Richard Spencer and other alt-righters used the Kekistan meme and were too stupid to realize that they essentially trolled themselves.   If you actually did the research you would know that all the real Neo-Nazis on /pol/ now hate Kekistan cause they realized we were taking the piss out of them.   Oh but go ahead, carry on trying to justify your own brand of political violence; keep on driving people to the fringes, that'll work out great for you just like it did in Weimar Germany."

"America was founded by patriarchal white nationalists and had an immigration policy meant to keep it that way until 1965. It is fair to say that the alt right just wants to return to the way America was for most of it's history and the way the founders intended. These days it seems radical to hold the same views as Thomas Jefferson but for most of its history this was indeed the view of the majority of average Americans."
"'The original United States Naturalization Law of March 26, 1790 (1 Stat. 103) provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national citizenship. This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were free white persons of good character.'  I guess America was a nazi state too... Oh gee!"
"Milk, Pepe and the Ok Sign were never symbols of the 'alt-right'.  Milk was adopted by people satirising those who called everything Nazi because some guy on the HWNDU stream started saying someone was a Nazi because he was drinking milk. People started arriving to drink milk as a result, because it's hilarious to think that drinking milk is racist.  The OK symbol was never used as a Nazi symbol, the idea was to attempt to convince some of the idiots in the news to actually report that this was the case and what do you know? They did. It's getting to the point where it's like these people are actively searching for Nazi's and would find them anywhere.  Pepe is a meme, some alt-right people have made Pepe memes, sure, but the vast majority of pepe memes weren't. Even those of pepe in Nazi outfits aren't necessarily signalling others with those sympathies but instead might be laughing at them.   This is getting to red scare levels, actual fascists are such an astonishingly small part of the population and yet some people are demanding them we identify them where ever we can."

"Why would you think you have any credibility talking about the alt right? You're fooling no one dressing like a girl. To shamelessly put your mental issues/identity problems on display like that sends up a big red flag that you have no respect for biology, and that you can't be trusted to talk objectively about a movement of people who will not entertain your delusions."
"One of the major points I'm thinking about here is the error that white supremacists keep promoting of 'one white culture'. Actually , whites are diverse from each other across geographic locations. I as a white person am not a carbon copy of other whites from Seattle, London, The Prague, Melbourne, or the couple next door. To insist otherwise is to engage in self deception. Besides, in the 6 years I lived abroad, I found that what unites us as human beings is deeper than race, religion, food, or clothes. It's in our need for meaning, a roof over our head, opportunities to improve ourselves, respect, and harmony."

"Progressives don't think everyone else is a fascist because they are paranoid. They think everyone else is a fascist because it gives them an excuse to hate anyone that they want, to act out in anti-social ways, and to proclaim it to be some form of moral virtue. They see hate-filled bigots everywhere because, like the  Neo-Nazis and KKK members they like to obsess about, they need some target that justifies the anger and self-pity that fills their own hearts. The problem is that the world just doesn't contain enough Nazis and KKK members to justify all of the hate (damn you Dwight Eisenhower and the Civil Rights Act), so we need to broaden the definition of fascist and racist to include all of those Centrists and 4chan trolls. Otherwise, where is a Progressive's sense of moral superiority (or even adequacy) suppose to come from?"
"'European heritage involves buying other human beings as property' Yes, as with everyone else. Except Europeans abolished slavery worldwide. The only reason this dumb fuck thinks slavery is wrong is because of his European heritage.  The Communist Utopia of Russia, China, Cambodia etc. all reduced human beings to slavery to the state, and even direct slave labor in re-education camps,  yet this dumb shit cannot see the incredible hypocrisy."

"'Defending white identity from relentless anti-white attacks = massacring non-whites, you know just like the Vikings did' This is his basic argument. There is no way for a white person to have pride in his heritage or defend his people without being an evil Nazi who is going to kill everyone. This is a kind of extremist thinking.   Ultimately his entire argument is 'If you are not with us you are against us' 'If white people stand up for themselves it will lead to genocide.'.  Meanwhile, he 'dog whistles' communism which killed more human beings in the last 100 years than all other ideological wars in the history of humanity combined."

"'Righties, get out of the hate group, and as for Lefties, Nazdarovie comrades' A communist calling fascists a hate group. Communism killed 100 million people. 10 times more than fascism. It is a much more hateful ideology. In fact, you bourgeois middle class white college kids would be the first to be sent to the gulags 'comrade'."
"I guess you can say I'm a 'centrist', even though I don't identify with such a label. While I understand your sentiments, I can't see myself going on paranoid witch hunts. Seeing many people as potential fascists is a bit stressful. I believe the important thing to do is voice your opinion as to why racial nationalism is wrong. Address their core beliefs and make them question it instead of focusing on a label to give them. It's the ideology you should be after, not the people(there are exceptions to this though).  I'm also an advocate of free speech and I found your point about their end goal being exclusionary to non-white people interesting. If we allow their movement to take hold, would they allow free speech to those who disagree with them, especially to non-white people? We don't know for sure but I'd say it's highly probable for them to dismiss disagreements. Perhaps they would allow free speech but they won't listen to disagreements. Just take a look at their reactions to anyone who disagree with race realism.  I'd say the answer to this is to be subtle yourself. Don't immediately challenge them if you happen to encounter them. Have a discourse and get them to question their beliefs. Ask about their end goal and how will their utopia sustain itself under such an ideology. Are non-white people welcomed? If not, how will you go about removing them and who will finance this? I'm sure if you get them to challenge the foundation of their beliefs, white nationalism will seem more and more like an emotional reactionary response with no real practical plan in America at least.  Although I don't agree with everything you've said, I still appreciate your video. Keep it up Contra!"

"Be a fag transvestite degenerate, and asks: 'What it is that is attracting people towards fascism.' Maybe the hard-left road that the whole society turned out too, forced by the privately owned part of the super-structure: Colleges, Media, Entertainment and Art. No one asked for multiculturalism, but it was pushed down, from top to bottom, for decades, unmaking one of the most conservative societies that FOUGHT and KILLED the NAZIS, until they themselves believed they WERE THE NAZIS.  Also fascism is not mandatory anti-jewish, western or even white.  You are an idiot, and don't know what you are talking about."

"He is correct in saying the Far Right wants a white ethno-state that will eventually repress non-whites.   But let us look at what YOU want. The Far Left wants a revolution and violent overthrow of the oppressor (the evil religious white male patriarchy) by the oppressed (A coalition of Marxists, Anarchists, Feminists, Black Nationalists, Hispanic Nationalists, Homosexuals, Trannies, LGBTQ+, Latinx, Bronies, Furries, Wormkin etc.) and the oppressive establishment of an egalitarian utopia which can never exist and has led to the death of 100 million people."
"what the fuk is this thing?"
"Why so many dislikes"
"So boiled down, if you're not a Globalist you are a Fascist?  You know they banned the Dukes of Hazzard because they had a rebel flag on their car, right?  I wonder how many people turned Alt-Right simply over that? The more people chase the annihilation of statues and symbols that have spiritual significance or are cherished by the average person, the more the average person needs to join the force protecting them. So advocating for the destruction of such things actually works to further fascist goals, as statues and symbols hold different significance to different people. Sure, a lot of folks see the Confederate Flag as being a symbol of White Dominance, but many others just see it as an identity symbol. Remember the Southern rappers saying, 'That's my flag, it's about my identity as a Southerner'... They weren't crypto-fascists, they stated their reasons openly.  Even the Dukes of Hazzard themselves were using it for it's 'Rebel' qualities, being as the whole show was about fooling law enforcement. They were rebellious - the Confederacy was a Rebellion. Just as there have been calls from Al Sharpton to get rid of statues of the Founding Fathers beacuse they owned slaves. Most people do not water the Founding Fathers down to simply slave-owning, for a start they founded a Nation, rebelling against an Empire. So for many the Founding Fathers stand for 'Freedom and Independence' - as did the Dukes of Hazzard. So yeah advocating for Year Zero style destruction of cultural identity is the quickest and surest way to help the fascists grow in numbers - and as such is the quickest way to wind up being murdered for being different. If you don't have tolerance for other people and what they cherish, they won't have tolerance for you and yours."

"'We must limit their right to recruit by taking away their free speech'. Free speech is precisely the RIGHT TO RECRUIT. That is exactly what you are doing in this video. If you support taking someones else's free speech you are also supporting someone else taking yours. Keep abusing the Far Right and denying them their rights and eventually they will come into power and take away YOUR right to free speech.   This person is nothing more than an articulate fool in a dress."
"This man is equating fascism to white supremacy/nationalism. That is a political epithet, they are not the same thing and never will be. This is pure far left propaganda, though fans of this person will obviously have a confirmation bias and continue thinking the things in this video are true."
"Well done. I prefer the more direct approach when dealing with this shitheads, but your video might actually work for some of the less extreme ones."
"Basically his premise is: any liberal, centrist or conservative position is just a watered down version of manipulative Alt-Right Fascism. One big slippery slope argument wherein the only authentic position is Radical Leftist identity politics."
"We want an ethnostate just like Asians, blacks and Indus. Is that too much to ask ?  Also, the white genocide is very real. It has a name : cultural marxism. You disagree with the alt right/light because you're obviously a degenerate queer... 40% suicide rate isn't a healthy society choice."
"This fool denies the existence of white culture and labels any desire to preserve it an 'attack on non-whites'. Basically he accepts the white nationalists premise that identity politics are a zero sum game but simply sides against whites."

"LOL he criticizes the term 'Alt Left' as a political label meant to shift 'acceptable discourse' to the Right. That is precisely what the Left has been doing for the last 70 years with the word 'Nazi'. He does this directly at 17:40 saying a Trump hat is really a Nazi hat. This kind of rhetoric leads to people in Trump hats being violently attacked.   What a bunch of hypocrites. All of his criticism can literally be applied to his own group. In fact, the Alt Right is simply the mirror reflection and reaction to the Alt Left."
"LOL, what a bunch of bullshit.   'You can't equivocate fascist violence and anti-fascist violence'. This is pure leftist political bias. The far left believes labeling anyone fascist gives you the moral authority to use violence and shut down free speech. Antifa (Marxist Communist Anarchist Radicals) are no better than Nazis (who only number in a few thousand in the entire US). In fact they are mirror images of each other. The Far Left giving rise to a Far Right reaction.  'Falsely equivocate white nationalism and black civil rights' Sure, label the reaction against anti-white bias 'white nationalism' and say whites civil rights are less important or authentic than black civil rights. This is anti-white bias."

If you think their are just millions of americans just itching to become fascists if they hear the propaganda then you are dumb. I thought you were a philosopher. People hate fascist but you allowed them to cover it in anerican patriotism and paint you as anti patriots and you wonder why this is happening.  You wave the flag and stand for free speech. Dont be afraid. And give fascists as big of a megaphone as they want. Yo challange teir ideas and destroy them. Fascists ideas fall apart when pushec. Then they get violent. Then police take care of it  But we see you and antifa getting violent. Thats stupid, now they can claim to be victims"

"Contra your videos are made really well. They're great and enjoyable! One of the problems with what your saying is a lot of these memes and beliefs are pretty normal throughout the right. They are using our symbols or appropriated it. They could use ANY symbol so why take those symbols on any merit? Those people are not all fascists. I know, I'm a right libertarian bi brown male. I go through groups of right wingers all the time IRL and online. For example, Pepe and kekistan may be used by fascists but most of the right and some center leftists use it too. It's like a counter culture symbol. It sticks it to the left. You don't think the left scares these groups (and me)? The left is powerful. The symbols are not the problem, the beliefs are. I agree, you have to talk to these people, what else are you supposed to do?"

Incredibly disingenuous badphilosopher tries to point the same talking points that centrists use against SJWS (or what is now, you're constantly changing your terminology to evade WOKE fascist detectors) at the alt right. You're both the absolute same, constantly trying to vilify anyone not following your herd of stupidity."
"I just want to say that if you're not looking too hard at the tiny channel icon, the goggles kind of look like eyes which makes the person kind of look like a muppet, until you click on it and it's not. Also, great video."
"Great video, as always! I just wanted to add that a huge problem with both-sides-ism is that it not only equates violent intolerance against fascism with violent intolerance by fascism, but also vocal, NON-violent intolerance against fascism with the vocal, non-violent intolerance by fascism. This is advantageous to fascists for all of the reasons you mentioned, but also because it precludes action by the State and centrists who swear by tolerance at all costs. After all, a tolerant government doesn't have the right to silence people who haven't yet done anything wrong. When even peaceful or state-sanctioned intolerance is vilified, the only other courses of action are tolerance or violent intolerance. Fascists don't come out to play unless it's a guaranteed no-lose scenario."
"You people are retarded."

"thing is these days everyone uses these tactics. it's just the occult... lying on a meta level"
"I agree with pretty much everything in this video except the 'They do not have a right to a megaphone' line. Because that's true, but the sentiment of that is kinda dangerous to me. First off, the obvious point is that old standard of 'if you can silence the fascist, you can silence anyone' and while 1984 is the worst case scenario, it's still possible. You have to be careful when you shut down fascist speaking events, because next people could be shutting down a Women's March or a Black Lives Matter rally on the same logic. The second, and arguably more important point, is that if you force their ideas *out* of the public sphere, you're going to build an underground fascist movement. Make no mistake, just because you silence them in public does not mean you will silence them online or in smaller settings. And an underground movement without the scrutiny of the public eye to call it out for what it is can be even more dangerous than public fascism in the long run. Other than that, and a few minor points that aren't worth mentioning, i agreed with everything in this video! Good job!"

"African tribes also sold human beings as property and established their own traditions, history, ethnic homelands and tribal identities,  so according to this guys reasoning they must all be fascist.

"This is just more of the same: if someone doesn't buy into identity politics, call them a Nazi or, now, a fascist.  Your definition, or rather your attempt to redefine what fascism is, fails.  Fascism is simply actions taken to exert control over others.  Like making laws forcing people to 'use your preferred pronoun'.  It's laughable to hear people who live to label people like 'cis white male' and claim that 'cultural appropriation' is a thing, try to re-define words to suit their narrative.  100 percent bullshit.  A split screen with the Brown Shirts on one side and Antifa on the other - no differences."
"What kind of magic is this? This is the 3rd time I have watched this video and I want to watch it again. I believed that the takeover of the alt-right was innevitable at this point but apparently there are things changing. Hopefully, people that have been sucked into the alt-right vacuum soon realize that it's just tempting to blame migrants and deny any sort of globalisation when it means to give up just a little bit of your own self. But still I don't believe that any of them is at fault for giving in to such a cruel but simplistic ideology."
"Authentic fascism is not based on'race' or on the biological particularities inherent in each being.  On the contrary, you are an error of nature. You do not look like anything.

"wtf are you serious? this is sort of sad tbh. fascism is an ideology, national socialism.  racism is inherent to it just as much as it is communism (socialism for pussies) meaning it isn't, unless starving is inherent to communism under the logic anything that happens is the ideologies fault. there were muslims nazis. read a fucking book. it's about more about cultural hegemony ( which applies to the left) & how people should act for the state filling it in for religion for progress of the state. hence, why brownshirts felt  justified to beat the shit out of discerners (antifa). private companies only being allowed to function if their values coincide with the state. it's much more about the collective being stronger (look up the root of the word) than the individual and killing the discerners (what youd be if trump was really a fascist). maybe take a step further and realize the root of the philosophy that created it and how the tactics are actually being implemented today. this is what a 2nd grader who just heard donald trump was a fascist on CNN & wants to suck off brian stelter would think."
"This stupid mannly bitch thinka fascism (italy) is the same as national socialism (germany). What the video is talking about is national socialism and not fascism, LEARN TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE!"
"My Polish Catholic boss voted for Trump and pretty much marinates in Faux Newz all day/night. He's also gone for the NRA big time, and while the NRA has a valid reason to exist they've gone really fashy lately. The guys Mexican-American wife falls short of this but still always has a nasty thing on tap to say about 'immigrants' and those people in Oakland who will use the new BART stop to go right to her house and rob it. Their kids .... don't get them started on 'the Rothchilds'. Plenty of casual racism/antisemitism from them and they're younger than me.   Conclusion: We're fucking doomed. But I joined the DSA a week ago and one of my heroes is Vitaly Zaitsev and I will go down fighting."
"I love you contra 💕"
"That's the content I wanna see on youtube !! keep up the work comrade"
"I have a question- and forgive me if this is ignorant or wrong, but I genuinely might not understand something here. Weren't the Nazis socialists [left of the political spectrum]? If so- why is the right using nazi symbolism/strategy? Thank you so much btw for making this video. It's very difficult navigating these things and *truly* understanding what's going on. It's so easy to be the centrist they want to take advantage of- especially when you have compassion and empathy."
"this video scares me so much. i can't believe it's taken us (the left) so long to realise most of this. but hey, we'll still win in the end"

"Fuck off Antifa. YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO GENOCIDE WHITE PEOPLE. And that's a promise. Communism died 50 years ago."
"21:45 So I take this comment in really bad Russian was 'ironic' joke, but it is kinda hypocritical to make such comments in a video where you call out even 'ironic fascism' as real hidden fascism, considering how communist regimes killed way more people than fascists that is pretty bad sign."
"It makes me more sad than it should that I ran into financial trouble the month before you made one of my new favourite videos on youtube. I did enjoy seeing my name in the credits once tho, lol."
"lately I've seen a pattern among these neo-nazis, it's not new, but it is becoming more explicit: they're obsessed with white guilt, not surprising when your identity is related with something so broad and that thing is also related with so many horrid acts in history. but because of it they can be easily triggered by pushing their buttons around the topic. for instance they have a raging hard on about whitewashing slavery by blaming tribal wars for slavery and not the poor whities who just couldn't say no to a bargain (I guess). and this is a way to rat them out."
"'but of course it was unintentional it was the ACLU'.. don't be so sure about that"

"This was very educational. Thank you for making it. Your videos are all made with such care and art and are so freaking enlightening. I also think you are GREAT. ❤️"
"Ironically, it's Dave Rubin's interviews with some of those people that have made me more suspicious of them. When allowed to talk freely, they can't help to reveal some uncomfortable ideas they hold. With Lauren Southern, for example, all I've seen of her before was videos where she trolls select feminist protesters or local Canadian authorities, which is while, I understand, questionable, never quite crossed the line for me, and I never felt like checking her other videos. But on Rubin's Report she's basically gone through the whole checklist from this video, down to arguing that Richard Spencer is not a white supremacist, but some made up term that means the same thing. Contra, Shaun, Hbomberguy and many others do a great job debating certain far-right personalities without their direct involvement, and that wouldn't be possible if those people couldn't speak their piece on youtube or twitter. If they were only allowed to convene on the internet's darker, less transparent sites, 'normies' wouldn't even know the problem existed. Non-internet savvy people still don't. Basically, I'm not sure that complete deplatforming is necessary good. I live in a country where displaying any nazi symbols publicly (outside of historical context), including some pretty obscure ones, is outright illegal. Inflammatory speech against specific ethnicities or religions is also a criminal offence. While on the surface level I feel very good about it, I also think that because people don't understand what ideas are associated with nazism, it creates a more fertile ground for anti-immigration sentiments, everyday racism, homophobia, etc. Everyone knows and very strongly holds that nazis are bad, but they are literally unable to contextualise their own beliefs to see how dangerously close they are to those of people they unconditionally despise. All this is based on my own experience debating people I know, of course, so I may be mistaken about the bigger picture, still, hate to say that, but maybe on that particular issue the truth is, ugh, in the middle."
"jesus christ what an ugly trans freak"
"You rekt the alt right."
"I can only wonder what it must be like in your head as you catch all these dog whistles. Anyway, your definition of fascist only includes neo-nazis. And don't forget Antifa uses fascist tactics. Also perhaps allowing a white nationalist to voice their ideas on your platform could be potentially harmful, but debating them in a calm and respectful manner and not just shutting them down might be more effective. A lot of these people feel this way because of identity politics and being demonised for being white. If they see seemingly reasonable white nationalists being refused a platform, they might feel this society is against them (because, you know, 'fuck all white people!' is an acceptable thing to say in our society...) creating more racists."
"I wish I had more confidence in my ability to argue politics with my friends (who definitely seem like internet shitlord) without actually losing them (because I do actually like them and don't have many others). Any ideas, random internet folk?"
"I don't buy the deplatforming argument. If you just drive facists underground it will just get worse and worse"
"Interesting video - subbed! Excuse the long comment, but I was finding it hard to actually find someone from the left wing side of things who both actively argues their position and allows comments.  I'd use Shaun as a good example of another one I've found - esp his calmly argued dissection of one of Sargon's videos.  As someone looking from the outside in, the internet is full of negative examples of Antifa and BLM, which really don't paint either group's actions in a good light (regardless of the ideals on which they are based).  This is why I deliberately looked for the counter-view to that, as I don't like seeing just one side of an argument (you talk about the need to question your assumptions...).    On that note, I'd agree with a lot of your points and I'm glad you make the distinction that just because Nazis (of whatever flavour) have adopted the 'OK' sign etc, doesn't mean that everyone that uses it is a covert white-supremacist, because it does seem to be a 'thing' where anyone making an OK sign in any context now is suspected.  However, seeing someone do it in the middle of a protest and then talking about 'drinking his milk today'...  I get your point!  However, one thing that did strike me though, is that you draw an equivalence between the way Antifa has profiled and attacked people as fascists being no different to the way elements of the Police in America view black people etc, but this IMO doesn't justify those actions. The argument that because the other side do it makes it OK is not a strong one - precisely because it directly reinforces the good point you make about Camaraderie being used to draw people to the far-right.  You make the point about centrists needing to argue, debate, understand, engage and oppose fascism, but this is very difficult to achieve with someone who has just been called a fascist and a Nazi.  As said, a view from an outsider, who's also not an American..."
"How is this different from McCarthyism?"
"Great video!'"
"Sanity, it's what I feel connected to after every Contrapoints video."
"I will definitely admit the 'refugee crisis' in my new country of Sweden felt worrying due to the huge influx of anti-refugee sentiments online. Videos like yours help bring me back to reality. You're definitely the best anti-fascist Youtube channel in my opinion. Ive become a patron, not a lot of money but I hope it helps. Keep up the good work!"
"i'd call my self an Anti-Facist and whenever somebody calls me out on my shit, i just call them a Nazi or similar bad-sounding word. have fun being extinct. nature's not progressive the way you think it is. nice hair btw..."
"Extremely minor quibble: Sargon isn't a centrist. He supported Trump and Le Pen, and the Tories - still right wing, but less outright fascist - and recently cited the founder of the Rand institute, giving the impression that he actually engaged with their work (more so than Sargon usually engages with a source anyway) .  Otherwise, this is definitely one of your best videos, and I'm going to link it everywhere"

"great job. Thanks ContraPoints.   Fox News has been conditioning its audience to accept fascism throughout its existence. I'm in Georgia surrounded by them. I was born in this area, but I'm going to have to leave home before the witch hunts begin because I'm an anti-fascist white guy :S"
"Superb video. You're doing great work by actually trying to reach out to people with very different, even opposing views. Just one tip for future reference- Russians don't toast with 'na zdrovye.'"
"If anyone wants to provide someone they know any actual proof of mainstream politicians using facist and neo-Nazi dogwhistles, I always show this video of British politician Nick Griffin speaking in the US to a group of KKK and white supremacists, including David Duke. He talks about how there's 'a difference between selling out your ideas and selling your ideas', and to use words like 'freedom, identity' instead of 'racial purity'. The BNP became moderately popular in the UK in the wake of the financial crash of 08, and actually held some seats in the European Parliament, but luckily they're all but forgotten about now. Mandatory viewing imo, really shows how easy it is for facists to slip into the mainstream without being identified as such by people who aren't savvy to their methods.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04QolIvfQEw&bpctr=1504341207"
"So anyway I reported your video for supporting terrorism. Sorry but I don't think it's morally acceptable to put a target on the back of every white person with any semblance of conservative values. Could you please make a video disavowing violence toward all people? That would be a good way to gain some well deserved respect."
"ehh, i think a better name for this video would be 'how to go on a paranoia driven witch hunt'."
"This is quite possibly your best video ever."
"You know, from my experience of online leftist communities, I'd hardly put my faith in their ability to spot a fascists, given their dogmatic and highly ideological nature, a good number of non-fascists end up getting mis-labelled. Nor are centrists as clueless as you think. If anything, they're the ones who tend to better see things as they are, compared to the more extreme groups."
"Nothing of your three points is directly related to fascism... So I guess Japan in WW2 were not fascist cause they were asian... Cool story bro"
"This is a REALLY great video. I’ve been resistant to the things being argued for a long time, it’s all just seemed like paranoid gobbledygook, but you present it in such a clear and nonjudgemental way that I feel like I’m getting it. It IS important for people like me to remember that SOME people engage in this behaviour with insidious intentions. Thank you for making solid points while drawing a clear distinction between actual dog whistling nazis and innocent memers, and all without being a “no fun allowed” buzzkill. I feel like a lot of people who bring up these sort of points do so in an alienating way that preaches to the choir and doesn’t make a clear distinction between actions that are insidious and those that are oblivious - and that distinction is absolutely KEY as to why these tactics are dangerous in the first place. A bunch of Nazis sending each other emojis seems like an inconsequential circle jerk, but it’s the oblivious people who give them the benefit of the doubt that make it a problem. And if those two groups are lumped in together, with oblivious centrists feeling like they’re being called Nazis and being told that using emojis is racist, it only exacerbates the issue of legitimate dog whistling being dismissed as innocent. Which leads to actual consequences such as giving fascism an inch where they’ll take a yard, or even getting suckered in by them.  That ChrisRayGun tweet at 18:25 was a big one that, at the time, just made me think the lefties moaning about “using nazi talking points” were absolute lunatics. It seemed like a case of “fascists drink water, so water is fascist,” and like people were declaring huge swathes of discussion entirely off limits for no tangible reason. But now, even if I think the general reaction was over the top and counter-productive, I much better understand where it was coming from.  While discussing people who too often give others the benefit of the doubt, this video refreshingly gives us the benefit of the doubt that any association with fascist arguments or dog whistles is inadvertent. It speaks the language of those it’s trying to reach. What I think is really effective is that at no point does there feel like an attempt to talk me out of my views or shame me for them, which is often the tone of videos discussing these issues. Everything is argued with the assumption that I’ll hold onto my views, so I’m just being armed with knowledge against a common enemy. A condom against fascism in a world of abstinence-only education.  tl;dr gud bideo, ty for spoon feeding me and holding my hand through the field of nazi memes, mommy."
"Some of this was very interesting. I do believe that fascists are making the most of this situation, but why would you support Antifa? They're just creating very compelling content for the Alt Right. Only once I've seen them protest actual Nazis. https://youtu.be/9qKCl9NL1Cg?t=15s  https://youtu.be/8RFWnqMfZEc?t=5s If I were alt right, I would become a comrade because they're so unappealing to wider audience. Why should people tolerate Antifa's attacks on regular people and free speech? Ooops! There's that word. Also, why wouldn't you debate them?"
"You can never be fast enough to point out that fascists do not believe in freedom of speech, they kill their political opponents to silence them. They did it en-masse in Nazi Germany and they do it today. Fascists are the biggest threat to freedom of speech. Always punch a Nazi."
"You should learn the difference between fascism,national socialism and the alt right before making a video.There were fascist movements in Africa and South America as well,so fascism does not include the white homeland thing,but only the nationalism part.Fascism is about creating a country that is home to only one people\nation,etc..The national socialist ideology included antisemitism and the belief that the Aryan race exists and that the German peoples are Aryan peoples.Come on."
"I had only one problem with this video that was the term Western Civilization being downgraded to a Neo Nazi slogan in example one. After watching this video, I get the feeling that Western Civilization is totally evil, that's BS. Basically I see little difference between the far left or the far right, I do believe they should be allowed to demonstrate all they wish, in order to show all Americans how totally degenerate they both truly are.  Lately it feels as though Western Civilization has become an evil word, it must be remembered it has only been Western Civilization that has constantly fought Racism and bigotry, and has tried to spread the idea across the globe, even though it is a work in progress in Western Civilization. There is no Asian Culture or African Culture or anyother Culture leading the fight against Racism and Bigotry, they only follow Western Civilization or remain as they are.  One last thing, when this channel starts putting out some criticisms of ANTIFA and other leftest organizations that  refuse to hear opposing opinions and yes they do use violence to accomplish this, then I might subscribe although I doubt it."
"Instead of having one person like Joe McCarthy, we have an entire generation of Joe McCarthys.  The ideas of the left which used to be an asset have now become a liability.   Between the horrible selfish Republicans who don't want healthcare for people and the intolerant left with fake tolerance we have a society that really needs some critical thinking skills and a good self assessment of what they are doing.   The left has become the radical emotional threat to everyone who doesn't share their world view.  Academia has become the brainwashing battleground with a leftist echo chamber while Wall street is corrupt and selfish and are the whores of western society.   The enemies of the western world just have to wait for it to collapse, in the end the west will have destroyed themselves with their own lusts, greed, and selfish desires.   The end isn't too far off, just keep on keeping on."
"2. *Some guy talking about culture* You: 'YOU HATE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS'  And people take this 'educational video' serious lmao."
"thats a dude"
"Can you at least start your video off with the correct descriptions of fascism, and not just made up definitions you wish it meant?"
"why you have lipstick on ?"
"20:57 You lost me on this one. As one of the people who these ideas are existentially dangerous to, I think it is an imperative to expose fascist ideas for what they are, just like you've done here. This can take the form of a video response, general comments, or live debates, but it is something that must occur. Once you peel off the layers, their ideas are horrid. People would not accept them as their own if they knew what they truly meant."
"oh my god fascist contra is legitimately nightmare fuel"
"who is confused....like you are  a person to take advice from...."
"This video gave me aids. Go drink bleach you degenerate."
"Why wouldn´t it be ok for white people that don´t like multikulturalism have a land for themselves? I don´t understand that, could someone please explain that to me?  I have to say that here in Europe we are having a really tough time, and i don´t think it is fair for people that don´t want this to happen to our countries, shouldn´t be forced to take part in it.   Don´t you agree?"
"thats a fuckin dude? LOL you fucks are retarded"
"If heard the free speech argument so many times,  but I still don't get it. I've you can you fascist policy to deny their free speech, why can't you use the same logic to ban Linda Sarsour and Jeremy Corbin?"
"14:14 I once encountered an alt-righter that got triggered by someone's use of Kekistan memes. They claimed it undermined their 'legitimate struggle'."
"This is a fucking frightening video. It's basically 'reds under the bed' rhetoric pointed at 'fascists' (but we're really talking about white nationalists, see dictionary definition of fascism) who we can recognize as anyone that claims to be a nazi or that claims not to be a nazi 'because that's just what a nazi would say' - do you not see the danger in that?  This, what I can only describe as propaganda, seems to me to be perfectly suited to the Stalinist era.  Yes there is a problem, but you're the ones pouring fuel on the fire."
"Dark Mother bless you, Contra."
"Side-point: Saying their points don't have value will hurt you when their plans work. It's not that one side will work and the other wont, both could work. It's about why one side is better. For many they like their side because it'll work AND they get to tear down those who have shit on them / those who have said their problems aren't priority so it's necessary to shit on them. Arguing that they're morons is false and wont convince them of anything. We need to emphasis that their plans are valid but will cause much suffering AND there is an alternative that will actually be best for everyone but will take longer."
"You know Antifa was recognized as a Domestic Terrorist by the state of New Jersey and the Department of Homeland Security."
"Identitarian, National Socialist, Fascist...you keep saying all these words as if they're bad things..."
"Of course you are an evil, racist, fascist Nazi if you have any objections to massive immigration or left-leaning race or gender theory. There are no environmental, economic, security, practical, etc. considerations to disagreeing on this. Just bow down and agree with the socially dominant dogma. Leftists often talk about fascist 'gaslighting,' even though they do the exact same thing by calling you a Nazi, fascist, etc. for even slight disagreements and have large institutional support in politics, education and popular culture."
"Even though you have some points, you overall really come off as highly unhinged, deranged and severly paranoid. And by the tone of that video, even you seem to know it to a degree"
"Hey,  I'm generally someone not on the side of Antifa, in particular because I value free speech, yes even for people who don't care about it themselves, and advocate for putting me in an oven or deporting me to Israel. But I wanted to say thank you for this. I was familiar with a lot of this already, but it gives me a bit more insight into your mindset. I've long observed paranoia on the left side, but now I can empathize with you. You study covert fascist tactics for long enough, of course you're gonna get gaslit and go a little crazy! I appreciate your self-awareness, and I will try to be more understanding going forward.  I still think your side has a serious blind spot. You're failing to address the fact that some of the 'covert talking points' that fascists use, and which others pick up on, may in fact be things that people are already concerned with. Pardon me for sounding like a crypto-fascist, but supposing you take as a given that people tend to prefer their own racial group (note: I find it distasteful myself, I think it's collectivist in a bad sense), and you make your peace with the fact that people are just going to be that way. Indeed, you should think that this would apply to white people as much as to others. And, indeed, at the moment it at least appears to be socially unacceptable for whites, but not for others. Again, this is a talking point that _normal people can relate to_ , even if it's not socially acceptable to express. Why do you suppose this is? Perhaps because it's a _reasonable talking point_ (even if you personally find it distasteful). Why is it a fascist tactic? Because _fascists are the only ones selling it_ .  So long as you are in denial of this, you will lose ground to the fascists. So what I would put forth for consideration to you anti-fascist activists, is swallow a bitter pill, and start selling your own version of these positions. Or at least an acknowledgement of the needs of the people expressing them, (but not in a condescending 'check your privilege' sort of way).  'Of course you can like your race and culture, so long as you get along with and respect everyone. You don't need to be alt-right for that. The alt-right are trying to trick you into thinking that normal people don't care about white people.' But then, say it _loud and clear_ , even if it seems stupid or obvious to you. 'Of course we denounce anti-white vindictive violence from [scary fringe group]. You denounce violence against minorities too, don't you? So we agree. We don't need those fascists.' And say it _loud and clear_ , even if it seems stupid or obvious to you. You talk about dog whistles, right? Failure to make these points _loud and clear_ appear to some as an anti-white dog whistle.  Think about the carrot and stick. You acknowledge that it appears to us at times that lefties will call anyone a Nazi, because sometimes you go a little overboard. (Again, I greatly appreciate the self-awareness there.) This leads you to being all stick and no carrot. There's pushing people away for having any hint of fascistic tendencies in their talking points. There's no rewarding people for rejecting outright fascism. You may be pushing them toward fascism.  Think about a forest fire vs a pot that's boiling over. It seems the left thinks that fascism is like a forest fire, and perhaps that bad economic times are like a drought, making the fire easier to spread. We need only to contain the fire, put it out as much as we can, wait for rain, and we'll live another day. And what I'm telling you is that in some sense fascism is more like a pot that's boiling over. By denying a platform, by intimidating, by shaming, by trying to stop the message from getting out, you're just plugging holes where steam wants to escape. Until one day it'll be beyond your control and it'll explode (and you'll conclude you just didn't resist hard enough). Instead what you should be doing is finding ways to let the steam out in controlled ways that are less destructive.  And by the way, this is why it's important to _listen_ to the fascists, to find out what it is they're selling, so you can undercut them in the marketplace of ideas.  My two cents. I haven't had much chance approaching people on the left with this perspective so I'm curious about counter arguments."
"I dont think a mentally ill person should tell anyone who is and who isnt a fascist"
"this is some paranoid bullshit."
"This is going to hurt innocent people. I hope it goes nowhere. I'm not a fascist, not an ethno nationalist, not anything along these lines. I'm not anything specific. I don't want to have anything that fascists want...yet somehow I get called a fascist on a regular basis all because my opinions on certain subjects differ from people that lean far to the left. If I try to back myself up I just get told that I'm lying just as you do in this video (even if in a lot of the cases you mention it's true). This is insane and dishonest. It creates bigger enemies and divides us even further. I respect you, but I disagree with this video."
"10:45 I haven't seen many alt-righters using the milk emoji, but I do know that non-social justice types occasionally pay homage to the time that a BLM supporter made the hilarious claim that milk was a symbol of white supremacy, so I wouldn't be surprised if ethno-nationalists eventually picked it up like they did when Pepe the Frog got labeled as a hate symbol by the ADL. (That was a really bad move on their part...) However, I have no idea why the OK symbol would be an alt-right symbol. I use it all the time. I have no idea what connection it has to anything alt-right. If someone could fill me in on that, that would be great."
"Here's some thoughts on the video so far.  I have to honest in saying that you need to put more depth into nuances that go on.  I'm denying what you are saying but rather pointing that you can't painting people that show what you describe as cloacked Nazi's or Fascists.  Of course, a smart fascist will deny that they are a fascist but so would someone that is in the center or holds some other ideology say that they are not a fascist.  It's kind of like the problem with alcoholics.  If you say, no I'm not an alcoholic than you assume I'm an alcoholic that in denial about their alcoholism.  If I say I was, than you take me at my word.  You can't win in such a situation if you rarely drink and have no particular desire or need to drink (maybe it's not a big deal for you).  In other words, maybe, in reality, you are not an alcoholic.  Now this is important when talking about fascism and if you falsely accuse someone of being a fascist and they aren't, it can blow up in your face by alienating the person or even worse.  With things like immigration, it's possible to be against some types of immigration but not others.  For example, you may be against immigration because a citizen (or maybe legal resident) may be able to take a particular job.  In immigration policy, citizens (and sometimes, legal residents) are legally favored.  In an addition, an uneducated immigrant may be able to function in the new society because they speak the language.  And yes, sometimes, behaviors that are condoned in some societies are unacceptable here (such as raping women).  And another part is that people such as criminals and terrorists in some lands may very due the same behavior here.  So if a person spent ten years for strangling a woman in Canada, the US is well within it's rights to say, that's unacceptable and turn this person away at the border.  Now sometimes, immigration is appropriate and such immigrants can be a valuable asset as some jobs are not easily filled by US Citizens.  if you screen them properly and that includes the educated.   Some failures with the vetting educated immigrants include Michael Swango  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Swango and Jayant Patel - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayant_Patel (the Wikipedia articles explain those cases extremely well).  And here's another thought, sometimes, you can't tell the difference between a REAL and a parody as things often can one meaning (like the inkblots on the Rorschach Test) and what thus, what an artist intends may not be what comes across.  'Born in the USA' is mistakenly  thought of as a patriotic song while it's really written about a blighted patriotism and poor treatment of Vietnam Vets.  The song 'Fight for your Right to Party' was written a parody of a party but was interpreted as a party song.  I can argue that similar thing happened with Murdoch Murdoch as that series appeared to me to a parody of some extreme positions that people YouTube take (albeit, in a dark humor that some people find offensive)."
"I love you contra"
"Hi, im a fascists, bye"
"Most fascists I've seen openly admit that they're alt-right, though they claim to disavow fascism. All you have to do is press them on race issues and they will open up. Of course, they won't claim to be white supremacists, and they won't openly suggest deporting or genociding all non-whites, but they will express a clear value for racial identity and nationalism. I say this because more than once, I've been called a fascist even though I'm mixed race, in favor of open borders, and in favor of all things consensual. Why? Because I believe that free market capitalism is a theoretically great system that should be implemented somewhere so we can hopefully prove that freedom is nothing to be scared of. But then some libsoc will jump in and say 'but Mises was a fascist', as though anything about the ideas he had regarding the market were fascist, when in reality none of them are. He just happened to be appointed by a fascist, meaning he had no choice but to give them his economic advice (which Austria's fascist dictator didn't even exactly adhere to). Anyways, I don't mean to go off on a tangent. The point is, there is a clear definition of fascism that revolves around extreme nationalism and ethnic identity, and if someone doesn't believe in those things, they're not a fascist."
"I feel bad for your parents, you disgusting abomination"
"I like your videos and generally agree with your priorities Contra, which is why it's extra disappointing to see you propagating black or white thinking in condemning 'both sides rhetoric'. There is nothing contradictory about condemning both the far left and the far right. Both have extremely murderous legacies and both have a small minority in American politics that advocates for the murderous policies they put into action in the past. Not only is there nothing wrong with condemning both, but forcing your audience to choose one over the other is a classic strategy both have used in the past. Hitler and Stalin both presented themselves as the sole alternative each other. This very thing was to a large extent what gave the Nazis their success in the last democratic elections in Weimar Germany. They successfully presented themselves as the only alternative to Bolshevism, and they won. The quickest way to win sympathy for fascists is to allow them to propagate this narrative, and condemning 'both sides rhetoric' does exactly that."
"I agree with your criticisms of the alt right and fascism, I disagree with your offhand criticisms of capitalism."
"Fuck off, tranny."
"The US military has medals in the same shape as the Iron Cross get your dumb shit out of here. And the rest of the crap beyond that point is all Strawman arguments."
"Congratulations on creating the most cursed YouTube thumbnail I have ever seen."

"What a joke. You need to look up a real definition. 'Race? It is a feeling, not a reality. Ninety-five per cent, at least. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today' Mussolini  Also this is a dude right? What a degenerate."
"So apparently denying being a fascist is exactly what a fascist would do, yet you deny being a fascist... rly gets the noggin joggin Also, please learn the difference between alt-right and alt-lite. Those you uncharitably assume are fascists in their denial are actually alt-lite and find the alt-right too scary."
"You realize that everything you've said can be invalidated by the fact that you're a mentally ill degenerate right? Your parents must be so ashamed."
"Great video!!! KEEP IT UP COMRADES!!! ❤️🏴✊🏽"
"Hey, nice video! I wish I could tackle every point in detail but I'm afraid I may lose my sanity if I try. So I'll just say this: It takes three to Tango. I see you pinning part of the blame for the rise of white identitarian movements on liberals and 'centrists' while largely ignoring the role your side has played in this mess. (Well, you did dedicate a whole ten seconds in your 20+ min video to say some leftist are a-holes, so that's something, I guess) But the truth is you're in a lot of ways responsible for this as well.  But I agree in one thing. It's not too late to do something. So sit your condescending ass and listen, because no one wants your flipping 'forgiveness' Ok? Instead, let's try to work together for once. The first thing to do is for you to stop being so 'paranoid' as you put it. If you know the wolf benefits from you crying wolf all the time,  when why do you do it!??? At this rate they'll ruin everything for everyone before you're willing to take a stand and stop surrendering things to them. After that we can both focus on the real issues. No one will be fooled into accepting 'white immigration only' or whatever, if you FOCUS on why these ideas are bad, instead of obsessing over what symbols are in who's usernames and for what reasons...  Peace out."
"OH NO! How dare fascists be against murderers , rapists, and criminals!"
"Do you literally have down syndrome?"
"Yo this was the SHIT bro this video will smoke all these alt right dumbfuckz!!!!"
"This could not be a more needed or timely video. Thank you so much Contra. I'm so happy I came across this channel when I did."
"your videos are amazing, so concise and well put together. keep it up <3"
"This lady is gross looking"
"Yet the left are ok with openly endorsing communism"
"I just notice that I was played GOOOOOOD and by a fucking idiot non the less. I feel stupid.     Ps: I fucking knew that this Lauren chick was a nazi."
"EXCELLENT!  I could listen to her forever."
"Yes, exactly, utmostly unpopular opinions. And they should be defended. Free speech includes people who want to repeal it. Its necessary to defend our rights and be ready to stop and argue against anyone whos against freedom. Anyone. Anytime they try.   But they get to speak."
"A question: Are all Trump supporters/voters fascist?"
"If whites are so destructive and prone to fascism why not isolate those of us who are to our own separate nation? If we have as flawed of a ideology as you say we do why wouldn't we just fail and serve as living proof of the ideology's inability to function? All countries would only benefit in the expansion of 'diversity' by allowing a large portion of whites to emigrate. Don't tell me that Jews should be allowed to have a ethnostate but whites shouldn't. Allowing ourselves to live in a culture of self-hatred is only going to destroy us. Don't you ever wonder why massive corporations (controlled by Jewish executives) try to censor us? Think about all the countries that censor dissenting opinions-- are they the 'good guys'?"
"I think you need to spend more time with non-white people."
"I will attempt to debunk your video. Fascists are open about being fascists. White supremacists are open about being white supremacists. There is not an enormous crypto-gang of Hitler loving Americans. It is dangerous for you to argue denouncing people for their honesty and associating culture and heritage adoration with a quest for supremacy. It is disgusting to have created this in my honest opinion because it endorses violence and anger and intimidation against people who have nothing to do with this ideology you are accusing a nation of harboring because of 700 white supremacists and neo nazis having a march... Way to propagate political mistruths."
"I wish this was smarter"
"There's many problems with this video. For one, you take three basic concepts and define it as 'Fascism'. This is not what Fascism is. Fascism is an economic system, which has little (if any) to do with race. At least in its original Mussolinian form. If you want to understand what Fascism is, just read Giovanni Gentile's 'Origins and Doctrine of Fascism' book. Just in case you didn't know, Giovanni Gentile is the mastermind behind this ideology; Mussolini is simply the one who came to him to ask for in regards to shaping this new (at the time) ideology. What you're discussing in this video is not Fascism. It's identitarianism, it's race-realism. NOT Fascism. You sound like one of those Antifa types."
"CONTRABABE!! U R DOING AMAZING SWEETIE ❤️"
"But I like fascism..."
"6:20 I wish we could be more pragmatic regarding discussions of violence & free speech.  There is obviously no equality of violence between the right and left, but perception counts for a lot. The media focus on left-wing violence, however unfair, hurts the movement.  There is a straw man going around the left that if you oppose violent confrontation with white supremacists, you want to have a dialogue with them.  This isn't true; the goal isn't to engage with or convince them at all.  The goal should be to persuade those who can be persuaded. Even if violence reduces the frequency of white supremacist rallies, it's counterproductive to the goal of building a mass movement because it scares away potential participants.  It reinforces the tendency of the majority to not get involved with political action. And tbh, these white nationalist rallies probably would have gotten little attention where it not for the counterprotests and the violence that broke out. White nationalists are most effective when doing what you describe in the video, using crypto terminology and symbology to infiltrate mainstream discourse to move centrists and decent-minded conservatives towards their side.  We have much less room than they do to fuck up.  The mainstream press will never be on the side of social justice movements. That small subset of antifascists who go to these protests hoping for a chance to rumble with some nazi pricks only end up hurting the movement and endangering the other non-violent antifa demonstrators."
"Thing is, I'm not sure fascists aren't already persuading run-of-the-mill conservatives with their rhetoric. My dad works as a truck driver and is surrounded by old, white men the whole work day and hears literally everyday that the country is being taken from them and how they're noticing that most of their kids' friends aren't white, and now some of them are making the leap to the white homeland thing. It doesn't seem like the fight isn't over."

"I don't understand nazis, they attribute all this conspiratorial power to the jews when it's actually just rich people with all the power. Rich people are made up of every race, religion, nationality. Why so much focus on the jews?"

"Who shut the Eyes to the Danger of Muslims and their hatred is a fool."
"@ContraPoints Antifa to me is like what you describe as the fascist in disguise. The thing about them is that whether or not they are really fascists doesn't matter to me. The alt right is fucking awful and I disavowed everything they stand for. I don't want to compare the alt right with Antifa as so many people seem to do in this argument about Antifa, what I'm saying is that Antifa has done awful shit. To me violence is not justified on either side and doesn't help whatsoever. I'm one of those silly little centrists that you're talking about, and while I understand your points, I would still like to have a discussion with you about Antifa. Seeing as to how youtubers essentially never respond to comments I don't expect a response, but I would really appreciate it if you would at least state your opinion of Antifa, do you think that the violent actions of individuals within the movement have been justified? I would love to know your thoughts."
"Are you actually questioning your own thought process or just reaffirming what you do believe? And becoming a reactionary-reactionary. Both sides are pretty retarded."
"На здоровье товарищ!"
"Why can't I 'love' react youtube videos?"
"Why is this man dressed like a woman?"
"Kudos on calling out centrists. This is probably your most complex video, and a public service."
"The production value on your videos just keeps going up! Must be making good use of all those Soros checks. ;)"
"You acknowledge said vile group deserve a constitutional right yet no megaphone...Is it not better to shine light on their vile views? then keep them hidden to fester and grow?"
"I've been going on the chans since I was in high school, around 2007. Once Obama got elected, you really started to see the shift from edgy teenagers towards a focused far-right political movement. It's easy for one who has a history on the chans to pick up all of these subtle messages and see them for what they are. Ever since Stormfront raided /pol/, people, at first ironically, started with the racist shit. Then idiots thought they were in good company and the foundation for it to become what it is today was laid. It's even harder trying to talk to people about this because I feel like I have to fight through a lot of smaller battles about satire, irony, and now 'free speech' to get close to lifting the veil from people's eyes. I feel that most of us thought that racist ideology was something we could just wait out, that it would die with our awkward grandparents who talked about 'the blacks' or 'the jews,' but then the thing we allowed to fester found root in comedy. Those who felt tired of being told they were the problem and they were just being stupid, or ignorant, found a movement which embraced those things and said 'See, look at what they've done to you!' So it's gone from ironically posting racist shit online to people feeling that by 'triggering' people, they had won the ideological debate."
"OH MY GOD Im so jealous of that Bucco Bruce beer stein!"
"Thank you Contra <3 absolutely perfect"
"SPLC is dog shit. That is all."
"it's somehow comforting to see that those forums haven't changed in the ten years since i decided i didn't want to be as hateful as 4chan was becoming. i hear a sentence like 'never reveal your power level' and i feel a nostalgic tingle.  anyway, i love this video. we're talking about a full-blown fascist program here, including the traditionalism, the racism, the anti-semitism, and the paranoia. we must pay attention to how these hip young fascists spread the ideology on various forums, from Twitter and YouTube all the way down to /pol/ and countless smaller subreddits and Discord servers. sheer inaccessibility has lent them a smokescreen; these anonymous chat rooms are miserable places to be as a non-fascist unless you at some level enjoy untangling the rhetoric. the private language is hard to learn, which keeps normies from understanding what's going on while still keeping the cult accessible to anyone ready to be redpilled.   a distributed, anonymous online hate cult invented ultra-propaganda, and they're using it to indoctrinate impressionable, angry young people into neo-fascism and to further a political agenda that will culminate in ethnic cleansing. Snow Crash meets Gravity's Rainbow meets the actual world that we all have to live in.  hey high school teachers: you know the quiet, unobtrusive, isolated kid who once wore a pepe shirt to school and who wrote that one essay where he weirdly shoehorned in 'identitarianism' or something? maybe consider treating him the same way you would treat a kid who started carrying around a copy of Mein Kampf and who wrote an essay where he denied the holocaust. you don't need to confront him or anything, but do try your best to reach out to him if you have that kind of rapport, because he might not be OK."
"I'm especially angry that edgy humor is now claimed by actual racists/sexists/etc. Edgy humor was a lot of fun few years ago when was owned by people to whom it was actual ~*irony*~. Fuck that. (thanx 4 the video, it was cool and informative)"
"Liberals do call everyone racist. You act like that statment is innacurate."
"To reference the whole 'pragmatically advance pro-White immigration strategy': there's literally a bill in the US Senate sponsored by Alabama Senator Cotton that would reduce immigration and prioritize 'knowing English' and education over familial relations.  It just oh-so-randomly happens to favor overwhelmingly white countries that are native English speaking (like UK and Australia), keeping out the browns.   The President also has been contemplating repealing DACA, which is, at that point, basically admitting he's a straight up fascist who prefers state-sponsored violence to get brown people to leave fuck this"
"Love the Videos production value, lighting, and synth tracks. Keep up the good work."
"Thank you for this Public Service.  This is your best video yet."
"Legit one of the best political videos I've ever seen."
"This is probably my favourite video of yours. This is excellent. Finally a prominent 'SJW' youtuber addresses the dog whistles these far right people use."
"The problem of Jewish Trolls has gotten so bad, that every Left Wing video has its comments section manipulated by them."
"as someone is probably a liberal by your context, that was quite interesting"
"Pretty much no one has stood up to the far left and now the far right are picking up, I expect the same. Welcome to the future, a world stuck between extremes."
"Okay but that awesome wallpaper though..."
"Mad how a couple of coloured spotlights make all your logic and observation so watchable. Simple things go a long way eh?"

"Critical theory. Cancer that destroys the very society that allowed it to exist. How boringly predictable."
"No pasaran, baby."
"At 19:50 'So yes I'm paranoid, but paranoia induced in leftists is a strategy by the fascists.' Congratulations CP. You've managed to come up with a more looney toon conspiracy theory than anything the alt-right has about the Jews orchestrating white genocide. You ascribe a sort of Machiavellian prowess to online trolls the likes of which I've never seen any Hitlerian to the Jews. This is the hill you choose to die on? This macabre insanity?"
"I feel like I'm watching a left-wing version of tin-foil hat videos about Saul Alinsky and his covert, incremental tactics and machinations.  I suppose you believe it should be fair for me to label you a Stalinist communist who wants everyone imprisoned in torturous gulags for decades on end. I mean, you even made a video of yourself having a mock conversation with a revolutionary communist. So are you a convert communist seeking to bring about a dictatorship of the proletariat dystopian society?? After watching this video, I'd say yes.  And also, Jews like Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, Hans Eysenck, Arthur Jensen, etc. are/were fascists according to Contra Points because they believed in racial differences between race and IQ."
"You think you'll get a few of those guys from the S K E P T I C  C O M M U N I T Y calling this video 'CRAZY SJW ATTACK HELICOPTER THINKS ILLUMINATI IS REAL LOL XD' like they like to do? Also: wow are you super hot"
"This just goes to show that identity politics is toxic and leads to authoritarianism. You just don't like it when the shoe's on the other foot. Fascism by any other name is just as repugnant. Sad that you can't see the irony."
"Just because fascists don't recognize the right to free speech, does not mean their speech should be denied. Including, crashing their events. Because, by that logic, since fascists reject the right of certain demographics to exist, do you reject their right to exist?  Many of these people are not fascists, let alone, nazis... To be a fascist, is to have a particular political leaning, not only  when regarding ethnicity, but also economical policy. In most of the cases i see, these people are not fascists. They're usually white supremacist conservatives. They do not seem to want a fascist economical government, they want to create a white ethnostate. It's bad enough... call them that. These people are not nazis, many of them aren't even neo-nazis...  Maybe, you should stop going around calling everyone a nazi, or a racist... clearly, it's not working. Race relations in your country seem to be getting worse, not better...  By your logic, some angry right winger could very well assault you, if irony and guilt by association is proof enough, that last bit would endanger you."
"God, Donalds hands are fucking tiny. Your Videos are amazing, keep up the good work."
"Are we listening, Armoured Skeptic and Chris Ray Gun...?"
"Probably putting this on the #1 spot as my favorite video from you, Contra. I love all your videos but this kind of critical educational style gets my waters flowing. <3"
"Thank you for this important video! Bless u Contra"
"I'm really digging the new wallpaper and televison! Do you think you'll ever do a BTS? I'd love to know how you go about creating a ContraPoints video. 🎥📺🎭"
"You know absolutely nothing about the origin of fascism nor the history of how it came into fruition. It has nothing to do with race (not surprised left wing arguments have to have race baiting bull shit to have a basis). While the extreme section of the alt-right is a growing concern in this country tht we haven't seen the last of. Ignorant tumblrina's tht brainwash fucktards into labeling everything to the right of Bernie 'fascist' doesn't help at all either. The left has become more aligned with fascist ideologies over the last year or so (suppression of opposition, being against free speech)."
"This is almost 5 Sargons. How do you expect centrists to watch it."
"Super well done and informative. I will never get over the cinematography in your videos tho. So well produced!"
"Usually when i watch videos like this I feel lile the creator missed womething or mad a small mistake in their analysis. But not this time literally perfect!"
"Thanks a lot for this video. Rather than give the people fish, you teach them how to. Well done, and thank you for your contribution to the world."
"western culture is dog whistling? the conspiracy is strong with this one"
"First time watcher, and instant fan.  Everything about this video is fantastic, keep it up etc."
"The whole point of the Kekestani flag satirizing the Nazi one was basically to take the piss out of the alt-right/white nationalists appropriating the pepe meme in the first place. I mean come on, they say Kekistan is supposed to be a ethno state of Kek where Facisists and Jews live in harmony together. At the very least, it started as satire on white identity politics."
"thanks to capitalism there's enough helicopters for this comment section"
"No Abigail Cockbane? Downvoted."
"An excellent video and one which could even convince some of the 'ironic' alt-right members (Those who post kekistan flags with no clue what it means) to maybe think again.  But Jesus that thumbnail is terrifying..."
"'i'm not a nazi, i'm a national socialist'"
"I'm sorry, but as a white person, you have no authority to speak on this subject."
"i thought jews were white??"
"You're fucking awesome. Killing in that dress, btw."
"This is fantastic, Nat. Absolutely. Incredible. Beautiful and visually stunning, and so informative and helpful. Thank you. <3"
"This video started out pretty good. But holy shit the way you started talking about liberals and centrists scared me. Here's a pro tip: People who really like freedom don't like being told what they can or can't do to escape the nazi purge you people are planning."
"Wow.. This Should go down as the last Chapter of *_'Kill all Normies'_*"
"Thank God we won the cold war!  Now with all those dirty Commies gone it suddenly safe (and fashionable) to be a fascist in public again.  Hi ho Genocide away!"
"Having grown up in Canada, the most racist people are whites, but I have met racist/ignorant natives as well, East Indians, mixed blacks, and South/East Asians. They all seem to have some sort of retarded view about the world, like 'my race is better than yours'."
"For me, the alt righters are just usefull idiots for the neocons and extreme right wing zionists, ironically."
"If someone is being racist towards you, beat the living shit out of them and defend yourself. Only weak and passive people get run over. Get guns, get ammunition, and always carry firearms for protection. Never tolerate racism, you have to stand up for yourself."
"Holy crap, what an amazingly edited and researched video, definitely sticking around"
"17:53 I looked away and came back to that O.O oh my geezum"
"Huh, it's funny. Our president does a lot of these things"
"An alt-righty could be pretending to be alt-lefty, telling alt-lefties how to recognize devious alt-righties, while signaling other alt-righties... This could get tricky."
"I'm impressed at how Contra has become the SJW David Lynch. Each video deserves some sort of award, I swear to Christ"
"we aren't trying to appeal to centrists, we're trying to appeal to people who actually believe in stuff"
"Definitely one of your best videos to date and probably the most important in the contemporary political climate."
"Dear Contra,trying to presuade liberals is a waste of time,  Liberals will never abdicate their wealth in order to save minorities, Communists and Socialists want to take the money and property away from Liberals to fund social programs to save Millions of lives, Fascists will protect the property rights and wealth of Liberals and preserve Capitalism, and thats why Liberals will ALWAYS support Nazis over Leftists."
"whats wrong with fascism? and hows it any different from communist totalitarianism?"
"Hmmm... Am I a fascist?  I think that Europe (esp Scandanavia), North America, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand actually have some of the most progressive and best policies and cultures. I think African nations, North Korea, China, India, Pakistan and the middle east at large have worse cultures. Is this even controversial?   Is it irrational to want to limit the number of people (especially economic migrants vs. refugees) that come to these 'Western nations'? Is it fascistic to hope that immigrants and refugees take on our values?  Thanks"
"Just throw people in a river, if they drown they're not a fascist."
"Yo. Respect."
"Great vid. Keep fighting the good fight 😊"
"Fuck yes"
"This was one of the best videos you've ever done. I bet it will be referenced as a valuable resource for a long time."
"What happens when some of the 'nazi talking points', by themselves in an objective setting, are correct (at least at some point)? Should you be dishonest and oppose it just to 'not follow a nazi talking point' nor 'support nazis/alt-right'? That isn't right  I also believe the 'falsely claiming people as nazis' is a problem you are downplaying. You point as Lauren Southern as nazi for instance, and being subscribed to her and watching many many interviews/videos of her it does not seem like that at all. She does have some 'nazi talking points', but having some nazi talking points doesn't make you nazi, and a nazi talking point isn't necessarily false. A 'nazi talking point' can be true, at least at some level, even if the nazis pushing it misrepresent it in other settings or have other false beliefs of their own. It is dishonest to instantly dismiss the 'nazi talking points' just because of the cultural context, instead of debating the points themselves. E.g immigration/islam/anti-white racism/'leftist intolerance'/etc.  P.S: I'm a leftist and liberal"
"The catch 22 for some of these tactics is figuring out how to acknowledge them without allowing them to have their intended chilling effect on self-criticism. That aspect is what makes this stuff so insidious. For example, comparing the violence of Antifa with neo-nazis is definitely a false equivalency, but failing to address the problematic aspects of Antifa to avoid falling into that trap also gives ammunition to the alt-right. Similarly hating on free speech because the alt right has hijacked that platform is precisely the reaction they were aiming for because it makes the left look authoritarian to the average American.  The way things stand it feels like the alt right could ruin cute animal pictures forever if they adopted puppies as a literal dog whistle. There's got to be some middle ground where we can avoid allowing the alt-right to control the discourse."
"ah the National Policy Institute, very deep pockets and been around for decades"
"Was not expecting to hear Shaun read fascist tactics!"
"Your videos are so well done and informative. I love how you mix your own cinematic style into your videos. You tend to get so much deeper into topics than other youtubers of your category, which is extra nice for people like me that are pretty informed about this kind of stuff for the most part. You structure arguments very clearly. Keep up the good work!"
"This was an excellent video. But I have a problem with no platforming BECAUSE- hear me out- they wind up getting their own plat forms. They build huge followings unchecked. No one ever calls them out until they're already famous. No one ever makes a fool of them. Even better than no-platforming is a quality debate in which bad people look like jackasses. When you refuse debate on the finer points that you brought up, people suspect you are refusing because you dare not try. That you have no real points. I'm not talking about outright Nazis and holocaust deniers- I'm talking about the ones that say simply 'I think we need to protect our culture from unchecked immigration.' No platforming doesn't work in the long run because they will eventually get a platform. Example: I never heard of Milo Yiannopolous until the hullabaloo of him getting kicked off campus. Now I don't go a day without hearing his name."
"called home for several generations now? No. Hell no. I was born free here and Ill see my family stays that way. Fuck the alt-right scumbags. Fuckk the religious zealots. Fuck dogmatic conservatives.  Stay strong, sexy and thank you for this channel."
"The nazi movement wiped out my family in Austria. Christian conservatives have made existing pretty crap for me most of my life but now this? Actual fucking nazis, here, in the land my blood has survived in, the country we've"
"When I was teaching a class of high school history, I used the term 'useful idiots' to describe events as they related to the Cold War and how it was a common pejorative.  Honestly, I see those who enable these proto-fascists - albeit with good intentions - are more akin to the term useful idiot. It would be a good example to show that class today; how social media expands their influence and increases their voice.  It's good that you're making thoughtful videos pertaining to this. Keep it up."
"Hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah, quality quality quality, u always good as hell bb"
"Lookin' hot Contra, that hair is gorgeous."
"My how flattering"
"I loved the video, but there was one point I took issue with: the definition of fascism.  I think you narrowed it it a bit too much to say that a fascist is inherently associated with white supremacism, or Nazism.  Sure, both of those groups ARE fascist, but that term also applies to any movement prioritizing nationality above all else.  People who believe in loyalty and dedication to a nation above the individual and modern liberal principles are also fascists.  Fascism is essentially extreme nationalism.   Keep up the good work!"
"Hey contrapoints have you read Angela Nagle's 'kill all normies'?"
"It's important to note that these do not apply to all fascists.  What Contra is specifically looking at are the beliefs of National Socialists/White Nationalists/Identitarians.  Fascism in itself doesn't actually have to care about race.  It's still garbage, but don't think that all fashies are nazis.  All nazis are fashies, but not all fashies are nazis.  The non-nazi fashies are still dangerous."
"Poor Pepe..."
"Try to talk to a conservative or republican about the 'Southern Strategy'. The results may be hilarious."
"21:48 wrong anthem, got mistakenly exited then disappointed"
"soooo maybe this is a stupid sentiment but what would happen if a very large collection of black and Jewish people suddenly started touting 'must save western heritage' while combining that sentiment with increased immigration and multiculturalism?  would the alt right shift talking points or fly with it or what?"
"Please dye your hair black to avoid White priveledges"

"The secret symbils make it seem all cool and shit and looks like they have a sense of community so it's I'm sure very appealing to some people. especially stupid young and lonely or thrill seeking.  how about we make feminism and left just as cool seeming? put ppl like contra out there 😊"
"go to the dictionary and lookup the definition of fascist. Then observe someones motives and actions ,that will tell who the fascist is. This video is ignorant"
"The secret symbils make it seem all cool and shit and looks like they have a sense of community so it's I'm sure very appealing to some people. especially stupid young and lonely or thrill seeking."

"Technically out president would be a crypto-fascist not a proto."
"i hate the use of the slippery slope fallacy of 'they'll come for you or me next' and the fact that so many fall for it"
"This is a stupid video. First, NAZI or Fascist is now just a racial slur for white people that don't agree with the left. Fascism is NOT a racial political movement anymore than communism is and to say so just proves your ignorance. A quick internet search shows there were blacks in the Hitler youth and they also served in the Wehrmacht. In addition, Fascism started in Italy by Mussolini who thought Marxism would be more effective with the emphasis on NATIONALISM rather than CLASS struggle as Lenin and the Bolsheviks promoted. Fascism was another form of Marxism and nothing to do with race in theory. However, those who preached both of these ridiculous LEFTISTS ideologies were themselves racists like Lenin and Stalin (look up how many Jews and Cossacks were killed or deported by the Russian communist) or Hitler. To see a fascist now would be to look for people wearing masks using violence to intimidate those who disagree with them and/or private companies to discriminate against the same people with the help of the government. I wonder who that really sounds like? Google, ANTIFA, News Propaganda, and government run police? Nah, it's the guy in a crowd of people with a flag that needs arrested and brutalized. KNOW your history and make an honest intellectual video (I know it's difficult when the state run media is giving you fake information but you can find actual facts if you try...at least for now)."
"Gawd I love that Shawn's voice is used for the 4chan narration."
"I don't agree with either side in the current dicotomy of political discussion, more of an amused bystander. That said this video is pretty spot on, entertaining and very well produced. Good job man."

"you look like a fallout ghoul"
"I think the point the centrists and conservatives are trying to make. Isn't that these people have good ideas or that they should be defended. But rather that because we have degraded what makes a Nazi a Nazi to the point where basically anyone who isn't 100percent on board with your ideas about governce or culture. is considered defacto a Nazi. And because of that people are afraid that violence against faceists is just coded language for 'I can attack anyone because they disagree  with me'"
"This video shows you how to form a shame cult via a YouTube channel.  Step 1.) Start with dissonance, man in a dress, disagreeing with himself dressed as a man.  Step 2.) Install Shame ... Convincing viewer they are inherently a sinner (fascist) Step 3.) Install Dependency ... View is so white they can't see their own whiteness without the help of this video Step 4.) Install Fear ... Say everyone is a racist on top of a land of racism being seen in a mind that's racist...  This is the cult of self-abandonment... When they attack 'white supremacy' they are attacking your identity. They want you to hate yourself long enough to hand over the reigns of your own morality and give it to the group. Please love yourself more than this!! Be a woman, wear a dress, do whatever but this dissonance about fascism is a projection of inner shame. We all deserve to love and feel good in our own identity."
"1. All you're doing is describing ethno-nationalists. Yes, some of them are also fascists, but not all of them. In fact, I'd say it's only the minority. In any case, if there is a black race, there is also a white race. You can't talk about 'black people' like they are a collective and then not treat white people the same way, especially when you talk about genocide, which leads me to point 2.  2. Where they're wrong, is the conspiracy and the jew-blaming. Otherwise, there is a contingent of people out there on the left that absolutely hates white people and wants to see them gone. We've all seen the Joe Biden video by now. We've all seen the 'can white people please go extinct now?' tweets by now. Don't pretend like 'white genocide' is some strawman position that no one really holds, because it isn't, and pretending like it is gives actual Neo Nazis ammunition. Instead, acknowledge the reality of the problem, and make the argument that white nationalism isn't the answer, because it's not.  3. This belief is generally held by the alt-right, but again, they're not universally fascists. In fact, that is again, the minority. Are you going to mention the fascist beliefs held by Antifa at all? Or are you using fascist as a dog-whistle for 'anyone too far to the right for my liking?'  'Fascism promises you can be a part of something greater than yourself.'  Contra, so does communism. That's how collectivist, totalitarian ideologies work. There is a lot to disagree with Richard Spencer on. He *is* either a full-blown fascist, or he's willing to take things that far. But no one outside of your dedicated fans will understand what that means. You need to argue against Spencer's points, not his label. Provide the quotes of his arguments, and argue against them. Point out the absurdity of forcibly uprooting people from their homes to get his ethno-State. Call him out on his misapplication of I.Q averages to sweeping generalizations and the normative judgments he arrives at, without question or inquiry, from those I.Q. averages.  'Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involved buying and selling other people as property!'  If I'm simply proud to be an American, am I proud of the fact that some white people owned slaves? I can be proud of something in a general, overall sense and still recognize flaws in that thing I am proud of. If you really don't like the idea of that though, if you can't be proud of something despite it's bad parts, no one gets to be proud of being black for selling their own people, and no one gets to be proud of being an Arab, because they all participated in the slave trade. Whites arrived to that particular game late, in fact.  '[....] or whatever you get off to is in no way impeded by people of different skin colors.'  It is if you accept the premise that people with different skin pigments cannot live peacefully together, which the alt-right does. Contra, I want to make something very clear; *I hate the alt-right.* Not even Nazis. I draw the line at the alt-right and further. I don't want to see them win. But at this rate, with arguments like yours, they're going to. You *need* to attack their arguments otherwise you will only rally your own base and you will not even budge the fence-sitters an inch."
"There’s something not quite right? I lick a honey bee. There’s something not quite right? The taste of honey. Something funny? On my hands and knees – smoothing my palms across the dark green grass. Why is it so dark? Is it night instead of day? Where is the sun? Why is it so warm? I cannot figure…  Something triggered? I face a mirror – tears stream down in the face reflected, but I feel nothing…  no pity, even a little sadistic – that’s not right? I open my mouth and out flies the bee. My taste of honey. I just watch and move my eyes to follow its flight. My taste of honey. There’s something not quite right?"
"This might be your best video yet and definitely one of my favorites. This has so much vitally important info, it *needs* to reach a large audience. Regardless of the consequences, I'm gonna spread this around."
"Great video as always. I disagree with some of the conclusions that you come to, and your somewhat paranoid outlook, but awesome video nonetheless."
"Contra, you are brilliant!"
"What I got away from this video is anything a right wing person says is just a subtle form of facism. I think that's ridiculous. I could say the same about left wing people. You say welfare, I say communism. You say universal healthcare I say socialism. Your conspiracy theories are just plain stupid."
"The bright and beautiful eyes of a woman who has arrived. Spectacular production."
"Yes, because clearly it's impossible to hate both the extreme right and the extreme left equally."
"I feel like to have an obligation to create million fake youtube account just to upvote this video because it is perfectly summarized everything that has been going on this country since the election. But I won't , because I am not an alt-right scum."
"I'm sorry, I gave you a chance, but you blew it. You're really poorly informed and just plain wrong."
"Contra = It's James?"
"At 10:45 I might add that another white supremacist symbol that comes up occasionally is Thor's Hammer, usually worn as a necklace. Hearkens back to the good ol' Viking days, and of course is a nod to the ethnic purity in Scandinavia (especially back in the year 900). It's a beautiful symbol and has deep ties to Norse pagan rites so it's a shame that it's been appropriated."

"Commies and Cultural Marxists belong in large open pits"
"Here's why the Nazis are more popular these days.  Immigration is a real problem for the West. The most 'neutral' problem is that mass influx of low skilled migrants pushes wages down for the low skilled native workers, as well as increasing competition for jobs.  The obvious 'centrist' solution is to restrict migration to prevent low skilled workers from entering the country.  The alt right support this as a stepping stone to getting their ethnostate.  The left CAUSED this migration problem in an attempt to import a left-leaning voter block, and so refuse to take steps to counter it.  Ergo, the rational thinker is aligned with the Fascists.  The left will never be able to oppose fascism unless it acknowledges the validity of the surface level arguments."
"Great. You come up against the actual moments when you might need to educate someone on how to handle dilemmas, and then puss out. For example, the part in the video where you need to tell people not to de-platform the alt-right, you only kinda-sorta do, and if I dare say deliberately make it a vague suggestion. And then at the end of the video, you say actually, go ahead and de-platform them. YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT. I don't know why you pose as a philosopher and strategist when you can't even keep your own basic talking points straight. Are the alt-right recruiting based on being de-platformed or aren't they? I can't help thinking perhaps you haven't clarified this because it's more fun to make hacky David Lynch videos in a mini dress and get tons of attention. Whether or not certain people with certain ideologies should rise the ranks of liberal/Democrat/progressive circles is a REAL QUESTION. And you, my friend, have fucked it up like all the rest..."
"ad 9) 16:34  no,no,no. no ! you dont fight fascism by becoming a fascist yourself. and thats generally the problem right now. antifa claims to fight fascism, but is doing so by employing fascist tactics. what will the normie think ? of course they see them beating up everyone whom they disagree with, and draw their conclusions about good and evil accordingly.  btw. i`m a monarchist (no, thats not a joke), what does that make me ? btw. btw. did you grow boobs ? i like that :)"
"YES girl, this is an amazing video, thanks for all the hard work and sick lighting 💯💯💯"
"The three criteria of what fascists believe layed out at the beginning is actually defining nazism which is merely one form of fascism. Look at the historical roots beyond Hitler, Mussolini is obviously the most clear point of analysis."

"Your shit keeps getting weirder and I keep getting harder."
"Fine job with the production. Certainly not as lazy as I've seen many other youtubers do."
"Honestly what the FUCK white CULTURE are these white american nationalists talking about when they say their culture? I know whites have culture, like germans, french, etc but what white AMERICAN culture? Why are these racists so OBSESSED with 'culture' anyway? It seems like racists just have a need to just feel special so bad. Hence, racist fascists are snowflakes."

"So I'm not allowed to point out left violence because it does not equal the violence of the right done 300 years ago? at 14:47 you clearly admit there is left violence but we should not bring it up because... It's good violence? No, no violence is ever good 'and we have to point. It. All. Out.'"

"this is fully automated luxury communism"
"As a liberal, who has been incredibly frustrated lately by many like me who cant' properly condemn fascism, I thought this video was great. In my experience too many on the left focus on how they think fascism should be fought, but advocate tactics they know many liberals will find unpalatable. I much prefer your approach in focusing on recognising fascists and not inadvertently helping them."
"We're gonna beat you LOL"
"First time viewer...from far away you could probably pull off being a woman 😂😂"

"'FASCIST' violence came as a fucking response to rioters and looters physically attacking people on the right. The alt right and the fucking alt left fucking feed off each other"
"I have a serious question, in what way would people on the left want people on the right to stand up to the alt-right/fascists? I mean from what I've seen from the left recently would lead me to believe that there are very few people on the left that would be willing to tolerate people who are openly right-wing enough to work with them against fascism."
"This has nothing to do with the content of the video, but it sounds like you're making great progress on the voice training. Your 'new voice' caught me off guard at first, but I quickly got used to it and I immediately forgot about it.   Then again, like you, I also have this peculiar personality type that just passively goes along with things and quickly adapts to big changes."
"Glad I found this video posted on a FB forum.  Best presentation and take down I've seen of the (insert name :) ).  Keep up the good fight"
"There's also the irony that the general disdain centrists and the right hold for safe spaces is immediately contradicted by the ultimate goal of fascists and white nationalists to have a space... that is just for them... and is thus... optically... safer........... to white narcissists............................."
"Are you fucking kidding me lol? How is this the alt right? This is just fucking Nazis. If this is your definition of alt right, then how come libertarians, conservatives, and anybody against the politically correct narrative ( A FUCKING TERM COINED BEFORE WHITE SUPREMACISTS BECAME A THING AGAIN), are just fucking labeled as alt right EVEN IF THEY AREN'T WHITE?!"

"I think you gloss over how harmful the far left can be in the fight against the alt right/fascism, and then you bash 'centrists' normies.  Not a good approach if you want to win and beat back the alt right imo.  Just look at how you admired the Pol post for its forward thinking, the guy was telling people to distance themselves from the extremists and try to win over centrists.  And then your video does the exact opposite.  antifa = good... because the fight fascists,  and the centrists are just helping fascists.    And perhaps you are some mind reading wizard at spotting fascists... but you audience is not.  @ 15:35  You blur the lines between conservatism and fascism. You can't have your audience attacking people who don't want to open the flood gates on immigration.... or people who appreciate American/western culture.  I would be interested in hearing what you think someone on right and who is NOT fascist sounds like.      it may not seem like it, but we are on the same team. I am a liberal, a life long democrat, who wants to see Trumpanzees and the alt right fail hard. ..... I am sure you would probably call me a centrist."
"Is that fucker using Norman soldiers depicted on the Bayeaux Tapestry to represent Saxons?"
"i genuinely agree with you, but, oh god, the the left and the communism makes me sick. even if it's harmless joke (like u did) or use of some communist symbolic or true believe, that communism is the only one to go: i don't understand how people, who advocate for equality and freedom for all, want something to do (even for the sake of satire) with ideology, that killed and stealed freedom from millions of people. and no, i not some random dude, who live in US and learned about communism from louren southern videos, i am from former soviet union and my grandfather died in gulag for reading a book late at night (=must be traitor). Hope i would live to the moment, then both fascism and communism are publicly condemned by all people around the world.  And yeah, i know, i know, It wasn't real communism."

"Fascism had nothing to do with race you dunce. The views you're describing as 'fascist' were held by people like Teddy Roosevelt and Winston Churchill."
"Don't talk to people don't give them a platform, but argue with them... Marxist programing fail, why should we trust you, why should centrists trust the left or the right, when we can spot bullshit from a mille away. You are like Steven Crowder only you talk from the left perspective."
"Is that a man in a dress?"
"man what a LOOK"
"One of the things that always gets me about 'White Nationalist' is their idea that all white people are the same.   They might sometimes says they don't see that, but lets face it, if these people gain power one day, will it really stop at non-whites? Roughly 10% of the UK's population is non-British white. If they secure a British ethno-state, they'll sooner or later have to target the Polish and German people in Britain. I know it sounds like I'm ignoring the issue of the pre-existing hardships of the non-whites, but after they are gotten rid of they will still find problems with more and more people until even the natives are oppressed under the guides of 'safety from degeneracy' or some Orwellian shit like that.   I think we are still a while away from becoming the National Socialist States of America (though since most the these people are free-market lovers it'll be named something different) but unless we do something and point attention to this issue in the way we point it to SJWs and stuff like that, it is a possible reality. If not for the likelihood of being spammed, I would like videos of the right-wing riots in Poland because I feel we are heading in that direction."
"I kind of want to try showing this to my mom in the hopes she'll finally get it, but I'm not sure it will work. Especially that last bit. She's Cuban, so she's pretty against anything that seems like communism. My dad's even worse and I really doubt he'd listen at all.  This video reminded me of how easily my parents are going to be fooled by all of it. I mean, they've already been fooled by it even after Charlettesville. I'm starting to feel really unsafe living here, but I don't know what to do. The problem isn't so much money, it's more that I just started classes already and I plan on transferring next year and the fact that I've never lived by myself before and have depression and can't get myself to clean things or do laundry or stuff.  I don't know. I guess I'm just hoping for some kind of advice or something.  The funny thing is the other day my mom said she was worried about me wearing my star of David necklace to school because of all the stuff that's happening (now that i think about it, i'm not sure if she meant she was worried about nazis or if she though antifa might attack me or something????). But we live in a place with several temples and kosher food places and we see orthodox jews walking to a temple that's just 3 blocks away from our house every friday. I actually feel pretty safe here (not counting in my house). So it seems weird that she'd be worried about me going to a school that's just 4 blocks away from said synagogue.   Anyway, video was awesome. Only thing that bugged me was that it could have been useful to have various code words that they use for jews. I mean, those don't seem to change as often. Still a good video though."
"I'm so grateful for you. Without you, we probably wouldn't get our message out there. Keep on keeping on."
"My life is split into before and after finding your videos. Thank you."
"Hahahahaha, I'm only 3:25 in and this is already brilliant ! Excellent dismantling of white supremacism  !"
"I'm right libertarian and I've had fascists try and recruit me to their side, it's like the creepy old The Spider and the Fly poem. I disagree with them on virtually every political position of note and fascists don't exactly have a good track record of treating political dissidents well so I'd be fuckin nuts to ever support them.  Frankly if things ever do get bad enough that having to choose a side I'm going to go wherever I can escape the fighting even if it's an obscure 3rd world backwater because I don't trust the left not to mistake me for a fascist and kill me and I don't trust the fascists to not kill me the second I stop being useful."
"As a centrist, I don't need people from one political side explain to me another political side, trust me we know both your games. So if I joke about drinking bleach I must be put on suicide watch because you know you first start joking about ideas you are not ready to put into practice."

"Thanks for the video, it was very informative."
"A excellent video, I don't think I agree with everything you said here but you've certainly shifted my views on some issues, given  other points to think on and explained the progressive world view and behavior in a way that will help me understand it better in the future."
"Plus this slippery slope game can be played on the other side of the aisle. For example, what distinguishes a hardcore communist or anarchist from someone who is much more moderate? The moderate will say 'I am not a communist.' Yet if we are dishonest we can find similarities between the thoughts of a moderate progressive leftist and an extreme leftist, accuse them of speaking in codes and dog whistles, and label them as 'communist' while blathering about gaslighting and treating their denials as just what a communist would say. Not very thoughtful. Maybe we should listen to what they say instead of trying to decode them. Perish the thought."
"Hi, contrapoints. Good video. If you want more of a look at the perspective of the older generation leading up to this, I recommend you read David neiwert's essays on fascist rhetoric, if you haven't already. It's free and online. He talks about how some popular conservative news pundits like Rush Limbaugh have used some fascist rhetoric since the 90s. Rush's defense, much like the younger generation's internet irony, is he's playing an over the top character. Neiwert analyzes fascism through the lens of scholars, and also his experience as a reporter who made a book on his interviews with real fascists, to show how fascist rhetoric is becoming normalized. He made the essays back in the bush administration and has done more since, but they're a great breakdown of seeing how an extremist group can appeal to non-extremists."
"Natalie you are truly a force of intelligence and patience, and I applaud you"

"'A Britain'  Also fuck these guys for ruining the OK sign, I use that all the time with my family."

"Wonder how fast the rating will drop once the alt-right agents have found this video"
"I didn't know what to make of this channel when I first found it. These days Contrapoints is probably one of the most rational channels that talk about current politics that we have right now. Just a shame that alot of people will be turned off immediately when they open the video, see Contra and close the video in the first 5 seconds"

"for real though, im so glad u called out fantano even tho i like him and he calls himself a bernie supporter, hes way too accepting of facism and usually says its a joke and that they have no power anyway"
"I am by 99% of all measures a centrist, but I do not feel like I fall for the tricks and tactics you mention.  (Then again, I acknowledge that I might not know, because self-analysis can be hard.)  I do see and hear dog whistles, and I have always said that I support free speech, but not for Nazis.  Sure, there are gray areas on the black and whote scale, but there are also obvious areas of black, and I don't think we lose anything if we pass laws discouraging speech at that far end of the spectrum.  Odious ideas would still make it through, but not 'the most odious'.  My only concern with my own position is that I fear it might be driving people underground where we can no longer see them and were they will continue to plot, but now in secret.  In the end that concern doesn't change my underlying belief that we should consider sane and reasonable exceptions to free speech when it comes to Nazis and white nationalists, but I recognize it is an arguable flaw in enacting my preferred solution.  More practically, America is not to amend the First Amendment, so it will continur to be vitally important to ooint out the dog whistles, even when people think you are being paranoid for hearing them."

"This video is complete bullshit.   Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce, that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. That is what Fascism actually is. And who are the people trying to suppress free speech, control the media, and are seeking dictatorial power? The Neo Liberals. Neo Liberals are basically Communist who also believe in Socialism. Liberals also want. more jobs for woman, trans people, gay people, and every other flavor of snow flake out there, regardless of merit, talent, skill level, qualification, or anything that would normally garner a person a job. They believe in segregation by the means of Safe Spaces. So which side actually sounds like a bunch of fascist? Liberals. These so called Neo Nazi's are just sick and tired of being shit on by everyone else. You want to talk about the slave trade. The number one country that still practices Slavery is India. China is second, Third is Pakistan, Fourth is Uzbekistan. In Fifth is Russia, but is a different story. Nigeria and Ethiopia are in 6th and 7th, but that is only because of a general decline in Africa's population. That is pretty much how it has always been. Slavery dates back to prehistoric times and was apparently modeled on the domestication of animals. From the earliest periods of recorded history, slavery was found in the world's most 'advanced' regions. The earliest civilizations--along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus Valley of India, and China's Yangtze River Valley--had slavery. When it comes to owning slaves, white people have been in the minority. Yes, Vikings and Romans had slaves, but no where near the amount that other countries had in the same period."

Greetings from Poland, where facism is unfortunately very strong :/ There is a lot of fear and hate towards immigrants here, especialy those with different skintone.

"where are these people coming from? fucking /pol/!"
"Sorry, but none of those 3 definitors are especially necessary to fascism. White supremicism and aspects of nazi-ism maybe, but it's very possible for non white people to be fascistic. It's about authoritarianism, nationalism, smashing unions, 'traditional' roles for women and serving the establishment while espousing (fake) populism. The alt-right are fascist, but not especially because of their bizarre victim race obsession. Otherwise, a top vid as usual. Tx <3"
"The problem with your western culture thingy is that not only fascist use that terminology. I want to perserve Western Culture because it is the culture of democracy, the rights of men and so on. I don't want it to be lost to authoritarian influences that could come from cultures of a different tradition of thoughts.  So what ? Am I a fascist now for defending the culture that allows us to think in terms of rights of the individual ?"
"And that's why you shouldnt care about labels. Dont ask them what are you ? (Identitarian/White Nationalist etc)   But what do you want for this country ? If they answer white homeland, purge minorities, social programs for white. Well. They're a fascist (NatSoc)."

"The quality of these videos is absolutely incredible. Keep up the good work! One thing that has stuck with me though is that you don't seem to offer an alternative view on immigration and the potential problems/solutions that relates to it. If you could find time to make a video discussing that it would be amazing!"
"In this video, how to became paranoid about everybody around you."
"Okay I stopped taking this video seriously very early on but anyone who unironically refers to their political leaning/influence as 'power level' is a weeabo and an idiot LMFAO"

"Good video overall, thank you! What do you mean by the term 'gaslighting' in this context?"
"Well, as usual, a good video.  And, as usual, I disagree with much of it. I won't expend too much energy on this, as I feel rather lazy at the moment.  But, here it goes: 1. You really don't do much to distinguish between conservatives and fascists. A cynical leftist might say 'That's because there isn't much of a differencs,' but you are better than that. You occasionally mentioned them in passing as being separate from fascists, but did little to enumerate the differences.  2. As a conservative myself, you gave me personally little that I could possibly do to prove I am not a fascist. Race I care little and less about, culture I care much about. But ah! Culture is just a dogwhistle! Well, except when it isn't.  3. This dovetails off point two, but this leads to a sort of left wing McCarthyism. The Left rightly condemned McCarthy....until they started mimicking him. Replace 'fascists' with 'reds.' I don't say this as mere namecalling: I am genuinely concerned that that chapter of history is about to be repeated, if not already.  4. If the more sensible leftists will not differentiate between conservatives and fascists, then that will most likely benefit the fascists. This is actually what happened in part in Germany. The struggle between fascists and communists ultimately pushed the weakened conservatives to reluctantly side with the fascists. 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' is a dangerous and stupid expression recited by idiots, but unfortunately it oftentimes comes true...for the worse.  5. Regarding no-platforming, this clearly contradicts classical liberalism. 'I don't care, it's a dangerous ideology!' Fine...but what about if the Right decided that progressivism is a dangerous ideology (in fact, I do)? Who gets to decide what ideas are too dangerous to discuss? Not sure if you've noticed, but Republicans control the White House, both houses of Congress, the Supreme Court, and most governorships. Do you REALLY think it's a good idea to censor ideas that are arbitrarily determined to be dangerous?  Imagine if communism, a similarly destructive ideology, was censored. And the Right was allowed to define who is a communist and what ideas are communist.  I agree that this confusion is 'just what the fascists want.' It is. It is, because it lumps dissimilar groups in with them, and the 'no platforming' policy many Leftists employ creates a simultaneous impression of authoritarianism rooted in a Left that lacks the confidence to debate and a 'sympathy for the devil' for the no platformed fascists. (Assuming for a moment that they were actual fascists in the first place.)  Instead, have the confidence to debate them. I strongly disagree with progressives, but even they I will grant have better ideas than 'ethnostates.' Honestly, most Alt Righters don't really seem to have thought their end-game through very well...should be easy to discredit them in open debate.  Also, either draw a line between conservatives (and not just pseudoconservative David Brookes/John McCain types...I mean real paleoconservatives, traditionalists, libertarians, and even the hated Bush/Romney neoconservatives...though the Left seems to misunderstand just how hated Bush was/is on the Right) and fascists.   If you really want to defeat fascists, don't artificially swell their numbers by lumping conservatives in with them.   That benefits the Alt Right and NO ONE ELSE.  Sorry for the longwinded post."

"I can trace my ancestry back to the Isle Of Skye, a part of Scotland where most of the Scottish stuff white people actually care about like Clan Macleod and fairies live. I'm anti-fascist, because I will not stand by and let some alt-right Kurgan claim the Prize at the time of the gathering. Now where's MY claymore sword?"
"Give the alt-right a platform and actually debate against their arguments. They grow in greater numbers the less the left grants them this and construe this as not having genuine arguments to counter against the alt-righters--which I don't believe is entirely false. Until you popularize genuine, rational arguments against the alt-right, they won't stop recruiting more people."

Red pill is accepting an uncomfortable truth while a blue pill is accepting a comfortable lie for the rest of your life because you are such a passive little sheep to your robot masters. So yeah calling yourselves blue pill is fucking stupid if you think you are correct. Its basically saying 'Yeah, I know Im full of shit and lying out my asshole, but my feels trump reality and thats how I wanna live.' like I know a lot of you guys don't mean it like that but you are literally asking matrix fans to go back to their simulated office jobs."

"Umm, the three things listed in the vid dont have to do directly with fascism. I mean, read a fucking book of a fucking google search.  I mean, all i really see in this video is 'HEY, LOOK! A WITCH'... Oh... Umm, i mean 'HEY, LOOK! A FASCIST!' Cuz, yaknow... You just call anyone that talks about problems you don't want to talk about a fucking fascist. You fucking disgust me. Its cunts like you that are going to let the fucking world burn and be like 'Well, at least the dirty fascist didn't do it.' Please, get fucked."
"What are your thoughts on the negative media coverage antifa got over the last week? The alt-right's push to create a false equivalence seems to have convinced some centrists."
"The only thing I feel like I should point out is that there is a difference between fascists and Nazis is that Nazis are a subsection of fascists. Obviously Nazis are by far the worst and there is a need to treat them as the only type of fascisem since, as you said, they are trying to paint the opposition the 'true' fascists, and there's also the need to simplify terms, but i think it's really important to remind people that at the end of the day fascisem at it's bae is a blind devotion to the state over the individual (And I can tell you that as an Israeli part of the major problem we are facing is the rise of fascisem in our country as well and it's by no means Nazism....)  P.S. just wanted to mention that watch your journey into becoming a woman really made me face my transphobia and you are helping me become a better me so thank you so much for that."

"Pychon was so right."
"Dear Contra. Thanks for the video, it is a very informative and well produced one. I would have loved if you eventually treated the coded message of 'helicopter memes' which are promoting not the typical racist Nazi shit, but South American Fascism, something in vogue with many Right Libertarians too."
"There's this guy I know irl who I still can't quite tell if he's actually a fascist trying to pretend to be center-right or if he just seems like one because I'm paranoid. It's frustrating. I mean he's obviously a right-winger and anti-SJW, I just can't tell if it's worse than that. Anyway he definitely uses a lot of the alt-right tactics which makes debating him a pain in the ass, especially surrounded by our mutual friends (mostly social liberals) who get more upset by the arguments than the insidious 'just kidding' bullshit he says. I mean in theory they agree with me but they just really seem to hate any kind of conflict more than they hate homophobia or racism or sexism etc. Also I don't really want to talk to him a lot anyway, especially alone. He creeps me out."

I value democracy and western values and I don't want to see my race or western culture disappear. I live in California and I'm the only white person at a store that employs 15 people and at school I'm one of very few men in class. I don't expect the Muslim women in class to fight for my culture or race  just the same as I don't expect my illegal immigrant coworkers to fight to save my culture. White people need to stand up for themselves before we are a minority in our own countries. I enjoy coming from a racially diverse family (white, mexican, Thai) but we are going to be bred out of existence and lose our culture if thing continue the way we are going. Diversity means having people from many separate races and cultures but soon we all be blended and lose the very thing that makes us different from each other."

"FWIW, the term 'alt-left' *was* briefly used by a small group of leftists in the aftermath of the 2016 US elections- *however*, ironically, they were themselves explicitly opposed to identity politics (since they felt it got in the way of focusing economic inequity, and turned off centrists), and are pretty much the last people to support antifa."

"Officially my favorite video of yours, just after the Jewish Professor, Roaming Mil & Nazi Dom satire.....WOW! Bra-vo!  I do have to say as a 'Center-Leftist', I think the hardest of hard jobs is working to fight back against both Toxic Liberal & Toxic Conservative extremes. I think most 'normies' are politically in the Center when queried on a series of issues, so having a measured, yet solutions-focused approach on things is the best way to convert regular folks.   That's ultimately what I believe the fight is for: the hearts and minds of regular citizens that want to live productive lives, and have large-scale problems that affect them addressed through reasoned, practical solutions by our elected officials.  Post-election I've been doing a tour of Alt-Right YT, and I definitely am pretty repulsed by 'cringy' Far Left/SJWs, and there are some points around ideological hypocrisy, and moral blind-spots I think the Left must contend with. I think Obama's presidency did leave a lot of us complacent, and the New/Alt-Right emerged with a stack of ideas, anecdotes and data-points we as-of-yet are un-prepared to deal with purely intellectually. We do see evidence in the real world that immigration and multicultural initiatives don't come with 0 downside. And I think we think we're still fighting the Christian Conservatives of the 90s & 00s, whereas this new breed of internet libertarian is able to Google and use tech and social media to counter-argue just like us.  I am someone opposed to violence, ESPECIALLY pre-emptive violence, but I also believe in my heart of hearts Rational Centrists/Liberals can beat these guys on the intellectual battlefield. One angle I feel is to force these guys to answer the question of how do we implement their ideas: How does a Gov't of 330M people implement an ethno-state? If Race/IQ is real, what are the policy implications for implementing an education system? When you find whites in your ethno-state with low IQs, how will you educate them? If it isn't worth spending resources to education low IQ minorities, why waste the resources on low IQ whites....?  When they can't answer, or their answer demonstrates an obvious socio-political impracticality, they'll expose that their views are just selfish individualism dressed up as new-school, intellectual morality -- or as stated here: fascism."

"One of the bigger tactics I've seen lately is discrediting me as being uncharitable to their position; every time I've asked them to define what it means to be charitable, they tend to go silent or they pull out some bullshit excuse. So long as you're asking concise questions to summarise their position, you're being honest and charitable.  If they purposefully avoid answering any actual questions about their positions, you may have found someone who is trying to hide something. It's frustrating to deal with."
"Yeah those Fascists didn't change their minds after Charlottesville. They just learned that bluntly stating their opinions makes them unappealing to most people and have adapted a more dishonest, dog-whistly method.

"If you have a humiliating soul crushing job, or no job at all, and you self-image and social status is in the gutter, it must be very attractive to be told that you are actually member of a uniquely gifted group of people with a great destiny. That you should take pride in paintings, poetry and philosophy which you had no part in creating, and which you dont even know much about, because it was made by Your People. That high social status is you birthright, no matter how unemployed and in dept you may be. It is almost as if our soul crushingly depressing economic system is creating the conditions needed for this poison to spread."

"Where the fuq you get that killah wallpaper?"
"I agree with most of this but being concerned with the behaviour of Antifa is not a 'false equivalence' that argument is just a tactic to shut down criticism of antifa much like the tactics fascists use you outlined in this video. Antifa violence only leads to emboldening fascists, making them more violent, making them more likely to show up to their events armed ect. It also has harmed plenty of innocent people.  Antifa isn't what frightened the nazis back into hiding, almost universal criticism is what did that.   Antifa has been fighting nazis in Europe a lot longer than the US, it does not work. People will simply not support you if you condone or even refuse to outright condemn unnecessary violent acts.  If you wanna sit there and say antifa violence is somehow justified because of donald trump or whatever that is your right but don't be surprised when someone else gets killed in one of these public clashes. That is the outcome you helped create and you should own it if that's what you are going to do."

"Once again, I love everything in your video, Contra, amazing work as usual. :)  I would just add that a lot of the hallmarks which are now used by the alt-right are things which can be traced back to the origins of fascism. In fact, you can see it in the word itself, fascism comes from the Latin word 'fasces' meaning a bundle of rods or sticks which identifies a very common symbol from the Ancient Etruscans and was later adopted by Ancient Greece and Rome of a bundle of rods lashed tied together, often with an axe sticking out from the top. The fasces was a symbol of the state, many small rods coming together to become unbreakable with the axe representing the power the state wielded, but Mussolini adopted the fasces as a symbol of Italian Fascism as a way of illustrating his desire to return to the glory and power of the Roman Empire. Everything spelled out in this video has been a part of fascist and right-wing, nationalist movements from the very beginning, the adopting of seemingly-innocuous symbols, the desire to return to a romanticized, idealized past (you only need to look up a fantastic Roman historian named Mary Beard online to see that fascist still idolize Rome as a white state), but it also bares pointing out that the fasces can also be seen behind the podium of the United States House of Representatives."

"Isn't it nice when people act like you're a child because they disagree with you? Talking shit about centrists and liberals is a great way to make sure that they're not on the side of fascists..."
"I'm still not totally on board with the whole idea that fascists aren't entitled to the same first amendment rights as other people because their ultimate goal is destructive to the rights they will champion to destroy it. I'm not saying that they need to be allowed to propagate their beliefs without challenge, I fully support censoring fascists ideologues on websites like Youtube and Facebook or from speaking at universities and the like. Just because I support the rights that give fascists the ability to spout their hate doesn't mean I support giving them public platforms, just like I support the 4th amendment despite the fact that terrorists, pedophiles, and other detestable criminals also benefit from this same right. If it comes down to it, though, I'm more than willing to defend these freedoms with violence, but I won't do it unless absolutely necessary. It just seems like if we started violently suppressing fascists too readily or something it might set a precedent that can eventually spread to other ideologies that might seem destructive to society, like anarchists, communists, fundamentalists, etc.   We should combat fascist ideas by being aware of them, understanding them, and calling it out wherever we see it. Be obnoxious about it, constantly call it out, never let up. Never let fascism be normal. That's how we combat fascism without resorting to violence or sacrificing our own freedoms. Fascists aren't worth giving up freedoms to defeat, don't let them have even the smallest victory."

"oh gosh, there's some significant issues with this video  first of all, you're mixing up fascism and white nationalism. a 5 second google search already shows that you're describing the wrong thing under the wrong name. sure, white nationalists are fascists, but not all fascists are white nationalists. getting terminology like this correct is rather important for your credibility. Getting things like this wrong makes it easy for actual fascists to brand you as 'an idiot who doesn't even understand basic terminology'.  in strategy 1, you use a kafkatrapping fallacy.  A kafkatrapping fallacy basically means that denial of guilt is used as further evidence of guilt. So basically when you accuse someone of being a fascist, it'd be either 'yes I am' followed by you 'hah I knew it!', or with 'no I'm not' followed by you 'denying it just proves you're guilty of being a fascist!'.  This means that when someone gets accused, they'll be considered a fascist either way. And this is a problem, considering 'smashing fash' is very popular now. Basically, you can accuse someone of fascism, they can't deny it due to this logical fallacy, so they'll be considered a fascist and a target for punching.  You constantly talk down to centrists too, and eventually even say that 'they'll just pick the side of the fascists anyway'. You basically accuse any centrist of being a lowkey fascist, and with the above logical fallacy, they can't deny it to you either.  There's also a problem with the 'tu quoque' fallacy example you use considering centrists: mainly that centrists dislike either side and point towards both sides as using political violence. With your 'centrists are lowkey fascists' logic above, you're essentially making it that people that condemn BOTH fascists AND antifa are still 'fascist' solely because they criticise antifa, making criticism of antifa nigh impossible.  The entire problem comes down to the 'far left' (for lack of a better name) being excluding. If you disagree with the far left, the far left doesn't look at their own arguments, they just brand those disagreeing as opposition. By doing this, you won't ever convince anyone to join your side. Can you understand why saying stuff like 'centrists are lowkey fascists' is bad now? It won't convince anyone that your stance is right.  Another thing I want to note is that something I see often is leftists telling someone that something they said is racist/fascist/etc., but rarely want to explain what or why it's said thing, and instead not associate with someone like that. It links into the guilt by association you used in your first point: 'if someone associates with fascists, they are probably fascists', which sometimes makes leftists hesitant to have conversation about it (because conversation is association, even if both parties disagree). So as a general PSA: if you call out someone on something racist/fascist/etc., point out WHAT is racist/fascist/etc. about it. If you don't, the offender will never learn.  As for the free speech argument: I partially agree, bigotry and discrimination suck, and I'd like them banned too. The problem however is that you can both sweep with too wide of a brush and severely limit individual freedom (links into how it's become increasingly easy to accuse and brand someone as a 'fascist'), and that banning hateful speech can drive it underground instead, where it faces little to no resistance on being spread.  As much as I agree with your final statements, I don't think the rest of your video really reflects on what you say there. There's a lot of contradictions in both actions and argument, and it's important that leftists self-reflect on this and improve.  As a conclusion I want to say 4 general things: 1. initiating political violence will not make you look like a good person, regardless of the motives. 2. saying something is wrong or bad without giving arguments as to why will not convince people that those things are bad. 3. not having conversation with people will never convince them that you're right. 4. if lots of people disagree with you, it might not be the people, it might be your arguments.  I hope this isn't too harsh, since this was meant mostly as positive criticism.  If you've come this far, apologies for the rant."
"Nasdrovia, comrade.  Also, I wouldn't say a lot of centrist support for fascist speech comes from naivety but they might somewhat sympathize with the idea even if they are aware it is wrong. The evidence to me is the refusal of many centrists to admit there is such a thing as white privilege and many would just rather turn towards fascism rather than admit they have enjoyed one form of privilege or another."

I bet 4-chan will get this video taken down before the people who need to see this can watch it. Also didn't know about the ok sign as a new white nationalist symbol. You learn something new every day"
"It is difficult to keep up with all the nuances of the Alt-Right. I appreciate that some keep on top of this AND are aware of how delicately this mus be handled when trying to explain it to the 'normies'.  I don't visit 4chan, tumblr, etc, but sometimes I see stuff which I know has hidden meaning, I just don't know what the meaning is.  I am always wondering what my strategy should be to combat the Alt-Right and white supremacy. I am certainly not convinced the antifa is effective. In many cases it is actually counterproductive. Regardless, I have to decided to get engaged in the 'fight' against fascism.  Thanks for the video and ideas to ponder."

"Sargon fan here.  17:05 'But remember, SJWs don't actually value equality, diversity, or freedom. They only value collectivism, their resentments against other collectives and authoritarianism.'   You want to know why the centrists are siding with the nazis and against you on this one? Because honestly, you do not look too different at this point. You have been getting more and more overt in your aggression against us... the centrists.   You people keep assuming that you're harmless but you aren't."

"Your home is straight out of Twin Peaks @Contra"
"Thanks for the tools."
"This video is fucking amazing. Thank you Contra. So many people think fascist means 'KILL ALL JEWS AND BLACK PEOPLE'. Fascists are not that blunt or outright with their views. They shroud their views with euphemisms and appealing to tradition and white culture. Fascists are trying to suck in disillusioned conservative white people by appealing to their hatred of immigrants and they slowly get them to hate non-whites."
"I just found your channel yesterday, and really love it.  Your videos are amazing, and you are incredibly intelligent not to mention fashionable."

"Your lens seems to be causing an annoying white spot somewhere around the libertarian spot on a standard political compass.  Good video info-wise, somewhat lacking in the genius theater that normally sets you apart."
"As a center right libertarian, it's hard not to look at both sides and just say 'I hate all of you' and then shrivel up into a tiny ball and play guitar all day. I hate all this fucking white identitarian authoritarian nazi bullshit and how it's trying to slide by with more legitimate right wing ideas, but I also hate the authoritarian, and often plainly communist ideologies of a lot of the far left, and how it's trying to slide by with more legitimate left wing ideas. And then it feels like both sides are trying to pressure people in the middle into just choosing the horrible ideology they disagree with slightly less, which seems directly counterproductive towards the ultimate goal of pursuing a happy life. It's frustrating.  Also, looking great Contra, nice video. :) Hope you're pursuing a happy life...whatever the hell that means."

"oooooooooh :/ I agree with the core of what you are saying, but I feel you run the risk of sounding like 'ANYONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE EXTREME LEFT ARE FASCISTS AND NAZIS!!!111!!' Some people do genuinely mean well. The problem with preventing fascism is walking a tightrope to get the people who don't want fascism to avoid such paths, and to get those actual fascists to be shown. When you call people who mean well fascists (or you call almost everyone a fascist) it gets others who are not to join some real fascists. Take Lauren Southern for example she is most likely (I say most likely because I am not her and I don't know what she thinks) not a fascist; saying she is causes people to think you are attacking their currently non fascist opinions, thus moving them more to the right having experienced this false accusation."
"As someone who is a bit of a centrist, I just don't get why centrists are still ignoring the alt right. I am not a big fan of a lot of elements of left wing identity politics (mostly the use of the coercive power of the state to achieve their ends), but the alt right is by far a bigger threat. A movement centered on black or trans gendered identity just does not have the potential to appeal to the whole American population (since most Americans don't fit into these groups). If one looks at the most successful populist power grabs in history they have appealed to the majority of the population, both communist and fascist movements (particularly Nazism) were probably successful because they appealed to the fears of the majority of the population. A movement focused on white identity does have this potential and centrists need to recognize this danger and prioritize combating the alt right."
"You look so pretty in this video. I had a difficult time concentrating on the message."
"*sigh* Here we go again : calling everyone you don't like or who doesn't want more immigration a Nazi is defamatory, and inciting people to do so (as you're doing with this video) is inflammatory... But I shouldn't expect more from a clueless - gender confused - Bolshevist sympathizer such as yourself. Please stop making our entire civilization pay for your painfully obvious existential problems."
"Got it. If anyone ever questions or criticizes me, I'll be able to tell they're a fascist, even if they deny it. Seems easy enough.      /s"
"but I really do wonder what is so wrong with wanting to preserve european culture. We have struggled hard to design a culture that values individual freedom, female equality and even recognizing gay rights. And it isnt racist because there are many non whites enjoying the freedom and is a strong part of our society.   and the introduction of people who dont recognize those freedoms and in fact, have a culture that want to rip all we spent the 20th century fighting for down and bring us back into the dark ages.  Thats how I feel  Seeing this video I feel that it is just a bunch of stupid fear mongering and made me lose some respect for you. Sorry Contra. But, we cant silence free speech and these fascists are no threat. they wont recruit but a bunch of fringe losers in life. But nothing gives them a cause more than if they are under attack and now they can claim free speech. Good work and if you think they are on the retreat think again. This has emboldened them.  Let them speak, let the world hear what they have to say. Few will really follow them if they can hear these people speak.  But if you feel that fascist ideology is appealing to the mass, then you need to think about that and about the nazis being stopped with violence. Well it was all met with violence as it grew. The Nasis or NSDAP grew though all of the street violence of the 20s and 30s when they were met by the social democrats and the german communist.  and it didnt stop them. It all gave the nazis a cause to spread fear. and I see people like you falling into the trap again  Contra, the answer is our laws. Use police to stop anyone who engages in violence no matter if its from the left or the right. We have laws, we have cops and we have prisons. Preserve our nation, preserve our laws. Dont rip them apart for a few fringe radicals. We dont need to engage in violence to stop them. Thats what police are for charlottesville wouldnt have hapened if there was a strong police presence to stop the violence before it ever started. But the police withdrew, allowed antifa to collide with the white supremacist. What did they think would happen"
"From what I've noticed is that liberals are generally unable to preserve their own societies because they tolerate ideas that seek the destruction of liberal democracy. And in fact liberals will flock to fascism when crises pop up because fascism promises to protect 'western' values, which liberals think means liberal democracy, but really fascists are simply talking about white people."

"Loved this video, possibility your best work yet! Keep it up!"
"I agree with most points, but I do think the freedom of speech argument is valid since, well, it's true. If you push people into the shadows, they will only use it as ammo.  I also somewhat agree with the 'why doesn't the media talk about leftist violence?' argument. The mainstream media LOVES it when ANTIFA does something. However, the media has a panic attack when the right does something that isn't even violent, but simply talks. I agree that it isn't fair to compare fascist violence to anti fascist violence, but people could at least demonize violence on both side."
"So, the pragmatic goal of making the alt-right pallatable is to become republicans, neoliberals and libertarians and guide those groups to their long term goals?"
"Awesoooooome!!!"
"Okay, so the point of free speech is that it's universal. To defend the right to free speech for one group and disparage another for speaking freely defeats the purpose. By all means, disagree with them, argue with them. Beating the shit out of each other and de-platforming one another isn't the way to go about it."
"Interesting video..."
"To be honest, I expected this to be an SJW 'everyone who disagrees is a fascist!!!' type of video and was both surprised and impressed by the level of research put into this. You really know your thing. What you are talking about is a very difficult topic, it's not black and white, fascists do use 'normal' behaviour to cover up dangerous extremism but non-fascists also tend to make fun of them by making fun of their symbols and thus using them and you truly done it justice. Though, as a centrist, it makes me wonder why do you seem to think that all centrists are naive and gullible? The centrists I know, including myself, are against ANY kind of extremism and thus very wary of it and wary of being grouped with extremists. Just curious what led you to this conclusion because from this video I felt like centrist = politically clueless or undecided. Thank you if you find time to respond."
"11/10"

"Antifa, people who wear masks, hold weapons, use violence to push their political agenda.......hmmmmmm ....what does that sound like? It is the very definition of terrorism. Also, just dismissing everyone as a fascist or Nazi because they don't agree with antifa is always used throughout history to create a fake class of subhumans so they can hurt and murder them without remorse. It was the same exact tactics the Nazis used against others. The same tactics that antifa and bam are using now."

"It doesn't matter that you're able to recognize these things.  You and I are merely swept along by the cliodynamic waves.  Trends and forces behind them are far more powerful than these individuals and small groups.  The fate of the Alt Right does not depend upon these individuals but upon its willingness to align itself with the observable patterns of history as they play out."
"Okay. I got it. A fascist is only one who believes in the unity of the european or white race and western culture is only white.   And only whites can be fascist. The baathaists were not fascist at all. Neither was Mubarak a fascist and Erdogan is really not a fascist.  I think you need to rethink what you consider a fascist because there are a hell of a lot of fascist today and many hard line fascist regimes in power, but they arent white so they dont really matter, except for those living in fear under those regimes."

"I'm only a few mins in so idk if this is mentioned in the video but I wanted to point out another fascist trick: CLAIMING TO BE A CENTRIST   I've noticed lots of people call themselves moderates or centrists in a way to seem unbiased yet they emphatically defend fascist talking points. Kinda like an antifeminist who's obsessed with being called an egalitarian. Popular quotes among centrists include,  'I hate the KKK and BLM equally'"

"What disgusts me (as a Conservative) is that these racists pigs have 'right' as a descriptor.  The German side of my family was devestated by World War 2.  My grandfather was a young police officer in Munich, just starting his career in 1936.  Next thing he knew, 3 years later, he was marching into Poland behind the German Army to serve with an occupation force that brought 'German Justice' to the Polish people.  He witnessed his countrymen engaged in atrocities that haunted him till his death.  By the way most of those German Police went right back into service after the war, which still baffles me.  One of my great uncles spent 7 years in a Russian Gulag, another died in combat in Russia, and the rest of my family suffered the destruction of Germany.  These Alt. Right bastards have no idea what they are asking for chanting 'blood and soil'.  They don't understand or fail to acknowledge the misery that their idiotic ideology brings.  This country is a diverse melting pot of different races, creeds, and backgrounds....that's what makes us great!"

You like most of the left ignore how dangerous SJWs ideaology and Antifia types are which is the reason many have gone in the opposite direction, congratulations you are the reason we have a alt right, being anti pc wasnt a thing until you guys pushed pcism well over the top.  Also a lot of winks to commies in ur videos should we use the same methods you used in the video that you are signalling you are a commie? After they are worse than the nazis."
"So should the same apply to communists? A lot of them want to implement their classless utopia by force, and if they had the chance, they would kill millions of people too. Of course democratic socialists/ social democracy advocates wouldn't want that , but by this logic, we should be suspicious of everyone. Similarly, a lot of feminists and blm people have advocated for and said pretty awful things in the past, but somehow that's just excused?"

"Love your music choices!"
"Great points, but western civilization ≠ white supremacy. Western civilization is a collection of artistic, philosophic, and legal traditions firmly grounded in Greek and Roman antiquity and later, the enlightenment.  These ideas emphasize the importance of individualism, rationalism, democracy, liberty, and capitalism in constructing just societies. While these ideas emerged in Europe and have their roots in Christianity, they do not necessarily have a racial component. That's what the fascists get wrong. Saying that 'western civilization' is a dog whistle sells short some of the core political and economic principals that have made our society successful. I hate Nazis too, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater."
"WTF? Those rat bastards ruined the OK sign, too? I fucking LOVE the OK sign! I guess I have to give it up... its been real, OK sign. One last time before the Nazis take you for good. 👌"
"Neo-Nazis = SJWs = BLM. They are ALL terrorist groups who promote violence, crime, bigotry, and hate. And because these three terrorist groups get the most media coverage, it's a no wonder why everyone thinks everyone is a racist.  Blacks think all whites are racist because of the Neo-Nazis. Whites think all blacks are racist because of BLM. SJWs think literally everyone is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ect, including themselves as modern Feminism is proving lately. If these three terrorist groups were made illegal then that would stop all of the drama. Real leftists, not extreme leftists, will be brought back into power, allowing for reasonable discussion between them and real right wingers, not the extreme right wingers since they will be just as illegal as extreme leftists."
"While I love the video, and agree with almost everything, I have doubts that fascism is, especially currently, focused on antisemitism.   Even though it is a huge part, I see a lot of people that can recognize anti semitism as wrong (because they can easily empathize with jews, i guess because they know and live with jews and know they are not monsters), but are completely ok with 'fascist practices' against minorities. I think going forward fascists are dialing down on the anti semitism (at least until they get to power), and dialing up the rest.   So, even though we should not forget the antisemitism, and of course recognize the horrors of holocaust, if antisemitism is the criteria for recognizing a fascist, their crypto tactics become a lot easier.  Anyway, thanks for the video, as always."

You dont have to know someone is secretly a facist, in order to see the flaws in their policy recommendations. Trying to gage a persons 'identity' by analyzing 'dog whistels' is just a recipe for mischaracterization and false flags. Judge their work, not their identity. A facist is still capable of putting forth sensible policies that can be beneficial to our nation, their identity doesnt exclude them from that possibility."

"Oh good lord, the edgelord in a cheap suit from that video fails to understand identity in classical or even medieval culture.  I absolutely promise you that nationalism was not a driving force in any of the movements he cites and even in the case of Rome wasn't the overriding factor...  but the ties that bound were in fact familial and tribal.  Which is not an endorsement of identity politics but should be taken as a statement that when you try to create policies around shrinking the size of what is to be considered your 'community' there is no natural reason to stop at the wider ethnic(German), nation(Germany) or even state(Brandenburg) level rather than engage in full blown tribalism within any of those communities.  And another thing, I am sick and tired of lazy ass schlubs who have done absolutely nothing of note or accomplishment in their own life trying to claim the accomplishments of people they almost certainly aren't descended from or even related to that occurred centuries ago as if they had anything to do with it.  My great-uncle was Ty Cobb...  I'm not constantly going on about how awesome my family or I am at stealing bases or getting hits.  I don't think anyone outside my family knows that because it's a stupid thing to brag about and otherwise isn't going to come up in casual conversation.  Come on folks, stand on your own two feet...  live and die by your own works and your own accomplishments.  If you try to live your entire life off someone else's laurels you will inevitably become just another member of the forgotten shortly after your own death.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with honorable anonymity but it's clearly not what these folks are hoping for.  Love the video, Contra."

He showed me pictures of an SS uniform he bought, a Nazi hat, and like the first Nazi party armbands. And after class ended he was arguing that the National Socialist Party was socialist. It was such a weird experience. So I guess I have to turn him into a comrade very slowly like I did with some of my friends"

Nazi/kkk and any other blanket label insinuating such is lazy, disingenuous,  and a fantastic way to get ppl who dont wanna ban words/burn books (wether its the 1930's or today, you goose stepping morons will never cease to amaze me) hurt, incarcerated, or dropped down the memory hole. If you like blanket-labelling of *non-conformists* , just call them *'INFIDELS'*   Ima do you a real favor with this one, мой немного Фашист. Dont complicate shit. just come out and say it:  'Do as we do, think as we do, and you wont. get.  *HURT.* '  💔  God damn, the digital burning of content today is exactly the same as the book burnings in 1930s germany. I hope, i sincerely hope,  *you* Фашист types wake up and realize what youve been pushed into before you kill 27.5 million of those 'subhuman' ppl, and annihilate 7 million of these other 'subhuman' ppl  because 'reasons.'    You are a weak minded, priviliged, bourgeois debutant.  Its amazing how throughout history, its *always* been priviliged upscale ppl like you, who just have the temerity to tell us little people what to say, do, think, and believe whilst reserving the right to mete out  arbitrary, violent punishments for even 'feeling' like one of us peasants 'broke the rules'.  How dare anyone have a right to have a mind of their own, say what they want,  and choose their path in life. Im so glad the bourgeoisie are here to tell us little people should think and live. 💔 Спасибо,  фашисты"

"Wait, you seem to be describing white ethnonationalism and not fascism. After all, it seems you can have fascism that isn't necessarily white ethnonationalism, like Peronism, which didn't include the racial categories of Nazism. (Nationalist authoritarian corporatism is like, pretty much the definition of fascism imo.) The current trend of white ethnonationalism in the U.S. does not seem to involve the kind of authoritarian corporatism that other fascist movements involved. Current alt-right, Spencer-like folks are just white ethnonationalists, which is neither necessary nor sufficient for them to be labelled as fascists. Perhaps you can label them Nazis, but that's playing fast and loose with a term that has a very specific referent. (Neo-Nazi might be more productive, but I'm not sure if that term is incredibly stringent.)   I find a lot of this semantic looseness troubling, since it involves just labeling some political movement as Nazi or fascist and then refusing to engage with it. However, the alt-right and smarter individuals within it, like Spencer, can simply point out the stuff that I did above, resisting the label of fascism/Nazism. In doing so, Spencer makes his view look more sophisticated and his opponent stupid, because this has been their opponent's only line of attack. Angela Nagle has pointed this out many times, and her solution is to move from identitarian de-platforming/call-out culture to more informed debate to show that most of the tenets of Spencer's position are immoral  and infeasible. Making Spencer look like an idiot is the way to defeat the alt-right, and the best way to do that is to make propaganda involving debate. White ethnonationalism is morally abhorrent and anti-American, and that is the end of it; there's no reason to create trumped-up charges of fascism or Nazism, especially when doing so can distract from the immorality of white ethnonationalism itself.  EDIT: plz no bully centrists, some of us aren't normies"
"with all do respect contra, using the lee atwatre quote is ridiculus, of all the reasons to want lower taxes, the most common of which is just wanting to keep your money, what percentile of this do you think it super covert racists? this seems like a tactict to lump anyone who is for smaller goverment or belives in the constituttion as a possible racist."
"Great video (so much better informed than any hysterical Sargon video on politics). I hope it gets millions of views. But I do have one correction - as far as I can tell, liberals, and not Trump or fascists, came up with the term 'alt-left' as a way of deriding Bernie Sanders style progressives."
"Amazing video Contra, and such an important one as well. It's so easy for some people to not recognize how this fascist rhetoric is having a very harmful effect. I think most people dislike fascists, but their inability to spot one (through no real fault of their own) is a huge hurdle which we have to overcome. The lessons of WWII can not be forgotten. It's crazy how often we let fascists dictate the conversation. They constantly use confusion and misdirection whenever anyone gets close to cornering them. I myself have become increasingly frustrated with how many people are failing to spot these disgusting excuses for human beings. However, I must not forget my empathy. I was once headed down this road. I used to be quite the anti-feminist. However, as I began to listen more to what they had to say, I saw what was really happening. I so easily dismissed death threats because that's what those around me did. But when I really sat down and thought how I would feel in that situation, it was like an epiphany. Not to mention understanding my own sexuality lead me to realise these people I was associating with do not want me. They only use my identity when it suits them, to insult Islam. They don't care about Christians who persecute LGBT+ people. It's a false attempt to appeal to LGBT+ centrists. Ironically, it's a perfect example of virtue signalling. They shame homophobia not because they actually care about LGBT+ people, but because they want to appear better. They want people to rally with them. To rally with hate."

"when we get to the point where wanting to pay lower taxes is a secret racist dog whistle i think we got to a silly point. the same with immigration reform. this account of  'dog whistiling.' is for practical purposes saying that if anyone is right of center is a suspected racist ( shout out to tariq nashead.) and the defense of ' im not saying there a racist im just saying thats what a racist would say. oh and denying your a racist is also what a racist would say.' is really not going to cut it, most of the people you mentioned have overt and obvious reasons why there facist, richard spencer advocates shiping non-whites out of the country, jared taylor openly admits he wants a white ethno-state. even someone like sargon who is flirty with the alt  right talkes about a muslim tax. so this idea that there is any serious threat of ultra covert facist is just untrue on the right at least, the left is a diffreint story."
"1:30 Your rebuttals of ideas one and three, out of the three mentioned ideas are simply unconvincing. The counter arguments you made on these points are rebutted quite easily. But predictably you just double down on the shame tactics and silencing. This is what draws centrist to the alt right."
"shoulda did this video with a tinfoil hat on your head tbh.  (ily tho. good content. even tho this video made me roll my eyes more than i thought was humanly possible) love the aesthetic"
"Anyone remember that Cult of Dusty drama way back? It feels like a thousand years ago."
"That TV is scary"
"While there is some truth what is said here, this video is little more than the expression and instigation of paranoia. Fascists don't spread fascism or gain power by being 'ironic' they do it though violence and through exploiting crises. The best defense against fascism (and other extremist ideologies) is the prevention of violence and to improve peoples lives. Indeed, attempts of trying to play 'spot the Nazi' is likely to be counterproductive since it pushes people away from 'the left' and radicalizes crypto-fascists and their sympathizers."
"Remember that fascist hate the global poor.   This is not a dog whistle 🎷🐷, this is a pig sax"
"Fascism isn't inherently european, I think this is important to stress. Fascism is possible in non-european cultures as well. Remember imperial Japan?"
"This is spot on!! I've been obsessing over these people constantly, and I'm glad there's a video that points them out. The gaslighting is strong with them."
"kind of expected you to smash the glass in the end"
"I have a relatively mild criticism of what you said here.  When you're talking about how facsists are constantly shifting their language, I feel like it's important to point out that they are actually trying to appeal to people more moderate than they are (implying that they can't get anywhere with their core base of support).  99% of literally everyone thinks fascism is gross, and they have to appeal to those people by appropriating their terminology.   When they say 'western civilization,' they  mean 'majority-white countries,' but the reason they're using that phrase is because a lot of people think of something completely different when they hear it. You're only dog-whistling to the people who can hear the dog whistle, not to most of the people who hear you and think you're saying something else.  Richard Spencer even mentioned this in the clip you showed at the beginning:  'We're often told that being an American, or a Briton, or a German or any European nationality is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords: democracy, freedom, tolerance...'  Translation: 'While the majority of people [the group subtly mentioned via the passive voice in this sentence] think that being American is about freedom and democracy, I think it's about being white.'   There are actually people who use terms like 'Western civilization' to mean something that doesn't mean 'white people,' which is why fascists appropriate the terminology.  My point is that you can't infer that someone is actually a fascist when they say something like that, and I think it's  really dangerous to go around labeling everyone who uses a term approrpriated by Nazis as a Nazi.  It's more like your ears should kind of perk up when they say something like that, but it doesn't mean they're actually a fascist.    The whole point of shifting the terminology is obfuscation, so that when you take a shot in the dark, you hit someone you didn't mean to hit.  I'm worried that suddenly saying 'Aha, you used this term appropriated by Nazis!  Fascist! Racist!  White supremacist!' will actually *help* Nazis, not hurt them, by lumping them in with the people who actually aren't down with the white ethnostate or Holocaust denial.  Demanding clarification from fascists and pointing out how vague they're being when they fail to clarify [because their actual beliefs are completely monstrous], is more effective than stabbing someone in the gut who might not be a Nazi.  If we keep saying that there are secretly Nazis everywhere, it's going to make us sound like paranoid, delusional nutcases."
"Question: How do you tell the difference between someone who feigns holding moderate positions to remain 'crypto', and someone who genuinely holds moderate positions? For example, Ben Shapiro won't shut up about how awesome 'Western civilization' is. So based on this video, I should suspect Shapiro of being a secret white nationalist jew."
"a+ vid a+ outfit a+ fritz a+ screencap good stuff ps trans life suits you"
"I do agree with a lot of what you say here but I feel as if there is some nuance missing when it comes to the nature of left-wing violence. Look at any footage of antifa or speak to any of their members and it's clear that the group dog-whistles just as much for communism as the alt-right does for fascism. Communism is a demonstrably more dangerous ideology than national socialism and white supremacy. And I think that framing antifa as simply opposed to fascism and racism is dishonest as they clearly have a political agenda of their own that they would like to see implemented 'by any means necessary'. The same tactics that you describe here are clearly in play on the left as well. Many alt-righters have openly stated that they use tactics that they've seen work on the left i.e. identity politics and coded language. You can say that you're opposed to fascism, but when you use violence to advance an equally murderous and authoritarian agenda, does it really matter if it's not based on race? I don't know your opinion on communism and I don't think that you necessarily approve of much of antifa's tactics but I am disappointed when you apologize for groups that are just as, if not more, violent and manipulative (even if their ideology is more appealing) as fascists. This isn't meant to be a 'gotcha'. Just my 2 cents. Love your videos and would love to hear a response from you."
"You completely lost me when you started talking about 'hidden fascist symbols' and listed Pepe the Frog and the OK sign. Even the Anti-Defamation League has said the OK symbol as fascist communication was a hoax developed by 4Chan. Why you even referenced a /pol/ post in this video AT ALL just blows me away."
"/pol/ is so much more tolerable when read out in Shaun's charming tones."
"You didn't contra any alt right points though... I don't get it"
"most boards on 4chan actually hate /pol/"
"Great video! That was a good point about irony, I found myself guilty of it too (with communism/socialism) in hindsight."
"has your take on far left violence changed since Charlottesville?"
"That /pol/ post is exactly what the extreme right in france is doing. Hiding their inner racism and put on makeup to win populist votes and appeal to the average guy, and refuse any actual debate where a rationnal argument can corner you. Marine le Pen kicked out her father of the extreme right party because he openly showed how antisemitic and racist he was, but the party leaders are all as bad if not worst. They are much smarter than him though and won many votes that way, but their end goal is exactly the same."
"throughout this video you talk about liberals and describe yourself as a leftist; so just out of curiosity, what are your economic views?"
"I take issue with the othering terms used liberally in this video such as 'they/them'. The ideology is bad, any individual is just as much a potential ally as they are a potential enemy, individuals are capable of being converted/reformed, as well as radicalised."
"I’m spreading this everywhere."
"Absolutely fantastic, entertaining and educational vid with great points. Also: Holy shit the zoom-in when Franz changes to the MAGA cap was really frightening and powerfull. Thank you for this!"
"Good video. But I find it sort of weird that you seem to divide the political spectrum into alt-right, centrists/liberals, and leftists. Where is the mainstream right/conservatives in all this? Are they centrists? Are they fascists?  I sort of worry that this fringe of the right are stealing the attention while the republican party are destroying the world."
"REALLY great video.   I also really recommend the book Against the Fascist Creep, as it goes deep into yet another strategy, which is co-opting far-left (environmentalism and anti-capitalism lately, see Varg and Harold Covington) movements and music subcultures (most famous being skinheads, but also extreme metal and to a lesser extent hardcore punk scenes).    Altho it's not always co-opting, sometimes framing.  For a while the Italian fascists took it to the point of outright terrorism with what they called the strategy of tension where they bombed and murdered ppl, blaming it on leftists.  Then there's the whole Ukrainian nazi problem, some of whom are literally aligned with ISIS, they don't even bother to hide it.  THESE guys are being helped by fucking NATO."
"God dammit Natalie.  Save some talent for the rest of us."

"Eh, doesn't your intro describe white nationalism, not fascism? Fascism doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the white race, or jews."
"interresting video but can you please stop with the avant-garde wannabe style"
"this is the first video i've ever watched from you. the style of it is so impressive and the information is presented in such a clear and understandable way without it seeming like youre talking down to your audience. really really great stuff"
"'This doesn't cause centrists to become allies with fascists, that happens regardless'   OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH"
"Bring back the gulags"
"meanwhile here in europe we would not think that there is only one culture"
"lol The racists' plan is to become the thing they hate most: PC. They are more accurately termed 'neo-nazis'. They say they love white people, but whites are the most left-wing 'race' on the planet. The far-right hates everyone."
"A lot of centrist beliefs mean that there must be a balance in ideas, hence why there must be an 'alt-left' that's just as bad as the alt-right and both are as bad as each other. It doesn't matter that one side wants to commit genocide and the other side want to stop them, each side have to be equally bad so that they can remain central and, thus, reasonable."
"Mother of my life, Contra, makes another great vid what a surprise"
"Why do all of contrapoint's new videos seem to be bad acid trips of a person trying to talk sense to you? Not that I'm complaining, I love the style, it just seems perfectly trying to give that impression"
"Contra your so hot xd Totally homo"
"Looks like the OK symbol thing is actually a 4chan hoax designed specifically to make leftists look like paranoid delusionals? Maybe that tactic should have made the video, because it's looking pretty effective from here.   https://www.adl.org/blog/no-the-ok-gesture-is-not-a-hate-symbol"
"Damn, that is some quality lighting. Good show, that woman.  (I want to make a 'Dick Spencer on Stormfront-Dot-Wang' eggplant emoji joke, but... now is probably not the time)"
"You are frickin brilliant and incredibly talented!"
"I've spotted out Red State dog whistling a long time ago. 'Illegal immigrants', 'Radical Islamic', 'law & order', 'state's rights', 'personal responsibility', 'protecting history/culture', 'family values' and so on and so forth. So when the fascists came with their 'Idenitarian' non-sense I could I see it a mile away."
"A fashist is someone who is fashionable."
"I really like the new set. I'm a bit concerned w/ cosplaying as a fascist at the beginning, but I can kind of understand the direction.  Enjoyed the video, nonetheless  --dirak"
"Nice presentation as ever.👌  Violence =/= fascism...so many seem to not understand this. I've been nothing short of astonished as the degree to which the general populace have (by proxy) sided with Nazi's. I knew a great deal of centrist and libs were bad, but not to this extent."
"11:00: I'm pretty sure assassins of Russian ambassadors already have that one lol"
"Is ContraPoints the David Lynch of YouTube?"
"I tried so hard to watch this but its way too cringe"
"NIce video, but it needs more weird,  more drinking, and   more queerness"
"You are beautiful in every way an this is the video the US needs right now."
"dark mother, please become a tankie, it's lit!"
"Does anybody else notice the irony of the alt right hating multi-culturalism when a lot of them praise Christianity, a religion which was developed by a man of Jewish ancestory in Palestine? Even their own worldview can't escape the fact that cultures one in way or another mix and interact with each other."
"brilliant, brilliant analysis. youve expressed so much I've had in my mind but haven't been able to put into words. however, given all you've said here, the next question is: how exactly do we fight back?"
"Lol @ Caligula clip"
"I really think a lot of these people are mentally ill. Richard Spencer has that little psychopath smirk when he says something that any normal person would understand is evil."
"I don't like the part where you say that if somebody denies he's a nazi they're probably a nazi, like sure, a facist would deny that, but only because everyone else would too.   the rest of the video is fine, carry on."
"I'm curious, how did you get the video to play on the CRT?"
"Contra, you are a goddess."
"Interesting video. I know you made a point about false equivalency but it seems like the fascists you describe use logical fallacies to gain support so they can establish their goals without others realizing their ethnostate endgame."
"I inadvertently ended up friends with a neonazi who had been trying to 'red pill' the anti-SJW sphere for a while, and I was naive enough to believe he was just a simple trump supporter. It turned out there were a couple more like this within that sphere, and after catching onto them I also noticed many of the tactics being used against me by this youtuber and his friends that are outlined in the video.  There's a couple of other things that need to be taken into account on top of this that some experience with this in practise over the past year-ish has given me:  1) It's not all about unintentional naivete. It's often about tribalism and the rose-tinted attitude one can have towards friends. The internet is a harsh place and people stick together. It's easier for a group of centrists to purge the leftist criticising everyone and accusing a guy of being a fascist than it is for them to admit to themselves that a friend they have a legitimate connection with is actually duping them. It's easier to fool a man than convince him he has been fooled.  2) In politics, especially online, there are many shitposters, trolls, edgelords and commentators who only profit from greater instability. DO NOT assume everyone is a naive individual who is being duped or really even cares about the positions they advocate. A lot of the people defending/protecting fascists have no investment in politics at all and are just here to cause as much chaos as they can.  3) Laugh in the face of danger, don't fall to intimidation. Doxing, threats, and actual potential violence are all something many activists fear. The best way to make yourself a lower priority target is to convince people and act like you're not afraid of it. Make your name public, tell them to come at you.... and they won't. Don't make a big deal out of any attempts either, it's hard for the shitlords to make out you're a 'triggered SJW over mean words on the internet' when you're visibly amused by people trying to shut you down."
"tHe fReE mARkEt oF iDeAs"
"This is a great video, but I'd like to offer one correction: fascists didn't invent the term alt-left, liberals did. In an attempt to discredit anyone to the left of Hillary, liberal pundits attempted to equate those fighting for universal healthcare and economic justice with literal fascists. It backfired as soon as the right got a hold of it, but its origin is with the complacent center-left."
"Love this. Super informative.  Also you look gorgeous Nat."
"Wow, you got me."
"Totally unrelated but nice wallpaper."
"End capitalism, end the far right! Without one, the other can't survive"
"Another good if not somewhat controversial video."
"liberals get the bullet too"
"Politics is war of contradicting desires. Fascists want to be commanded. We should command them to their graves."
"I hate when people take an intelligent video and reduced it to the person making it being hot but... Your hair is looking freakin amazing in this video. 😍"
"when's the next antifa meet"
"1:10 Oh fuck off. I don't like the alt-right any more than you do, but don't try to associate cultural conservatism with fascism.  I've seen this argument many times before, and it's one of the least intellectually honest talking points I've ever seen."
"the chess at the end ❤ brilliant"
"Used to think you were one of the sensible es-jay-dubul-yous but holy shit have you lost it. You been living in an echo chamber so long you're terrified of emerging from it cause you'll find the right-leaning are mostly just average decent people. 90 % of which were forced into there  Now your fear of reconciling this has made you become just another LL (lunatic leftie) who's bought into the circus cause it's more comforting than dealing with the nuances of reality. Most people don't care about politics. Most people are just shitposters and shitstirrers. Most people just want to have fun and not worry about being trapped in this encroaching Orwellian state   Most people *just want to live their lives in peace * cause they've noticed there is no oppression in the West, save for the one put-upon us by the ruling elites of society - but their boot pushes down on all EQUALLY. That is where everyone's source of frustration stems from.   You might dress peculiar and you might act slightly peculiar, but when all is said and done - you are utterly mundane. Superficially obfuscating that you consist of nothing of substance. A veneer of garish to cover an underlay of droll. You are utterly tedious. Generically lame. And dull. You're little more than a completely average guy. A *normie* trying to disguise yourself as a non-normie  You. Snowflake."
"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"CONTRA YOU ARE AESTHETIC QUEEN"
"omg Trump doing the ok symbol thing blew my mind"
"Why not have a debate and smash them though? Let them de-platform themselves when they look like a tool.  *Not referring to Roaming Milennial and her Richard Spencer ass kiss session."
"I haven't watched the entire video yet but god damn the aesthetic you have is fucking beautiful It looks like you streamlined everything thats great about a Clarence Clarity video"
"YES the academic, no-BS Contra is my favorite Contra! I mean, I love a drunk Sims stream, but these types of videos are my favorite."
"I haven't done coke for like 15 years, but if I relapse, I want to do it with Contra.  I would realistically settle for espresso, though."
"You should be a horror director. Great video."
"I notice that a lot of people, like you in this video, think that fascism = nazism: they are different idealogies, terrible in different ways. Other than that, good work ;)"
"Seeing Contrapoints upload makes a bad day good. Thank you, dark mother!"
"That shade towards Lauren Southern tho"
"I see the Foldable Human tactic of filming two times backfired on you a little bit (or it was something else?), but, as a viewer, I really appreciate the effort. You'll get there!"
"I completely disagree with the idea that the Alt Right is trying to appeal to centrists and it's getting to a point where if you're not either on the Alt Right or Antifa you're a piece of shit to either side, i don't like this 'you're with us or against us' ideals right now and think it's pretty shitty."
"Lauren southern isn't a fascist"
"Why won't White Nationalists realize the reason that 'white culture' doesn't have the same amount of enthusiasm as minority cultures is because when people are opressed, they band together to try and form something greater than them."
"Phenomenal video, possibly your best. Will definitely bluepill some people.  Have you considered making a video talking about the right's weird hatred for contemporary art and music? If you don't, I definitely will."
"The way you 'advertised' fascism is the same as the justification for the modern social justice and feminist movements. These groups and forced ideologies are the reason why the next generation is more conservative. They're tired of being called racist and sexist. The milk and okay sign were jokes mocking the leftists who wrote articles saying that said things were racist. Antifa and BLM led to the emboldening of white nationalists. BLM and Antifa are fascistic terrorists by definition."
"Prepare to mirror everyone"

"No, don't take away my eggplant emoji."
"Nice to see my home town on the list of removed statues."
"So the alt-right is _Fight Club._"
"Didn't the okay sign use to be a communist symbol? I know it's supposed to mean 'white power', but for many decades it has meant 'workers of the world unite'. This realisation has lowkey mindfucked me - I mean if the same thing is a symbol for two opposing ideologies, is it even a symbol?"
"I have some concerns that people will have enough motivated reasoning here that your thesis may not land among the intended audience (I think that crowd may require this to be even more agonizingly piecemeal).  However I do like the addition of your commentary about how some of these rhetorical strategies are purposefully set up in order to  prepare the whole 'oh see the left thinks EVERYTHING is racist' response. I have a feeling that of anything in this video, that has the best chance of landing with people. That is, people *may* be willing to entertain the idea that others would use their dislike of a group to manipulate them.   Great work as always!  PS: on the topic of racist hair... I have a very similar haircut to Richard Spencer. It is one of the only haircuts that leaves my head looking remotely in proportion to my body. Also I have been one of your Patrons since like December. So... that lets me keep the haircut right? That's how this works?"
"Spencer is planning to appear at UF! Guys if you live in FL, we need to counter protest against him. His beliefs shouldnt be welcomed on campus."
"I wish Nazi Contra wasn't the sexiest Contra..."
"Race war's been repackaged into the culture war thanks to people like William Lind and those that have let him. White Genocide becomes, the Great Replacement, and so on, all so a younger audience can latch onto these ideas without understanding their gravitas until they're 3/4 in the rabbit hole.   To quote Richard Spencer: 'Millennials are arising in a period where no one at that table remembers the second world war. That might seem banal or meaningless, but it absolutely is profound and meaningful. It means that they are able to get out from under this massive black cloud. This massive anvil of guilt that has been weighing down our people. This massive black cloud called Hitler or Auschwitz or the Holocaust or what ever. Because at the end of the day facts don't matter'.  That's why videos like this, serving as a reminder are paramount. Shining a light on what they believe, what their beliefs have led to in the past is the best line of defence for this kind of nonsense. Western culture is, a melting pot. This is what European culture is. And if they don't like it, they can leave."

"[Edit] RESPONSE TO CRITICISM: The biggest (often intentional, I'm guessing) misunderstanding of this video is that I think saying 'I'm not a fascist' means you are a fascist. No. Saying 'I didn't kill him, your honor' doesn't mean you killed him. But it's not in itself definitive proof you didn't either. The point is this: fascists have good reasons to deny being fascists, so they often do. Thus, denial isn't proof of innocence (and neither is it proof of guilt, of course). This ought to be really obvious. But people so often say, 'Richard Spencer says he's not a white supremacist.' As if that proves it.  The other major misunderstanding is that I think anyone who uses dog-whistles like 'Western culture,' Kekistan, etc., is a fascist. But of course I don't. The reason fascists use dog-whistles is to appear less like fascists, to blend in with non-fascists. If everyone who used the dog-whistles was a fascist, the strategy wouldn't work. This is so obvious and so clear in the video that I can only think people are being deliberately obtuse to misrepresent me. [End Edit]  What I want people to take away from this video is an ability to perceive the general strategies fascists use, not just the particular symbology they happen to use at this particular moment. Pepe, milk, the OK sign, Kekistan: all of this is quickly being abandoned by savvy fascists. Normies have caught on. It's on the news. People recognize it as fascist. So it won't work anymore. They'll shift to something else, probably something even more subtle. The only way to keep up is to watch fascists closely or listen to people who do."
"God I wish Philip DeFranco would watch this vid and stop saying 'this person isn't a racist because they say they're not'"
"Another fantastic video!"
"What a good video"
"These guys love to talk about how there are no white ethnostates, but there are Arab or Black states (like being vaguely 'Black' constitutes an ethnicity). You know what I don't get? Why do these fucking ethnostatists completely disregard the fact that there ARE white ethnostates. More specifically, I'm talking about the national states in central and eastern Europe such as Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine etc. There is almost no non-white immigation to these countries for economic and historical reasons, almost no Muslims, almost no South Asians. UPVOTE THIS COMMENT SO THAT FRITZ CAN SEE IT: *HEY FRITZ! YOU'RE VERY WELCOME IN EASTERN EUROPE! IT'S LIKE A WHITE NATIONALIST THEME PARK! NO BLACKIES! NO JEWS (CUZ YOUR FOLKS KILLED THEM ALL)! REALLY LOW REAL ESTATE PRICES!*"
"I love your videos contra but this bashing of the centrist maybe went a little bit too far. I am guilty of making kekistani memes and I consider myself a centrist. But, like me, most of the centrist made those memes to point out the flaws in some of the 'far left' (for lack of a better term)ideology and not so much to support the right. Can't we just hate both the nazi's and the commies?"
"I thought I knew about these 4chan memes and all but they took it to a whole other level. Thanks for clarifying this. Also: You are so damn beautiful. На здоровье!"
"God fucking damnit your videos are so fucking good. Also the  æ s t h e t i c ™ is amazing."
"Just want to jump in and say that I really like this 'blended' style of video from you, lots of information and well stated argument mixed with some wonderfully, horribly surreal imagery.  I don't think anyone on youtube is doing or has done anything quite like it.     Fuck Nazis."
"Brilliant video. ❤️  I’ve brought this up before when the 8chan post was being discussed on twitter but there might be some learning experiences for the Left too here.   When the anon talks about incremental realism the first thing I think about is Brexit. Only ten years ago only a fringe position held mostly by fascists, their eventual victory has jerked the Overton window so far to the right that a Labour Party standing on its most left-wing manifesto in 34 years has moved its immigration policy to the most right-wing its been since the Commonwealth Immigration Acts.   The fact that a party spokesperson on equalities can say in the country’s most popular newspaper that all Pakistani men are potential rapists and hold onto her job for almost a week afterwards shows how far right the public mood on immigration has changed, and for the worse.   Your comments about gaslighting also mirror feelings I’ve been having recently about how political campaigning recently, especially the more fascist tones, is taking a lot of cues from emotional abuse. Case in point again: Brexit, where Nigel Farage the Pinstripe Fascist can go on TV and say Brexit won without a shot been fired barely a week after the first assassination of a sitting MP for 25 years.   Not only that, but the classic DARVO technique rears it’s ugly head; fascists love to claim the EU is some sort of Fourth Reich and they’re British patriots, even though the EU was basically designed by British and French in the post-war period to encourage peace across Europe and contain any fascist contagion.   Also, “before I realised I as trans, I used any opportunity to crossdress ironically”? Haven’t we all, Contra? Haven’t we all."
"Thank you, this is so damn good!"
"I'm sure we'll get plenty examples of another strategy in this comment section: 'all criticisms of fascism are not 'real arguments'.'"

"I don't know about y'all but I sure as hell didn't come down from Tumblr, cross five thousand miles of YouTube, fight my way through half of Twitter and jump out of a fuckin' subreddit to teach the alt-right lessons in humanity! The alt-right ain't got no humanity! They're the foot soldiers of an orange faced, Muslim banning, wall building dildo and they need to be destroyed!"
"I'd really like to thank Richard Spencer for giving me a purpose in life beyond meaningless capitalism. Unfortunately for Spencer it's the same damn purpose my Grandfathers had in driving his zombie ideology back into the fucking ground, and keeping it there."
