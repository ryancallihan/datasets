"Yep– not even wolves do the alpha/beta/omega thing.  Also, the Vikings were a much more ethnically diverse society than a lot of people think, and The Golden One and his ilk make my heritage look bad."

"What does Mr. Frog say"
"The surprise flex actually made me laugh so much"
"i can't square this with the obvious reality that there are indeed qualities that we attribute to people we term Alpha and people we term beta.  If i were to hold pictures that I curated up to any random sampling of people and asked them ,'of the two, which is Alpha and which is Beta', I'm certain that i'd get responses that would mirror my assumptions.     Ultimately, which person appears the more dominate would be the one people would people would term Alpha.   I can observe this in my day to day.   Alphas and Betas are just the Tops and Bottoms or the doms and subs of the hetero-world. Non-hackers would be beta 'And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved corps.'  - full metal jacket"
"You definitely emasculate.  But i find you sexy.... especially in the tub scene."
"The real life Gaston with David Bowie’s face and some additional ””””racial passion”””” thrown in... Oh and apparently he’s created dozens of threads praising his own physique in bodybuilding.com, you can’t make this stuff up"

"I fucking love Fingal's Cave omg Mendelssohn is the best"
"The golden one is literally varg vikernes"
"The funny thing is that the whole concept of alphas, betas, etc, doesn't really exist in nature. The guy who coined it later tried to revoke it, but nobody listened to him cause they were so in love with the idea."
"4:30 “...you have committed a terrible sacrilege, and you will pay for it with your life.”  This is not an original quote from “The Golden One.” This is not an old line from an epic poem or a part of some ancient Germanic battle code. It’s a fucking quote from the 2005 HBO TV show “Rome.” Specifically, the pilot episode. Specifically specifically, about five minutes into the pilot episode.  This dude is a parody of himself. Like, he is joking, right? Cause if not, making fun of him almost feels like bullying a mentally disturbed person.   Although I grant, he is kind of hilarious, both on purpose and not."
"Golden dude looking like a Who on roids."
"Hahaha the moment you run from the end of that corridor with the hammer! You are just adorable! 😍😍😍😄😄😄"
"now that you're a woman you're not allowed to show your tits."
"While I'm happy and supportive for Natalie's transition and blossoming into the woman she was meant to be....I do lament the loss of a potential hilarious Anti-Manosphere/Anti-Alt-Right character/Satire of THe Golden One in 'The Golden Twink'.  The Golden Twink could've been like a parody/satire of The Golden One....A Progressive, androgynous, super-pretty, rail-thin, Gay/Bi/Pan/etc. Anti-Golden One who also has a 'I'm an ancient god!' schtick going (The Golden Twink is an unknown misfit Nordic Deity). The Golden Twink would shred Toxic Masculinity and annoy The Golden One! IMAGINE!  I count 'The Golden Twink' as a 'character' since 'he' shows up in two videos (this one and 'Why White Nationalism/The Alt-Right Is Wrong') and might have had a weird Deity-Based backstory (Saying, 'My cousin's out fighting dragons. What do I get? NAZIS!' and hangs with an unseen character named 'Lars').  I need to come up with fanfic and fan art of The Golden Twink (while Natalie's a separate person)."

"Which hair dye do you use? My girlfriend wants to know."
"1. If you say you're an alpha, you're not 2. I don't want the Nazis to quit the Nazi shit. Unless they actually stop being Nazis, I'd prefer they advertise, before I end up in their fucking basement"
"the golden one found a wife though, so yeah he is still alpha male"
"Sadly we have trump, draft dodger, misogamist,  anti-LGBT, racist, liar, unstable idiot, and would be dictator. trump would like to be an alpha but he ios such a coward."
"GREAT ending monologue, splendidly sums everything up. I previously assumed a more generic and negative impression of TGO, so thanks for opening my mind."
"8:30 This swedish guy is wearing a t-shirt with the black sun on it and that's a neo-Nazi symbol..."
"If you are beta, i dont want to be alpha any more hehe ♥"

"The Golden One looks like a Street Fighter 3 Boss"
"Used to think this idea of alphas and betas came from Huxley's Brave new world, now I'm disappointed it's just nazis"
"The Golden One makes me embarrassed to be Swedish... Like... Fix the accent. Fix the attitude. Fix the world view. Urgh I just don't get how a so goddamn privileged person can get the idea to use their platform for such terrible end goal. Like shure I'm like the opposet of the golden one.. Afab non-binary, over weight and a social democrat (yes, the famous Swedish kind) so maybe i'll never get him and he's so called 'alfa' friends"
"Everybody quotes the wolves and all. But studies have shown that a 'wolf pack' is generally just a single family of wolves. The 'alpha' male and female are the two who mate, then the rest are their offspring until they grow old enough to go off and start their own packs"
"Not sure why AIU was in there."
"the time is 6:50 ... i watch this video just because i want full on alpha male energy on me... ykno that glorious modern europe man... and then i feel attacked as a 21 year old turkish woman who lives in constantinople, only the constantinople isnt named constantinople anymore, rather than Istan-fucking-bul and the goverment is NOT the ottoman empire rather than the republic of turkey. soooo......... and actually, no, my freind, you dont have to retake istanbul from turks in order to understand the nature of woman. that is wrong on so many levels... i cant even begin to explain. i just... cant... just... ugh"
"TGO: Man is a force of nature Me: you realize that it's MOTHER nature, right?"
"Zuckerberg was a weird example though. I would be willing to bet two apples and a banana that Zuckerberg (as well as Besos and Musk) would call himself an alpha, if asked about it. It might take a few blunts though. I'm absolutely sure that those dudes would have had at least half chance to end up hosting a toxic masculinity channel if they hadn't lucked out with their respective start-ups."
"'Alpha males', in a nutshell, are guys who believe that their over-the-top performance of masculinity in defense of their insecurities and their unhealthy tendencies to solve problems aggressively OUGHT to be the things that determine social standing. They think they should have high social standing, they do not, so they look for someone to blame."
"O_o Okay that's just not fair, you're not allowed to be gorgeous both pre- and post- transistion... Most of us can't even do one gender that well T_T"
"I was too distracted by that cute froggy on the golden one's sofa to really pay attention to what he was saying."
"It is I, the ultimate alpha lesbian queen, bow before me"
"'Youtube is an inherently epsilon activity...' I laughed, hard."
"Whenever I'm sad I go back and watch the beginning of this video. The reaction to the 'surprise flex' alway makes me laugh out loud. Cheers Ms. Points, you're the best."
"Lol. Pepe the Frog has been Pepe Silvia all along. While we're at it, who is Nicky Potnick?  Just so you know, i'm totally alpha, i just post comments to give all the omegas a taste of Chad."
"After watching this I'm kind of inlove of male Contra."
"what a beta cuck"
"That surprise flex was basically rape against my eyes"
"God DAMN you were a yummy twink back in the day, Natalie. I prefer your current look but...mmf. Yummy."
"I watched yer debate with Blair. I disagree with you on a number of points, but yer pretty cool? Anyway, I want your arms. Ugh. Lol I think your views on racism is skewed, but meh, let's talk about it."
"The golden one's face looks like a horse hoof came to life and wished to be it's most handsome self"
"Wait wasn’t this guy a total Hitler apologist"
"Obviously you know what you need to do contra    Have a boxing match with the golden one. Alpha on that bitch"
"Where’s the white women?????"
"“I don’t like people publicizing themselves in a sexual manner.” *Makes video of himself flexing muscles and perking his breasts with no shirt on*"
"More like the HE-brides, if you know what I mean. I don't know what I mean."
"13:38 Lars, get Natalie another pitcher of milk!"
"4:29 ‘If you become drunk, you have committed a terrible sacrilege and you would pay for it with your life’  6:02 ‘I’m gonna take her mead’ Sorry, Goldilocks, you’ve gotta go."
"4:11 Is that ‘pass the oil would you, Lars?’ or ‘pass the Oil of Rituals’?"
"I have such second hand embarrassment when watching that clown"
"Yikes."
"The golden one has the most feminine muscles I’ve seen XD"
"So I was about a quarter of a way through this video before I realized  that the golden guy was an actual 'alpha' idiot on YouTube and not just an actor that you hired to portray an idiot 😅 He is so ridiculous I guess I thought he was a legit character. I swear I am normally pretty sharp but it is super late...guess that is my cue to go to sleep🤦🏼‍♀️"
"God damm it. How dare the Golden One be such a god damn hottie but then also be a fascist. Men, don't be a nazi."
"Contra went from beta male to alpha female. We stanned then and we stan now."
"7:00 Witchcraft!"
"I honestly don’t know any woman who would fuck this man...  I can’t believe he’s serious"
"Oh god... Its Swedish Elliot Hulse...yeesh"
"A lot of these fascist men seem neurotic and prissy - your 'ugly engorged penis'??? That's when they're not actively supressing their homosexuality.    Repression is a dangerous thing."
"So Sverge hulk Peter Dinklage here was flexing off and on, and you can notice it in the jump cuts CP does.  At some points, TGO isn't flexing, but then he is, almost like an alarm is going off in his head like 'FUCK!  I FORGOT TO KEEP ON FLEXING LIKE A GUY WHO ISN'T SECURE IN HIS MASCULINITY!'"
"Lets remember that the Golden One's hyper masculine appearance comes courtesy of endogenous hormonal (in his case, adrogenizing male) pharmacological intervention, and THEN, he shaves his entire body (which is 'feminizing') ......... IRONIC, no, actually incoherent, for him to be anti-trans.  He is, in a way a trans-man himself, he transitioned from beta to alpha male with hormones."
"The golden one is hot, too bad he’s not gay :(    And a fascist"
"You gave me a strong boner"
"'I am Alpha!  I am Alpha!' I scream as I slowly turn into a tomato."
"Leaving comments is omega.... 😭"
"What's the song at 02:13?"
"contra these old vids of yours confuse my sexuality."
"Im ALPHA....      Just kidding <3  My fiance is the Alpha female :P"
"I don't get. ... all those people all fools, furthest thing from alpha.... Aren't real alphas just leaders. ..  business owners, bosses, people that march to beat of their own drum, entrepreneurs,  captains of their sports teams, the guy that goes out and recruits people to be in his band,  the one guy in group of friends that everyone kinda knows is the leader.   Why are we viewing that as abhorrent.  The real alphas are the job creators,  guys sacrificing and working hard to be the next great rock star or athlete. .. tiger Woods. .. Michael Jordan. .. kwahi keonard...shaq...kobe...arnold Schwarzenegger. . Robert deniro... Chris Rock. ... Adam Sandler. .. Jim Carrey. .. Jim Morrison. .. jimi hendrix... Justin timberlake...Eminem .. elton friggin johns an alpha... David Bowie.. Prince. .. id guess a high majority of the most loved people in our modern world are alphas.. that's what got them there. Unless I don't know what alpha is or our definitions are different. ..  I like the video,  but you coulda spent a minute or more on positive alpha qualities.  How bout an entire videos on awesome alphas...lol. IMO Real alphas are leaders but more importantly held in high regard and respected. .. and we need leaders. .. some might consider you alpha...oooooo the horror! !!😆😆😆  Alpha isn't only meant for males either... there's alpha females too... so let's put alphas on the positive scale of qualities where they deserve to be!"

"Hmm, I wish I knew this thing when I was younger .   At the age of 18 i broke up w/ my first girlfriend w/o having sexual relationships(actually I did have, although not with penetration). My lack of experience and my inner sadness made me start working out (yeah, I'm a bit cliche) and then i met some guys who introduced me to one of this pickup artist. From then, everything turned  for the worst. I started to develop a false  feeling of self-confidence to overcome my lack of self-steem. I never publically told my inner feelings of  misogyny because deep down I was ashamed of them. When i attempted suicide i decided to leave this modern culture hate group. and, though it's been a hard road i don't regret it at all.     Now i'm 20, i've recognised my bisexuality and  my relationship with women (cis & trans) are so fricking healthy I can maintain a romantic relationship and a bunch of good friendships.   So please, as tempting as it may be, don't hate these Alpha Males as much as I once did, they are  trapped in a subculture of which not everyone is able to escape."
"Recently found out about Contra. Going through her vids in anti-chronological order. Really interesting seeing her “de-transition“ ^^"
"Why is that Swedish guy's head so small?"

"'Youtubing is an inherently epsilon activity'... So true"

"The golden one can barely grow a beard he must have low T. Beta"
"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂the golden twink...this is awesome...why does she not do more vids...I'm glad she's not into degeneracy😂😂😂😂not sure about the Nazi thing though... I think it's only bad cuz Hitler had plans outside of Germany... just like Candace Owens said if Hitler just wanted to mgga or mdga it wouldn't have been an issue 😆"

"I had a panic attack"
"the female nipple on youtube!!?!?!?"
"Dying"
"That faq was this"
"Best fucking video ever dude.. hahahaha wow.... Funny ass hell"
"His... his head is too small for his body"
"This is obviously bullshit. Of course there are alpha males, it is only the guys on the left that doesn't believe this because they are betas."
"This contra points girl did her make up"
"I'll bet 100 bucks the Golden One secretly likes to take some dick"
"I am so glad you let me see some of this golden guy without actually giving him any views."
"I personally believe in alpha and beta people, sort of. But I think it's about freedom more so than anything else. In conclusion you're an alpha bitch."
"Oh my god Natalie was so far in the closet back then."
"MENTAL HELP........ YOU NEED IT GUY....."
"oh gosh Natalie, even your old videos are ... dare I say it, pure gold!  and you are fucking sexy and have always been, its your humor and your intelligence that I enjoy so much."
"The Golden One is totally one of those guys who masturbate while looking at a mirror"
"I'm so glad that this community is so pure and good"
"7:02 Greece has entered the chat."
"Doesn't 'beta' actually mean you are second in command? This is how stupid these people actually are."
"Ha ha, great video. You both are astonishingly beautiful, just different types. You two look like Thor and Loki. Well. I just talk about the body... Ha ha, alpha requires brain, too. A true Alpha will never try to stand out in a ridiculous way."
"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)"
"First time seeing you pre-transition (never saw your old stuff till now) and I hate to say I think you’re a really hot man, like god damn I’m having a hard time paying attention to the words in this video 😂 Sorry to say post-transition you isn’t as hot, or maybe I’m just on the gay-er end of bi then oof"
"Fun fact: Those 'surprise flexes' happen, when men stop jerking off.  The tension needs to be regularly milked away, or else it builds up leading to those goofy spasms."
"My hubby is an alpha. He's a physically strong male. He's smart and self made multi-millionaire. He doesn't take shit but will ignore the things that don't matter. He's confident & sexy. He's protective of the family yet not controlling. He would never refer to himself as an alpha male bc he's not an attention starved cocky pretender. He's is white but not racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic. He's liberal in personal views and conservative financially. He believes in small government and in let live as long as you don't physically harm me or mine.   Btw, my mom is white but I'm not.  Although alpha male might not be a legit science term, most reasonable ppl understand what's meant. It's actually a nicer way of saying real man vs bitch boy or cocky pos."
"Queers"
"I still go and check every now and then TheGoldenOne's videos. I met him due to the videos on Breadtube and I still find it god damn fucking hilarious how he is so oblivious to who he is. How little if any self-awareness... Yeah he is swole and who knows what he consumes to be like that, whatever he says - but other than that he's just a repressed right nerd, a glorified viking cosplayer with way too old ideals. 'Ecofascism'? My, my, if these are the people who will 'save Evropa' I don't wanna go deep into who they picture as enemies."
"This video is awesome and hilarious"
"I'm far more attracted to contrapoint than this alpha male....personal preference ig. I always like the slim guys lol"
"0:27 weird flex but OK..."
"I hate the term alpha male. I'm a brown woman. And our culture is based of patriarchy. So many times, I seen my male cousins tease each other for being beta-males. But then they complain that they can't get women. Not only that, their standards for potential female partners are incredibly high and sexist, like she must not me fat, must be a virgin. It is just awful."

"* I tend to come up with weird headcanons on things and I like to think of 'The Golden Twink' as a ContraPoints character....a cute, slender prettyboy who's a hilarious spoof/counter-to/foil of The Golden One....the 'Anti-Golden One' ('He' shows up twice and has an unseen cousin who battles dragons, I guess 'He' could be a 'character'). * In my headcanon, The Golden Twink and that Libertine Nobleman Guy (I call him 'Contranova') from the 'Pick Up Artists' video (the master of cunnilingus with oysters) are separate from the lovely and female Natalie and are Alternate-Universe male versions of her."
"This is kinda not on topic but you're very pretty. Reminded me of the sculptures at an art museum."
"I got serious Rhaegar Targaryen vibes at 0:45. How is she so attractive no matter what her gender expression is?"
"I wanna be super buff, but with the attitude of men these guys call beta cucks"
"Back when you could actually read each patron's name in the credits...Nice package btw Natalie. I know I'm 3 years late here, Seeing your transformation (evolution?) since then feels like comfort food. Curious, seems like you could've really delved into the whole Making Constantinople Great Again thing. #MCGA"

"'beta' - a person who spell-checks fanfiction before the original author posts it"
"Surprise muscle flexing is what separates alpha males from inferior males.  Don't let the correlations with misogyny, racism, and fascism fool you.  Lots of defective people like those things."
"You're probably so emberassed of this now"
"The idea of alpha ness really is pretty one dimensional , it’s become such a weird quasi religion among many disenfranchised men, I had the misfortune of reading the rational male and the idea is weirdly idolised (to the extent that a fifteen year old boy who had a party while his parents  were away and the didn’t give a fuck was lauded as “the alpha Buddha” ) I guess it’s kind of a mental shield against a confusing and difficult world it’s just a shame it involves trying to turning into Tyler Durden (a false self)."
"Wait. Wasn't sex a vital part of ancient Norse religion? Like it was sacred, and wasn't seen as something to hide?"

"there is female presenting nipple in the thumbnail cool"
"Wow, as a cis woman, I have to say that the golden one does nothing to me erotically. Nothing at all. But I do want to sit him down for some milk and cookies and ask him if he has found a nice guy yet."
"6:56 Teddy, you're an idiot. Also, this whole 'ugly engorged impaling member' talk just reeks of self-loathing. How insecure do you have to be to speak this way about your genitals?"
"This Golden Guy sounds like a closet case."
"* I know Natalie's a woman (and always was one, being a transwoman and all) but I confess she was also yummy as a Golden Twink Prettyboy. The Golden Twink is a yummy cutie and I have a thing for lithe, androgynous pretty young men. * That said; She's a woman (and a lovely one at that) and I need to keep that in mind. I will not mis-gender her."

"* The Golden One looks like a giant action figure: 'BY THE POWER OF NUMBSKULL!' * Shame his main schtick is hardcore NeoNazi regressive Fascist garbage because he would've been fun to watch, otherwise. If it was just goofy videos about a cosplaying, Fantasy-novel-loving, Skyrim-playing, bodybuilding, NeoPagan Thor-wannabee calling himself 'The Golden One' it would be neat in a silly way. * Again; Muscle-oaf talking to a teddy-bear is just the most hilariously adorable thing (and he and teddy wearing matching sweaters)."

"It's especially ironic because the guy who termed the phrase 'alpha male' in wolves would later admit that he was wrong, discovering that wolf packs did not work like a 'super strong alpha male rules over the weaker ones' like he thought.

"Alpha - as in peanuts."
"There's something weirdly endearing about seeing a big goofy muscle-oaf talking to a teddy-bear (even if he's a bigoted meathead whose teddy tells him to invade Istanbul)."

"Od kiedy Chęć posiadania własnej kultury i tradycji jest rasizmem? Kiedy czarni mają swoją kulture to jest super. Kiedy arabowie mają swoją islamską kulture, islamskie kraje i prawa - super. Kiedy azjaci mają azjatyckie kraje tez fajnie. Kiedy biały chce by jego tradycja, rasa i kultura istniały -RASISTA 😂  LEWACTWO mnie zadziwia 😁  (mam kolege lewaka ktory twierdzi ze to bardzo dobrze ze w zachodniej europie jest tyle imigranów i innych ras.

"Well,  the golden one gained a sub today. Thanks!"
"still better than a fucking alien transfaggot piece of shit"
"Natalie took off her robe, and I realized that I sincerely lust after her. Natalie, this is completely inappropriate for me to say, but you are fucking sexy regardless of gendered clothes. You're a hot woman. I appreciate your wisdom, but you're easy on the eyes as well. Signed, a lesbian who married a cisman"
"I can’t get over how that alpha male is actually ugly af"
"Before i begin, let me say I'm a contrapoints sub, and she has helped to to get a better understanding about a lot of ideas.  I believe in alphas and betas, but it is nothing like what these idiots represent (or what the modern mainstream representations of the ideas are). To be very concise, what I consider alpha qualities are what the literal meaning of the word represents : qualities of a leader. Confidence, not taking shit from others, reliability, high social standing (or at least folks around you are inspired by you), and yes, not afraid of offending others (this does not mean that you go out and try offending people, that is something these caricatures, these 'alphas' would do).  Absence of these qualities are what constitutes a beta. And I would like to say that I do not mean this word as an insult. It is just a description, a lack of certain traits. An 'alpha' who has to demean folks who do not have alpha traits, actually display their own insecurities, and ironically, how not alpha  they are.   At this point, with these clowns running around, it feels a bit cringey at times to use these terms, because they have normalised such a distorted version of the original ideas, but I still make it a point to do so, because I think that the original values are something to strive for, personally."
"I thought the golden one was a parody? oh well... either way these guys function on the most basic and primitive view of the world, which is us against them, so it is no wonder they are anti-women, anti-other life styles, anti-other races, anti-other nationalities and I'm guessing anti-other religions. It really doesn't surprise me that they hate all 'others' and I'm pretty sure that just like other extremists, the circle of who is 'us' gets smaller and smaller with time, until they start killing each other. So let's just sit back and enjoy with a bowl of popcorn when it happens."
"Golden one or whatever is suuuuper racist. There was a gathering in central Stockholm for a far far right party called Alternativ för Sverige and he was there. I mean we have a racist party which isn't these guys, these guys are way way more"
"its true, she was a yum yum"

"Small European countries can't become African/Asian settlements. Being against mass immigration is fine. Some of the other stuff, esp regarding women is indeed a little odd but you'd still crawl over hot coal to suck his penis, wouldn't you? Yes, you would"

"See, in chemistry, alpha particles are the ones that penetrate the least after leaving the nucleus I think they take after that alpha"
"Peoples belief systems have very little to do with the sociosexual hierarchy. Behavior patterns are key to figuring out if you are Alpha. Its very helpful with who you work with (men or woman seen in a society) and is important for a society to function. I get the feeling that you didn't do much research, and your not fooling me with the smear tactics in this video. We get it, Nazi's are not cool and acting tough to get more woman seems patriarchal . If your more interest in figuring out the Alpha or the rest of the sociosexual hierarchy , Vox day does a great video in describing list, and a personalized video on just the Alpha in his voxiversity series."
"The way HE bashes Anita is alpha as fuck."

"the golden one is dio but worse"
"He talks like an eleven year old who wants to show off by swearing as much as possible"
"I'm starting to think 'beta' means 'normal'. The men I know are kind, loving, decent human beings with morals. They aren't perfect, they have flaws, but they're not racist assholes who constantly choose to assert their masculinity.  They take care of their children, they know when to be strong and supportive without being so touchy. The 'Alpha Males' that I know (self proclaimed) are very touchy, easily offended, can't take a joke, condescending, don't know how to treat a woman, etc.  Basically they're the actual Beta's, because they're so hyper focused on preserving their masculinity. It's a bit sad actually."
"Why is his poor Teddy Bear so damn racist?"

"Suprise flex had me lol loudly."
"Trump says he's great, and he's the president, debunks the logic 'people who say they are alpha are great are not' LOL!!!! beta leftists"
"I know this is an old video but I must say... Even before finding out about Mr glorious whatever being a white nationalist, I was already kinda disgusted with him. He just seems like a shallow narcissist with an artificially inflated ego. I mean, yeah he's physically conventionally attractive but his personality makes all that go to shit. Like, you don't need to make videos while you're shirtless or half naked. First of all, nobody wants to see that. Second, the vast majority of your audience is male, you know this, and you continue to appear half naked. That seems pretty gay, and that's not intended to be an insult (I'm gay as well) but he'll probably take it that way."
"'There's is no reason to promote (gay) sex in public' sits shirtless in front of a camera and flexes his muscles... Idk what your promoting but I kinda get a.... How do you say..... Sexual feel from that"

"Good job with this and your Jordan Peterson videos. I enjoy a lot of your videos and they offer perspective unique from many of the endlessly repeated pre-packaged viewpoints out there!"
"When the autogynophile attacks the male who reminds him of his flight from masculinity and responsibility that made him start dressing as a woman lol. This is essentially the same as fat guys who try to dog on athletes by implying fighting or football is homoerotic."
"How could anyone not love you after watching this video? I'm so glad I found out about you through Vice news recently... Also, is it weird that I, as a straight woman, find myself attracted to someone who was at the beginning of his trans woman journey? Hmm"
"Why does he think being gay is about sex? Gay people were having butt secks long before pride parades, it's about love."
"Incel: Deeply misogynistic, low self-esteem: 'I'm genetically inferior, so I'll never get laid.' Alpha: Deeply misogynistic, high self-esteem: 'I'm genetically _superior,_ so why am I _still_ not getting laid?  Hmm... must be the _Jews!'_"

"The Golden One is a neo-Nazi but he's so pretty. I would let him take me away to a swedish isle and ravage me. It must be his good personality. I'm a jew."
"So glad Vice sent me your way! Love the channel, love the work, love you!"
"All hail our president!"
"Hey hey it's George Lakoff's theory of how the conservative frame is a strict father model."

"Alpha and beta were (now outdated) classifications made for the roles within a wolfpack. Since humans don't live forming wolfpacks and have a far more estructured society, it makes no bloody sense."

"You spent years pumping iron to build those muscles coupled with a few questionable supplements here and there, but I can still stab you with a knife, so who's the real alpha, boy? Now hand over your women and get into the closet."
"I would bet Bezos and Elon both consider themselves alpha after their image transformations but who knows for sure... well other than how they treat their women."
"As a 'natural born Alpha Male' I'd like to say this: if you are an Alpha, you don't care about be an Alpha, you don't care about 'looking like an Alpha' by doing body building, and so on. Alpha male is just to be born bigger/stronger, and with a self confidence. It's the attitude to become a leader, a dominant role in a group, having a strong mind and courage. None can become Alpha, you can learn how to act like an alpha. That tipe of men just looks like trying to convince themselves about 'to be an Alpha', Alpha male don't need confirmations about it :)"

"So gd!"
"Oh shit, who's really alfa lol"
"Daves car has low testosterone."
"That dude is fuckd up. I have been seeing his videos pop up off and on for 5 years and man what a basket case. All the checklist is checked: racist, nationalist, phobic of almost all things not male and hetero, sees women as fairytale maidens, uses the language of incels, props up Roman and Greek 'values' despite being Swedish and ignoring the rampant sexual culture of Rome, and the rampant male-male sex culture and how there was no concept of homosexuality in their culture, just pleasure seeking and power. The best one, he thinks masturbation is evil.  Golden One he calls himself. He is a creepy creep."
"anyone who proclaims their alphaness has already failed at being truly alpha"

"6:02 - But you, oh Golden One, said earlier that getting drunk means commiting a terrible sacrlige."
"Golden Boy is fine and all but my sexual orientation was confirmed when Heart started playing"
"When he said 'when you´re getting drunk you´ve committed a horrible crime or something', I litterally had a glass of whine in my hand. x´D  But I´m also a pansexual enby, because nothing sorrounding gender and sex makes fucking sense under the patriarchy and I probably wont become that alpha ever in my life so... might aswell get wasted ^^"
"When I was in CEGEP (French Canadian version of late high school/early university), their was this very weird thing that I noticed:  I had a girlfriend. We lived together. Our sex life was so active that 4/5 of the surrounding studios put forth an official complaint to the dorm. I had multiple friends with benefits. I was the president of a gaming club. I was the person people depended on. We would host parties that would often turn to «well these two are clearly fucking in the bathroom».  Basically, I had the life these guys fight so hard for. Yet you can only get that life by being openly weak and by giving not taking.  Because weakness is not the opposite of strength. Those who have strength to spare have no need to take from others and it costs nothing for them to give some."
"Someone needs to get him a copy of red dead redemtion 2"
"Aye larz. The queen wants more milk!"
"IM DEAD, Love contrapoints, but wow, you label devon tracey or atheism is unstoppable(kangaroo guy) as white nationalist and antisemitic, when he is demonstrably not, you have a gaggle of retards trying to compensate and then insert a leftist who is actually making better points then you on this particular topic. ive never seen someone fight antisemitism more than that jew hating kangaroo LMAO, anyways there were some good points (mostly low hanging fruit) and then a cringe inducing diatribe that slanders people who literally spend their days advocating against the nonsense you suggest they do. thats is hilarious and horribly researched."

"Stop confusing me!!"
"This guy has a man's view of attractive traits in a man. Almost as if he wanted only men to pay attention. As if.. he only wanted men. Hmmm....."
"Antisemitism is a surrogate for antiauthoritarianism, socially engineered to divert the attention of the weak minded away from those who have real power and cause real damage to society. In other words: if you have a bulls eye on your chest, its more effective to paint the bulls eye on someone else, shine a spotlight on them and slink away into the shadows than it is to clean your own act up."
"You. are. AWESOME.   Just wanted to say that."
"I find The Golden One almost adorable in a child like way. I think it's a mix of the accent and the teddy bear. I don't know he seems like he's trying to do good and doesn't really have much knowledge yet."
"sorry but ur literally so hot and intelligent"
"I still like this video."
"Please let me read the books in your book shelf"
"I know this was serious but this was one of the funniest videos I've seen in a while"
"I'm still not sure if The Golden One isn't just a brilliant troll that got way out of hand... I have a theory that he originally created this personality just as a satire for the lulz but got psychologically sucked so deep into it that he can't find a way out anymore - shifting his being from funny to tragic."
"I am incredibly attracted to ContraPoints."
"I’m definitely a Phi Male because I’m irrational, but my proportions are still pretty good. :-D"

"Why is everything 'glorious' to this fucking nerd"
"I REALLY hope nobody associates us Pagans with him...."
"haah this has to be the gayest nazi porn i have ever seen. or the naziest gay porn. wait...i am confused."
"The golden one is the best :) Long live mother Europa. He is a bit cringe at times, sure. But he stands for something good, id est, our self preserverance. The number one question for Europe is stopping the migrant invasion which is making everything worse for us European people."
"Dear Ms. Contrapoints: I've been avoiding your videos since they looked like overlong comedy skits but after watching this one... holy crap it's like modern Schoolhouse Rock! I'm being educated while being entertained"
"Aren't Caucasian genes weaker because of incest?  Talk about building your own prison.."
"'Why do so many guys calling themselves alpha also turn out to be crazy racists' sooo your saying your a beta? and your also saying every actual guy is a racist....way to go there. Or is it just those that disagree with you are racist? seems like a straw-man..."
"No thanks, I'll take the bread pill."
"ContraPoints makes porn for sapiosexuals"
"Geh. This twig is pathetic."
"the Greeks, Cabbalists, and the Gnostics considered alpha to be corresponding to the moon, which is an effeminate symbol...so technically, the more effeminate you are, the more alpha you are."
"You're not a beta.. you are a degenerate"
"The Golden One is 100% closeted."
"CT Fletcher...pure alpha."
"When I do say something I trust my thoughts stand on their own. I can just talk about my views on war because I'm a war vet, I can talk about computers or medicine because I have degrees. My knowledge can stand for itself without me saying my qualifications. If anything, withholding that I'm an authority on a subject can help me when I reveal it later.  Aka, an alpha male hasn't got to say so and is harmed by doing so."
"Lars! Bring Natalie another pitcher of milk!"
"I really enjoy your sense of irony and how you frame it within the videos.  and can we all agree that the Golden  One is the gayest gay that ever gayed?"
"PROUD OMEGA"
"I'm pretty sure Contrapoints is the true Golden One. The true savior of mother Europe, chosen by gods blah blah blah. I mean I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure."
"I am afraid I will eventually become the person that just always creeps on you in the comments, but I just can't contain your overflowing awesome feminine energy. Never stop. Thank you very much."
"real Alpha males are male feminists."

"I swear The Golden One is the most unintentionally funny person on Youtube."
"this alpha guy needs to be pegged, really good destresser"
"For first few minutes I actually thought The Golden One was just some bodybuilder invited specially for mocking adepts of alpha theory, because it's too ridiculous"
"K beta."
"Is that a dot swastika on your chest at the beginning of the video? I just started the video, so if it explains it later I apologize.   Also it's funny to think that technically you could argue that this is 'female nudity' on YouTube now, but it wasn't when this was made."
"Alpha males do exist as a type of personality type common among males, but they are based off of a misconception in animal social heiarchies.  In the animal kingdom, animals tend to be subservient to other members of the pack not in a complex instinctual understanding, but in a way that children are subservient to their parents and other elder caretakers. Parents are generally stronger, so they are the leaders, and leadership can rest on female shoulders as well as males.  It would seem that primative man tended to lean towards patriarchal leadership, given that brute strength led to better survival odds, but in these days it would seem that those concepts are archeic.  Not advocating for a matriarchy, merely one where all people can contribute their skills evenly"
"The OTHER place obsessed with the alpha concept, who use the alpha and beta and omega language  is SUPER GAY FANFICTION about a fictional setting where there are alpha males who are super masculine dominant daddies, and omegas are twinky submissive boysluts to alphas, add in like a mating cycle thing and you have a great recipe for porn  Also sometimes the alpha and omegaverse involves the omegas being able to get pregnant so it can be a 100% society of guys FOR THE GAYEST OF PORN, also sometimes werewolves are involves for extra wolf alpha concept linkage?"
"omg, you were/are cute even though this was 2 years ago and you've transitioned, which is totally cool just saying. that said, muscular meatheads aren't really alphas. they are just muscular and probably try and walk like they think an alpha would. but a true alpha man doesn't really have to be muscular, it is really just inherent confidence, integrity and trust in yourself. also, your body is more attractive. nerds are hot and can be alphas too, even with feminine skulls, lol. just take elon musk. he was an alpha even with glasses on, due to his laser sharp focus."
"that was a wild ride. Love your costumes and editing :)"
"OK real talk: What's the music at 2:53??? I need to know."
"If this video showed me anything, it's that the title 'alpha' is the most ironic thing ever. Their masculinity is so fucking fragile that they depend on this flimsy european-supremacist idea of what a 'man' is supposed to be, so much that they alienate themselves from society. These guys are so much more whiny than SJWs"
"'Don't invade Russia,' huh... ok..."
"'People on yt keep calling me beta' -goes to bathroom to put makeup on"
"These people often says _'respect is earned, not given'_  So maybe they shouldn't give themselves the title of alpha and instead see if society sees them as such?"

"The “golden one” looks like he’s from Skyrim wtf"
"7:00 got dat bitch Constantinople, bitches love Constantinople"
"I love every single point you mate except for Obama. I've done nothing bro proof that he was a fascist dictator. Other than that I want to shake your hand if we met in real life."
"I don't understand how some 'alpha males' can be so *so* blatantly homoerotic in their presentation, but then be uncomfortable with homosexuality. Good grief."
"Listening an all of the sudden hearing a white dude say 'fucking N-words' I was thrown back"
"Too many freaks on Youtube! thought this Thor-looking guy is actually a homosexual friend of Natalie and he is acting like a hilarious bone-headed pornstar for her. he's such a guy fits for a barbarian role from the movie called Kung Fury."
"Are we just assuming that The Golden One isn't putting us on? If he is, he's kind of a genius. On the other hand, if he's not he probably has some mental health issues and I feel kind of bad about laughing at him. But seriously ... a fucking teddy bear tells him that to understand women we have to retake Constantinople? There's no way that's meant seriously (though taking stuff so far that you are losing sponsors is some serious commitment, it's true)."
"'Greetings- MMMMMMMMMMFGH'"

"When you de-robe yourself, you struck the most stunning sensual face! I like."
"Well, no fear my friendly.  No alpha here.  Lost my virginity at 30.  Got a couple of blowjobs after that but that’s it.  Someone as ridiculously lonely and well...  downright pathetic as I am could never be considered alpha.  No fears though.  I’m not some incel ready to pop his cork and go in a killing spree.  Would have years ago if I were."
"It's a good thing I don't live in Sweden because if I saw this Golden One dude on the street I'd laugh until he broke my spine"
"Well the golden dude is not a fighter cus well any fighter knows that long hair are always a disadvantage in a fight they can be grabbed and used against you also thus big muscles will mean he will get winded quickly so huge muscles and long hair are never an advantage in a fight."
"Lars! Another pitcher of milk, please!"

"You're asking why we're losing power?  Well... you know, today we cannot use violence, like for example fight the current invasion of Sweden and Europe with arms.  Like they would have done in the past. So that's basically it. If white men actually used violence, we could take back  women's right to vote in a second and throw out every single migrant invader. But you see, we can't today so... :)  So much for that right. That's why we have to fight politically."

Anyone on you tube saying there are an alpha isn't! Stop looking on YouTube opinion channels. Not one of these dudes are alpha's. Alpha's dont need to suppress women. Everything you say is just a sad false world view. Alphas are simple.. Find men who dominate in battle and with women. The best way to find a human 'alpha' is to just look for men women throw themselves at endlessly."

"I've said before, but the most 'alpha' people I've ever met were members of my family who were always there for others. They are alpha *by merit* . My grandfather always saw my awkwardness (undiagnosed autism at the time) as just me being me, and always supported it. As a 'natural patriarch' of the family, he had the final word. If awkward little antisocial me wanted to leave the dinner table and read dinosaur books, he would have the final say, nobody else - and he would sometimes read my anxiousness, and simply say 'You can go now', and I would disappear in a puff of smoke. He would continously provide me with science-magazines.  My dad has always - always - been there for me in my troubles, even if I brought shit on myself. He is a staunch pacifist who I have no doubt would not hesitate for a moment to pick up arms, if it came to defending his family.  Another strong alpha in my family is my grandmother on my dads side, as well as my stepma - dad's wife. Both of them are efficient problem-solvers, always putting family first, and always racing to solve something, sometimes to the detriment of everybody elses independence (in particular my grandma, who pushed dad out of the way when he was well into his 50s, to negotiate with some not-really-that-difficult airport employee, to have some ticket-problem fixed. He stood to the side, like some little kid :D ) My grandma gave me a university-level dinosaur book when I was 10, because I told her the kiddy-dino books were too low-tech for me. She also bought me a horribly gruesomely graphic documentary about lions and hyenas (The 90s Nat Geo special, highly recommended!!!) because I told her I like hyenas.  Alpha is not about strutting around, being all 'umpf!' for no reason, it's about being there for those that depend on you. Insecure little man-boys have always mixed up softness with weakness. Solidarity and empathy and care is one of the most vital aspects of functioning society, both on micro and macro scale. I see it too often, blatant insecurity misinterpreted as 'another fellow alpha!', and, as ContraPoints points out (:v) - these are often fringe people. They do not have families to care for, they do not have anyone that *depend on them* These people will not spot an 'alpha' man OR woman if they sat on their faces.  (btw, I'm fully aware the term no longer applies to wolves, but it has come to apply to humans, so... that's my interpretation of the proper application I guess!)"

"I have to admit, I do sort of like the Golden One too, if only he weren't a facist - he seems to half realise the others in his 'movement' are arseholes, but never seems to realise its because his world view is wrong."
"T1 king of alphas"
"I didn't know the Golden One. At first I thought, what a sympathetic, a bit foolish young man who is just a bit lost in his role play fantasies. Then the Jewish question came up... I had to rewind several times to see if I heard correctly. Such a shame... Now I will have to kill him from a distance (because of my obvious physical inferiority) when the Nazis are marching through the streets and I assume my destiny as a beta partizan."

"So i just randomly watched The Golden Ones response Vidya to this prior to actually watching this.  I am a fan of the Golden One. I am Alt Right. I am a real 'National Socialist'. The real deal. Anyways the beginning was entertaining lol. I'll give you that. But regardless, all you women, gay men, and trans 'people' know you secretly fantasize about us. Especially the liberal women. You know it. Liberal women tend to have the most depraved sexual fantasies especially. And to act like the few weirdos you did show were the majority of the movement is bullshit. Roosh and The Golden One are both decent guys. And don't act like they can't pick up women either."

"He's so pretty, now shhhh ..."
"I can see how a tranny would be offended by the idea of an alpha male, but the blonde dude is obviously trolling."
"Your video was hilarious and entertaining but you misrepresented the Golden One’s views. He does not believe in throwing other races out. He has been clear about not hating or looking down on others. He’s definitely a nationalist. Not clear on fascist. Haven’t heard him denounce democracy but he has criticized capitalism, which doesn’t make you automatically fascist.  I believe that’s all."
"Anybody notice this guy has a massive cock?"
"I read somewhere that we should grow a pussy instead of growing balls, because balls are very sensitive but a pussy can take a pounding....   Also women give birth with their pussy!   Don't get me wrong I think men and women inherently have the same potential to be strong."
"1. Belief in the concept of an alpha male is based on a science claim that turned out to not be true. 2. Even if the concept turned out to be valid, it was about wolves and not applicable to humans. 3. Most of those claiming to be alpha males or accusing others of being beta males are generally insecure 'beta' males:  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/politics/trump-economic-anxiety.html"
"I would prefer leftists always to the far right but some of the coments here are just so wrong that they made me cringe. The first thing is some women saying that Golden One is not that attractive and that some twink would be more attractive is just funny and going againts basic evolution and biology. Now i am not saying thats impossible to think, they are some anomalies here and there in some peoples sexuality, but for majority of women, the types of musculine hunks like this are ideal for women because of evolution. Like take my example, i live in a pretty much semi traditional country. My cousin is like the steryotype of a 'chad' that incels talk about and the guy is just perfect in every way, his body being very similiar to Golden One and his face like Chris Hemsworth. So this one day he and this other guy were attacked by atleast 15 other guys from a different ethnic group. My cousin fought of 6 people at once like a lion while that other friend and other twinks and genetically inferior men did nothing and just watched. After the fight he got praised by girls and girls gossiped about him for days,there were even 3 girls that liked to be his girlfriend amd fought againts themselves for him. The reason for all of this is our biology and in the past this type of men would be the best candidates to protect their women and children. My point in all of this is that majority women in thuth love reasonable violent men because it triggers their basic insticts for survival and mating. Many of you that lie to youselfs that you prefer twinks over hunks like this wouldn't say the same think if you are attacked by a group of other men and your twink boyfriend can't protect you the same way a muscular man can do."

"Golden One is not an alpha male in the traditional implied sense. He is a Swedish or whatever nationalist bodybuilder pagan-fetish guy. If he were trying to pick up girls at a club, women would be very weirded out by him. As a matter of fact the swedish world of warcraft obsession shit is classically a very beta male interest. He was a strange but entertaining choice for the 'alpha male' example."

"Also, can we just go on record in saying that white men are by and large the biggest participators in identity politics despite constantly proclaiming to hate them? These are the same kind of guys with this Alpha Male Syndrome literally put all of their stock of their personal identity into their manliness and their whiteness. Their biggest fears are exactly that; being feminized or unmasculine. I would say that even men who are not fearful of immigrants tend to be more liberal and left-wing still participate in a lot of #NotAllMen denial, if not outright sexism, and glaring tribalism within maleness."

You'd freeze, or starve to death in your sleep. Totally manufactured (just like all his beliefs lol) He can't even let his arms dangle. Too much muscle by far. He looks like a horse's ass."
"Gotta love that “the Jewish question” video he made. Where he keeps reiterating that individual Jews are different from “international Jewry”. Again, and again and again. Almost as if people look at what he says and (quite rightly) assume he’s a Nazi"

"Bro This chick is a dude  Not cool I feel weird now that I used to find her hot"
"You’re by far my favorite sjw because you actually think and have your own ideas rather than just parroting stale slogans.  I don’t really care about alpha vs beta but with masculinity being demonized today I think it’s worth pointing out that the truth is somewhere in between these overcompensating tools and decadent willful sjw girly men like yourself. The problem isn’t that men aren’t macho enough. It’s that so many are happy to sell off their masculinity to the next person..."
"This is the question you all need to ask, Its been raining for a week, the rivers rise and burst their banks, the farm floods and the whole family is huddled on the roof praying for rescue, then coming closer through the rain you see it, it's a row boat coming towards you !

"Thanks for talking about alpha theory is bullshit, can you please debunk generation theory next? Its literally invented by christian fundamentalists hocking a book every few years. Giving this much power to religious fundamentalists is terrible and the lefitsts love falling back on this terrible theory."
"All the people you chose are weirdos and outliers. An alpha is a masculine man, no matter the race. Ronnie Coleman is an excellent example of an alpha male, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger. Both of these men show dominance over other men. What makes an alpha is his natural leadership abilities, similar to the alpha of wolf packs. If he is the strongest, best leader, the most intelligent, wealthiest, he is an alpha. CEO's of giant companies and successful politicians are all alpha's due to their success in life. Alpha has nothing to do with racism or sexism.  Alpha males are also not against feminism. None of these people want to take away women's right to vote or pay them less then men. The whole purpose of the alpha movement is to be more attractive to women. Alpha's in nature (wolves, bucks, etc) are more likely to survive, thus are naturally more attractive."

"Is it just me, or does that golden boy look and act kinda... girly? Like, in the subtle movements. He doesn't really act like someone who's happy to be dirty..."
"This is not anything related to the video but I thought it might amuse you. I found a post of someone who had a dream that went as follows: She overhears some dudebros talking about sex. One of them says, 'I would suck a dick.' Another one says, 'That's so gay, bro.' All of the dudebros look at their fellow and the first guy remarks, 'It doesn't have to be a guy's dick. Don't be a transphobe, Chad.' 'Don't be a transphobe, Chad.' That is all."

"1) Morality doesn't exist so at least use logic and not a non-cognitive.  2) You could have introduced the SDO or social dominance orientation which links alpha with racism which means all high-status people are racist but Heidi Klum fucked Seal till his face got fucked up.  3) read Colin Wilson's Criminal History of Mankind  - Mao' s dominant 5%  Status, dominance hierarchies by ww. cumins  Sapolsky's dominant 5% and Tinder/OK Cupid.

"If you had to choose: PJW or Contrapoints? They both have compelling arguments, im guessing only time will tell who was right.."
"That chart you had there with the arrows and so on really put things into a good perspective. I haven't seen your videos before but I can say I learned something. Thank you man"
"You are the best thing on the internet."
"Contra looks good though what  a beautiful person"
"Youtube just recommended your channel. But I didn't get why. I enjoy videos like yours, who takes a very controversial (or not) topic and build a discussion around it. Oh, contrapoints, know makes sense why youtube recommended it. Anyway, you make fair points and the topics are interesting, but the confusing part is: You seem to make comedy videos, at the same time, you came from academia (as you talked in some other video), and pose as 'Wait noob, lemme lecture you about the real truth'.  Sorry, got lost, my point is, you seem serious about the topics, but you choose fucking dumb people and examples. These people are clearly idiots. I saw that you have a video on Jordan Peterson, I'm gonna watch it, but the way you are approaching topics: using crazy people, small cuts with the stupidest things they say. It feels like a thought bubble.  And your audience wants to hear not the truth, but the truth the pleases them. If that's the case, I'm back: Why the fuck youtube recommended this channel?"
"I know this is hella old. But oh my sweet spaghetti monster with sauce... amazing."
"It's nice to know your unembellished voice and looks, it's honest. =D"
"How Contra Points just looks like a young god and the wannabe idiot just like... well, an idiot. I hope this wannabe Alpha will be denied of sex for all his life. And may his coffee always be decaf."
"Just discovered you yesterday thanks to The New Yorker. You have well researched and educated content. Thank you."
"gay"
"“Don’t allow nationalism to gain traction in Europe” so it can freely gain traction anywhere else right? Do you know about the Ottoman Empire and what is currently happening in Turkey with Erdogan. A lot of Turks in my European country support him. Make a video about that please! He’s not white but surely nationalism is also bad when brownies and blacks do it right?"

"I like the Golden One but goddamn this video was incredibly funny."
"I'm not a leftist like contrapoints, I dislike the left almost as much as I dislike the alt right. physically this 'Golden one' (lol) guy is more or less my type (though too muscular imo), and I still find him repulsive and unattractive, instead I find contrapoints both as male and female 100 times more attractive than this golden idiot whose face appears more and more ape-like to me the more I watch him talk and act like a fool."
"Ahh no arguments to be seen"
"wish this was in 1080p so I could see the rest of the bookshelf-Being in Time looks well worn but Being and Nothingness not so much-good call on that one buddy"
"This soy boy looks like a woman"
"True alphas don’t need the validation to make YouTube videos. True alphas focus on their work relationships and hobbies. They congratulate those more successful and give support to friends around them who aren’t. Kinda like “there are no girls on the internet” rule also apples to alphas"
"There's a squid that mimics female squids of the same species perfectly,enough so that the larger male squids ignore these smaller male squids completely,and while two or more of the larger male squids posture and duel one another for dominance,the smaller feminized male 'seals the deal' with the receptive female. Food for thought."
"It's so weird seeing Contra crossdressing like a guy in these older videos. Dressing up as a guy in a button down shirt is such an uncreative and weird costume to put on, so awesome that she ditched that bullshit"
"I haven't laughed so much for some time now! Thank you for being on point at hilarious at the same time."
"There is no better flex than....   SURPRISE FLEX!!!! :D :D :D"
"I don't think this is helpful but damn I just gotta say Natalie you're beautiful now but you were hot as the big bang when you lived as a man"
"Fuck you you pissant Stop undermining our Beautiful Europe"
"I have watched a bunch of commentary videos on 'the golden one', and I can't get over how UGLY he is!  His face is abhorrent.  His overuse of weightlifting and steroids make his body-to-head ratio ridiculous, and the fact that his torso is oversized makes his proportions disgusting.  That, paired with his views and opinions make him disgusting overall."
"Laughing so hard at 'the golden twink' part....jesus, I needed this. Thank you. Also making my way through your old videos, like so many others. Indubitably funny. Please keep making videos, because I love them."
"I know this video is super old you have like a 0% chance of seeing this but what the hell. I am curious what your thoughts are on more mens fashion/lifestyle people like Alpha M and so on. It seems like they use a decent amount of the same ideas around dating/women that you brought up here. And they definitely fulfill the parts about trying to sell you something. I feel like they definitely feed on the idea of being 'alpha' and getting women and a lot of fragility behind being 'manly'."
"Natalie: Great videos man. Got turned on to you last night through a buddy of mine, and I've been on a 9 hour binge. Utterly brilliant stuff mate; even with the little jabs and subtle nuances you insert for context... fantastic stuff... re: this particular video, could we not agree to be 'Beta +'?"
"Anyone who needs to go around frantically telling people how 'powerful and masculine' they are probably isnt either of those things. Isnt that common sense?"
"Back when Natalie wasn't transfemme so they were allowed to bare their chest... what is up with society?"
"Holy fuck her old voice sounds so weird now"

"way to insult YouTubers and commenters, though."
"his morals can be positive but it takes a right minded individual to sift out the crazy shit, just consider him a skyrim NPC"
"Self-proclaimed alpha males? That's fucking hilarious."
"You should put together a playlist of videos on this topic, starting with this one! I have a hard time explaining to my small town father what the alt-right is (he gave up on all news), and these really help. Thank you for the work you do!"
"Guys who think they're Alphas are the definition of betas."
"Literally nobody in this comment section has ANY clue what a 'Alpha' is."
"I know it's an old video but as a person who is concerned with games and works for a games company I still find it fun that they think that alpha is superior to beta...cause I keep thinking of alpha as the broken proof of concept phase and beta as a less broken you are finally ready to show it to the world phase..."
"Funny thing is, a 'guy' like you (quotes cuz I know you're not a male) would do better with women than any of those so called alphas. So, that would make this little twink the real alpha here :^)"
"I loooove your reaction to the videos x)"
"Could you explain 'femme fatale' as well?"
"I'm not defending this poor downs syndromed man @8:23 but right off that bat I can tell he isn't advocating for police to shoot MORE black people....what he's saying is that based on crime stats (which are ha I'll skewed and biased for a number of reasons) that police COULD be taking more black lives, but the police have such restraint that they aren't taking their lives."
"THE GOLDEN TWINK OMFG 🤣🤣"
"I'm from Finland. We are tomorrow celebrating out nation's 101st birthday. And according to Antony Beevor in his magnum opus The Second World War, during the Winter War when Stalin attacked Finland, Finland asked help from Germany. But the Nazi government told Finland to give in. So... In behalf of the republic of Finland... Fuck Golden One and his Nazi ass kissing!  11:15 Oh I heard Hugo and Jake mention this in one of their videos about Jordan Peterson. Hey I would LOVE to have you read a chick tract with them."

"God u r gorgeous"
"I love you. Lol this hit home with me so hard. As a gay male I’ve been called beta so many times ironically by men who want to sleep with me and think that labeling me as some sort of submissive sex object will make me take my pants right off!"
"That's a photo from Nosferatu the Vampyre!!!"
"If it weren’t for all the fascist beliefs, I’d feel sorry for this guy. It’s pretty obvious that he’s holding in some deep seated insecurity & a thirst for validation. When he talks about masculinity, it sounds more like he’s trying to convince himself than he is us. I wonder what his father is like."
"Almost forgot to watch this today"
"I'm trying so hard to concentrate on this video but I'm seriously distracted how The Golden One's head is tiny compared to his fucking massive body :) :) :)"
"What about the left wing alpha males, aka the 'White Knights' who bully guys who get rejected, and always take the woman's side even when the woman is being a hypocrite?"
"the jews fund contrapoints, unsubbed. jk. hitler told the german citizens that joos ('the international jew') were behind commmunism, bolshevism,and marxism (while in reality- yes, individual jews were behind it aka marx, lenin, many bolsheviks-- but not 'the jews', wtf). he used toxic idea in order to derail the masses against them, shifting the blame for the german poverty and failure of the early 20th century from the epic failure the german goverment did in WW1 to an amorphous 'JEWS!!'.   now alt-righters are using the exact same excuse- just exchanging commumism for feminism.  IT' S SO OLD. ONE WOULD'VE HOPES SUCH A SUPREME GROUP HAD SOME ORIGINALITY. jeez."
"I still ship Golden One x Contrapoints"
"Nah I would still rather be like the Golden One"
"Alpha means confident and masculine, you silly goose. Of course we cannot all be presidents and billionaires. And you don't have to, happiness is much easier to achieve."
"I’ve fallen in love with this video! You are fucking awesome! *hugs* Subscribing!"

"Brilliant!"

"Hillarious! :D I always new that He-Man exists."
"You make a pretty convincing guy tbh. 🤔"
"Been waiting for someone to comment on The Golden One for months. Such a weird, self-obsessed side of youtube"
"Funny because where I'm looking none of these people are Alphas in any sense. They aren't leaders, they're cucks omg"
"Weird weird weird weird weird weird"
"2:14 that golden speedo blended so well with your skin tone that I got shocked for a second because I thought you were naked"
"I thought some of this was going to be jokes, but then he goes and actually does it... I was talking about the Golden One, just to be clear."
"tbh alpha males seem alot more like insecure fucks than beta males"
"I noticed early on that a lot of men who have a need to look very masculine are often quite insecure. If they do not have muscles, they are not men, so they also adopt a lot of views that men are supposed to have in order to market themselves as manly. Carlin also spoke about the macho-struttering in locker-rooms, the macho culture within police and how some even have to beat up gay people in order to prove that they are straight manly men."
"I hope The Golden One will see the error of his ways and unable to resist your erudite observations, beauty and charm will gather you into his arms most swole and breathlessly whisper for forgiveness in your ear...Teddy watching from one of his IKEA loveseats, his little teddy heart at last unburdened that his troubled companion finally let go of his hateful ideology and delusions, to find love in the hairless, nubile arms of The Golden Twink. 😘"
"In contrast to these 'alpha males', I think men who are either slim with not much bulk, or ones that have chub are more attractive. Bulky/fit guys just kinda turn me off, personally."
"I can't help be feel like uh, Red Pill Philosophy's comment about sex being 'impaling' women with an 'ugly engorged penis' is body dysmorphia reflecting how he feels about his own body and member. I've found a lot of sex to be aesthetically pleasing (not just arousing) and found a lot guy's dicks to be rather beautiful looking I want it in my mouth put it in yum yum yum."
"There is a spiritual war going on, the same satanic forces behind multiculturalism, feminism ect is the same satanic force behind Nazism...all to divide and conquer humanity to create a one world government. Its so sad to see what is going on in the world, people are so brainwashed but if you try to resist and transcend it all like me you get spiritually beaten down by demonic alien grey and reptilian entities...since im so beaten down no one will take what i say seriously.  Nice clockwise swastika btw i was literally just looking into swastikas and their meanings...btw the clockwise is used in buddhism and other religions... it represents life and spiritually spiralling towards heaven unlike the anti clockwise which represents death and the black sun....evil.   I wonder why you used the clockwise instead of anti clockewise swastika if you would please tell me?"

"Any guy who says he’s an alpha male is a omega bitch guaranteed"
"Contra, you’re really smart cooky.. thx for articulating this issue"
"Love the Hendrix poster."
"I mean, women ARE attracted to testosterone and higher testosterone levels is associated with physical attractiveness (height, jaw, and muscles/fitness) and  behavioral attractiveness (motivation, and in many mammals and early humans, non-civilized or prehumans it is associated with status), so I don’t think the term alpha is used as an absolute, but used in a continuum and more contextually. If you studied neuroscience like you said you did, then you would know this. My favorite neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky mentions this a lot. The phenomenon of alpha male is very real but it is of course, still more complex than those guys make it out to be. You completely discarded the entire thing without giving it any credit. Thats preposterous."
"If you're obsessed with alphas and betas you're an Omega."
"These guys sound like they dislike women because women like men and that's gay."
"Im new here, the guy with the makeup on is probably the prettiest man Ive ever seen."

"8:37 when did kangaroo jack become a racist? Lmaooo"
"Please, please don't take this the wrong way, please understand I mean this in a positive, complimentary way... but seeing you as you are in the beginning of this video makes me sincerely wish you would reconsider and opt against physically transitioning. You are so perfect just the way you are, and it's so rare to find someone who I can relate to, as most people like me are always focused on transitioning instead of finding contentment with the bodies they were born with. And let me be clear, I do understand that for some people it is very difficult or even almost impossible to find contentment with the bodies they were born with. But I always try to urge anyone like me to really think about whether she is transitioning solely for personal benefit and betterment, or whether it is more a decision based on social pressures, specifically the social pressure that erroneously insists that you're not allowed to be accepted as who you are if you don't physically possess a vagina. Either way just know that I think you are absolutely flawless as you are, but I also fully support you if a physical transition is truly what will bring you peace and balance! If you are having conflicted feelings over whether or not to physically transition, though, just know that there is someone here for you if you need encouragement or advice. Also know that, when I see you like you are in the beginning of this video, it gives me immense encouragement about my own image and my own way of expressing myself. I would be the most comfortable and fulfilled if I presented my own aesthetics in such a manner, but I constantly deal with shyness and hesitation when it comes to just putting myself out there like that."
"This guy would make a good trans girl."
"As much as I hate to say it, and I do, I kind of like that guy too against my better judgment. He's kinda goofy, I like watching people run around in costumes, and we both like Skyrim. Kind of bummed he's a misogynist Nazi asshole."
"there can't be any alphas in a sexually repressed culture - any kind of repressed culture, but that one takes the proverbial cake"
"'when you look"
"at these social justice warrior freaks with their blue hair and their obesity and their low testosterone and their sexual perversity and their STDs and their useless degrees and their criminal histories'  omfg he turned it into kinda a bop at the end there"
"According to the amount self-proclaimed alphas on the internet, they outnumber betas 100 to 1. Real alphas don't express it and are leaders, and they look after the weaker among them. They also don't go after betas, they go after other alphas."
"These guys are fucking losers. To bad they don’t all die."
"It is pretty simple why they are all racist. They simply favor a hierarchical society because they believe it will aid them and therefore you attack equality and democracy on every level."
"as a brown female, I noticed the soap scum on that bathtub immediately, and I insist you get some white vinegar on that ring."

"Hunny, the insecurity can be seen from space in any of those 'macho' guys, but it's nice to see someone put it there so eloquently."
"Loki vs Thor?"
"youtubers are weird people"
"Quick comment:can we start no longer switching nationalism and national socialism as if they are the same. Nationalism has no inherent bad virtues, and has been used several times in a liberal progressive way. Currently everyone knows that nazism and facism is horrible, our fear and disgust of of it however has created a lot of misunderstandings on anything right of center"
"Amazingly well researched."

"Urk, Roosh."
"Wait. Is this Swede guy for real?"
"I've been to be a beta and I guess I am by their definition, but do I care? No. It's a silly childish game."
"nataLIE I LOVE YOU"
"You ability to compliment those you disagree with shows me that you strive to be objective, and it's what attracts me to your channel. You sometimes fail (not too badly) and I know you probably beat yourself up about it the moment a video goes live. To that I would like to say, you succeed far more than you fail in the objective department and I will be a fan of yours to the end.  I was introduced to your incel video and was immediately captivated by your integrity. I also like the videos in which you debate yourself yet still maintain the ability to be fair to both side's point of view. I don't know what words of encouragement to give that will be meaningful to you but I do hope you don't ever give up as long as you actually enjoy making these videos."
"They're more sigma at best beta at worst but not alpha"
"'The golden one looks like an alpha contrapoints'  Comment this on all his videos."
"if not a fascist, the golden one seems like a sweet guy... he is personification of dumb, privileged, patriarchal jock/thor archetype. i don't know if he's just playing as golden one for youtube because he knows he fits the stereotype, or he plays the role in his real life as well.... interesting...."
"I stalked the beefy guy (not to try and find nude pics of him because I thought he is kind of hot and i have low self worth or anything…) and hes marrying and gonna be a dad to a baby girl!, good for him, hope he stops w the shits tho."

"...am I the only one who sorta sees David Bowie in his face? I can't unsee it."
"That. Was. Amazing."
"Im new, is he trans or does he just like drag?"
"The Golden One's face looks exactly like Henry Cavill after his mustache got removed via CGI for the Justice League film. Slightly off."
"'alpha males/females' are supposed to be the dominant ones the main problem with that is most people don´t know what dominance is 'hiding'(accidentally displaying) your insecurities and/or being excessively aggressive, confrontational, violent and/or emotionally detached, unavailable is not dominance, it´s basically 'beta-behavior'"
"very smart from the fascists to use those terms alpha and beta to recruit young insecure white males. Everything they do is actually very fucking smart and it's amazing to think that it's still working in this day and age."
"Oh please tell me this Golden One guy is a joke! He seems like such a cartoon character."
"Pepe sitting on the sofa. You managed to infiltrate my mind ContraPoint, looking for those fascist clues.."
"This video was yikes. That guy looks like the son of odin when you are a mentally ill soy boy"
"I totally love this except that your wing eyeliner is just slightly crooked. I sympathize. I can't get mine symmetrical either. I'm such a beta female. :-D"
"The dramatic disrobing aroused me."

"~ DIRTY TUB ~"
"Is AiU really 'alpha male'?"
"Ok I know this video is old but I'm slowly making my way through your content and I just think you're the bee's knees."
"Excellent video."
"If someone tried to make you alpha, I'd kick their insecure ass. You keep your glorious fine ass the way it is. Yes homo."
"I love your videos! Heard you on Trapo and decided to watch and now I've binged."
"being alpha isn't something you can just become, it's something that you naturally do, and no it's not about getting laid or calling yourself alpha. most people can point out the alpha pretty quickly.  and usually they are the rock that everyone clings to, someone they go for help when they need it. protector of the group and mediator of it aswell.  the whole alpha thing is odd because it's a case by case basis, for example if there is a group in a room and the original alpha leaves the room then someone takes the original alphas place as the new alpha, and this can be both men or women so who the alpha is pretty much allways in a state of fluctuation.  they don't have to lead but they usually do because the people around them trust their judgement or want them to lead because the others aren't secure in themselves to assume that role but they do it if they have to. remember there is a difference between someone who is appointed leader position and someone who just takes the leader position. the latter usually is just a tyrant or guided by their own selfishness or narcissism.  that's how i view it anyhow."
"The Golden has more boob than I have!"
"Contrapoints is maybe the most interesting person I've found on youtube."
"Your videos basically have explained to me that all of this internet crazy identity political radicalization is all caused from forums in reddit and 4chan. I was wondering why this world turned upside down and this sea of population comments with their crazy jargan vocabulary all came from.   Makes me miss obama era for sure. Barely of this shit exsited prior to trump except your standard women's studies class lesbian feminist from the 90's. My how things have changed. Propaganda has never been more trendy. Cults are the norm to make your friends at. Be in a political cult or be alone!"
"Liberals are alpha males. Alpha males fight for their friends and protect people."
"I love your videos, sadly I’m not educated enough in philosophy to understand the whole complexity of your messages, yet I really appreciate what you do, despite of feeling dumb.  Now speaking about this video:  Those guys are ugly inside and out. The Swiss one is an incel that is why he is full of hate.  Women do find confident men attractive, but bragging is not confidence. You can be a man of a few words and be confident."
"I'm in love with Contrapoints."
"Obama is alpha af"
"You're very attractive as both male and female. I hope you take this as a compliment."
"Everyone in the comments are T R I G G E D"
"A true alpha doesn't have to say he's an alpha."
"only read the title - What, omegaverse? I don't like those..."
"when a tranny has a bigger dick than you"
"If you have to call yourself an alpha, then you're not an alpha."
"The problem with the 'alpha males' is twofold. First, they misunderstand what it means to be alpha, totally throwing out basically every aspect aside from 'get muscles and women'. Second, everyone fucking knows that an alpha male would NEVER talk about being an alpha male. That's the least alpha thing imaginable.   The problem with your logic in this video is, while you nail white nationalist beliefs to a fucking T, you imply that many people who are NOT white nationalists likely are. Anti-feminists? Donald Trump? Even some of the people in your video probably aren't white nationalists despite having racist tendencies. Being racist is only one factor in that."
"Why not invade rusia? Fuck that country! It's done some of the worst damage against humankind in history."
"Hey. Who are you to tell me I'm not a Mysterious Mermaid from Another Planet®?! My flippers are all in an uproar now."
"This video turned me gay"
"This is a very well put together video.  I never liked the idea of alpha and beta males, maybe because I didn't want to be a beta, but it was never that important to me to be an alpha anyway, as I value creativity over dominance.  For me, an example of men I consider beta are those who feign alliance with a progressive cause just to get laid.  If you mean what you do and do what you mean, you are not a beta.  Being a beta would then be a choice to not be authentic or risk rejection for your ideals."
"As you say it is competence not dominance that establishes these men as alpha, Warren Buffet or The Zucc are excellent examples. I'm not falling for these extreme rightwingers, but as a man who's low like myself. i'm beeing treated poorly by people, men and women. And Peterson is merely telling us to stand up straight in the face of it. i don't like feminism, i really don't. i'm just beeing honest here."
"Kudos! Fucking headshot, bruv!  The retraction of the alpha wolf paper ought to be the end of any argument on this nonsense."
"Feels golden one man, I enjoy some of his videos about martial arts and gaming and weight lifting, but I've ignored his political ones because I have 0 idea about what the guys talking about lol"

"Please understand these guys are not white men they are of pharaohic bloodline. The bloodline of Cain  who hates white Europeans we are their enemies. As they state!!  All around Sweden you will see the Templer cross the Templers are everywhere there. They are the second third and fourth etc. born sons that had to live in Temple’s because they did not Inherit any land or money only the firstborn sons did.  The firstborn son is our the old world order from the red house. Templar’s are the rest from the White House NWO. This is why the Red Cross and white flag. As you can see the Red Cross often looks like it could be pulled up straight into a pyramid. That’s the pharaonic symbol you’ll start to notice most of the flags of the world have red and white on them and the blue stands for war. Notice there is no blue on the Swedish flag because they are always neutral just the financiers and beneficiaries. Please learned this"
"You can tell that man is not actually a big guy more like a short framed guy who’s worked out a lot Schwarzenegger was massive this guy is not massive he’s probably 5 foot seven  Remember this guy is from Sweden you know the place that stated they were neutral in every war yet funded them then hid  behind the curtain like cowards this is his ancestery."
"Btw “golden none”please no more baby blue and go up a size in your T-shirts for goodness sake‘s looks foolish"
"lifting weights does not make you an alpha male I seen plenty of weight lifters crumble in my life. Neither the incredibly huge ego u posses. Manny a fight has been won or lost because the other guy is willing to go further or has a lot less to lose. not necessarily the stronger man. Tru strength lays in the mind and heart of men. endurance  through will power is most valued."

"I think we need another oil scene."
"I feel weird seeing your chest, like I have to look away XD"
"Alpha males are a really depressing lot"
"How the hell did this video not get banned?! Amazing!"
"You've lost me at 'extreme anti-feminism is often coupled with racism'. You then just spew some narrative as an explanation. The wrong mix of power and desperation lead indeed to the massive genocide when the urge to equalize the outcome of every people's fruit of labor was extremely common. Much more people were wiped out of our planet on much wider scale. Yet you stubbornly present some stupid freaks on the Internet as the major  threat to our society. Those freaks don't scare me. The smart people like you who are that blind scare me more."
"I'll be honest here: The Golden One looks about as attractive to me as one of those upside-down triangle traffic-signs."
"At the risk of sounding like an 'alpha' obsessed male. I bet if 90% of these guys got girlfriends/ boyfriends and learned to function in a relationship they'd probably never post a video again."

Former prime minister of Israel said about antisemitism: 'Its a trick we use to stop criticism and get the public on our side.'  Criticizing someone based on their race or religion is terrible. Criticizing a government that has committed repeated war crimes is necessary."

An alpha male is simply someone who has the masculine qualities of physical bravery and the ability to lead in difficult times of crisis. Some men are alphas, but most of us are not. It takes all types of masculine & feminine expression to make society work."

"It seems like the 'alpha male' as they define themselves is someone who strong and forceful (gets what they want). I think the reason these people do not become alpha's in the ethological sense is because being strong and forceful is not how you become an alpha in human society... instead you have to have good networking skills, get people to like and respect you, get people to rely on you etc etc... it's a complicated process and it can't just be done by being tough."

He hates black people and arabs, he hates jews, he's sexist, homophobic, and transphobic. I don't think I've ever met a worse person than him.  On another note, ContraPoints, I really admire how you can make fun of yourself and still be serious when discussing topics, you seem like a very interesting person :)"

Somehow even realizing that he is sincere in his fascist beliefs, I am having a hard time grasping the fact that he is saying all this stuff UNIRONICALLY, and not just doing a really, really funny parody of hyper masculine, racist Neo Nazi types.  Its a shame, I actually kind of wish I could like the guy.  I mean come on, he unashamedly talks to his teddy bear, and he has a cute froggy sitting on the edge of his couch.  If it werent for the weird sexist Nazi bullshit he'd be downright cuddly.  Though all those pecs could never compare to the sheer hotness that is the Golden Twink   ;-D"

"Alpha is usually confused with  a douchebag fuckboi which are two completely different types of guys with the same physical appearance. Sort of like emo and Goth can be confused of either one. Truth is an alpha is  basically someone who is so  confident within himself that he doesn't need approval by anyone else or jump on the bandwagon  just to come off as better than anyone else because he does not need approval by anybody else and usually shows traits of a leader without actually needing anybody to follow. Where a douchebag or fuckboi is the epitome of the opposite . Both types normally hit the gym but one does it for the Aesthetics of physical appearance and material possessions where the alpha does it because he knows that it will benefit himself in the long run physically and mentally .  Whether you agree upon this or not. to each their own"

"I once dated a guy who labeled himself as an alpha. At first I didn't understand why because when we were together, he was actually very sweet, caring, and was actually relaxing to be around.  The problem came when I started hanging out with him while he was with his friends. He turned into an entirely different person. He always tried to be the dominant figure in the room. If that position was taken away, he got aggressive.  I was really sad when I realized that I had to break up with him for my own sanity. He was close to perfect when it was just him and me, but I just couldn't handle him around other people."

Enough for sentence fragments, apparently.   Man, I'm witty.  Also, if a dude talked to me about how sex was nothing but him impaling women on his ugly, engorged wiener, I'd direct him to Potterverse fan fiction for creative sexytimes ideas. Fanfic authors are not afraid to experiment."
"Lol I'm here for Omega booty"
"Fucking moron! Wingnuts are obsessed with Alpha. But they're all just men who despise women and they've all got their reasons for being racists. And the more some idiot claims to be an alpha, the more of a loser he is. Take Alex Jones, who pretends to be one but he sponsors these male vitality pills that seem to have the same effect as testosterone, ie shrinking his balls and brain. And makes him rage all the fucking time, the moron."

"Fun fact: when the norse beat the crap out of the Franks, they bred into the local population so hard and fast that they were sporting brunette bowl-cuts by the time they invaded across the English Channel. Same in the Iberian Peninsula:  they adapted so well and so fast to cultures that didn't have to spend 6 months of the year shut up in their longhouses with the sheep and cows that the Norsemen disappeared as a separate ethnicity within a handful of generations in most of the regions they occupied.  Apart from the north of England for some reason: probably the weird beer they have up there."

I'm one of the few exception, because I hate everybody on this planet but my friends and family. Everybody else can go to hell, I don't care."
"In those golden shorts you remind me of the Greek mythological Hermes; messenger of the gods. All you need is a caduceus in your hand.  And the Golden One… I won't say which ancient mythological persona he brought to mind lol!"
"You can't ignore the statisticians though, non-whites per capita commit more crime commit more sexual assault cases and are more likely to be under a cultural system that encourages rape and that women are under men.

That makes me wanna hug you even more. You're a good person, I hope you stay around."
"Creepy"
"ContraPoints, I just found your channel recently, and I must say. 1. This is hilarious, and 2. I hope to good God that you've cleaned your tub since this. The reason why the grout between your tiles is almost orange isn't just mineral deposits, it's from the same bacteria that causes UTIs. Spray that shit down with pure white vinegar if it's still in your tub before you start pissing burning cloudy stank, if that doesn't work, just light the entire thing on fire fam."
"Yikes. This video is badly researched. You conflated actual 'Alpha's' with people who self-proclaim to be alphas. That was your mistake.    And you confused business success with social-hierarchy. Basically assuming that wealth is what makes you an Alpha... it doesn't. Just like among dogs; age, strength, size, sex are not what make you an 'alpha'. It's innate. It's basically a personality trait. It is essentially confidence, but not the type you displayed in your video. What you displayed were people who are insecure and that feel the need to bully certain groups of people to feel better. It's a coping mechanism for not having what it takes.    Also, Beta's are not at the bottom. Omegas are. Omegas are technically the ones who are spineless and get stepped all over. Beta's will try to one up each other. The majority of people are just Betas. It wouldn't make sense for the majority or even half, to be born leaders.    A select few people are very good at learning social cues and being charming and just evoking a vibe of confidence and safety. Very few people can do this naturally. We do often see these people take on leadership roles. Societies need someone to lead them. Throughout our evolution we were always led by 1 leader or chief. The majority of people are more than happy to please, follow orders  and contribute. Not that many are fit to lead. Leading because you have a power complex is not the same as leading for the benefit of all."

"You need a wider view on the world my friend. the golden one is weird, there is no question about that. but he is also very impressive, he is like a living piece of art and i like how he connects this to the gods ('i am a son of the gods') which is very similiar to the mindset of pre modern europe....it is strange, but also a very brave way to think...can you even understand that?  you know egon friedell? he was a jewish austrian writer, a great idependent guy, gotta love him. in his philosophy about cultural history he stated, that every great thing, every progress come out of sickness. there is no progress without sickness. it is like: we suffer about the destroying off manhood in western civilisation (which is a fact, you just need a to open a history book and compare..if you dare ;) ) , some suffer more, some even feel freed (like you i guess), suffering makes sick and they one who suffer start to create answers. ...often they are a little bit weird ;)  just wait maybe something good will come out of it, maybe it wont work...but you look at life, while you are represinting death....that is my opinion. sorry for insulting you...i did it with a smile in my face ;)"

"Idk if you're a metal gear fan but you give off this liquid snake feel in this vid with that outfit lmao.   Also I'd like to say that as a macho man I dont think I've ever heard another macho man (ok maybe once but that guy was both drunk & high) use the alpha/beta bullshit...don't know why but that whole concept makes me cringe. I prefer the 'hes cool/hes not cool' concept better."

"This may be the best video on youtube"
"i fking loved the surprise flex, imma pull that one myself."
"I wonder if those alpha males ever stumble across the alpha-beta-omega-trend in fanfiction (mostly gay men with weird wolf-like anatomy having lots of kinky sex).   Just ... what would happen in those brains?"
"Beta is a pretty high rank in this terminology, cause there can only be one alpha per group. i would probably call people omega, especially since the character looks like a butt."
"The golden one makes me cringe."
"At least one of them had the wherewithal and the brains to wear a helmet it's not football or hockey helmet but it's a start at least he won't hurt himself lol no but seriously look at the men that claimed the alpha they're really not that attractive I mean even the golden one isn't really that attractive yeah sure he has big muscles but his face it just seems a little weird looking"
"I can't express how grateful I am that I found your channel. This is the most on point, constructive and educational content I've seen since the beginning of YouTube. And you manage to make it fun without making the videos ridiculous and taking away from how serious the topics actually are. I wish I had something more mindblowing to say here, but I don't. I'm just impressed."
"Hate to break it to you but nonwhite men do commit much more rape than white men (maybe except Eastern Asians). So it's a valid point to say that letting more of them in, is a threat to women. And btw why did you use Obama as an example of a true alpha male with high social standing? Why not the current president? ;-)"

"Maybe if society didn't feminize men but taught them to harness their inner spirit, perhaps, the suicide rates wouldn't be so high for young men my age. Boys in school are treated like bad girls for acting like boys these days. A kind of militant spirit could be harnessed, the Romans had the Campus Martius, we should get something like that, to relieve the pressures of life and build male bonds. I feel that would relieve stress and it may decrease suicide rates because of its reliefe on the spiritual rot caused by an untrained militant spirit"

"he lives in uppsala and always been a weirdo"
"Excellent point about the genocide thing. It may not be immediately apparent, but to suggest that there are two different classes of men in the world--'alphas' who deserve our praise and admiration, and 'betas' who are worthless and expendable--is an incredibly dangerous, sociopathic, and dehumanizing idea, to say the least."

I get it you don't get you are free and that's what you like but that will also be your painful extinction and your kind of people will beg and cry for mercy in the near future, you may laugh now but you will hate yourselves most of all for what's to come."
"'toxic masculinity' Ok"
"I'm sorry but the Viking wanna be just looks so gay. Like is he seriously straight or compensating?  Are you sure he's not mentality ill? He is literally an idiot. Please, tell me he's a laughing stock of the alt right and no one actually takes him seriously. And people laugh at feminist frequency"
"Toxic masculinity ruins the party again"
"Guy looks like Thor and Derek Hough had a baby"
"i have the weirdest  boner...."
"On a related note, I used to be really into weight lifting in college but avoided most online forums devoted to weight lifting because they'd inevitably be full of frustrated 'alphas' bitterly whining about how the only reason they aren't swimming in pussy if because of feminism or because black guys (with their magical giant dicks) are 'stealing' on the premo white women. It's like they were so convinced that having biceps bigger around than your head was a sure fire chick magnet that when that turned out not to be true, their brain was so incapable of processing it that it just melted down."
"Self proclaimed 'alphas' tend to be guys who don't have a lot going for them because the alpha mentality is their way of comforting themselves over the fact that they don't have a lot going for them. It feels better to tell themselves that the only reason they're not at the top of the social hierarchy and being fawned over by willing harems of supermodels (despite that CLEARLY being their rightful place in the natural order) is because the natural order has been corrupted by feminists/progressives/leftists/snowflakes/Jews than it does to admit to themselves that maybe they don't have a lot going for them because of some personal short coming that they have or because sometimes life just isn't fair."

"I gotta ask, is their a reason for all this Wolf Milk?"
"Gay propaganda lol."
"I do believe there is validity in wanting men to reclaim their alphaness(?). Men need to grow the fuck up and assume responsibility for their life. However therse fringe-maniacs have a, shall we say, scewed image of what masculinity is.  Masculinity is not blaming people or groups for what you see as a societal problem, it is shouldering duty and taking responsibility for changing your surroundings for the better. It's about taking action, being assertive when you need to be and to listen when you need to. It is to admire your betters, to aspire to be like them and lifting up those weaker than you.  Masculinity need not be toxic, in fact it has been and can be an overwhelming source of good."
"You have been beautiful before transition and you are beautiful after it. I am so happy you quit 4 chans bullshit. Stay balanced, happy and in a good place in your life. You have very pretty natural shade of skin tone and gorgeous undertone, your hair is healthy and glossy, your eyes are almond shaped and face very proportional. Without make up. And you bring out color of your eyes wonderfully with the make up. You are a beautiful woman. And your intelect and articulated talants just paint your mind in colors of the rainbow."

"The Golden Twink... I fell in love with a tongue-in-cheek Greek statue that came alive and ruined me for all other beings. In all seriousness, I have never found an oiled masculine form particularly stirring but that has changed today and I am grateful. And wistful. Very strange to have those feelings simultaneously during an entirely new experience. I imagine you won't take a compliment about your body as something shaming or awful (if I guessed wrong, I truly apologise), but please allow me to say you're fucking beautiful. And it would be an eternal shame for those balls to remain dry- BAHAHA I'M SORRY, I FORGOT THIS ISN'T REDDIT!! Damn it, you ruined me. RUINED!"

"imo alpha males aren’t inherently strong/masculine, its more about unquestioned authority. People who are calm are way more ‘alpha’ than people who aren’t. People who identify as alpha make me want to fight them. Id never try and fight someone who was a true ‘alpha’. u just gotta get that calm authority lads."
"Alpha male is just a guy that a woman will bang just because of his genetics - no money required. Betas need to 'provide shit' to get sexual access. Christian Grey is alpha. Married guys who get sex once a month despite how hard they work or how much they bring home are betas. These are just euphemisms guys, literary vehicles if you will they're not saying humans act like wolves. Wolves are FAR more noble a creature."

"aku"
"What about the channel Alpha M? He is a good example of a non-racist, nonpartisan manhood that young men can aspire to. I am all for critiquing the fascist alpha males of Youtube, but you are also devaluing the good guys who are trying to be good examples by not acknowledging them. Not all guys who want to be alpha males are dicks."
"You're trying to make The Golden One looks ridiculous, but you just look 10x more ridiculous than him in your tranny get-up"
"no one who is alpha has to go around telling everyone how alpha they are. So by picking people who go around proclaiming there  alpha you've only cherry picked out a straw man  not alphas."

"Racist Kangaroo's real name is Devon Tracey."

I mean, these people call Justin Trudeau--the leader of an entire fucking country--a 'beta male'. That's how I know these terms don't mean anything, and exist for no other reason than to boost the self-esteem of pathetic losers who have done nothing with their lives."
"My god, you're like Griffith! Nice looks..."
"I watched this video through my fingers hahaha, so much fucking cringe :') BTW I don't understand these guys' obsession with old Scandinavia. In Viking history women actually had a lot of power and were super respected. Keeper of the finances, leader of the household, etc. I mean, even without the extra bearded viking husband I'd go for that. Jeez they just pick some things out of history and completely fuck it up to their ideal worldview that never even existed. Ughhh."

"Wait. Fenris is a male Wolf. That would make his Milk his ......... cum?"
"Wtf? He’s such a narcissist"
"I personally don't think you are a 'beta' (if people usually mean uncharismatic, weak-behaving males); however I feel you cherry-picked some ridiculous examples of men that people (or rather themselves) might consider to be alpha males. I think there is naturally nothing wrong with calling out the stereotypical/expected attributes women and most gay/bisexual men would find generally attractive in men and sum them all up in the term 'alpha male'. Being an alpha male barely means more than a certain set of behaviours performed by a male at a specific time hence the behaviour itself is interchangeable and not fixed entirely to a specific type of personality- instead it is associated with a character portrayed by a personality. You might be an asshole or a nice guy, shy or upfront, but once you do something charismatic and brave you act like an alpha person (this may also apply to women by the way).   P. S. I think you are acting as an 'alpha' in situations where you dare use reasoning and debate against things you disagree with, or when you don't get afraid of answering provocative questions."

"i know i should hate The Golden One, but i can't. i don't know if i'm blinded by hot hunkiness or if, compared to the other assholes on the list, he's arguably the least awful. he doesn't seem 'malicious' in his thinking. he just strikes me as being in his own little world and very confused with everything around him. i wonder what his background was growing up, i'm really curious.  am i the only one who sees The Golden One as a living fanfiction? i swear he looks and sounds like a creation a far right conservative born teen discovering his sexuality would write up on wattpad in a desperate attempt not to be gay and failing miserably at it!"

"When seeing the unveiling of the Golden Twink I nervously questioned my sexuality."
"8:25 The red pill guy is probably referencing the amount of violent crime committed by black people is so wildly disproportionate to the population size that achktshually there should be more incidents involving them being shot by police.  Just thought I'd throw in some context, because you seem to be strawmanning."

"golden twink so sexy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3"
"I feel like 'alpha males' don't understand that beta wolves are supposed to be high ranking second in command wolves. I always think they might be talking about something akin to an omega  one has but that doesn't work either since they would need to actually help each other.  TL;DR 'Alpha males' don't understand pack hierarchy"

"I thought you were kicking a strawman in the low hanging fruit, then I watched the rest of the video..."
"A good five minutes then the video degrades into a 'communist killed twice as may people as the nazi's but I don't care video.' Stopped it after six minutes. P.S. The Golden One doesn't call himself Nazi or the alt-right but when you are a godless communist, what consequences does lying really have?"

"When I asked my high school history teacher why Anti-semitism is such a persistent problem, his answer was something like 'because they killed Jesus,' which was unhelpful, somewhat anti-semitic in itself, not actually how it went down in the Bible, and also not a cogent response considering the secularization of Europe (and to a lesser extent, America) over the last century.  Your explanation makes much more sense.  As a white woman I feel somewhat dirty being the exuse alt-right fascists are using to upend democracy, consciously or not."

"I really like the golden one, and support some of his ideas. But this was a fun video!"
"2:12 what song is this"
"'How does one become alpha?'  I can answer this for you, very easily: You said in your video regarding PUAs that you don't work out to be strong or healthy. You work out, in an attempt to be sexually attractive, though you apparently still have a lot of room for development. Though I don't really care for his content, I've familiarized myself with The Golden One, and I know that he works out for all three of those reasons... being sexually attractive, as a secondary concern, but mostly because he wants to be strong and healthy.  That's the difference between an alpha and a beta, between someone like him and someone like you. A beta WANTS something, and an alpha has the strength of will to actually get it. A beta makes decisions solely on acceptability, because it's what others want out of them, whereas does things because THEY want it for themselves.  It's the difference between you and the Golden One, but it's also the difference between a soldier and a 'conscientious objector' (note: coward), and it's the difference between a Malcolm X, who takes the stage and makes their voice heard, and a protestor who merely blends into the crowd and hope no one notices them. It arguably describes the difference between the modern right and left. Right wingers, on average, make more money, have more children, are more sexually attractive and are overall happier than their left wing counterparts. The right is led by alphas, and the left is lead by loud betas."
"You're a god among mortals"
"Well, as a young fertile white female in my prime i can say with most certainty that this alpha strong man is an absolutely  unappealing hunk of overkill and over compensation. My instincts are not responding well. Im probably juat brainwashed though..."
"God, this is so comprehensive! Take me now!!!!!!"
"What's funny about the golden one is he claims to be a powerful alpha but like, there's something adorable about him that's making me overlook his ridiculous nazism it's like a giant teddy bear denying the holocaust."
"what i like about ContraPoints is that she knows the right better than the right itself. It makes them look pathetic"
"If you actually watched Golden ones videos on Adolf Hitter then you’d know that he’s not a Nazi. He doesn’t like Hitler but he did praise his economic policies. Also the Golden Ones advance has helped me so much, I now have a girlfriend, and a well paying job since talking his advice. No offence but I am not going to take advice on how to be a man from one of the most feminine men on the planet. When we talked about Alfa males we don’t mean it in the Scientific way it’s just a quick way of describing a masculine guy. Also it was kind of dishonest how you took the Golden Ones jokes out of context to trike anyone that doesn’t regularly watch his channel."
"You made me feel good about unsuscribing from all the red pill channels."
"0:26 makes me cry every time"
"The thought of her making these vids really all by her self in her home amazes me. It makes me like this channel and her content even more."

"God dammit,I like to show my gay pda because of their fucking guns in public and fucking goddamn puritanical bullshit,shit(to you) in your face,ok that came out wrong ,I didn't mean shit in 'your' face,I  mean LGBT have the sane rights as s's,and we should not even have to make a fight,rights are rights,period,everybody is on the same team weather we realize it or not"
"When the flex dude got in I was like wtf,I like fbb's but damn no beard I'm sorry"
"big dick energy > alpha"
"You can say whatever you want, he gave me self confidence, made me improve myself, both physically and mentally, and I am now very much happy and healthy than when I was like you, depressive and without any value. So on this point, he's at least useful, him"

"If I'm Omega Male for commenting, does that mean Charleton Heston played me in a movie? That sounds kinda Alpha..."
"There's plenty of far more reasonable heathens and European pagans out there, not to mention more than a few queer ones like myself. Insecure whini ergi like the Golden One are just laughable cosplayers."
"“Calling yourself ‘alpha’ basically means you fetishize male dominance.” This. People in these circles so seldom understand how homoerotic their schtick is.   God help me if a gay version of the Golden One ever emerges."
"You're not a beta male you're an alpha female"
"We might think about it as response of a certain group of young males to a new set of expectations women tend to have when it comes to relationship. It seems like these guys can't understand/handle these new standards and lose their head over it. You can see that by the fact they put so much emphasis on muscle and looking. Bunch of losers."
"Conservatives deny that racism is inherently racist, and yet their own most vocal standard bearers are a bunch of self-proclaimed Nazis. I can't even deal with conservatives seriously anymore."
"Oh my, I can't get enough of your videos."
"The Golden One desecrates the Mjolnir he wears around his neck.  Fuck him. Fuck Nazis. Hail the gods."
"Alpha males are essentially Jesus, Horus or Marduk bruv. Fag wads like 'The golden one' are just obnoxious fools who have nothing to base their self worth on except for trivial things like muscle size. If you want to understand what an alpha male is it's essentially someone that everyone admires, and to strives to emulate. Like Daddy Trump.....jkjk lol."

But .... is it as pervasive as it looks? Have they lost their puny, immature... minds?"
"Found you through Blair White. ( I surprisingly don't hate her. I think she's a human who is a little misguided but in her own way is trying to do good, even if some of it's harmful) Anyway, really liked you in the debate and am so glad I found your channel. You're hilarious and make some awesome points:D"
"u put on a full face of makeup just to pour milk on it, you are my true alpha"
"It's funny just how miserable cishet men seem to want to make themselves. Maybe some girls are perfectly peachy, or even PREFER short, low testosterone, beta, less muscular guys. But nope. My opinon AS A WOMAN doesn't matter because supposedly my 'natural female biological programming' will kick in when Chad's shadow falls across my path.   It's been 26 years. Still waiting and still perfectly happy with people who treat me like a person and act like themselves instead of never-ending insecure posturing..."

"I love that my daughter showed me this channel (specifically the Jordan Peterson video).  These are really interesting.  Thank you."
"The amount of bodies piled up by the likes of Hitler are a fraction of a fraction of those from mao, stalin, pol pot, etc.  In the end, it doesn't matter, the goal is the same:  Monopoly.  Also, Hitler was backed by many international corporations and financiers;  the same ones that claim to be communist/socialist.  As for terms like 'Alpha', what it is really referring to, is sexually attractive males high in testosterone during female ovulation, as outlined in this video by Dr. Lisa Wellings https://youtu.be/-LZZJTR0GxE  Low testosterone males are sought after during other portions of the cycle for security.    The saying 'Alpha fucks, beta bucks'  established by the Red Pill type of community, is referring to the repeated observed behaviors of females who, though claiming to have no physical requirements for attraction to try hard males, demonstrate through behavior that they do not need to actually know anything about a guy to have sex with him, just high testosterone (masculinity) because that is the internal subconscious reproductive strategy of the female of the species, and there is plenty of biological science to prove this fact, aside from eye witness accounts from third parties viewing the behavior objectively.  Just have a look at romance novel covers, for crying out loud.  https://www.google.com/search?q=romance+novel+covers&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjE5Kb1ypXcAhVBmK0KHd05ALQQ_AUICigB&biw=1310&bih=865  Chippendales isn't full of weak, stringy or chubby dudes.  That doesn't bring in the profit.  Sex sells, and as it turns out, females do have general attraction switches related to height, physical strength/build, dominance, and wealth."

"I was going to counter the 'no white person wants black people in American cities' as I'm like, 'I'm okay for this'... but then I remembered I am a Melungeon whose first language is Cree. Well... the Swampy Regions of Ruperts Land in Canada equivalent of Melungeon."
"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. Because the beauty of the white aryan women must not perish from the earth. HAIL ODIN"
"Not that i'm a fan of any of those guys but I think your examples of alpha males: politicians and corporate CEOs aren't the best as modern capitalist society is ruled by the people who can best ruthlessly lie, dicksuck, cheat and deceive their way to the top or a guy who got kind of lucky with an idea whose time had come. Some of the points these red pill guys make about modern society aren't all ridiculous, I thought you kind of cherry picked and strawmanned the worst of them tbh. I think you should debate one of the more intellectual 'red pill' guys, because these videos are kind of just lampooning characters to the applause of a progressive audience and the veneer of intellectual depth isn't really honest as it merely addresses a strawman of what you project the oppositional argument is."
"I have to say I have never heard of the Golden One until I found your channel. I don't want to check his channel out too but he is too gloriously rediculous for me not to. He seems to be the exagerations I make shitting on the alt right made manifest in real time. Alomaost validating the nasty things I say about them sometimes. Now that I think about that it's like he may actually doiong good by displaying the very absurdity I proclaim, making it manifest ."

"I think the golden one is OK, he's definitely entertaining to watch. I took the opposite road to him with regard to masculine pursuits, never interested in sport or bodybuilding  etc. so it's fun to see that sort of guy working out his world view. He's a strange egg for sure."
"I loved this!! duuude golden twink FTW!!! \,,/,"

"That's not LARP, that's RPG"
"Did the Golden One use an Uruk-Hai as an example of an alpha male????"
"I'm sorry we're supposed to start looking at Lord of the Rings ORCS as our male role models now??? I thought the point of Lord of the Rings was that true heroism can come from even the beta males like Frodo"
"Never seen Stockholm syndrome so brilliantly displayed as this video"
"The way the golden one pronounces his 'ee' vowels is very strange, it's like he closes a laryngeal fold, and that's not a thing in any of the swedes I know, that's a him thing"
"so is beefy like an animation ego?"
"I'm disturbed by the fact that three of the books in the Golden One's library are fantasy novels I enjoy."
"The whole alpha/beta thing is one of those things high on the truthiness scale because it sounds like you use Greek words like some kind of scientist."
"You are just great!"
"It's actually hilarious watching your psychological history as you slip from simple crossdresser into full blown transexual. At least it would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad."
"Chad Thunder-cock confirmed. I'm dying from laughter! 😂😅"
"I don't think the chosen son of the golden gods would have a 5 head and a snout."

"Does the Golden One have a girlfriend?"
"11:36: When you say that there aren't a lot of Fortune 500 CEOs going around and bragging that they are alphas, I'm reminded of the story by Elon Musk's first wife that as they danced at their wedding reception, he told her 'I am the alpha in this relationship.'  This 'alpha' toxicity is reportedly very common among the venture capital crowd in Silicon Valley."

"Come on, Contra. As we all know, beta radiation, whether negative or positive, is always mass-less and has a charge of magnitude 1. Since the term 'alpha' exists as an alternative and since, as we all know, alpha radiation is equivalent to helium nucleus without electrons and thus has a charge of plus 2 with a atomic mass of about 4, we can conclude two things.   First, whatever 'positive' represents to these people, you either need to become positive or become MORE positive. Judging by the amount of bitching about Jewish people, we can safely conclude that it has nothing to do with happiness, so it is likely something to do with the direction of your politics. I would guess that positive corresponds to conservative roughly. From this we can conclude that, in order to become an alpha male, you need to become more right-wing.   The second thing? You need to become more massive. I'd make a, 'do you even lift, brah' joke, but that is actually the wrong way to look at this. Alpha radiation, as we all know, can be blocked by even something as small as a sheet of paper, whereas beta radiation needs something metallic to block it. As such, an alpha male is big, but also nearly unable to actually break through any obstacles put into their way.   In other words, you need to become hard right-wing and either a body-builder unable to use their muscle for any practical purpose or morbidly obese and unable to move of your own accord.   ...I recommend bulking up first. God help you if you become a gamma male by accident."
"My God, this guy is a living meme."
"How are your videos always so perfect? Makes me want to like them a hundred times each."
"I'm not gay but damn dude you are giving me a hard time"
"also... what the hell does the Jews have to do with multiculturalism, feminism, or 'Cultural Marxism'. All three of those things are DIRECTLY counter to Orthodox Judaism. I hate to break this to you man, but your flow chart is where you begin the descent into the idiotic rambling you cite from the other you-tubers to prop up your, yes you did get this part right, strawman argument."

"I've been binge-watching your videos (thanks to the rec in Current Affarirs) and just loving the shit out of them. Thank you so much. Seriously. And I have to say, did not expect to see a totally on-point understanding of anti-semitism and how it differs from other kind of racism in a video about 'alpha males.' Thank you for that too. Would love it if you could do a whole video on anti-semitism, especially given many of the comments below..."
"I watched the whole video and you never once tucked your penis between your thighs, I'm disappointed"
"Omg the countertenor music makes this video"
"I look like a beta male"
"Well now you'll have to be my mentor until I learn to think for myself."
"I do feel bad for the Golden One.He, unlike the others doesn't really seem like a horrible person as such, he looks like someone I would like to hug."
"Aquele velho argumento de qualquer país do mundo. Espero que não entendam."
"Not rhetorical: what was racist about RPP saying blacks should be over-represented in police homocides? Shouldn't we be measuring it relative to the number of violent criminals, not the race's population as a whole? I gather that the left-wing position is that structural racism is causing blacks to commit more than 50% of homocides, but while we're fixing that shouldn't we expect about 50% of police shootings to be on black people? White victims of police homocide are higher than blacks, why do we never hear about them on the news?  I don't really buy the conclusions people normally reach by going down this line, looking for a robust response. I have no tribe loyalty, I vote Conservative but I'm also total leftie on the environment, gay rights, etc, and I'd never heard of Red Pill Philosophy until now"
"I've seen some of Golden One's videos and he's definitely the most likable of all these so-called alpha types and neo-nazis.  Golden One actually lives up to the image he's promoting, unlike the others who appear like desperate losers. He's an exception in that sense.  He is comfortable enough with himself to do the funny stuffed animal bits.  He seems to have a personality that is probably quite high on the scale relative to peers around the same economic level.  He has a very attractive girlfriend and he doesn't come across as sexually frustrated or angry at women. He openly admits to not having good advice for how to attract women other than to become an 'ideal' male then women will be interested in you naturally. He advocates genuine self discipline and avoiding behaviors such as drunkenness.  I want to like him and respect him, but holy hell his political opinions (i.e. nazism) are incredibly dangerous and delusional."
"You are too intelegent to poke at low hanging fruint like the Golden One. You are capable of much more."

"The Golden One is a nasty piece of work, but damn, I can't get over the fact that he flexes and makes his nipples dance at the start of his videos, and he does it without a shred of irony. :-D"

"I like your books."
"11:58"
"I don't think I've ever fallen in love with anyone as quickly as I have with you"
"Also the whole alpha beta thing is dumb. You might be a 'beta' in one pack and an 'Alpha' in a different pack.   For example a guy without muscles will be considered a 'beta' in a body building 'pack' but can't be an 'alpha' in a different social setting he is more comfortable in. Just like a body builder would probably be the 'beta' in a computer science 'pack'.  People thrive in different social settings."
"Why do most body building mean seem so intellectually disabled?"
"4:50 LOL"
"I can rebuild a carburetor, build a log cabin, survive an apocalypse, mark an 8' spread with a 30 round stanag at 40 meters with an assault rifle in 45 seconds, grill a steak, be a positive role model to young boys and walk down a street in a bad (nonwhite; GASP!) neighborhood without worrying about being mugged, but I'm also a liberal SJW so I guess I'm just beta as hell."
"The thing is, even if being an alpha male was really a thing, then I'm pretty sure no alpha males would be making youtube videos about how alpha they are"
"I'm dying to know what is the song at about 2:50. Could anyone tell me?"

"They’re all gay."
"That Golden guy is the biggest queen ever, in a sort of Opposite World kind of way."
"All the men around here are beta soy-boy cucks, i.e not masculine enough, yet weirdly we're not the ones with a blogging ecosystem build around dick pills and boner creams to amp up our masculinity. You'd think we'd be the ones who need it most."
"Fascists are just goofy overall going on about bullshit like degeneracy, fat people, how jews invented drugs and porn to control our minds, fuck you, i don't need you fash fags telling me or anyone what to do with our lives, life is short as shit to be spend obeying commands on every aspect of your life. That's the thing that's infuriating with leftists throwing the word around at us conservatives randomly, you guys don't know real nazis, we do! We've been fighting their goofy ass for ages now, the alt-right fucking hates our guts probably more than they hate you XD"
"So in other words, to become alpha you just need roids. Alpharoids"
"Golden Twink> Golden One"
"my hero"
"Just a question I’m a young guy who almost got sucked into the alt right because of my resentment of not being successful with women, but after I joined the army I worked closely with black and Hispanic people and actually learned they were people like me just “ different”. But I still suck with women any advice?"
"I think so much of intolerance basically boils down to fear and lack of self love. When you truly accept and love yourself, it becomes a lot easier to love and accept others, however different or not they may seem from self."

"Bruh, the only thing that's fucking massive are those titties. Other than that, bomb ass video."

"6:00 that look. fucking priceless 😆"

"His tiny head perched atop his overgrown body makes me laugh."
"YOU'RE AWSOME!"
"But none except the swede claimed to be 'Alpha', no? And He used it in 'his own view of the word'. Oh well."
"toxic masculinity is a term used by lefties not by these guys. Get your act together"
"'None of these guys are especially high on the social hierarchy' You are stupid. I f only you knew how many wealthy men share their views you would be dumbfounded. They dare not speak though for fear of ostracism or heavy criticism. Another reason they are not is because society is so degenerate it seeks degenerates to run it."
"SURPRISE COMMENT  yeap, had been a long time since I performed a glorious surprise comment on youtube..."
"When Men are alone under each other... everyone feels where his place is...real Alpha men have a certain 'respect aura' and Charisma at them....and one dont needs a brawl to decide that... everyone somehow feels where he is ranked.... BUT bring 1 Girl into that Guy group and suddenly everyone wants to be the Alpha and it can lead to fist fights and wrestling and such stuff .... in that Regard we are not much different than Animals in their breeding Time. And every Guy here will know what i mean....  when you meet a Guy who is more 'Alpha' then you...you feel it...he does not need to fight you or so.... and opposite you of course also feel when someone is 10 ranks lower then you. I wonder of Girls have such a 'unspoken law of rank' under them too... and what decides it ? Beaty ?"
"show me your bobs"
"Funny things most guys we talk about alphas and betas are bettas themselves.  Theres Exceptions of course but  the majority are disenfranchise guys."

"I'm the Alpha of Omegas"

"God is not fair. You are smart, funny, sexy, pretty, handsome and muscular at the same time... He took everything from us and gave them to you I suppose."
"Damn it, TGO's a little nuts but it might be kinda charming if he wasn't a fascist."

"I can smell Betas in the comment section sniff sniff."
"Clean your bathroom hahah"
"This Golden One is like if a Frank Frazetta  painting came to life."
"I'M READY TO DIE FOR MOTHER EUROPA"
"Your videos are fantastic"
"All these alpha males seem to have realised that women tend to be attracted to muscular and confident men, but took this to a ridiculous extreme while failing to realise the even more important reality that we don't want to date misogynistic assholes who feel entitled to our bodies. It's really ironic, and kind of sad."
"Oh come on, roo is fine"
"You raise good points. Although i think the 'alpha males' you chose in this video are in fact not alpha males. They seem to be racist and anti-feminist which tend to be beta traits(anti-3rd wave can be argued for not being beta but that's for another discussion). I think there's two major flaws in this narrative. What an alpha male truly is, and why the 'alpha males' in this video exist.              The terms alpha and beta like you said derived from a study of wolves that was discredited. That being said if you look at our closest relatives in nature the gorilla and chimpanzee you see this hierarchy of alpha, beta, omega, sigma so on and so forth. Alpha male is a term that is used as a tool to describe social dynamics. Women can be alpha as well. Typical traits of alpha men are that they have good posture, are well spoken, natural leaders, they're dominant in social situations and tend to be moral people who are defensive of the people they care about. There are so many other traits that make a person alpha. The modern definition is skewed to be the pick up artist type.               Hence leading to why the 'alphas' you chose in this video exist. Cis-gender straight millennial white men feel very hated on by society. Being told they have privilege and that they support rape culture. All the while being told that 'toxic masculinity' has devastated western society. I agree all these things have merit, but strictly by a case by case basis  not as a general rule that would be preposterous. So it brings us to the mentalities of these 'alpha males'.  They see beta males as weak, nice guys. While alphas, like the ones in this video are the god men that get all the ladies. They 'reject' what feminism suggests men should behave like. They lean to heavily into hyper masculinity so instead of becoming the alphas they purport to be they are in fact beta.        I could talk about this further due to this being a multifaceted conversation. Maybe I raised a few points you had not considered. I'm open for a discussion on the topic.     Btw I'm a big fan of your visual style in video making it's enchanting."
"What ARE you?"
"'alpha' in essence is a sales pitch. I was here for the jokes and all I got was a bunch of swatiskas :/"
"Oh dear God how did I survive this video... well if I die laughing I'm okay with it... oh ContraPoints I'm going to miss the male version of you... in this video you are the beautiful god Apollo complete with stinging intellect <3"

"Funny and informative! GJ!"
"7:42 I've argued with that guy! That's Warcorpse666. (Classy name, right?)  The dude was, like, someone attempting to be the biggest collection of dumbass white man stereotypes. I walked away from an YouTube video argument with him when he made a 27 minute video that opened with a 5 minute diatribe explaining how he wasn't a redneck (I never said he was, he just didn't know the difference between redneck and white trash) by saying he thinks heroin should be legal.  lol"
"no such thing. the guy who came up with alpha wolves later found out wolf packs don't have ranks, just families. But people clinged to the idea and ran with it because humans crave a hierarchy.  Which is kind of shitty because we're at a point in our development that we don't need one. But hey, people are dumbasses."

Maybe if you go to a library you would find out what an Alpha male is. Unlike just googling (Lazy way to research) and seeing what Google says it is. There are Alpha male in a lion's pride.  Explain how that to me, oh wise bata male. J/K"
"As a swede, I was confused for the longest time as to what 'lake Malaren' was. Then I realized that it was of course lake Mälaren. Yes, those little dots change the pronunciation enough that I didn't immediately figure out what was being referred to."

"Honestly thought the muscle bound guy was playing a joke for satire for like five minutes.   Fucking. Wow."
"i'm pretty sure if i met The Golden One in person and didn't know his political views he'd instantly become my new best friend until the inevitable awkward conversation that comes about when he finally says something really fucked up and I'm like 'no, i don't think the orcs we just slaughtered were feminist jews, I'm not gonna take you larping with me if you keep making it weird.'"

"'So, what 'Alpha' looks like to me is a pseudo-scientific term used by guys who don't have a lot going for them to inflate their wounded masculinity.'  Holy shit, this was great"
"Viewing this video again one extra point strikes me that I hadn't seen before.  I have no problem with The Golden One using 'The Lord of the Rings' to make a point, literature has served philosophy since Plato's time, but The Golden One's example of an Alpha male appears to be Ugluk.  Not Gandalf with his self -emptying love, not Aragorn with his patient endurance serving a 75 year long apprenticeship as he waits to fulfil his destiny, not even Frodo and Sam with their heroic self sacrifice.  No; it's the leader of the band of Orcs who abduct Merry and Pippin and rampage through, Rohan hoping to carry their victims to a hideous fate in Isengard.  Tolkien was writing about his own time and he knew full well about what brutalised men armed to the teeth and led by thugs and demagogues get up to.  We have been warned."

"Fucking spectacular channel. Making my way through all your videos"
"You missed out on a golden opportunity(pun intended) to clear up what a beta actually is and how most alt-righters are actually betas.  You see, betas are actually not on the bottom of the social hierarchy like people seem to think gauging by it's use in common parlance. They are the 2nd in command who serves as the right hand of the alpha, usually. Sometimes the beta is strong and don't get along with the alpha male but is not strong enough to overthrow the pack leader and take control of the pack. They then leave the pack rather than submit to the alpha wolf and chose to roam alone as lone-wolves. This lone-wolf beta archetype fits very well with the alt-right men you see on the internet. They are strong willed enough to not fit in, but not strong or socially skilled enough to take control of the pack(mainstream groups) so they chose to be lone-wolves rather than submit to the pack."
"'Teddy says that in order to truly understand the nature of women we must first retake Constantinople from the Ottoman Empire' I laughed for a about a minute after hearing this. By the end I couldn't barely breathe. Then there was drool and tears of joy on my desk. Then I would giggle spasmodically for an unspecified amount of time. I'm convinced now that it's the Golden One's plan to make all degenerate lefties suffocate to death from his whatthefuckery. I mean this apophthegm is a weapon. It must be a fragment from Monty Python's Ernest Scribbler's Funniest Joke in the World"
"Of note is Alpha M on youtube who actually has useful style and workout advice, is generally pleasant and avoids misogyny. He's not really part of the whole other 'alpha' group mentioned here."

"is i be alpha? just throwing a litle joke your way to lighten your day a small amount. excuse me, amoont."
"You can’t link racism and feminism you dumb ass!! You have taken a bit of what these alphas are saying and twisted it. If you actually hear them out completely you will maybe get your pathetic brain around it. Facts before feelings...people these days man...this marks the end"

"He looks like a Brad Pitt with downs"
"demonizing masculinity is just as bad as demonizing femininity. we are sexually dimorphic, so what's the problem? he's a sperg, but masculinity isn't 'toxic', it's natural. allah gave us these bodies and it is a disgusting perversion to alter yourself chemically and/or present as the opposite sex. it surprises me that this is somehow controversial."
"Every time I see the Golden One, I think 'fuck, maybe I am a lesbian'"
"he looks like the human embodiment of an erect penis what the fuck"
"also he doesnt talk to his teddy correctly. u need to but your cuddletoys to your ear. common knowledge. fing plep"

"For reference, Everchosen is a term ascribed to Archaon, the main villain of Warhammer Fantasy: End Times, who leads a massive horde of demons, hellions, and barbarians from the northeast to overrun and destroy a Modern (1500-1815, not to be confused with Contemporary) European-like continent. The Golden One often makes references to Warhammer, and accuses ContraPoints of being a demoness of Slaanesh."

"Being a white nationalist doesn't necessarily mean you're a fascist. White nationalism is about taking pride and loving your ethnicity, race, people, culture, history, nation, etc. Fascism is a system of totalitarian nationalism where opposition is censored and all property is state owned."

"Here is a proud omega comment <3"
"A GF I had many years ago had gay roommates; they had some old gay skin mags from the 70's. In one of these mags was an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger. In this interview, the reporter asked Arnold what he thought about the fact that the majority of the audience at bodybuilding contests were gay men.  Arno;d replied, 'I don't care who they are, so long as they buy a ticket'. The golden one could learn a lot from Arnold.   He's probably cis hetero but you are totally spot on pointing out the homoerotic nature of his life style. I appreciated the praising of all things male from the gay community myself. Mainstream society likes to male bash. As for the whole racial purity thing it is a part of the hetero male drive. It isnt all bad, but needs to be directed positively. it is a natural thing, nature cannot be subverted but it can be cultivated and directed."
"my friend loves you, and they sent me here! you're an angel, thank you for this!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Well, I am an alpha male but I'm not a racist or chauvinist. I'm just a thought zombie in the sense that I consume knowledge 24/7."
"Alpha is a situational motif.  Hero."
"I wonder if the Golden One shaves His chest?"
"Damn can the golden one raw me please"
"I tried to take a drink every time you said 'alpha', but Im 11 minutes in and out of booze. oops."
"great video  😍😍😍😍🤗"
"I find it strange that someone like the golden one (who seems to be transported from the dark ages) would be a fan of hitler,as well as the obvious reasons why no one should like hitler that we all know - he was a sickly beta man with a long list of health problems (as documented in a channel four documentary for anyone interested)  as for contrapoints maybe instead of watching videos made by the golden ones that he just watches old he man  cartoons instead they are less ridiculous"
"*Gay propaganda intensifies*  Real life Johnny Bravo: 'Whoa Mama!'"
"Holy fuck, Johnny Bravo is real!"
"5:42 DONALD IS THAT YOU?"
"TGO is not in any way racist, if you think that you need to rewatch his videos. He's an ethnonationalist, yes, this means that he thinks european countries should be european, african countries african etc. Thinking this is racist is disingenious, he doesn't think any race is superior to any other nor does he disrespect or treat anyone badly becouse of their race. He has a large nonwhite following, which you, again, would know if you actually watched his videos and read some comments. The theory that jews supposedly are destroying europe is based on a couple of things: George Soros and CO (they have alot of influence over the EU), the open society foundation (by soros) and the fact that a large majority of prominent communist figures were of jewish decent (Marx, Engels, Rosa Luxembourg, Lenin, the list goes on). And a large number of jews are advocating for mass immigration to Europe, there are even videos of jews saying europeans will be outbred and disappear. The protocols of the elders of Zion also helps fuel this, and while disputed by many official scholars, it's unsettling how right it is on many points. Couple this with the fact that Poland (with lots of jews) magically got ignored by the beubonic plague, the fact that jews own a disproportionate amount of media compared to their low population and it's not as unreasonable as you'd think.  The golden one is not a fascist by the way, he believes in the democratic process and actually argues with his fans regularly on why he does this. He is, however, a firm nationalist and believes feminism has been bad for the west as a whole.  He is actually very self-aware and understands how ludicrus his ''surprise flexing'' is, but it doesn't matter becouse his personality is entertaining and he can pull it off becouse he's fvcking jvceey. He does not blindly praise Hitler either (as you disingeniously put fourth) and he thinks world war two was a wasteful brotherwar and should have been avoided. This video did not feel very genuine and you even contradicted yourself by showing the clip where he explains his usage of the word alpha then saying that he is not high up in a social status, which he recognised was the real term and proper usage for the word."
"After a dozen videos I think this is actually the one that made me a fan."
"This is my favorite ContraPoints video. I've rewatched it so many times. It's just too good."
"My male friends (I'm a woman in Germany, yeah that country) refer to themselves and others as alpha when they refer to the petty side of their ego, that likes getting attention and feels jealous. For example 'He actually might be a nice guy, I probably just don't like him, because when we see each other both of our alphas come out and want to be on top' They don't use the word often, they don't think of others as beta, they are lovely people and I wish, oh how I wish this was the only time I heard that word."
"I want to make fun of him so hard but my vagina says the otherwise😩💦💦"
"Ok weird question but what was that music that played while you were pouring the milk on your face? Great video btw"
"Your videos are so well put together and clever... SUCH a gem to watch, love your work!"
"What's wrong with Alpha? She and Kokone make such a cute couple!"
"The virgin Golden One vs the Chad Contrapoints."
"Unlike what others say, you don't sound like a mainstream SJW at all. I lean slightly right but do enjoy your content (along with some disagreements of course). And BTW, you did sound like an alpha here. You aren't afraid to confront the other side and are consistent with your views."
"HIT THAT GYM"
"You are a God/dess"
"As always love the video, only recently found your channel. Keep it up."
"Which Greek letter represents someone who doesn't give a shit whether or not they're sufficiently or insufficiently 'masculine', and doesn't base their behaviors and thought processes on what they think will make women like them? Would that be an Iota? Omikron?"
"That guy is not an alpha he's a fullblown beta 😂🤧 Being an alpha is just being confident, kind to others, help others in need, just being a good human being Ppl like him are douchebags with obvious self esteem issurs"
"Hahahaha! ContraPoints, you can do no wrong! Aluta continua!"
"Me like bishies!! (Drools)"
"There's nothing wrong with being comfortable in your masculinity and being a confident man, but the alpha/beta crowd and even the r/k theory crowd are just projecting their own insecurities. I'm actually subscribed to the golden one and admire him to some extent, but his self worship gets pretty cringey."
"Lower biceps are inadequate on gold boy. So Hes the true beta."
"Okay so I just found this channel and OMG this is wonderful and you are wonderful"
"Surprise Flex!!!! I fucking lost it"

"WHOS THIS QUEER"
"OMG That guy is real!?!?!?!"
"Why is a Swedish fascist displaying the fleur de lis on his chest?"
"I ship Contrapoints and the Golden One."
"only those are true alphas who cultivate land, build a homestead, create space for others, are kind understanding and loving partners, no aggression but ready to defend themselves and their loved ones when being attacked. live and let live. a bit of muscle mass does no harm... like your work!"
"Well... I don't care about teddy, but Constantinople has to be taken back ^^"
"'Beta' guys and 'Alpha' guys are both really insecure, just one is better about lying to themselves about it. And no one who labels themselves as alpha actually gets a lot of women."
"Did anyone else have the biggest gasping-laughing fit when you heard “the only way to understand the nature of women is by taking back Constantinople” 😂😂😂"
"The most bothersome point of this video was when you called obama alpha."
"Cuck"
"Mendelsohn!!!!!!!!"

"You silly, there is no other way than genocide to clean up the mess which happened in Europe later. :)"

"AIU, Racist? Do you smoke crack? Why would you randomly call someone racist. That's slander, you know."
"PLEASE what's the song at around 3:00 as Contra is pouring milk on her face? Thank you."
"If the Golden one isn't a screaming closet case then my name is Stacey."
"Taking multiple clips out of context and taking sarcasm literally, what a hard hitting piece this was. Who would've thought you can strawman your way through an entire 15 minute cringey and unfunny 'critique'. And who would've thought the genderfucked gag queen would loathe the idea of an Alpha male, let alone any value placed on masculinity."
"AiU is not racist. He's left and he voted for Ovama and Hillary. Get your facts straight shiggy diggyvdoo"
"The reason why the left is losing ground so rapidly is quite simple. Take one look at The Golden One, and then one look at - whatever the fuck the other thing is, and the direction of a functioning society is a pretty clear choice."
"alphas are completely useless. theyre loved and sheltered. once theyre support and reward system disappears, they crumble. give me a kid who was bullied and called fag every day, and each time, rose up to the fight. doesnt matter if he won or lost, he never backed down. alphas back down after the first taste of defeat."
"Sargon of Akkad is alpha! ;) A true alpha would never claim he is alpha; things just seem to naturally revolve around Sargon."
"entertaining .. thanx 4 some laughs i went through! i have a question, i  mean its easy to take wankers (such as the viking) apart, but here the question: have u seen this vid of black pigeon 'why women destroy nations' ? that would be an interesting and i guess seriously more challenging object to play with !"
"Wow, that golden one or whatever he calls himself has to be one of the weirdest people ever."
"I can't decide if I want the muscley one or the skinny muscley one."
"It took me five minutes to realise that he wasn’t just contra’s friend helping to clown on douchebags(i didn’t realise until contra actually said so)"
"Has anyone suggested your style as 'Schizo Socratic Method'?"
"Bless this wonderful vid and channel."
"There's nothing more homoerotic than sexist masculinity cults. Just look at your average salafist preacher, he's 'understanding', 'close to young people', goes out with young men often. It's just a matter of time and context when the sex tunes in."
"Contraaaaaaa ;_; you presented this so well but I cannot seem to shake this feeling that it was somehow painful for you D: my empathy is haywire right now because even though you showed excellent form and showpersonship in your performance, somehow I still feel like I just watched a video of someone slowly and inexorably jamming a hand-sized shard of broken glass entirely *through* their arm, right between the ulna and radius. I realize that I'm the person feeling this and not you, and accept with humility and a measure of shame that I'm saying this more for me than for you, but...  Are you okay??? Please tell me you're okay...  (This skin crawling, stomach knotting, soul-clawing eclipse of bleakness... Is this dysphoria...?)  Edit: oh Celestia dammit I just saw that this video was from last year >_(\ nevermind..."

"Amazing video!!! Keep up the good work!!!"
"I hate how so many of these fashy types drone on and on about old Norse sagas. You don't have to be a racist punk to like these stories."

"But isn't it significantly more manly to only do other incredibly manly men? You're showing that you're powerful enough to force them to do things with you, whist also proving that you don't need women to begin with.  I'm just sayin!"

"Why the hell is a swedish guy with the mjönir-necklace telling me i can't be drunk,  he's a shitty viking man, i mean close to if not every story in the edda starts with or involves getting drunk."
"I will point out that while the held different ideologies, the mindsets of Elliot Rogers and Hitler are not as dissimilar as they may seem. The persecution complex is massively over the top in key ways."
"they are mixing alpha traits with masculine traits and giving their personal views. they are idiots. alpha just means leader or to take charge. it has nothing to do with masculine or feminine traits. really the whole 'alpha male' comunity are only stereo typing the term alpha male and only refering to it in the sense of the hetosexual dating game and there go forget that said males are capable of losing alpha status when there may be change of environment or over time."
"do a video on David Irving , Ernst Zundel, and David Cole"

"Please tell me that's Wagner at 2:55"
"If anything... It's safe to say those so-called alphas are nothing but beta cucks themselves. The true alphas are the capitalist elite who they also hate...  They aren't breaking any mold. They are just further cogs in the capitalist machine."
"More liquids over face plz"
"Anyone notice The Golden One's face is actually, not proportionally accurate?"
"seems just like primal psychology reinforced by hundreds of thousands of years of there being a dominance hierarchy in the sexual marketplace. not justifying, just talking strictly  anthropologically in terms of mate desirability and selection going back to our origins as primates. of course, like zuckerberg or buffet, the parameters have changed somewhat as humans and the civilizations they've constructed have evolved. it's totally believable to me that primal psychology is difficult to completely eradicate given the relative newness of our civilization or modern concepts of anarchy. not saying 'give it time', just kind've trying to touch on the darwinian aspect that i think the 'alpha male' concept inherently draws upon. i think those kind of primitive impulses can be overcome on a social level, but it ultimately brings me to the question of whether human beings are capable of advancing their societies or if they're doomed to cyclical history. https://www.bitchute.com/video/6yR3LTfcas63/ https://soundcloud.com/666satx/visions-of-color-audiozine-ep7-the-cutting-edge-of-liberation  edit: in terms of desirability and mate selection, in the context of our society, i would say that CP is pretty high on on my list 😉"

"Not all anti feminists are pro tradition. Some of us are MRAs and think traditionalism is cancer. Also I'm Brown so there's that."
"Asataru has people getting wasted ritualistically and has since ancient times."
"I've watch a couple of your videos and the straw man type criticisms seem to be a reoccurring theme along with the Golden One... Why don't you just debate or have a discussion with him yourself? It seems to be a theme with you, criticisms of people while refusing to actually engage with them."
"Hehe. The jealousy is palpable :)"

"uncucked alpha hero. that shit killed me"
"I will give you this.  You articulate leftist thinking very well.  I also like how you cut throught the crap and get to the point.  As a fascist I appreciate you're content.  I think to benefit you're research on fascism you should check out the website Ironmarch.org.  They have some very informative content on the fascist worldview."
"Funny video many laughs, I have also found that guy to be cringe as fuck, he must have an IQ of well under 100 if not under 90?  Well, enough said about that. I am myself a racist. Probably fascist too, or at least so I have been told. Perhaps I am Alt-Right or maybe I am just all right. Hope I have not too much in common with this nutty guy. Anyways, I watch your videos but seldom agree with any points of actual substance, but I watch on as it is good to have your views mocked to get some perspective. I must thank you for all the times you have taken the piss out of me and what I believe in. That I do like.  I hope I am not guilty or rather nutty by association such as all the examples you shown in the video.  You have a very crude understanding of the alt right world view, mostly you get kind of there but get lost on some of the finer details. Overall pretty good try at least. Maybe it can with some accuracy describe at least a lot of people in the alt right circles but not in any stretch all and especially not those with some finer knowledge and sophistication. I am half way on agreeing on your try to explain the alt right world view and you are not really getting the very extended use of metaphors in the alt right circles. Not so strange though, few are and it is still difficult to follow even for me sometimes. I had a really difficult time too before I gradually started to understand the way the people in the alt right sphere uses language. The language has developed from lots of oppression,  censorship, taboos and need for code and secrecy because of it. The only ones you actually can see at this stage of your understanding is the ones with the 'I do not give a fuck' attitude and as you can guess they are kinda 'special' if you know what I mean. Their crude understanding and world view mixed with their bombastic but flawed personalities is what you can see and understand as being 'alt right'  Kind of like an unintended straw man."
"Excellent video. The thing that has always baffled me about these guys is that they shit-talk women and then expect women to fall into their arms. You tell me I suck and then get mad when I DON'T want to sleep with you?   I don't think a guy who disrespects me as 'alpha'  or 'dominant'. I think of him as an entitled asshole."
"I AM A WHITE NATIONALIST AND CAME TO HATE WATCH BUT THIS IS QUITE AMUSING"
"Clean yer goddamn grout."
"Right now  your reaction to the 'suprise flex' is my favorite thing in the world."
"His face confuses me"
"Oooh all the maitence that's why I couldn't go trans I'm bi but very hairy and the fiddly stuff set my teeth on edge I like camo makeup or wrestling makeup (Great Muta is the greatest), this alpha stuff is such twaddle and really really gay as alpha males appear only in captivity and usually execute dominance through rape. I look upon the Golden One sort of like Frankenfuter looks on Rocky, but he's such a male bimbo I find him as threatening as Carl Benjamin a quick kick in the slacks they all go down."
"....in order to truly understand the nature of women we must first retake Constantinople!"

"You certainly aren't beta."
"I've got boxes full of Pepe Silvia!"
"Great vid.   If those are 8 ft ceilings, you're taller than 6'2'. It's time to re-measure."
"First, I'm sorry this comment comes a bit late, but, who knows, maybe you can return to this theme when Thor: Ragnarok is released :D.  I must say what touched me more about this video is how started seeing the Golden One as a fucking idiot whereas your compassion made me feel a little...sad and compassionate about him, too. And that's quite touching and valuable."
"Hhhm I agree about the lonely and desperate part but I'm not so sure 'toxic masculinity' is to blame. What does that even mean? Masculinity is masculinity. You can call it toxic if you want but it is what it is. Anyway I don't think society teaches men to ignore their emotions or defer to agression, I think society ignores men altogether. If you want to be masculine in today's culture you pretty much have to figure that shit out for yourself. There isn't a very clear definition of what it is to be a white male anymore. That's why you have some going full fight club and some putting on dresses and lipstick. Men need something to put their efforts behind. We are vessels for novelty and change. Stagnating in this post-capitalist, sanitized hellhole is destroying our souls and it's pretty obvious. It's really no surprise that fascism is appealing to young modern males. You know your culture is fucked up when fascism seems like the only sane alternative."
"Ahaha these guys are so lame and insecure. They don't seem to get laid often and that's evil women's fault and has nothing to do with the fact that these guys are creepy douchebags."
"I have a penis, therefore I'm an alpha male"
"Ah ha! Slaughter by Passion Hifi- nice!"
"Another great video of yours- nice one. Just wondering what that awesome music during the 'white nationalist worldview' part is?"
"I think part (possibly all) of the reason anti-feminism/misogyny is correlated with racism among white men has to do with the psychology of domination. Feminism is egalitarian, and these people glorify hierarchies and domination. They are hyper-masculine and associate their masculinity and dominance with white dominance since they also have identities as white people."

"I replay the surprize flex part all the time and cry-laugh. The editing is just so good, with the grunt continuing into the reaction shot. It's high comedy. It's hilarious."
"Hey Contra! I've watched some of your debates and I love the way you express yourself. This is the first video I watch of your channel and I loved it! Your style is unique and cool ;)"
"hahah bom demais!"
"Wow, never knew Swedish cartoonists were this deeply untalanted- What do you mean he's a real alive human person?!"
"'leaving comments is positively Omega.' amazing. subscribed."
"I shouted a laughter at the part he  mentioned constantino. It's double hilarious if you are Turk."
"Alpha males=racist. Your so objective and smart!"
"As the first video I've ever seen from Contra (former anti sjw we all make horrible mistakes) this is really good at tearing apart the bullshit expectation about how men should be and all that jazz. Also 2:14 is easily the most informative part of the video, a lot of rather big looking info there."
"'Calling yourself alpha is the symptom of adhering to nature based philosophy which is right wing.' - beats this entire video. I hoped to be enlightened on classical meaning of being masculine (which is not Greek conception used by Golden One). I couldn´t be more disappointed. Heil victory."
"When people use the terms alpha and beta all I can think is Aldous Huxleys Brave new world where they grow Alphas with normal brain capacities, betas with slightly reduced brain capacities for manual labour and ape-like gammas that work the most basics of tasks (like assembly lines and elevator operators - stuff nowadays robots do).  This view on society only considers intelligence as class barrier. And judging by these measurements all the idiots calling themselves alphas would be actually gammas."
"Northern Europeans are the people with most Asian eye folds among all whites because ancient nomads constantly visit their homes."

"Am I supposed to masturbate to this video?"
"Part of me really wants to listen to and laugh at the points and jokes you're making in this video. The other part wants to get double stuffed by you and the Golden One."
"Honestly the whole application of the concept of 'alpha-ness' to humans never really made sense to me, even given the supposed (and erroneous) belief in the role it played in wolf interactions. I mean, wolves aren't particularly closely related to humans, so wouldn't it make more sense to use the social interactions of other primates that are closely related as a basis for comparing and studying human social behavior? Chimpanzees, Bonobos, and other great apes - i.e. our closest biological relatives - all engage in social interactions and form societal groups that are far more complex than simple alpha/beta interactions, why would we assume that humans would be any different?"
"I love the golden twink"
"did mother nature stole his lips in exchange for alpha powers?"
"I love you!"
"When my mom saw a video of tGO, she though he was a troll, and that he was actually gay. I think he's legit, but who knows, maybe he is secretly gay, for some reason it wouldn't suprise me."
"Holy fuck, the golden one is the most insufferabe youtuber I have ever seen"
"Wait, Contra do you even lift ? 🤔"

"how to prepare an alpha bath:  1: clean your grout you heathen"
"There's nothing at all bad about being physically strong, confident, assertive or outgoing, whether you view these traits as 'masculine' or not.  But it seems like the 'alpha' mindset expressed by the kind of guys who make those videos is that you can ONLY feel powerful if you hold power over someone else; you can only feel strong if you make someone else feel weak; you can only feel confident and in control if you make someone else feel cowed and submissive.  'Alpha males' always appear to derive their own self-esteem at the expense of someone else's.  Honestly, it seems like an exhausting and dreadful way to live."
"can't believe mastrubatetin is degenerae. like seriously why tho? i jerk off 20 times a day in order to pleasure the benis."

"Why the dishonest framing and name calling?  I can only hope that people will go over to look at the channels of these people you mock, to see for themselves what is really going on.  I wish you all the best."
"This is basically one psychosis critiquing another. Interesting enough."
"fuck the alt right. fuck the patriarchy. fuck cis- heteronormativity . fuck reactionaries!!"
"It's interesting that the Golden One mentioned the Uruk-Hai from LotR, because I've decide that Alpha Male idiots and their relationship with toxic masculinity are a lot like Gollum and his relationship with the One Ring: he loves it and hates it in equal measure, loving it for what it promises him and hating it because it never delivers. The ring serves only one master, and it isn't him.   In the same way, these Alpha Male idiots chase the ideal of masculinity but can never achieve it because it is a manufactured ideal that only serves advertisers trying to sell you shit you don't need - diet pills, muscle milk, self-help books, fascist ideology, etc."
"wounded masculinity ^^ look who is talking"
"I can sum each up with three words.  Alpha= Strong, slow and silent  Beta = weak, fast and loud"
"you must think you're audience is stupid. Perhaps many of them are.  how long did you search to find the 'alfa male' that was also a white nationalist?"
"I upvoted this video, because watching two retards fight is entertaining."
"So many men afraid of being called betas, so they say such thing doesn't exist LOL"
"Don't go around calling people Betas. BUT DO GO AROUND CALLING PEOPLE NAZIS!"
"He's a Nazi? C'mon. The leftie loves to hate on ''racist stereotypes'' but love to Label people as ''Racists Neo Nazis'' who want to kill sixmillionpeople. I m yet to see any arguments."
"A Degenerate making fun of the Golden One? LOL. You just prove all his points."
"I know there's a lot of channels on masculinity and 'alpha', but I have to ask, did you completely ignore the channel 'AlphaMale'??"
"Donald Trump's existence handily refutes the notion that whole alpha-male thing is merely the domain of fringe losers. Hell, I'll-drone-you-if-you-hit-on-my-daughters Barack Obama has a bit of the alpha-male vibe too. Most of the folks who talk a lot about being alpha perhaps rank relatively low on the social hierarchy, but broadly alpha behavior appears among elite men. It's bad because it's oppressive, not because it's low-status."
"Some people on the left are anti-white anti-male and anti-freespeech.  BUT these people are even more dangerous .  I hope this trend calms down soon ."

"Your biggest fear. Normal cream of the crop males."
"do you think there arent any black alpha males"
"'and don't allow nationalism to gain traction in Europe' > Oh, I just love how you ate up that propaganda. Everyone can have their countries except Europeans, right? Not a double standard or anything. At least you're honest about spreading degeneracy."
"Wanna do some manly alpha things in a motel? SPOILER: It involves oil and you shouldn't be scared to touch a man unless you are like kappa or whatever I dunno"
"great vid dawg, loved the white nationalist chart. new sub"
"Wow. Kind of a stretch to put people that don't want their cities to be overrun by people majorily from countries with cultures almost incompatible with a free, democratic society and literal Nazis in the same basket.  Not everyone that is against uncontrolled immigration and the sexism of 3rd wave feminism is a white nationalist and wants to exterminate all non-whites in Europe."
"Not so bad."
"'And I don't mean 'Fascist' in the way that people throw around the term for anyone they disagree with.'  You mean, the way SJWs do? See, THIS is a perfect 'Cry Wolf' example. YOU are the one doing that. YOU are the one crying Nazi. And now that you've run into a legit Nazi, no one believes you.  Should've actually listened to those bedtime stories. They had really good morals."
"Hahaha! Holy fuck. Anti-feminist=racist. Yeah. Go home and take your ridiculous definition of fascism with you."
"I don't know most of these guys but I would like to know where the 'racism' accusations come from regarding the kangaroo guy."
"Love this video - spot on"
"1:08 -- This makes me nostalgic for the olden days when we could disregard all of the pseudointellectual BS and just call a guy like this what he is: a closet case.  However, not all of these 'alpha males' are strictly creatures of the internet or are socially negligible. One of them, Allen Frantzen, was a prominent Anglo-Saxonist at Loyola who, by being one of the major sources for peer review in that sub-field, may have damaged the academic careers of a number of women. Frantzen is also gay and early in his career did extensive work on homosexuality from the medieval to the present. It just goes to show that gay men need to justify being misogynistic shitheels as well."
"Those are some alpha abs though."
"ContraPoints is incredibly sexy. :U"
"I doubt the golden one subscribes to the ideology of national socialism . collectivism is for cucks . u have successfully glossed over that and misrepresent nationalism at once . I don't care for the alpha shit but its funny hearing Americans label nationalist as racists when its not your continent being overrun by the third world .   I'm gonna go out on a lime here and assert that your a racial  and cultural relativists who labels anyone who dare mention IQ disparity or cultural incompatibility as Nazi . that's kind of sad because you come across as a deep thinker but your reasoning is as shallow as a tea spoon . disappointing but none the less expected ."
"Nice video."
"Thanks contrapoints you made me laugh until i peed myself. Its the only release after wallowing in the worlds bullshit, laughter not peeing, that was only a dribble. Don't tell my alpha friends."
"Oh my god. I thought that was somebody you brought in for a parody... he is real!"
"This video is a beautiful example of the parallel paths open to young folk.  Do you want to look like a member of the squad in Predator, or wear a dress? Do you want to travel to Asia to practice Muay Thai, or learn how to apply makeup? Do you want your father to look at you with pride, or disgust? Do you want to pull hot babes, or suck dick? Do you want to win a heavyweight championship, or one of those drag queen karaoke nights?  Its a big world and a short life, youngsters. Choose wisely."
"I got the biggest boner when you listed 'invading Russia' as your #1 no-no of the past 1000 years."
"so you are saying men should stop saying they are alpha, just make lots of money and get power."
"This video is absolutely alpha XD"
"so is fascism the way to gains, have i been doing this whole exercising thing wrong?"
"'Why do so many guys calling themselves alpha also turn out to be crazy  racists?' Because being a crazy racist and assuming humans have the same  social structure as pack predators both involve accepting pseudoscience  and adopting lazy assumptions that actual scientists scoff at."
"I hate this fucking brainless piece of meat and I'm ashamed to have been born in the same country as him. He's a disgrace to the Swedish people. I'm surprised he can do anything more than bang sticks together. Mindless fucking idiot."

"AIU doesn't belong lumped in with those other guys."
"LOL  This channel is criminally underrated."
"If I had to guess, the White Nationaliss you're talking about also exhibit the third pillar of white supremacy: Orientalism. Prediction: A lot of these 'alpha males' use 'yellow people are smart' stereotypes to claim they're not racist."
"I died at the teddy bear part, totally thought it was a joke holy fucking shit"

"dang ur too sexy im gonna have to watch this later when im less horny with all this no shirt and gold hot pants action woof hello nurse.."
"The golden one looks like he was a burn victim then got crappy facial reconstruction surgery."
"You're like an attorney defending a guilty client ... you're arguments are intelligent and sugar coated, but they're not necessarily correct. Males aren't divided into alpha and beta - those terms represent opposite ends of a spectrum. And, it is self evident that anyone who calls themselves an alpha male is likely to be crazy."
"lmao that guy"
"Have you been working out since this video?  You look buffer. More alpha, might I say."
"I low key love that guy. If you get past his odd personality he actually has some interesting points and is very educational"
"contra always contradicts himself - he's fucking annoying tbh"
"Your videos are spectacular. You're witty, charming, sharp and talented but I'm sure you've heard all of that before . Do keep it up."
"you're a dipshit"
"sometimes i think he just doesnt know what he saying. cause of how he uses some words. :P"
"ripped like jesus"
"I love how you just straight up rip on Marcus.   Man, your channel is good for a man who loves trolling.   Liberal leaning degenerate trolls who think the alt-right are cucks, this is perfect.  GREETINGS."
"Y'all who go after white privilege completely ignore Jewish privilege. Look at the income statistics will ya?"
"ContraPoints, you are a degenerate and a representative of everything that is wrong with the world."
"I find it really cruel that people keep calling you 'Beta'. It's obvious that you are VHS! F'ing idiots..."
"currently watchinh the golden one's videos on mute .... fck im part of the problem"
"oh my. 0_0 he's super cute ... x( why is he ... so ugh"
"You're amazing:)"
"This is bizzare"
"You gotta admit though, the golden one is a moron, loved by right-wing women everywhere.  Looking forward to your next video on women of the alt-right."
"It's hilarious how both ContraPoints and the Golden One are extreme polar opposites of one another! :D  One is some big dumb giant the other is a fairy princess! xD"
"If someone tries to classify men into 'alpha' and 'beta', that's a pretty clear sign they sure as hell aren't an 'alpha'."
"Still don't get why people are becoming so anti-Jew. I mean like REALLY, EXTREMELY racist towards the Jews."
"You're very attractive"
"The golden one would be such a cool dude if it wasn't for his political views, and well, most of his personality tbh. Really I just like him cause he's into nerdy shit like skyrim and fantasy books and he has a really good body."
"To quote a phrase. We're all gonna die. Ya better be fuckin ripped to deflect a God damn knife."
"Stop dragging me down with your Jewish-Bolshevik cuckness! I'm alpha! Hear me whine... I mean roar!"
"I love you!"
"The Golden One has women's boobs."
"I am so glad I have finally found a channel which isn't a moronic far right hate mongering garbage shoot for angry white men. Thank you for giving me some hope that genuinely funny and intelligent people still exist."
"You want to be a tough manly badass?  Be like Theodore Roosevelt. Fight against corruption, defend women's rights, and protect minorities' rights. Not afraid to show emotion, not afraid to get in a fight when need be, but still able to defend his believes."
"This was a great video."
"I love his surprise flex"
"YOU DARE BLASPHEM AGAINST GLORIOUS VALOR!! YOU DEGENERATE PORN WATCHING BAG OF WEAK BONES! .. and u miss represented all his vids with editing, his video on hitler was about the nature of money in war and in no way does he glorify hitler."
"omg he has a little frog plushie in the bg.."
"I've been binge watching your vids for the last 12 hours out-of-order and with many breaks (because I'm not *that* manic). I'm absolutely loving your content, so I'm thrilled I found you from the Blaire White debate. I turned Ad-Block off over a week ago to test how often I see ads now that YouTube has been doling out ad revenue in war rations. This is the first video I've seen an ad on out of the 20+ videos of yours I have watched. Heartbreaking.... I'm glad you have a successful Patreon!   BTW: the only content creators I've seen ads on have been I Hate Everything (who apparently hates making videos bc he hasn't made one in months), all the popular industry channels I sub for hair education, and that scumbag Daddyofive. Do5 was making money from abusing his kids daily but creators who actually have something intelligent to bring to their channels are getting the shaft. I'd protest if I weren't such a mainline YT junkie."
"'beta' males are so sexy and woke <3"
"I stopped the video when you started putting make up on your face. I disagree with a lot of the golden one's political views but there is one thing i can agree with and it's the fact  that i despise beta leftists."
"I've never met a legit alpha-trans person, nor have I ever seen one that passes as such on any social media. The btq communities seem to only embrace stereotypically gendered feminine, or 'softer' omega-ish traits, like Nina Arsenault does, for example.  It's curious, especially when we're supposed to accept all gender expressions, including male traits in queer bio-girls. I'd suspect that a hardcore, authentic F2M alpha dude would not be welcomed in the sjw trans club. Is it because he wouldn't fit the 3rd wave ideal of a society of passive 'boys'? What gives? Can anyone point some out on youtube? I'd love to talk hunting and football with a cool trans-alpha boy. I'm not interested in wigs and other such girlie things."
"This dudes bathroom is dirty as fuck!!!🤢🤢"
"WTF"
"Just today the thought crossed my mind: 'I wonder what ever happened to Nykytyne2.' I'm pleased with the answer. Congrats on the great new channel."

"1:00 holy crap so many good books"
"To the best of my knowledge I have never commented on a YouTube video before, but I wanted to let you know that you are one of my favorite people on YouTube. I prize your work greatly. Thank you for the wonderful content."
"I'm more zeta, maybe delta if I'm feeling risque"
"What about gorillas, chimps, and elephant seals? they all have a combination of large harem leader males and smaller feminine fringe males. Though the smaller fringe males father more of the offspring than originally expected."
"is that soy milk?"
"I respectfully disagree with your opinion of the 'golden one'. I can understand how one could mistake his personal views as racism, but I don't think that is correct. I genuinely believe that he is trying to encourage positive changes in others, and even though he personally may not believe in the mixing of races, that does not mean he hates or discriminates against any racial groups. Why shouldn't he be proud of his heritage? I may have missed something in his videos, but I don't agree with you. Your video was entertaining though, even if you were, in my opinion, a little bit off side."
"Golden One might be a bit of a douche and a narcissist BUT he has several of his own business ventures, he is in great shape, he trains hard at martial arts, he tries to inspire other guys to be successful and strong and to learn things like philosophy etc.  that's pretty alpha behaviour in my opinion. I'd sooner team up with someone like that, than someone who simply criticises and uses all the '-ist' and '-ism' buzzwords.  those type of people will be hopeless in any kind of high pressure situation in which they can't simply cry to daddy (the government) to save them"
"98% of this comment section are weak kids dissing alpha males. But in real life you wouldn't even dare to look at the golden one's face because y'all would shit your pants. Lets be honest tho, no hard feelings"
"Can't believe that there is such large following for that freak of nature. No wonder most of them come from jew-run colleges (ie marxist brainwashing camps)."
"😂😂 I'm around Alpha males in my sport all the time, they're often ridiculously pedestrian  fist dragging apes and rather amusing.  I never realized before how many of these self proclaimed 'alphas' were so racist."
"'Leaving comments is positively Omega.' Well, now my telling you how much I enjoyed the video is positively self defeating. Ah well."
"Dude. youre way too cute to be man.  But hilarious!"
"I am commenting because I like you and your videos, and I want to help your stats.  I am a reasonably smart boy.  You are better."
"I have that same copy of being and nothingness"
"God I know a guy just like this.  He tries to give me relationship advice, which is usually really shitty, but he has never had a successful relationship ever."
"I have to give props for the bit near the end that amounts to 'your abhorrent political views are what's ruining your life, because you honestly have a lot of genuine good to offer'. That's something you don't see a lot of.  Yeah, people like that don't often change, but my optimistic side enjoys seeing them be given the chance."
"He is not for kicking out all non whites. Dont talk shit. He said he wants people that live in europe assimilate to the country and thats just fair. If i lets say move to China i will fucking assimilate to their laws. End of story. He is no racist."
"i just figure out who you remind me of. Thomas Middleditch. This is a compliment"
"The gods have a funny sense of humor because they stuck a 10-year old girl's head on Hulk Hogan's body and called it their ever-chosen."
":)"
"Oh you have no fun, well you did till the half point in the video xD Anyways you should look more into The Golden One you did not really give him fair representation tbh. Anyways just a suggestion."
"If you really really really want to learn visit a prison."
"u beta cuked ur way into my heart <3"
"0:25 lmao I choked on my drink You're right, Golden One could be funny in an cartoony, endearing way if he wasnt a Nazi"
"Wow you're gay"
"u r beta as fuk"
"The plain explanation as to why racism and sexism is interlinked with Nationalism is because of the countless millennia of the existence of individuated races of people.  It is a natural desire to protect our own heritage because it is what has given us our identity. It is a natural desire to protect our own women because they are who will give birth to our children that will further our legacy. It is a natural desire to protect our culture because that is what has given us our purpose for our very existence. It is unnatural to not protect what is good for our people own people."
"Never mind the Mendelssohn, what's that gorgeous music that accompanies the milk-pouring at 2:55?"
"how to be alpha, step 1 get buff as fucked step 2 get arrested step 3 beat the shit out of everyone in prison"
"*swallowing everything I want to say only **1:34** minutes in, in one big, gulp* Soo, what's that music in the background? Yeah, I actually do want to know, it's just that I have some issues with this...golden fellow, here."
"When I first came across this 'alpha male' shit, I thought it was just a humorous way of describing a classic macho stereotype like Clint Eastwood's characters or something. Then I realized dudes on the internet who say they do things 'ironically' generally don't know what irony means and it's a literal aspect of their worldview. Creepy"
"Why is that dudes face so long? why does his nose arch up like that? why does his hair look like an obvious wig? Is looking like mr. potato head fucked the wicked witch of the west part of being 'alpha'?"
"What do these fools have against my race? Black men are among the most alpha males around! DAMN!"
"Gay pride = sex in the public.... or does he really means get back in the closet?"
"The whole alpha and beta comes from the defunked a and b personalities science assigned to wolves.  So, it's basically pseudo science they usd to shame people, yet they claim to be the rational ones."
"I think any truly 'alpha' male, if such a thing existed, would have no need to proclaim it.  In fact, the proclamation precludes the label.  Further, the label would be relative and situational.  The alpha of one group would not necessarily be alpha elsewhere.  In short, I agree."
"I'm so glad I found this channel. You are sorely needed in this world, ContraPoints"
"Damn, son. What a fantastic video."
"0:20 - What the _fuck_ is that?! It looks like a Conan-HeMan-Flash Gordon fever dream that somehow escaped from Dr Frank-N-Furter's laboratory!"
"12:09 This whole section is really deep because the incongruous appearance of the beach on each side of the pier because of the flow of the current is so, like, existential, man."
"*SOME women like confident men. ...  But all of us like Mendelssohn.  ALL OF US."
"Looking past their differing ideologies, I think Contrapoints and The Golden One would make a very cute couple."
"If you need to tell ppl you are alpha i am pretty sure of that you arent alpha."
"You are beautiful, Contra! Really great video with great points."
"10/10 would watch in the bath tub again."
"Lars, go get another pitcher of milk"
"Am I the only one who is constantly reminded of teen wolf,as i watch videos about alphas and betas? ^^"
"'As long as you're not a sissy, prancing around teaching degenerate behaviour to younger people.' 'Well, I can assure you there'll be none of THAT on this channel!'  Lololol! Subscribed!"

"Legitimately arousing video."
"I'm not sure if anyone will really care, but as a small trans dude this video kind of makes me feel better about myself. Great job on this! :D"
"The Golden One isn't as vapid and pro-Hitler as you make him out to be.  He's actually a pretty intelligent guy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn-vlDNZFhw"
"*starts fanning self after contrapoints puts the oil on*"
"I love how Contra has more of a chin than this 'Golden One' XD"
"I recommend revising your video slightly.  Devon Tracey, atheism is unstoppable (the kangaroo), does not belong on a list with red pill philosophy and Aurini.  AiU is actually fucking awesome. He might talk about being alpha, but he is a completely unapologetic liberal, and does not belong lumped in with those racist sexist kooks."
"I know you said not to call people betas, but my sons are betas.  ...Oh, I meant bettas. They're beautiful, cute, little fish."
"I'm not quite sure Roo deserves place in this list, Devon and the first guy do not have anything in common."
"lol o man you did it again im really loling XD"
"I just checked out The Golden One's social media and apparently he's in Thailand now and taking some boxing lessons there or something. I thought he was a white nationalist, and now he's fraternizing with who he thinks is 'the enemy'? What a hypocrite.  ...Also, he is insane."
"I couldn't have articulated this any better. Good job!"
">'it's cool, as long as you're not a sissy prancing around teaching degenerate behavior to younger people' i will proudly be what he says is not ok. i'm not going to let this 'alpha' bullshit reign undisputed"
"Can someone please answer which version of pur ti miro from monteverde's coronation of poppea was used in this video, please. it's the song that comes when contrapoints pours wolf's milk on himself."
"Humans are too fucking complicated to have this 'alpha beta' bullshit. A janitor working for a large corporation by day is someone who would not be even noticed by most people, hence cementing him as a 'beta' or even 'omega' by social standards... but when he gets off work and say he's part of an underground music club where he's the most popular guy around and everyone wants to talk to him... then he's now 'alpha' in that situation. That can totally fucking happen.  Real achievers don't bullshit about their 'alpha' status, they just do stuff. Also these guys tend to talk tough and think that fighting is cool. In animals, Alpha males actually fight the least, and when they do fight, it is usually over something pretty fucking serious and the consequences are deadly.  To put that in human terms, imagine a bunch of insecure teenagers who fuck 2 or 3 times a week for the hell of it. Total beta male behavior since they fight to establish some cheap form of (very weak and temporary) dominance. Now imagine a 40-something man who ignores insults and petty provocations by said teenagers and goes on his way... but when those teenagers try to break into his home to rape his daughter, he simply pulls his shotgun out and shoots them dead... THAT is how Alphas do it. They don't fight over petty shit, and when they do fight, it's for fucking keeps.  Now take Gavin McInnes who talks about what a fighter he is and the people he's fought with. Just what his idea of a 'fist fight' is and you'll see he fights like a drunken teenager girl and has the exact same reasoning behind it. I don't want to call him a fucking beta cuck, because I'm beyond that (even if I did just do that indirectly)."
"He's no alpha male. Real alpha males and females don't called themselves that. His narrow view of masculinity is appalling."
"i have absolutely nothing insightful to say but 0:25 - 0:29 is one of the funniest fucking things I have ever seen. I laughed so hard my sinuses cleared."
"so the jewish powers want multiculturalism, liberty for women and gays and a workd free of boundaries? tell me why should I be against that?"
"He isn't that different he enjoys cosplay too."
"Real 'alpha' men don't sit on reddit and youtube all day talking about how alpha they are."
"Contra please fuck me"
"Warcorpse claims to be alpha?"
"ahahahah i actually used to watch a couple of the dudes videos about mma and lifting until i realised how insane he was. i almost spit out my food with laughter right now ;:D::D:D"
"Wait i thought the whole alpha/beta thing came from gorrilla's social behaviour, not wolves."
"You're the best thing I've seen on Youtube in a long damn time."
"So wait, The Golden One is actually serious? He's not a parody? He seemed like such a parody."
"The Golden One is amazing. It's incredible for me that he is a REAL person AND a swede. Because I'm a swede. But also we do have problem with swedish guys who are having more or less the same 'ideas' as our dear Golden One. . . . . . . . . . ."
"I'm gonna capture point Beta. Suka blyat nakhui."
"I love it when I make new friends over a mutual punching-bag... 'The Golden One' is definitely my favorite neo-Nazi toolbox. Mainly because he's kind of a goofball in his own way, partly because I like some of the same stuff he does (fantasy-novels, costumes, etc.), and also because, Shigeru Miyamoto help me, I WANT to like this guy. But he just needs to take the White Nationalist stick out of his ass.  But yeah... brother, I like you. You're good people. ^w^ You just earned yourself a subscription from me!"
"This video awakened things in me. I'm very... confused now."
"Best video yet. Thank you for explaining anti-semitism; that shit always confused the shit out of me, possibly because I never heard any disparaging remarks about Jews growing up (or really anything about Jews besides the Holocaust.) Racism against non-whites, while wrong, seems to be based on stereotypes. Anti-semitism, on the other hand, seems to be some Alex Jones level conspiracies. 'Jews own all the networks,' or 'Jews are secretly controlling the government/media/ect.' Idk.  anyways, Great video!!"
"You really need to clean the grout in you bathroom, that shit is disgusting. Also, you crossed over the threshold from parody to weird, poorly produced PSA...."
"A real man stand up for its people and defend his woman and family. And dont support massive immigration to his own nation like betas like you. You are probably born a beta as it looks like.  Europeans will sooner or later defend themselves  thats how nature work. And I dont think people like you want to stand in our way when that day soon comes.  The culture marxist globalist days are soon over and europeans will rise. Greetings from Sweden"
"i wish i were as golden a twink as you."
"Bless this video."
"Milk for everyone!"
"The common perception of 'alpha' is a somewhat self-confident, masculine, financially stable man, the common perception of 'beta' is a submissive, naive, meek guy; there doesn't have to be a science behind it for it to make sense   You strawmanned the POV of the Elliot Rodgers at r/MGTOW and made a video out of it congrats, you babbling abortion"
"Gross."
"this is actually really well constructed? very good run down of the inter-connectedness of oppression, for such a fucking tongue in cheek style I really like your videos"
"the golden one is intelligent. All the idiot does in this video is launch personal attacks with no proof. It's not racist to want to defend your country's culture. The racists are the ones who want to destroy it thru massive immigration."
"Haha great stuff you're one of my favorite youtubers."
"How can I possibly respect a man who doesn't do the voice for his teddy bear when he's talking to it?"
"I keep wanting to back you up. But I don't need to. You make your own points fantastically."
"Wow, I'm sure that it was actually not your intention, but your video made me even like the golden one more than before. Thanks for making him more popular dude! :-)"
"Lmao... At the brainwashed cultural marxists"
"Buffalo bill"
"Pfft, I'm alpha and I only listen to Wagner, Manowar and Amon Amarth. Beta's listen to 80s AOR and glam metal pussy stuff like Poison!   (Seriously though, I like Manowar despite their ridiculousness!)"
"Mmmn, around minute 5:15 you lost it imo. I do not think he is anti-gay? What is your deal? He may not be right on every issue. He makes some good points nonetheless. Place him on your side as an ally."
"This stereotypical cartoon-like muscle guy, is basically a shit-poster and a shit-lord mostly cause of his ignorant bs. I know a person like him, minus the muscles. His name is Kyle and he seriously is stupid. He mixes up semi realism which is style of art that's aesthetic is to keep certain things complex in a human drawing piece ( as in the face and body) while simplifying others ( noses or hair) to cut down on cost for animation with, exaggerated, surreal, or cartoon art. Which semi isn't cartoon or surreal bullshit.  Semi real would be; Naruto, FMA, Bleach, Blood+ and C, and a few other anime    (Art wise) Realism: Gantz, DeathNote,  Berserk, Monster, and a few others  Surreal/exaggerated/cartoon art: Is most cartoons if not all which does include panty and stocking with garter belt. This could also include chibi or semi chibi stuff.   The point is there are different art styles and for someone else to fuck that up is moronic. Oh you want more? Kay, he blames the Jews, feminists, and most people who aren't bad but just want to be treated like humans like shit or that most are out to get him. The man denies climate change, and denounces many things which includes the idea there are different styles of art and also art theory, the man is a fucking moron.  However the world is full of these ignorant shit heads who believe they're superior men but are nothing more then what they fear. Ignorant beta males.."
"As someone who has watched content of mostly the 'anti-SJW' ilk, I find your content very refreshing - different perspective, sense of humour and openmindedness. Good stuff"
"5:30 Correction: Loads of people have actually invaded Russia successfully: Wilhelm II, the Mongols, the Poles, Tamerlane..."
"Pretty smart for a leftist, but still gonna go with the Golden One. Men need more traditionalist values these times...dads all over the west are villified so they stop giving their sons proper fatherly education, and they grow up to be  emotionally castrated men filled with impotent rage like this sexually ambiguous freak."
"Humor at 0% Hail the Golden one! 😊"
"I don't think that even the nordic gods would like 'The Golden One'. Heck, I'm pretty sure they'd laugh at him and call him names. Also, I've noticed a lot of these 'alpha' males talk about women as they're not even people. It's almost comical.... and slightly scary"
"As a goldenone subscriber i was finding your video funny untill you strawmanned Goldenone and redpillphilosophy as racists. Golden one has expressed his love for other races and that they should defend their heritage/land. Redpillphilosphy is not a racist lol, this coming from someone who is mixed raced asian/black/white.   How deluded can you be to assume alpha males don't even exist? You know the popular jocks in your school that the girls wanted, example of alpha males. You know the geeky guys who werent very physically attractive that who had trouble getting girls, example of beta males. Dominance, confidence, physical strength, attractiveness and social standing are factors which contribute to an alpha male.   Jeez you sure love making strawmen. You stated his trouble in life due to political stance yet he's had no problem with having a girlfriend, having group of friends that share his beliefs and even stating he has financial problems lol?  You say you kinda like him yet you bad mouth him without knowing who he actually is or what he truly believes in. Is it just a coincidence that you're the second blond haired, skinny white liberal making a video mocking him? Just looks pathetic."

"My grandma is from Ireland the rest of my family is from England I'm English 4000 lives were lost because people were a different domination of the same religion and they had a different sense of identity we now import people with not only entirely different religions , ethnicity and identity this can only end one way....."
"He is not nazi. Entertaining video thought"
"so it is actually possible to finish Infinite Jest in one life time"
"1. It has been my own experience that anyone referring about themselves as 'alpha' is pretty much always a beta if not an omega. 2. While I have used beta as an insult myself, there is technically nothing wrong with being a beta, in fact the majority of men are betas. But when I do use beta as a pejorative, I do use it to refer as the 'lower betas', the self-loathing ones who hate their masculinity and act as total doormats to any women they encounter. I have no respects for those lower betas."
"I like what you have to say but sitting through clips of these gross assholes spouting their venom is really hard.  Except for that kangaroo. There's an alpha male I can get behind."
"I just saw the Thumbnail of a video called 'Beta-Male Cringe Compilation'. In the thumbnail you can see a shirtless Guy having 'Real Men don't rape' painted on his chest. Sooooo if a guy who says rape is wrong is considered to be a 'Beta-Male' what would that mean for being an 'Alpha-Male'?  Seriously though do these people think before they upload such shit?"
"'If you become drunk, you have committed a terrible sacrilege' Worst viking ever."
"I almost got baited into commenting on the golden one videos, but no. I shall not play into his glorious trolling. What did surprised me is that they are rather nice among themselves. That's... troubling. It's easy to see this people as monsters, but my guess is that most of them are very insecure unsucessful men that find some sort of repite and validation on this so called role model. All they have to do is let their morals slip just a little bit. Just let go of what they have been thaught about race before, let go of the lessons learned the very hard way by humanity, just accept the most superficial answer because it's the easiest, take a few steps to the other side, learn to stop caring about this people that look nothing like them and that's enough to be accepted in this new community and stop feeling so lonely. Is this how cults start? what has youtube come to? It seems like just yesterday I was watching cat videos and illegally uploaded avatar episodes."

"I ship contra and golden one, Contraone"
"A friend told me about this video. And I am glad I watched it! Informative and stuff and the fact you are cute as fuck is also nice <3  Also if you want to spite those guys, just tell them that, if we go by the Ethology meaning of the term 'Alpha Male', then even Caitlyn Jenner is much more alpha than any of them will ever be."
"0:24 JESUSS CHRIST! I lost all of my shit when he suddenly flexed. It wasnt laughter, it was fucking hysteria. I think I woke up my neighbors"
"Are these videos a secret strategy to make me sympathise with the golden one? The ending made me feel sorry for him almost... but CAN YOU REFORM HIM??"
"not too familiar with the other guys, but The Golden One I would say is pretty high on the social hierarchy. He is a pretty well known public figure in Sweden through both his political commentary and his bodybuilding and martial arts career. He also has a beautiful girlfriend and overall is pretty good with women. Red Pill Philosophy I would say is a fake alpha male. He is really insecure and talks a lot about how cool and confident he is, but The Golden One actually encourages his viewers to exercise, educate themselves and form good relationships with people. He is also not racist, as he supports all races and people in preserving their culture"

"I just discovered your channel and this is the second video I have watched. Bravo! You manage the trifecta of being entertaining, coherent and clearly intelligent. Thankyou!"
"I actually like The Golden One, he legitimately has a nice personality and I wonder if he has some underlying issues that have contributed to his world views.  Probably just being easy on him because he's fucking gorgeous, damn you Sweden!"
"some guys however like vagina"
"Alpha male is pseudoscience term according to you. Yet you are using term 'toxic masculinity' ?"
"No. Conclusion is not genocide for god's sake, neither hate to other races. Conclusion is to be aware and have your own people first, also tradition. It doesnt mean persecuting or attacking other races, cultures or minorities. True nationalists are actualy not dissmissive of other cultures, but study it. As everybody should."

"Thanks for saying my makeup is incredible. My next move is ti film my makeups. I am a total YouTube novice and I am so low tech. I mostly focus on my Instagram platform which has grown to 128k. I found your vids when searching cultural Appropriation. That's because I get accused of it all the damn time I thought I better educate myself a little and construct a good idea of where the grey areas are. I only paint skulls you see. I love your vids and have watched them all. You are entertaining, erudite, intellectual and an unusual and likeable character with many pertinent things to say. Looking forward to your next vid dude. Peace out x"
"suprise flex!"
"So any mention of Jewish power is refuted by saying 'Nazi'? This is why race realism and ethno-nationalism are becoming more popular. You people have no arguments."
"I feel like I should watch your videos in private mode... Also, I'm gonna go play my dark-skinned gay bosmer married to an orc, brb."
"Even if The Golden One wasn't a homophobic Nazi...ewwww. His head is so disproportionate to his huge body. I know there are plenty of women who are into that but blech. No thank you."

"Important question, Has that gold speedo ever been used in any Rocky Horror Picture Show contexts?"
"If you want a real prespektive on the Golden One go to his chanel because this is bullshit."
"He´s bringing the Golden One out of context."
"Interestingly this video kinda helped me understand just why antisemitism is so popular with these folks. Antisemitism is one of those things I've honestly struggled to understand and that kinda connected the dots for me."
"has bomberguy copied this video"
"so i'm like 2 minutes or so in? and i have never slapped that 'subscribe' button so fast in my fuckin life"
"Well, at least, your video is still there."
"The Golden One is basically a villain from a cheesy 80s action movie that ends up crushed by a train or thrown into a spinning propeller."

"Was linked here after watching an hbomberguy video. Thank you!"
"This may sound strange, but the debunking of 'alpha wolves' is kinda one of my fav topics. It really says a lot about our biases when it comes to science, and that a lot of observation really says more about the people observing then the subjects, ya know?"
"Dude, I remember this guy! Did this person used to have another channel? Was it nicotine or something? Can't for the life of me remember."
"I would like to dub thee the perfect balance of the Internet. If, of course, that hasn't been said already,"
"YouTube actually recommended some The Golden One videos to me. The first one I watched was him moaning that some people describe him as a Nazi. The second was a rant about Jews. THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION YOUTUBE."
"Rewatching just for the ContraPoints eye candy..."
"ContraPoints confuses me sexually 😳"
"I feel like the only comment appropriate is a lenny face"
"i honestly dont think ive ever heard anyone use beta as a put down and not been taking the piss while saying it most times it saying it about them selves like on the misc"
"Wait, so he hates the Frankfurt school but uses 'cultural marxism' and 'moral relativism' (or, at least, his warped idea of it) to support fascist arguments?"
"The only thing to do to the Alt-right and those Aplha peddlers is to beat their asses anytime they exhibit their bullshit."
"Thank you for making this video. This made me rethink my life. I used to be picked on for not being 'tough' or not being into guys things. Even at home I was always told if I wanted to fit in, I HAD to like guy things. When I was in high school it only got worse and i was isolated for that. My best friend then who I still talk to now is a shell of toxic masculinity who always nags me for not liking guy shit. I'm in college now and when I got here, I found my self to be more aggressive to things, or people, that I felt attacked my masculinity when I know years prior I wouldn't really care because it was who I am. I even used the term beta for people on the internet (not proud of it but I never claimed to be 'alpha' though EVER). Ironically, before college I hoped when I got there everyone would be tolerate and accepting but when I did get there, it was I who was the intolerant one. Now I just feel like an idiot but thanks to this, it made me realize that it's okay to be who I am. I guess the years of constant nagging fucked me up in the head a bit. Thank you ContraPoints. I just discovered your channel today and I love it."
"I don't know why but I love the golden one. for some reason he makes me smile instead of filling with hate...why?"
"that 'alpha' guy looks like a slutty gay nazi edit: well i was right about the nazi bit at least that page has gotta be satire??"
"This is the best channel on youtube"
"Dude!  Clean your bathroom!  Yuck!"
"HAHAHAH! Ah, this was fucking hilarious! I discovered your videos yesterday and though I disagree on a lot of points your videos are great."

"Hey contra this is my first video that I've watched and thank you! Keep doing what your doing!"
"The Golden One seems like a cool dude."
"CLEAN YOUR BATHTUB"
"I would love to see porn of these two :D"
"so bishonen Rocky makes a decent point but what about people like Elliott hulse (a sales men but still a gifter of knowledge.) the buff dudes or Tyler Durden  (the youtuber not the character). as far as I'm aware none of them are alt right, and while not all of them are talking about alpha maleism they all fall under the category.  also side note about the wolf study it was actually found alpha males and females where parents with the betas being children, making wolf packs just large roving family's, like nomads/Romania (a reference to the roving family nature not the racist misconceptions of the people.)"
"You've got some serious problems, dude, and I mean that in a good way.  Keep up the great work!"
"This should be taught to young boys, before they buy into the snakes oil for their insecurities."
"That exaggerated gesticulation. That overblown line delivery and smug gaze. Those turtlenecks...  The greatest trick The Great Aurini ever pulled was convincing a bunch of beta-misogynerds that he isn't actually a magician."
"when I started watching aiu / the kangaroo (I was a regressive lol) I thought the term alpha was p cringy and pathetic, but I wanted to know how he uses it bc he made pretty good points about other things. so I learned that his definition of alpha is just someone who isn't afraid to talk about and acknowledge uncomfortable or politically incorrect subjects"
"sooo... why did you include Devon (aka the kangaroo)? where is your evidence of him being a racist? what else from your list of accusations do you think applies to him and what's your evidence?"
"this is honestly my favorite video of yours... It's cracks me up every time I watch it."
"Please debate him on your channle"
"Rewatching because I absolutely cannot believe The Golden One is real. 😂😂😂"
"I think his hair and your chest should get together and have a channel. That would be alpha as shit!"
"'Teddy is saying that to understand women we first need to retake Constantinopel from the Ottoman Empire.' had me on the floor. Did he really say that? with the map on the screen as well?"
"Yes, but what about Alpha Mohels?"
"You actually have a really nice body. You're pretty fit"
"glad I found your channel. you sexy af and funny. 😍"
"LMFAO!! I LOVE your channel."
"Takes a racist to point out another racist especially if you're a self hating nazi always a bonus."
"CounterPoint, I love these videos, thank you for them! Ok, I need to know some bits of music that weren't mentioned in the credits: 1) the song where The Golden Twink is first introduced and then 2) the Baroque(?) just before 3min when he's pouring milk on his face?"
":drools:  you glorious twink you... e.e"
"Why are you so stuck on calling out Nazism? I'm no nazi... shit I'm not even a right winger. But I'd say the three big lessons should have included something about dictatorship and radical national parties in general. The Communist party in Russia did just as many terrible things to people they just didn't racially discriminate."
"The Golden One, putting 'man' back in 'manchild'."
"Milk of the Fenris wolf? Wait... wasn't Fenris male? That milk came from no titty! That's not really milk!"
"Nononono. No. Alpha/beta divide has nothing to do with nationalism.  When regarding humans, and in the current zeitgeist, the alpha / beta terms, when regarding humans, basically mean a man that is attractive to women (alpha) or not quite so (beta). It comes from the PUA circles, which, as far as I know, concentrate on getting men more 'alpha'  Wheter they succeed, or even what traits are attractive to women is a separate issue. Specifically, if being dominant is an attractive trait, then an 'alpha' male would be dominant."
"so good. i shared the shit out of this vid. i shared it right up its ass, rammed it hard.. oh you get it.."
"This was a great video :) subscribed!!"
"+contrapoints, really love your videos so far. I look forward to seeing your channel grow. Keep up the hard work!"
"Man, if I was straight, I would so make an exception for you, man! Not because you are pretty (thought that's a plus) but because you are one sharp cookie! Smart observation of stupid people"
"Hey, I just discovered your channel and I love your content. (and you) One of your videos (For Whom the Belle Trolls) really made me think about how humor influences peoples opinions. I myself have an academic background and I have always thought about ways to reach out people and you have inspired me to try a different approach. Thank you."
"This large shiny Aryan man CANNOT be serious. His channel must be hyperbole."
"Man, you are awesome :D"
"How dare you say bad things about the golden one. I just made a video that should enlighten you and show you the error of your ways."
"Maybe you won't be the next Nabokov,  but I hope you'll find something better than being a pop philosophy videos guy. My fingers are crossed :)"
"ridiculous........I love it"
"He is adorably ridiculous.  He also doesn't seem as mean spirited as the rest of them, either.  Wrong as all hell, but not mean spirited. Or not as mean spirited as the Davis's and RPP."
"I love the bedazzled swastika"
"Darn Contra  Have you been working out?"
"Honey, you so fabulous! ;)"
"Hi!"
"'In order to understand women we must take Constantinople from the Ottoman Empire' - oh god, I died crying in laughter!"
"Great video! It describes a lot of what we are seeing in society today. I do have one criticism though. Devon LOVES Jews. He is the opposite of an antisemite. If anything he is a philosemite. He also rarely talks about feminism in the same way that other anti-feminists do. So while I agree with your theory, I just don't agree with that one example. Overall excellent work!"
"I'm alpha ;)"
"i love you"
"Another great and very interesting video! Thank you :)"
"Just make sure you don't drop a toaster oven into that bathtub LOL"
"I don't think 'atheism is unstoppable' is a white nationalist.  I don't know the others."
"In the words of the greatest alpha male there is: 'Any man who must say, 'I am an alpha male,' is no true alpha male.'"
"Hahahaha! You are hilarious."
"OH MY GAAAAAAWD I thought Golden One was your friend who decided to joke with you!!!!! Nooooooooooooooooo"
"My how you have blossomed.  Great stuff."
"your videos just keep better and better  :)   Keep up the awesome work !"
"I watched this video at work, mainly because of your funny introduction. I laughed so much during this video, it actually almost got me into trouble. Lastly, this video was beautiful."
"It is beautifully comedic how the fragile narcissistic proclaiming to be a nordic god reborn leaps onto a game that is a shallow fetish of norse mythology (nothing against Skyrim's approach to fantasy or mythology, but it's very telling how this type admires the most derivative form of his master culture of choice)."
"i like this video a lot"
"I thought you might be different but you are one of the leaders of Beta , so beta it's unbelievable and again if you hate Western white civilization go live in the Middle East or Mexico or South America don't live in the white western world"
"REP PHILL IS GREAT"

"My philosophy of science professor told me whatever I do with my life to not become a philosopher because it is a pretentious waste of your time"
"Well look at it from their perspective. Whites are a minority on this planet, and the objective scientific fact is that white population is shrinking, other populations are all growing..    You are going to get some reaction to this fact that isn't going to be pleasant. The thought of the end of white people is terrifying for them, have a little empathy."
"I just found your channel through the1janitor and I watched all of your available videos. I think you're my new spirit animal. Where have you been all this time with your great points, funny content and fabulous attire?"
"You are a beautiful human being."

"i've probably commented this on every video of yours but i fucking love you man"
"A real alpha wouldn't go around proclaiming their alpha-hood, they wouldn't need to. These guys are a bunch of insecure losers desperately trying and failing to conceal their self-hatred and victimhood (which they are constantly trying to project on other people). Except maybe Golden Boy, he's quite endearingly sincere in a dreadful Nazi kinda way."
"Golden boy is bleh. Contrapoints on the other hand... sexy af."
"I want to comment about how your appearance is appealing, but that seems like it would only be socially acceptable because you identify as male, and would just come off as creepy if you were female. I don't know how to give a compliment to someone who has the kind of body I wish I had without it being creepy, so instead I'm leaving a meta comment because you seem like the type of person who needs a self-esteem boost and you're pretty cool."
"Your vids are awesome. And 'alphas' I just....can't even"
"Cross dressing is a lot of goddamn work."
"I'm so glad I rediscovered your channel recently; I think I was subscribed to you long ago but one time you deleted all your videos and I unsubbed when I was weeding out inactive channels.  But your content has only gotten better, and I love how you fuck with gender.  <3"
"That can't be Davis, there are no skulls."

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq4f43ErK_s öh wrong! Most of us love the jews and I would argue that SWJ's usually traditionally hate the jews because they considser them 'rich white men' Which would make sense if you look at how much media influence they have in united states for example. Them and the alt-right seem to have a bone to pick with the jews. I personally  also love the jews. :P"

"There are segments within affluent, half educated parts of our country and world that I have a hard time accepting still exist. There seems there is always going to be a bottom group that never really grows up. The reasons are natural enough just as you describe here the 'toxic' masculinity culture many spend their formative years wading through. And I suppose that's the crux of this comment: I simply appreciate you sticking your arm down into the sludge caked to the drain at the bottom of our vast behavioral sink and giving them a vigorous intellectual scrub and rinse. Most with any sense won't do it. Overly sensitive types like myself simply can't do it. I could never spend more than a few moments listening to Thor and his Glory Pill, which you must know, comes only in suppository form. So, thanks for being and keep them coming.  ~~Honk if you love Horkheimer."
"That Skyrim video, he's like a cringy, racist version of Robbaz."
"incredible as always. come to san fransisco sometime - i'll buy ya some shots"
"The point about them being insecure can't be emphasised enough imo. For example I know a lot of people think Devon Tracy is a massive narcissist, but I see the opposite. Like when I first watch a couple of AiU vids I thought Devon must be some Johnny Depp looking guy by the harsh beauty standards he applies to other people. But he's not. He's just an average looking person. And I'm betting he would shit on his own appearance if it was someone else. He always has a few of his monkeys orbiting him and telling him he's perfect. He never ever consids to being wrong and he never cracks a joke at his own expense. Then you see him on a podcast having a damn near mental break down because somebody disagreed with him... I don't know but that doesn't seem very alpha to me..."

"Great vid, agree with your premise almost entirely.  However, I think you are being wildly unfair to Tracey - he is certainly not a racist and basically all of his 'alpha' routine is him joking around; you guys would probably get along fine in a live chat."
"At least to me, being Alpha is extremely important - it's just most people get what it means wrong (almost everyone who says they're 'alpha' isn't 'alpha').  At least to me, being 'Alpha' just means standing up for yourself, not being scared of debate, good self esteem, not lying, standing by your word, etc - and it has nothing to do with being male or masculine (a woman can be alpha just as well as a man).  I understand this isn't how the word is typically used but that is how I think of it."
"I'm surprised to see there are people who actually take the alpha beta thing seriously. Usually 'beta' is just a jokey insult assholes call any guy who seems to be too 'social justicey' (for lack of a better term)"
"It's interesting how you try to win points by obfuscating the issue.  Btw, males are naturally less emotional than women.  I've never felt pressured to cry less.  I simply don't have the need to cry as much as women do because I follow logic rather that emotions.  Perhaps you do not understand that because you are on the other side of the spectrum, but it's true on average."
"I wonder what Theodore Adorno would think if he saw The Narcissist pwning the Frankfurt School in Skyrim."
"Hey man! There's nothing white-genocide about bicycle safety."
"Jesus. How is that a real person?  Please tell me he is troll. Please."
"'This is gonna be a fun video' - I laughed right out loud at your reaction there. That was a thing of beauty."
"the word alpha seems to be used as a way to describe what some people see as a desired personality trait but it is really just being an asshole. Great job breaking it down once again."
"Oh man, you put AIU in your video? Prepare for his shitty fans to flood this.  On second thought, it couldn't really be worse than TAA fans..."
"In human terms, 'alpha', 'beta' etc. are used to describe group dynamics.  Alpha personality: Leaders Beta personality: Enforcers Gamma personality: Soldiers Omega personality: Challengers, outside of the hierarchy, keeping the alpha in check, often the second most powerful, maybe even *the* most powerful member of the group  This all has only very little to do with sex. That's the point of those claims how 'Alpha' these bros are. Their twisted view of nature is how in their mind the world should work. And in their twisted view of nature only 'Alphas' get sex."
"I was going to comment praises on yet another good ContraPoints video, but then I noticed the severe shortage of the Dark Mother..."
"WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE IF ROB LIEFELD DREW SEPHIROTH"
"Lol the golden fascist"
"Freaking hilarious!"
"This video is just disgusting by how it fetishizes betas; I'm gonna go take my testosterone cream, bitch about this in a 15 minute long video response, and then go to sleep hoping nobody realizes I'm a fucking loser."
"Excelent video, congrats."
"The Golden Twink should be a recurring character. Because reasons. Very gay reasons."
"And I am a lemniscate male! /jk"
"What is this gay cucked crossdressing shit?  8:23 is racist??  Why is AIU racist? I haven't seen any evidence for that whatsoever.  Fairly entertaining video in general, though."
"<3 <3 <3"
"A real alpha male doesn't need to tell people he's an alpha."
"I am a FIVE STAR MAN. THE GOLDEN GOD"
"This video made me Feel Things."
"Overall solid video, but I think that racism and sexism can and do appear often enough also separately from each other, so I would not generalise that they have to be connected like they are with these people shown in the video."
"I can't stop watching that surprise flex moment at the beginning Has me in stitches every time"
"I'm very jealous about how much better your videos are than mine."
"BREH, IM ALPHA AS FUUUUUUCK! I don't think it's necessarily fair to put everyone who thinks they're alpha into a racist and sexist box."
"Holy crap, this is great!  I think Lars needed to bring you a pot of unguent."
"I am the alpha and the omega."
"I may be as anti-feminist as  they come but 'The Golden Twink' just earned a sub. Fucking sides in orbit!"
"Now that we have all seen your batch, can you show us your butt in the next video. I would like to see the alpha Golden Rod....uh...I mean Golden God deep in your omega."
"I love commenting pls like"
"By calling yourself alpha, you're basically stating that you are in a rough unfinished format that is still in testing and unavailable for public viewing."
"I have literally died. I am dead now. How the fuck did you pull that off without laughing too much to get anything done."
"11:12 I think Rodger was a little more complex than that, but I don't think the obsession with sex helped"
"The number of thin-skinned losers who call me a 'beta' for having a different political leaning is hilarious. You can smell the insecurity"
"This was your best video yet. You need to be absolutely huge on YT, my friend."
"I'd make a distinction between egalitarian antifeminism and hardcore traditionalist antifeminism. The latter would view the former as feminists."
"0:25 I almost screamed when I saw him  Delved into the alt right to see how they responded to Milo's interview calling them liberal egalitarians. This will be very fun."
"good vid"
"good vid"
"Swede here. What a glorious video! That smile on you at the beginning :)  I've tried watching whatshisface just to see what he's about, but I can't get past his horribly bad English accent. It's the most extreme 'Swenglish' I've ever heard. This is our nightmare English teacher speaking, with Swedish cadence and intonation, etc.   Now I need to start watching this guy... I wonder where in Sweden he's at. Is there I chance I might run into him somewhere? :P"
"I wonder what sage advice 'The Golden One' picks up from Kermit The Frog, sitting across his room, since he gets such valuable advice on women from his teddy bear."
"just so you know you look fcking gorgeous in this vid <3"
"Every video here is total gold. I'm so glad i found this channel"
"This is the best thing. You are the funniest!"
"Cool video BRO"
"Good video. Just Subway'd."
"forget about alpha male, i want a body like yours Contra!  i especially loved watching you lay on that couch. you have beautiful legs.😍"
"Can you be my role-model? You're not only really good looking, but clearly as the discussed topics of this stupid 'Alpha' thing people are going on about very intelligent. I personally haven't heard any of this alpha or beta crap before apart from in nature with animals like Wolves, Hyenas and etc, but it does seem, like you pointed out, many of these so-called 'Alphas' are hate filled people with a abhorrent ideology. I think they're opinion of Alphas is someone who is powerful, doesn't take shit and bangs as many women as possible, which isn't truly what an alpha is in nature, but strength often comes into it as most animals have no other way to show off that they're the best besides fighting and killing a competitor. Apart from maybe birds as various ones show off their feathers or use bird-song, but even then they're known to fight too.  Subcribed."
"I have a doubt. What do you guys think of people using the word 'Beta' as interchangable with 'subordinate'?. Also, I for one think that the term 'alt right' means just as much as 'SJW'. Both reduce the complexity of issues wiht a wide spectrum of responses.  I seem you identify what are mostly PUA´s and Nationalist in the same group which is probably coincidental, blaming the construct of toxic masculinity for both, which is highly debatable. And many other groups are externaly identified with the alt right despite having little to no conection to the ideologies presented here, for example the MRA´s."
"The most annoying thing to me, Norse mythology continues to be _appropriated_ (is that the word?) by assholes like this.  And milk of the Fenris wolf? Fenris (or Fenrir) is pretty alpha--an uncontrollably violent behemoth--but there is a primeval cow in Norse mythology,   Auðumbla."
"should not have been watching this with my family in my immediate vicinity.... contrapoint's eyeliner skills have gotten better with each video lol"
"10:44 Exactly, why are they so racist against the rest of the Greek alphabet?  #morethantwoletters"
"Soo gut!:)"
"What a beta tester."
"I am not a beta male, but an omega one. Loved this video!"
"I'm a Delta Man. What are you gonna do?"
"I'm a proud beta male and please comment if your one too! Betas of The World Unite!"
"Pleasing to the eyes yes, night mother would proud."
"Hello golden shorts! (I promise I was paying attention to everything else you were talking about too >.>)"
"I am taking pills to reduce my testosterone and increase estrogen, I am the ultimate Beta Male."
"That awkward moment when Contrapoints makes a way prettier girl  that you'll ever be :'("
"you're my new favorite"
"Is it just me or do nonwhite women don't exist to alt right douchebags? These alphas only  talk about white women or, to be more accurate, the evil princess that exists in their heads. I guess if you're a nonwhite woman they think you're so inferior to them you're not even worth consideration."
"'Helloooo boooooys' HOLY SHIT I'M DONE! :')"
"ContraPoints you arent even a social justice warrior what the fuck, stop lying."
"Oh lord. Watching this on the bus and got to 3 minutes. I hope no one saw that on my screen."
"Damn those gold shorts don't leave much to the imagination!"
"Good stuff"
"After seeing this video, you should totally do a 'Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in sci-fi speedos' skit in a future video.  On the negative side, seriously, you call yourself an opera lover and couldn't come up with anything better than Wagner to signify Teutonic nationalism?"
"It's scary when you start noticing parallels between Alt right rhetoric and 'Welcome to Night Vale'."
"I love this.   I work in a dementia care home, so you could say i am compassionate at times, empathic and emotional, seeing as I connect so well with my residents, and i am told people think I have feminine qualaties, So I think I would be called a Beta by many, so how comes I had sexual relations with 16 of my collegues at a previous job. All consensual and all women (some of which were married to 'Alpha males'). Tell me that Alphas!"
"I told myself that this time, I'd leave a comment that wasn't all about objectifying you and instead stick to my intellectual response to your thesis, but then you just had to go romping around in your undies. God damn it.  Just know that if I listened to your videos with the screen off, I would just nod in agreement.  You haven't put a foot wrong yet. There's also a desperate need for these arguments to be heard when everyone else on YouTube and social media seems to either be alt right douchbro, or humourless academic feminists that don't engage the audience as well as you do.  So there. Non-sexual sycophancy. I did it. Not once did I picture you impaling me with your eng- oh god damn it."
"Gee, Nick, I was watching your video and laughing and then I realized something. You're sexy."
"I highly disagreed with you on many issues but i love your videos."
"oh god that guy is a fucking embarrassment to all swedes everywhere, he makes me embarrassed for being from the same country as him."
"don't get me wrong, i love a surprise as much as the next man, but the 'surprise flex' is up there with the 'surprise STD' and the 'surprise genocide' on my richter scale of surprises."
"The Golden One has such a friendly face & calm voice though. It's hard to have any strong negative feelings about him. He doesn't seem to do the patronisingly fake bursts of rage that a lot of others do."
"I had a boner right until the Golden Clown showed up. I had to defibrillate my dick back to life. #BonerKillerClownFromOuterSpace"
"I don't think men look good with makeup but... your eyeliner looks very nice."
"Loved the video. Really good stuff. Except the toxic masculinity part, that was kinda gay. But other than that: top kek. I really like how fucking weird you are."
"You're the most alpha mayonnaise-gendered individual I know tho, contra points ."
"Im a 'beta' I guess, though Id prefer 'upsilon'. It just sounds better. Golden Boy is such a great find that Im going to laugh my ass of for hours, though I just hope he never gets into position to hurt someone. Also, I wonder how 'alpha' is it to use so many beauty product and shave your arms and chest like that.  'Can you understand wee-min?'"
"> 2:15 > Dad walks in  :O"
"You didn't lie about the fanservice 😊"
"fucking hilarious dude"
"Fun Fact the Golden one is the name of a minor Marvel vilain, who look a lot like his Youtube namesake  Here his backstory  'The Golden One is an artificial being created genetically by a group of  scientists who were trying to create the perfect man. After being born  the Golden One killed his creators sensing that it had to be himself to  continue the project of the scientists and began to create other beings  genetically creating his own personal army. '  http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_One_(Earth-928)"
"Have you fallen and hit your head? lol Great video."
"I got boxes full of Pepe!"
"I consider myself an alpha male!"
"Is it just me or does Golden Boy's head look too small for his body?"
"This video was gold(en)!"
"Brilliant as always.  I'm glad you went with the extra shiny pants :)"
"This is such a fuckin awesome video, man. I love you"
"Isn't cuckoldry actually really manly; since cucks are confident in the relationship with their lover to the extent that it won't hurt their masculinity to see them having sex with others, but are sexually empowered instead?"
"You. fucking. beta.  ... I love you."
"I can't like this video. It shows too much of an obnoxious twat who constantly remind me of the terrible accent my country comes with."
"I admire your restraint by not making an obvious He-Man-joke."
"I absolutely lost it at the beginnig wi..SUPRISE FLEX!"
"Those are quite the plums you're smuggling, there."
"I made the mistake (or not), of watching this in public on my laptop. Am I doing this right?"
"baby, you are Alpha and Omega"
"Typical femikultist moonshine. You are so clearly subsumed by the totallizing effects of the femimonolith that alternative codices of gender relationality are unequivocally out of your grasp and its subjects are psychopathologized to a degree that could in and of itself be aptly precodified with similar heuristic ease as pathological. Racism and sexism are nothing more than heresiological heuristics for the non-obeisant agents. You have no argument against the golden one or white nationalism, only bitter insults and reductio ad hitlerum."
"that was HOT"
"omg great heckin video twink daddy 🍆 the bit at 11:58 is so on point 🔥"
"What's that music at 0:40?  Also the stuff at 2:55?"
"Pretty much nailed it. The infatuation some guys have with being 'the alpha male' is just insecurity. Real men usually just don't give a fuck which I find to be the much healthier attitude."
"I 'love' the Golden One, he's adorable in his own scary fascist way."
"It is brilliant that he does actually look just like Contrapoints on steroids."
"Why would I wanna be an Alpha Male when I have so much fun just being myself?"
"One of the things I have consistently noticed about the far right crowd is how their attitudes towards rape and sexual assault on women don't seem to be based on the idea of a person having her bodily autonomy violated, but more on the idea of _'how dare you mess with _*_my_*_ women'_. That's why a lot of these people will shut all the fuck up whenever some whiteboy rapes someone or otherwise confirms every theory on rape culture ever presented, but if a black dude or (perish the thought) one of them there mooslems do it, they're right out there waving their nooses and burning crosses, butthurt as fuck and demanding retribution for their own wounded egos.   The idea that blacks, hispanics and other non-whites are being used as 'stormtroopers' by the jews against the White Man (TM) is directly analogous to the German nazi belief that the Soviets (or _'asiatic hordes'_ as they were commonly labeled) were working as part of a Jewish conspiracy to bring down the pure Germans.   It's all the same foul-smelling shit, although in a slightly different wrapping. Even the skittles comment made by Richey McEntitledface Trump the Turd is just a variation of Julius Streicher's 1938 anti-semitic children's propaganda book _'Der Giftpilz'_ (The Toadstool, or more figuratively the poison mushroom), where the argument is that any measure of Jewish presence in German society will necessarily poison everything - no matter how decent individual Jews are perceived to be.   And also, we need to recapture Constantinople to understand the minds of women? That is just adorably insane."
"Buddy, you're getting a thumbs up for those shorts alone.<3 <3 <3"
"Yeah still feeling kinda beta myself though."
"Great video! but I have a question. In your video you only mention white men as calling themselves Alpha, but African- American men and Latino men can be that way as well."
"I love the phrase 'beta male', but mainly as a joke. At the same time, there really is no such thing as an 'alpha male'.  Also, not sure if this was intentional, but your Nazi symbol was backwards."
"OMG, I kinda got a little hot under the collar with all the pg-13 nudity."
"If you have to tell others how 'alpha' you are, you aren't."
"Dammit why does this muscular guy have to use Pepe in his thumbnail."
"please, you are clearly a Lambda male  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_symbols#Lambda"
"I must say as an art music buff I appreciate your selections. I hate it when I click on a video and I hear some pleb tier Fur Elise shit that screams 'hey guyz look how smart I am'"
"Elliot Roger didn't think like an alpha. Elliot was an incel, and they resent Chads / alpha men."
"Christ almighty when the Fascism bomb dropped. XD legitimately surprised me."
"I met a surprising amount of 'Alpha Males' playing Magic: The Gathering every Friday night in the basement of a comic store. It was like a watering hole for insecurity and sexual frustration."
"Alpha males?  Beta males?  Why are we discussing useless 1970s pop-psychology bull?"
"'Teddy says that in order to truly understand the nature of women, we must first retake Constantinople from the Ottoman Empire.'   I know Im supposed to dislike this guy but he is really adorable, this is precious."
"What are you talking about?!?  Down-voting videos posted by feminists is the most RAW MASCULINE ALPHA THING YOU CAN DO!  It's second only to going to the gym, which you just know that all my friends with Pepe avatars do all the time.  Me and my gang of totally buff alt-right friends march into biker bars every night and call people out on their ad hominem fallacies."
"Ingmar Bergman?"
"Great video."
"Neo-Nazi? The golden One is not even a socialist.  It's national SOCIALISM you should let get traction in Europe or anywhere; not nationalism.  Why do you leave  out the non-white 'alpha males' and POC who hold similar positions?"
"12:00 How DO you cope with this though? By getting a sex change and fucking other non-passing trannys like you do? Forgive me if that idea doesn't sound appealing."
"Another great video comrade! The Jewish Cabal shines brightly on thee!!"
"Informative... and arousing."
"The last time I was this early, the twin towers were still standing"
"so good, so damn good."
"Heh, what amuses me is that girls became a lot more interested in me once I started crossdressing and wearing makeup and stuff. Nothing is more alpha than doing your eyeliner better than women can. :^) Get on my level, scrubs."
"i'm laughing uncomfortabley"
"Every time I hear Charlie Sheen speak I think 'that guy is so goddamn alpha!' while hopping and clapping. Nobody listens to or respects Charlie Sheen."
