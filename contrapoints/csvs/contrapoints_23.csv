"Aren't trans and genderqueer totally different things? For me I always viewed myself as female (I'm a cis female) but I was pretty butch etc. I used to get pissed off if people called me sir by accident. Now I don't care as I kind of view myself as both male AND female, depending on what I wear. I can easily pass as a female if I wear tighter clothes, and pass as a male if I wear baggy clothes. Apparently even with my girly voice I can still pass as a guy lol. That's what genderqueer is, isn't it? Not relating to either gender, or feeling like you're both? Trans is when you're born in the wrong body"
"You're a fucking inspiration. Thank you, Natalie."
"Well. I can only say you are pretty amazing.  F#@k what others think. Be you, whatever that amounts to. Everyone's journey is  different,  and you have a right to live it. Easy or hard, be who you are. And yes I like you, as the human being you are. I like your voice, look, everything.  Or change it all later, who cares. Of course I am highly  sapiosexual, so none of that really matters for the most part. I think it would be amazing to hang out with you. I don't  have any real helpful suggestions,  except,  you do you. Seems like you are on your way to figuring it  all out. Take your time,  you are already amazing,  and I don't  see that changing because of clothes,  gender identity, sexuality, sex, or anything else. IT IS ALL A SPECTRUM.  And guess what? You are somewhere in there. No hurry to figure out  exactly  where.  ‚ù§"
"'Honestly, I'm just not that inspiring of a person, so stop being inspired!'  Natalie's entire relationship with her fanbase in a nutshell"
"You are a good actress!!!"
"Transgender isn't a thing they are things"
"Your either male or female not both sorry facts don't care about your feelings"
"There are only two genders: Censored Nipples Uncensored Nipples"
"Thanks for helping me further understand my gender. I‚Äôm a female androgyne who identifies with both genders."
"Did i only looked at that creepy doll?"
"Love you and your channel, your intelligent, accurate, some times sarcastic and humorous approach if perfect wish I met someone like you long ago. Every bible cultist should be required to watch your channel, they would either get a better understanding or their heads would explode, either result would be acceptable. But among the religious deniers of our existence they do practice mind control as soon as their poor children are capable of speech and they don't want us back in the closet they want us gone..."
"oh god when that hunter avallone video popped up i literally had war flashbacks"
"Holy shit!!! I loved this!  I live in northern Utah, and even HOMOSEXUALITY is still a sensitive fucking topic here.  (the massive Mormon population keeps this place about 30 years behind the rest of the US) I'm learning a lot from watching your videos and they are all super funny, too.  Love it <3"
"It's sad really. Clearly you didn't have gender dysphoria, you just created a persona that you fancied and went with it. Cudos for that. People can be happy doing drag, impersonations of the other gender and stuff. Why go ahead and transition though? Why identify yourself fully with a persona? I liked you better as a man, you were much more original, you even said yourself that you liked some of your male characteristics. I can't get how gender is on one hand a spectrum and something that doesn't really matters and one shouldn't be boxed based on his sex and how on the other hand trans people choose to be boxed into so stereotypical expressions of gender especially when one shows little to no gender dysphoria."
"Who are the girls from 0:45? I know I've seen them, but i can't recall who are they"
"I did like this voice, but I like your new voice too"
"Isn‚Äôt everything in our reality just a bunch of made up nonsense?"
"I cant believe I just found you, these are the most insightful, intelligent and humorous explanations or conversations we do but probably shouldn't need to have. Evolving is so hard."
"'Honestly, I'm just not that inspiring of a person' Oh Nataly, how you've grown..."
"did y'all notice the trans flag lighting???????"
"Really loving the transflag-lighting in the background üíó"
"6:23 Too late. Can't help it."
"That doll in the background is terrifying. It stares into my soul, even though it exists in the past."
"Why is doctor playing with food? Has he no shame? h3h3   p.s why do you care why people think, you be you <3 like your humor = unique and stoic"
"tbh i dont know about my own gender because ive noticed that when i hear ‚Äúhe' referring to others, i definitley see that as a masculine identity but when its used in reference to me, i dont see that as gendered. I kinda dont see myself as a man or a woman maybe somewhere in the middle leaning towards male but who the fuck knows."
"In Chinese ‰ªñ means he and Â•π means she. They are pronounced exactly the same ‚Äúta‚Äù but are clearly different words."
"New subscriber!"
"Thanks for explaining what i am going through"
"Omg this is the closest thing I‚Äôve ever found to myself ever thank you soooooo much"
"simplemente te amo sos Genial, gracias por aclarar tantas cosa y decirlas de una forma tan sencilla y con tanto buen humor algo que es muy complicado de sintetizar."
"'I am genderqueer' Me, 2 years later, watching this video for the first time: bitch no u isnt"
"You actually look pretty nice!"
"In a world of pure imagination"
"That doll thoughüò±üò±"
"That doll behind the door just watching is spooky!"
"I'm trying to figure out what I am. I am a gay male, but also genderqueer.  I'm trying to get all the info I can get to learn as much as I can. I have the feeling just need some help expressing it."
"me a few months ago: everyone has these feelings, nonbinary people are just faking for attention! me now: apparently not everyone has these feelings and i'm nonbinary"
"I really like you and I like your videos."
"amen"
"Maybe I‚Äôm a really feminine trans guy..I think that‚Äôs it."
"Just, thank you ! <3"
"Amazing to come back 2 years later and compare to your ‚ÄúTranstrender‚Äù video. Thanks for making consistently great content!"
"This is hilarious and smart! I love both the old videos and the new ones. We need more people like Natalie on Youtube."
"I know this is an older video & you've come a long way since making it but I wanted you to know your videos on this subject(which you've been incredibly generous & courageous to share) have helped me understand/support a family member who is going through their own transition as well as just be more educated in general about gender identity. Thank you."
"however did you get such a feminized voice from the day you made this video to the day i am writing this post/question?"
"that doll in the background is staring into my soul"
"I too pay my scotch"
"I think I will stick to only remembering the genders of the ppl around me. I don‚Äôt have the energy to learn of genders of ppl I don‚Äôt even know."
"I'm an American living in South Africa for the past few years, in a primarily IsiZulu-speaking area. Pronouns and pronoun prefixes in IsiZulu are gender neutral, so when most Zulu people I know speak English they often misgender people (even if they're fluent). So yeah, that's a thing. I don't really know my point here, but I just think sticking to a hardline binary with regards to gendered pronouns as if that kind of language is the symbolic protector of some sacred truth about the nature of people is... silly. Using gender neutral pronouns really shouldn't be a big deal, even if it will take getting used to."
"Thanks so much for this. I've been trying to grapple with the they/she political thing and this has helped me a lot. >3"
"Just because you can alter a male's body with hormones and surgery to make it look more like the body of a female, that doesn't mean he's a female. The changes are cosmetic. Trans women are male and always will be, trans men are female and always will be. There is no trans woman that can create her own egg cells or grow her own uterus, just like trans men don't have their own testes and can't make sperm. IT'S ALL COSMETIC. That's fine, but trans women are not women and should stop claiming they are. Just because there are actual women who have health issues resulting in infertility that doesn't take away from the definition of female or woman."
"oh no, it's jaclyn n shoe!!!!!!!"
"What are the differences between bigender and gender fluid? Every time I google it the definitions seem the same to me. 4 years of sociology, and it still confuses me"
"Love your channel I cannot believe that freaking youtube unsubscribed me already!  I just subscribed to your channel yesterday!  Just wanted you to know beware of your subscription numbers they are probably not accurate."
"my dudette you don't know how easy you have made it for me to come out as genderqueer best part was: everyone that mattered fucking loved it   rock on degenerate scum"
"I f***ing love this self-respect s*** goddam"
"Polygender/Pangender?"
"Damn ya look good"
"fauve"
"I tried to pay attention, but that doll in the back was on my way... (;;;„Éª_„Éª)"
"'Am I a trans woman? Well, that's a good question.' *SpongeBob narrator voice* Two years later..."
"I am offended by how you treated the hotdogs since i identify as a sausage."
"Can we be trigender?"
"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Nah."
"'stop being inspired' NO!"
"So I, as an agender person, am really curious about whether your thoughts on non-binary people have changed now that you‚Äôve gone the way of the binary. You‚Äôre not the first person I‚Äôve seen who had a non-binary identity before going Full Binary, so I‚Äôd like to know what your thoughts on that are... I‚Äôm not saying this is your fault, but every time I see someone who called themselves non-binary walk it back, I get nervous about not having ‚Äúpicked one‚Äù myself after... [counts on fingers] oh gosh, almost six years. (The blogger whose articles almost-singlehandedly guided me through the early days of my Journey of Genderlessness did later come out as a binary trans man, and that fucked me up a little, ngl.) Hopefully I‚Äôll get to see an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù of this video from you someday!"
"I love this of being able to use all kinds of pronouns for you. It¬¥d be wonderfull if things could be like this for all people."
"ready when u r CP"
"ü•ö"
"I just wanted to know if your a girl or boy"
"phases are under rated, just because you are no longer a child doesn't mean you were never 'really' a child, same with phases of gender or sexuality. but i wish this phase had lasted. there are so few visible non binary people. i guess her list of excuses not to transition implies the queer life was never really for her. i can't begrudge her now being a woman, but lately she mocks non binary people to appeal to the alt right, to convince them of... it's often pretty foggy what her goal is."
"‚ÄúWhat are these Pok√©mon‚Äù Gotta collect them   MAyBe i gOddAm wiLl"
"If I ever met Natalie I'd blurt out, 'Marry me?', and then cry from embarrassment and curl into the fetal position until she walked away."
"0:50 I'm sorry, you're judging people while you still have raccoon eyeliner from 2008?"
"Disgusting"
"Personally, I think the Romance languages are a lot more gendered then the English language."
"The definition of genderqueer: A word made up by people who believe they can create whatever gender they want as a means to gain attention and attempt to become a somebody in life.   You are welcome :)"

"Why is that doll peaking from the corner staring into my soul...."
"lol all the people you put in the beginning are people I watch regularly and enjoy"
"Everytime I have this explained to me, I get more confused...thanks for trying, though, sir'am. Sirm? Ma'am/sir."
"Thanks for this video. You‚Äôre super articulate about this subject and your personal place within it. Thank you for your very honest and humble (no joke) approach!"
"Awesome video!"
"whoa"
"You say that English forces people to choose between pronouns. Indeed, but at least it's not like French (and others): we don't have the neutral 'the' or 'a(n)', and hence tons of words must be gendered one way or the other. That means for example that 'the workers' (les travailleurs)  doesn't include women  unless we add the same word but with the gendered ending (les travailleuses). According to the rules, the masculine form prevails which means that 'les travailleurs', unless you're specifically talking about dudes, includes women as well. Of course you can imagine it sucks to do this. And of course that means that trans/non-binary/etc.. just don't exist in the literal sense that they don't have their own pronouns and proper word enfings. (Adjectives and nouns have their endings changed according to gender). Anyways probably nobody has read this but whatever!"
"Great video you tackle a complicated subject with clarity and humor. I have referred to my self with a number of labels and all I want is to be me. thanks."
"‚ÄúA pint of raw ether‚Äù"
"Natalie sounds odd."
"It means he is mentally ill"
"There are only two genders then...wiener and bun??????"
"Well it kinda was a phase or you"
"Hair here is bisexual haircut goals!(Or, cue this bisexual's 'do I want to date her or be her?' crisis over everything about Nat in this video.)"
"Am incredibly freaked by the doll in the background."
"8:20 I like your voice too."
"So I know this video is old, but I'm new to the channel and I'm still really confused. I want to be accepting of people, but the 'common arguments' section of the video didn't have the argument I would have put at the top of my list:  What's the difference between identifying as non-binary in some way and all those made up genders like identifying as an attack helicopter?  I'm asking this question in good faith. If someone honestly says that they identify as an animal, what is the counterargument? Is there one? If not... I don't know if I can take this whole conversation seriously. I get how someone could identify as non-conforming but I haven't yet gotten a specific, clear enough definition for gender to include concepts like a spectrum but then also exclude the weird stereotype version which, yes, does exist in some small part. It does not make sense to me. Maybe it should? I don't get it."
"That drink offer stands, by the way."
"Welp, I've been called a 'f*g hag' or 'closet lesbian' for being attracted to 'metrosexuals'...AFAIK they're definitely not homosexual and all have been like, 140+ IQ too...so I'm attracted to feminine men with sexy deeper voices who are smarter than I am. I also have no real sexual attraction whatsoever towards actual women.  Am I gender queer then? What's my real label lol."
"Pinküå∏üå∏üå∏ White  Purple ‚öÖ‚öÖ Black‚õæ‚õæ‚õæ Blue‚öÑ‚öÑ‚öÑ  I'm genderflud"
"I just innocently concidered my bestie to basically be a girl ever since I met him in kindergarten...I never really thought of him as a boy while growing up, though he is now an openly gay man. He liked to dress up as a girl too, and I always wondered why that was a problem since I in contrast, liked to dress like a boy and no one cared about that. Doesn't mean I hated being a female or anything.  The only concern I have is in sports...if one has developed past puberty into a male, won't they most likely have more strength than a non-trans woman even after transitioning into a woman?  Idk I might be totally wrong...it just seems obvious to me that a once developed man will probably have superior strength compared to even the (naturally) most athletic woman due to having more testosterone during growth. If true then it's like what's the point of women's sports if there's no way they can compete anymore. It's also not fair though for trans women to not be considered a woman when they are...it's too complicated lol."
"Holy crap that lace is banging, nice dress."
"You re just a man with XY chromosomes that likes to be dressed as a woman."
"I only discovered your videos recently, but you're already my favourite YouTuber! Watching your evolution (from identifying as male and cross-dressing 'ironically' to transitioning) makes me really happy. Your videos have really taught me a lot. Please make more videos!"
"A whole mess"
"Chinese speaker here, there's gendered pronouns in Chinese, but they are pronounced the same. Â•πfor females and ‰ªñfor males"
"I'm 6'3 and didn't think I'd 'pass' because of that. But after I started transitioning, I started to notice that actually, there are quite a lot of tall women out there. I'd never noticed this before, but I was pleasantly surprised to start seeing cisgender women who were around my height on a fairly regular basis."
"8:55 Well, hello from Russia: in our language, even verb and adjective endings are gendered. It sucks. c:"
"Natalie, I can't thank you enough for this video. I've watched it so many times. It's helped me construct some of the ideas I've been mulling over in working towards a better understanding of myself. You are beautiful and amazing and I appreciate you. <3"
"I know you dropping that good knowledge and all. But that doll in the background. I can't stop staring at it... like if I look away it's gun get me."
"Love the doll in the closet!"
"how do wonderful people like Natalie not realise they're wonderful?"
"Rawr."
"As you stand and talk about being something. Your hair your makeup and that killer dress i want that dress you look fantastic."
"That doll is creeping me out"
"You do have very cool taste and style in your clothes accesories and makeup.Perfection my dear."
"'I'm 6'2', my shoulders are twice as wide as my waist, and I have *this* voice. So, passing--it would take a lot of work.'  **2 years later**   'Hi! I'm Natalie Wynn. Biological woman ;-D'   This is why people are inspired by you."
"I‚Äôm starting to come out as non binary to a few people. I haven‚Äôt done a ton of cross dressing out of fear but now that I‚Äôm being more honest with myself I‚Äôm gonna buy some fun clothes"

"I'm trying to understand how bigender differs from genderfluidity. It was confusing on Google"
"Kind of sounds like someone is going to great lengths to rationalize their mental illness. I don't intend this as a dig or snarky comment, it's my honest opinion. Seems like, rather than admit people like yourself need psychological help, you've created this series of fictional constructs to make the world bend to your delusions. Again, no disrespect intended, but I remain unconvinced that this isn't all some means of burying yourself in denial"

"You inspire me :)"
"I thought this was gonna be more than far left propaganda, womp womp"
"Hi. You're amazing."
"That moment you realize she actually was going through a phase..."
"I come here from the future to pass on this message: ‚ÄùPassing will be no problem! You will be super bio-hot!‚Äù  End of message."
"Watching so far, I think that the video has an aggressive tone that people who don't understand gender theory are very unlikely to agree with. Perhaps a more fundamental, well paced, and comprehensive explanation of gender theory would be better rather than a bland assertion."
"This was very informative, thanks."
"6:24 - you are not inspiring? YOU are not inspiring? LOL... don‚Äôt make me laugh. You feed my brain cells like a titty full of milk feeds a hungry baby. And I don‚Äôt even go through half of the dilemmas about identity you go through, it‚Äôs just the way you meticulously lay bare your emotions and contradictory thought process that is just so fucking... INSPIRING!"
"I feel like any should identify as anything they want because if they feel good about what they identify then let them do it.it not hurting anyone.yeah I can ridicules but it not for us to go up and be rude about"
"Well i guess we have reached the point where absolutely anything can be normalized."
"Especially in the light of what you're like today, it seems that you're experience or being non binary is that of being a trans woman who believe she'll never look like a woman and is trying to accept it by making a compromise.  Now this may not apply to all non binary people, but it strenghten my position that we should leave non binary alone, because it's an important step towards acceptance of who they are."
"k but why did i nut when you giggled at 6:29"
"HA! Too late I‚Äôm inspired!!"
"The reason I have a problem with the term gender-queer is because it's associating  non binary with a being abnormal or QUEER."
"Whoa, there's only like 5 'A' patrons."
"I wonder if Natalie still has this opinion or if this identity was just a necessary step in accepting herself as transgender."
"Nebulous political gestures,  Doctor.  send in the < 30 second distractions> ...shameful history, haunts us Gnolls...haunts our hunger, eats our ghosts. You cannot write off your gender identity on your taxes. You truly un-inspire me. Alpha up, feelings talker! Yur gonna need it in the mad darkness of the Abyss where DARK PROGENITOR ententicles all matter,  all anti-matter! all these labels in the 4th dimension -you will go mad to BEHOLD THEM.

"Well.. you're DEFINITELY a degenerate pervert...but that's what makes you so goddamn hilarious!  :D plus I'm a degenerate pervert..  <3 go team weirdos!"
"i`m trans too"
"The answer is yes"
"I think I belong to queer... üòë"
"I think generally it's a lot easier for (people perceived as) women to explore gender without raising too much suspicion. When people who are perceived as males try to explore gender...it's not as easy to hide and conflicts a lot more with society being aggressively anti-feminine when seen as at the cost of masculinity."

"Hello, I'm from 2019. Contra is a woman now."
"I've been hunting high and low to try and find some non-binary people who can provide more than stereotypes about gender to describe what it is they are feeling, and I think you did a better job explaining it, but I still just feel like it sounds like an external representation of what you feel inside not being completely on one end of the spectrum. In ways, I think these sorts of labels harm the understanding by cis people what being transgender is really about, and give fuel to the more-trans-than-thou thing. I feel like more people coming forward with the truth about their dysphoria would help shed a light on non-binary better, and your subtle mention of liking your voice is the direction I would like to see things headed. I get how cruel ignorant people can be and why non-binary people wouldn't want to disclose those sort of things though. I see a lot of non-binary people that end up going through full transition to the opposite gender as their birth sex, and I feel like part of that is that going genderqueer is a baby step for some people to test the waters, but on the other end I worry that a lot of non-binary people end up with an environmental dysphoria of characteristics they once had no problem with because those things keep them from society accepting their identity, and referring to them by their birth sex, and they just decide they would rather be referred to as the opposite than their birth sex if they can't get people to accept them as non-binary.  While I consider myself full-blown trans man, there are certainly things that I would like to keep about my birth sex, and as time goes on, I often wonder if I will give them all up just to stop being misgendered.   I'd love to hear your thoughts."

If you find that you can‚Äôt tell what someone‚Äôs gender is, and you can‚Äôt find a way to ask, I wonder how this would work... for example, say you‚Äôre talking with someone and you say, politely, ‚ÄúThank you, sir... sorry, do you mind if I call you sir?‚Äù I was just thinking that might be a good way to kind of get people to tell you what they prefer to be called without being insulting, instead of just being like, ‚Äú..... So are you a man, or what?‚Äù LMAO, like uhhh that‚Äôs just not the right way to approach that, I‚Äôm sure we can all agree there, trans or cis.

"The issue is when you say gender is a 'psychological and sociological concept', you really mean 'psychological'. Because society should view as a member of the gender you chose for yourself. While the broader truth (in space and time), is that society never cared for your 'psychological self'. Gender is different from sex, and is a psycho-sociological concept. Not in the sense that 'society will accommodate your psychology because it values the free will of each and every individual to bring them happiness' but in the sense that in a functioning society, the individual is (and should be for practical reasons) alienated by society to the point where he will accept and internalize psychologically his sociological self.  This incredibly novel way of working it out is called, 'rules'. They're the core of societies, not only among human History but among social animals too. And although an ant could technically be of any kind, it will be distorted and programmed and fed a special diet and coerced by the colony to internalize (and even externalize biologically) the features of the role assigned to it by the colony. If it doesn't, it is deemed dysfunctional by the colony and left to die. Because the colony doesn't need 573 queens, 2 workers and 4 hunters. And all societies have built a fuckton of rules about your sociological identity, that you just have to comply with in order not to get raped for years on end in jail.  For instance, perhaps you feel psyhologically like your natural empathy (along with holistic mystical healing powers) make you a better doctor than most other MDs and you should be allowed to be rewarded for the skills you honed. To me, this idea is as valid as the idea you should be viewed as a woman. Or an irresponsible child whenever sadness breaks lose in you to the point where you can't meet society's expectations for an adult and citizen. But if you start writing a sign for 'MD consultations' without a diploma, society will rape you in the ass. If you were traumatized in war and can't just take it and feel you should run while conscripted, society will have your comrades shoot you in the back. If you feel your allegiance have switched in a time of civil unrest and doesn't go to the government in place anymore but to the rebels, society will plug your right nipple and left nut to a car battery. You see, the 'sociological construct' of you, respectively, as 'not a doctor', 'a soldier on active duty', 'a traitor judged by a martial court extraordinaire' supersedes whatever psychological notions you might have about you own gender or role. And it is willing to use the full scale of its legal violence monopoly on your ass to ensure your psychological views match its sociological construct about your role, to the extent that it chooses unilaterally. Because otherwise, it fails as a society and jeopardizes the safety of millions for the psychology of a few, which makes it inherently tyrannical.  Do you see what I'm coming at? Your gender is indeed a 'psychological and social construct', but in the same fashion that your 'status as a taxpayer willfully participating in the financial well-being of his community' or 'concriptable soldier' or in most other societies which have existed 'slave' or 'serve' are/were 'psychological and societal' constructs. What this juxtapposition of attributes really means is this : Society wishes for you to psychologically adhere to the role and gender it has chosen for you, both based on its abstract and eternal values and its technical and contextual needs. Because it all other cases, society will have to punish you for being dysfunctional, often to the point of making you entirely useless (a prisoner in its charge, a body in a mass grave, a screaming bag of meat in a mental institution). And society does not care for useless people.  That's what a 'psychological and sociological' construct means, in actual functional existing groups/tribes/herds/nations. Not 'a socially-sanctioned personal delusion about myself, rooted in a medical condition called gender dysphoria, because we're all free here and society loves us all unconditionally'."
"Thank you for posting an intelligent video on 'genderqueer' I relate with this and find this comforting. I love your humor and sick of drinking to pass myself for the day of not feeling guilty of being.      'odd' or.   Like a hot pet boy video.  It's a sin.   I remember watching via VHS tape with my mother.   Before she passed away...wishing I was straight in the name of God....so I can go to heaven.   Now my dad is on me....bless him... and maybe me"
"I don't know who june is but she looks and is dressed like boxxy"
"You are not genderqueer. You are a grown up delusional man who chose to act on his delusions.  You will never be a woman, a girl, a lady or anything resembling femininity."
"I feel guilty about watching and even liking this video while she's so much further in her transition now..."
"I don't agree with what you are saying, but I have huge respect for your way of explaining this topic. You are very funny and talented so keep up the good work."
"I almost fell down the 'rational skeptic' hole a while ago because I enjoy atheism videos and a lot of those people are atheists. I am so fucking glad I found ContraPoints and she showed me the light. I'm disgusted to admit that I used to follow shoeonhead and repzion ü§Æü§¢ü§Æü§¢  Edit: once i starred seeing their videos speaking down on nonbinary people, LGBTQA people, poor people etc. i started to realize I was barking up the WRONG tree."
"The way he talks about disliking himself and makes harsh jokes about himself kinda reminds of myself. I have no idea how to feel that I relate to you. Mostly because I don't relate to most people. Plus the fact that no offense, you are weird, I'm not even talking about the gender thing. Just in general. Still subscribed."
"Wow I totally feel you with the whole sexual degenerate thing I'm hey cis bi pan whatever f****** labels are using today. But I prefer I'm a freak and will f*** anything that moves the sad thing is people respond to you better when I say it that way. I was coming out to my friend the other day and she was asking if I top or bottom and I just said I'm a freak I'll do anything why do people have to care so much about what we do if they're not actively in it pun intended"
"im one of those 'trenders' :) nonbinary teen right here being cool, or whatever"
"Two genders soz babe"
"So where the hoes at?"
"Do you still feel the same about enbies and genderqueer now that you are binary trans? I notice all the people that ID'd as those 'grew out' of it and ended up as a binary trans person or just went back to being cis. So it really seems like a phase to me, and I don't think phases are necessarily bad, as they help us learn and grow, but I do think treating it as a real experience harms people who turn out to be trans and cis people who are using it as a distraction from other mental illnesses they may have. I notice a lot of 'detransitioning' videos surfacing on YouTube concerning cis people who confused gender for gender expression. I also feel uncomfortable in trans spaces because of the influx of people using these labels, who I and other trans people can't relate to, and we are often ostracized by the community for expressing that."
"but aren't you confusing labels with identity?"
"U remind me of Joan Cusack"

"But you do inspired me. How could I not!?! You are the only same person I can tolerate and see your point."
"I don't get it. So......you are like not male/female because of what? Psychology? Hormones?   Or is it not researched properly so much that you can't tell yourself?"
"I really can't make up my mind on this issue. On one hand, I acknowledge that there are all kinds of strange people on the planet who should be celebrated for who they are, and be respected by society. One the other hand, for each genuinely strange person on the planet, there seems to be another absolutely normal and straight brat who 'wants to be special' and pretends to be strange just to have an identity. In a way, that person is doing 'LGBT appropriation' (or whatever other minority in fact). Usually that brat is the loudest of those two, and speaks all the time about something they are not and that they don't really understand. So what does the average person hear about LGBT ? 80% of crazy bullsh*t made up by attention-seekers. This provokes a stupid misunderstanding and a conflict that has no reason to exist between normal moderate people and normal moderate LGBT people. So how do I react to LGBT demands ? Do I accept them as genuine needs for human beings, or as stupid arbitrary rules made up by fake attention-seekers ? What do LGBT people REALLY ask or want of society ? I don't know, because there seems to be a wall of radical and superficial people between me and the real person I would like to acknowledge and talk to. In a way, you, Contrapoints, have this role, and I thank you so much for that : for giving moderate and understandable information for the average moderate person that I am. But I also hate the misinformation and preposterous claims made by basically everyone else discussing these issues on Youtube. Obviously, most the 'against-LGBT' is misinformed, but also most of the 'pro-LGBT', and this is really tragic. N.B. : My claim that a portion (which portion, I don't know) of so-called LGBT people are not really LGBT, especially trans and queer young adults, is supported by two things, which you might or might not agree with :  1) The numbers for detransitioning show that a lot of teen trans people go through a phase and then change their mind. That means that a lot of trans teens and young adults will not stay trans all their life. Does that mean they aren't really LGBT ? I can't tell. But the second argument makes me think they aren't genuinely. 2) My personal experience. I have a number of friends from the leftist, pro-LGBT, and LGBT social spheres. Genuinely LGBT people don't talk loudly about it, and are quite rare. I know that because I talk to all kinds of quirky people, because I am curious about different human experiences. But a lot of people around them want to be special, and aren't really genuine people in the way they live, act, and so on, so when they claim to be LGBT as well, I am not inclined to accept their claimed identity as genuine."

I do understand however, how it can confuse non genderqueer people to hear ‚Äúthere are more than two genders‚Äù as gender is just a social construction tied to biological sex"

"I like how you used to be our humble narrator and now you're our dark mother"
"Great video and you're so smart. Gender is binary but also based on biology, i.e. clitoris'/foreskins, biologically NUANCED. It. can. be. BOTH.  If biological sex is strictly and blatantly supposed to be as rigid as we make it in society, religion or culture then evolution would have done away with clits and penis hiders the world over! ROFLMFAO! But we're mammals and obviously the evolutionary process didn't trickle down to the point of us having those naughty bits being phased out because they weren't necessary in said evolutionary process. They were advantageous.  Obviously nuance is the name of the game for us mammals. As it should be. So it stands to reason that we would also express, i.e. peacock, as different expressions of either our genders or our general ideas of who we are (think vanity and a girl buying Gucci to show off how fashionable she is or someone getting massive sleeve tattoos to virtue signal how cool they are or a 15 yr. old going through a punk rock phase (LOLZ). We're all just trying to figure out who we are in some form or fashion and that ambiguity is perfectly okay because again: WE JUST ARE. Human beings aren't valuable for their peacocking or gender but because we're all sharing this crazy human/mammal experience together and human life matters regardless. Humanity is valuable in and of itself. That's why we watch out for each other, try to make a difference or have hospitals.  Like, for instance, people pick a career but are complicated, like everybody else everywhere, and have interests other than their main career choice. Just giving a real world example to explain that regardless of our choices, life is complex and human behavior/choice doesn't always follow a linear path. You can be a complex person out here in the world and gender expression certainly can't be left out as an option. Kids are just taught so early and for so long that man= man and woman= woman that it becomes a set in stone belief that it's hard to make people budge on even just a little bit, i.e. homophobia and how people's ideas/ignorance/hatred of it often reflects their ideas about gender back to them, in doing so.   Science/biology aren't so black and white. WE ARE DIMORPHIC so we just ARE. Regardless of expression of said complexity.   Also, again you're so smartzzzzzz so I wantzzz to date you. That is all. #PleaseLoveMe Lmfao :P"

"For all the people/youtubes you have mentioned in this video (and future), do you really dislike them or are you just having fun?"
"I came back to this video surfing through old stuff (not without a little guilt for gazing upon Natalie's awkward phase) specifically to find the video where the faux scientific idea that there are only two genders and, for that matter, only two sexes, is represented by dumb animalistic grunting and slamming hot dogs and buns together. I HAVE FOUND YOU, SWEET MYSTERY OF LIFE."
"Love these videos. Wish there was a Contrapoints for ALL of the lives that aren't mine. Maybe we could all learn to be compassionate."
"So a male dressed as a woman, drag queen? You are a man... Got that part aside... Okay, so transvestite, not a gender though. There is 2 Primary Gender, 3 Genders, and 2 Sub-classes of genders. Which the 2 primary is Male and Female. The third gender is a mix of both genders which is called Hermaphrodite. Then you have sub-classes of genders which is Pseudohermaphroditism, basically one taking more traits the other meaning one could be more male dominate the other could be more female. Understand all the other stuff you hear is fake not real and unnatural at this point in time. There could be a genetic mutation that allows a new gender to pop up somewhat in the distant future but till then its not real, get use to it."
"Your honesty is actually inspiring!"
"'Honestly, I'm just not that inspiring of a person.'  I found this channel for the first time a couple weeks ago and have been slowly working my way through the videos. I think your comment section is one of the best on YouTube and I've read a whoooooooole lot of comments. And I can tell you with absolute 100% conviction:  You're wrong about that, dear."
"I love you! Thank you for bringing me back to the leftist progressive side of the force."
"Holy shit..."
"Women are trying to stop hating our body hair and you're here enforcing traditional gender norms."
"In Spanish and romance languages in general it‚Äôs even harder because not only pronouns, but all nouns and adjectives have gender declination -o (masculine) -a(feminine ) , to make it more problematic, plural speech ALWAYS assumes masculine declination, as if masculine is the standard speech, the only case feminine is used in plural is if everyone referred by the speaker is feminine, literally you could be speaking about a group of girls (ni√±as) but if one boy is added to the group you must immediately switch to masculine (ni√±os); and our current pronouns don‚Äôt offer us a neutral option, so we‚Äôre trying to create a new declination capable of assuming inclusive meaning:  ni√±o peque√±o =little boy ni√±a peque√±a= little girl ni√±e peque√±e= little kid (not assuming any gender)  ni√±xs peque√±xs= little kids (both masc and fem and in between)   though, since it is still really new and experimental, most people shun us as crazy, because were trying to break with many of our standard and grammatically accepted rules. We‚Äôre basically trying to transform Spanish in a grammatical level.   I‚Äôve noticed  that the more gender codified a language is, the harder it‚Äôs society perceives gender codes on a social scale. From the romance speaking countries, France is the most liberal in terms of gender, I suppose it has to do with the fact that gender declination has little to no impact in spoken speech, it lacks the phonetical stress gender has in other languages like Spanish or Italian."
"i HAAAATE being non binary i‚Äôm uncomfortable and dysphoric and gross no matter WHAT equipment i have from the get go or COULD get why the fuck would anyone think i WANT this? i mean i WANT to be my real and honest self, sure! but i could do without the feeling that all that shit is wrong,,,,, and even if i was fine with my body, i‚Äôd still be nonbinary i personally would just be like ‚Äúeh. this is alright. it‚Äôs not perfect in reflecting me but it isnt disgusting either.‚Äù -love a grown ass adult that drinks their taxes and pays their scotch, too, & has known the word for their identity for about five years now"

"Characteristics non-exclusive to either gender. Still not sure what gender even is. There is biological gender differences, hormones, differences in preferred activities, differences in how men and women see the world. Most striking (ahaha) is the difference in male violent tendencies.  I don't think gender is primarily socially constructed, I place my bets that since a human being is still an animal that it has ways to discern sex differences. One of the most obvious ways to discern gender in nature is scent. But these are not impermeable walls that cannot be transgressed, and the moral of doing so is purely traditional pandering and has no real value in reality. Changing gender should be a personal choice, it affects no-one else and doesn't have any noticeable downsides.  Gender reassignment surgery is imperfect though. We will reach a point where our assignments after birth will be superior to those that we get naturally. As machines tend to go. Given we'd most likely be sick or dead in much greater numbers without 'unnatural' solutions to problems like, birth complications, viral infections, bacterial infections, food security, threat detection, schooling, etc. Really the base human being is kind of stuffed without it."

I‚Äôve never had gender issues myself BUT I‚Äôve had plenty of issues around finding and accepting myself, developing loving relationships with others ...and I just hope and long for a time when we can let everyone be who they want to be ( and no I don‚Äôt mean serial killers of paedophiles cos some idiot is gonna a say it) as long as it doesn‚Äôt harm others"

"To get an idea of just how non-binary identities have faced erasure, Australia has recognised non-binary identities since 2013 (and if you had an intersex condition that gave you ambiguous genitalia, the option had been available since 2004), yet the only places i've seen it brought up outside of non-binary specific spaces (and even then, this video itself didn't bring that point up) are places that required confirming one's identity (e.g. passport renewal, online govt. healthcare services). If anyone has an example of a non-binary erasing person being directly confronted with the fact of Australia's recognition of non-binary gender,  could I please get a link, I would enjoy seeing them trying to comprehend being more conservative than the Australian government circa 2013 on gender politics (you know, back when we still didn't even have same-sex marriage)."

"My2cents: I am cisguy retired paratrooper and sometimes I just see some funny parallels to queer people on the 'cultural landscape'. Servicemen and queer folks usually have a unique vernacular and concepts that are common knowledge within their group. These are usually poorly understood by people not part of the group. Both groups are also strongly debated within the general public so peoples misconceptions are very apparent to them. They also are heavily favored by half of the political landscape, and demonized by the other half. I think those misconceptions will be the sword the queer movement gets stuck on. A 'thank you for you service' from a person that doesn't know, what your service was and what it is he is congratulating on is probably as meaningful and irritating as someone who doesn't believe in a gender concept using your preferred pronouns. Don't get me wrong, acceptance is a nice feeling and I take a compliment over being called a baby murderer any day but it is not the real understanding you wish other people were capable of. On the other hand you shouldn't take it hard on the other person that they don't get it, it is not their fight and most people are struggling with no one being aware of it.  P.s: the one significant difference between queers and soldiers is; we are waaaaay more homoerotic."

"A few of the people (definitely June, she made a whole general apology video, and I think Blaire) have reneged on their nonbinary comments since this has uploaded. When your exposure to anything is from kids with little empathy and/or respect for others it will barely influence you, but when a well-reasoned adult presents valid, researched, and actually humorous points, it can actually lead to conversation. So, sorry to say, but this video is important and not just shouting into a void.  But dammit if I don't feel a little put out that this is more evidence for people I've watched saying 'I dunno, most people I've met who claimed to be nonbinary either became comfortable with their assigned gender or completely transitioned,' since Contra has since said she's a transwoman. At least I still have Rain Dove still being a successful male-and-female model to keep me from thinking I'm lying to myself."
"Why can't there 2 sex and different degrees of sexual expression...."

"I would like to be circumcised.  I know there's a lot of blah, blah theories on sexuality, but I don't like the feeling.  I've had issues in the past with people using sex against me.  i could go on forever about bondage and domination. I choose not to.  If it's weird, okay, but so many years of my life have been wasted thanks to that."
"Don't feel bad.  I don't like sex, what I've done, that is.  I'm still a virgin-is at 31, and I'm hideous.  In the military hospital, they were convinced I'd been molested because I wasn't having sex.  Okay."
"0:07: Contrapoints, inventor of the sextuple whiskey."
"Now that time has passed.   It's weird to see him/er say things like he/she wouldn't  change his/er voice, and how heshe feels a man and a woman and heshe wouldn't transition in a videos that is about being more honest about hieser previous statatments on hiser gender.  As a bisexual myself i'm reluctant to call it a phase, because it's annoying, and even if it was just a phase on hiser case, that  doesn't mean it is the case for everyone.  Now the problem I have with the video is that it's telling that you should be more understanding about the topic and that it's normal if you just don't get it. But then it's never explained how it is posible to be agender.   How do you feel agender? It's someting really hard to comprehend and that's just what we need to empathize. If you can't give an explanation on how it feels and how your body and brain percieves the world, I'd respect that, for politeness and respect, even benefit of the doubt.  But not understanding something and doing it for politeness shouldn't be enough.  And in a video that touches on agender(which i don't understand) and bigender(which I can understand) when it comes on explaining it, it deviates to refute the 'biology though' people instead of trying to make a compelling case on what it is that it is.  And again, looking back it seems as another layer of protection on what her gender truly was."
"I'm confused. I don't like being confused!!"
"There's a boy I like and we're in 1st grade, he's cool and we hang around at recess and play kick-ball, so since I like his company that means I'm gay right."
"I had a cashier today say to me have a nice day sir, I was soooooooo ready explode, how dare they classify my gender, they don't know me even I don't know me as I'm in constant transition between genders and percents of genders including non human and non living genderless based consciousness.  I should have got the stores manager but at that time I was the manager."
"Do I have to be gay to be queer I wanna know, do I have to be flaming just to be a homo.  Words to my new tune."
"It was a phase..."
"omg she is too cute. Natalie what the fuck you aren't inspiring, you're a fucking legend. <3"
"Sorry, still inspired."
"Stupid comment but  THAT IS SUCH A LOVELY DRESS. OK. Back to the substance now."
"TE ADORO <3"
"My doctor has the same credentials"
"I quit twitter so now I just watch ur videos"
"You are beautiful."
"Glad you brought a doctor in for that explanation.  I tend to think that science has been twisted by...people: 'People are the problem . . . ' As Dougie Adams did say."
"Are you HowToBasic???!!!"
"I thought you were a girl"
"cool"
"Ther is two sex male and female.  Men and women . Feminine and masculine for only human"
"I‚Äôm a enby person who went down the wrong side of youtube and I finally got onto the correct side of youtube of rainbows. Also, cool humor side that isn‚Äôt patronizing is always nice. I‚Äôm not sure if you are aware of this but you‚Äôre writing is AWESOME. The hotdog skit was really funny. It‚Äôs 1 in the morning and I almost woke up my roommates laughing."
"Chinese does use gendered pronouns. They're written differently (‰ªñ and Â•π) but pronounced the same."
"6 foot 2? Damn Nat you're tall as fuck"
"Great video! My only issue with nb identities is like they are often another way of saying you are gnc, and the existing boxes of 'woman' and 'man' are getting more narrow if being gnc is seen as another gender. But on the other hand, people really seem to need a 3rd gender identity. So I don't know."
"What I do not get is why people hang up to some mistakes made in history, such as assigned whatever at birth or the declaration of independence. What is that old, yellow paper worth, unless at nursery. I  was assigned Lutheran at Christening. Should I now call myself post-Lutheran? Even people in Belfast were not interested in my Protestant past."
"hahaha being an egg is cute"
"don't know about other languages that dont have gender pronouns but Chinese does: ‰ªñ and Â•π, for male and female. but both are pronounced 'ta' so..."

"I'm quite sure we feel the same way about our gender but I'm not too sure..."
"You re actually quite inspiring  <3"
"8:51 I‚Äôd hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Mandarin does have gendered pronouns. If someone is just speaking, then it‚Äôs unisex. But if it‚Äôs written, the female version is Â•π, and the male version is ‰ªñ. Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger, just clearing it up."

"Conservatives are fucking ignorant, stupid, worthless assholes."
"DEMON QUEER!"
"Can't get over the doll in the background"
"Idk I would just call you a man , and whatever way you want to express that is fine and I'm okay with that . Because you like painting your nails and having long hair and wearing traditionally womens cloths is okay with me . I'm assuming your sex when I say he or him I'm not assuming your gender.. gender isnt even real just express yourself how you feel. Your not a hybrid man your just being yourself you dont need a label"
"‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs clothes‚Äô, I didn‚Äôt steal them off a woman.‚Äù I lol‚Äôd."

"I just watched a full ad of PragerU on the ‚Äúwar on Christians‚Äù ughh I hope you get all that add money contrapoints!!!"
"I love you"
"I'm more than fine with people expressing themselves and by extention gender in whatever way matches who they are. I do have a problem with the they pronoun for a singular individual. That word has a distinct meaning (plural group of subjects). So Any one individual being refed to as they does not imply no specific gender as much as it implies more than one person. This is the wrong direction and the word they is not replacable as we have no substitute for a grouping of subjects. I don't see why this is a hill gender queer folks want to die on because it is not a conquerable hill and it shouldn't be. They is the wrong pronoun for gender queer, they is plural. We just need a new pronoun, and cis people can and will over time except it. But the they thing, that is a huge uphill battle which even if you win just muddies our comunication more about gender."
"You don't suck. I like you."
"My come back to the whole ‚Äúthere are only two genders‚Äù when folks are talking about a sex of a person, I ask if they know about intersex folks."
"I'm a 33 year old non-binary human and was assigned female at birth and I identifying more closely with you even though you are more femme than I am. Gender is fun. Imma do a video on my gender shifts since kidhood! Thanks for the idea!"
"5:45 as jontron says 'If I hurt Myself first then you can't hurt me okay!'"
"What is the difference of both vs neither?"
"Do you have to experience dysphoria to be genderqueer? Btw, I probably have more questions. I just want to know more about this and have a conversation"
"I'm sorry, but Ican't focus on what you're talking... that doll is starring at me."
"I don't understand how it's so hard for other people to understand people are complex"
"A trump ad played before this video wtf"
"You inspire me. The fact that you act unlike other people and you rush head first in to an honest representation of yourself and so publicly is beautiful. People can go to the grave hating themselves because of their desires (not strictly those of a sexual, or gender non-conforming nature) that they never acted or even talked about. At least from what I can see in these videos I see someone who values truth even at the cost of some embarrassment rather than conformity or lies. If you ever come to NYC I would love to chat with you, I think you are amazing!"
"'Other people's pain is funny'? nope"
"You said we could call you whatever we want so is ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù okay?"
"why the doll?"

"I love you. You are such a comfort. Thank you. And I am jealous of that out fit. So cute."
"thanks for all your videos ~ so creative!"
"I always think the gender argument is so stupid. You literally don't have to use pronouns if you don't want to, at all. You can ask someone's name and just use their name. People ask me what my pronouns are and I tell them I don't really care; they shouldn't talk about me in third person around me and what they perceive me as says more about them than me. Maybe that's an oversimplification that places the owness on everyone else; but, that sounds like a you problem."
"I'm a cigender male and I do think that some people don't identify as having gender, and that's okay."
"you don't exactly fall into the definition of a 'grown up' but ok. close enough."
"‚Äúi‚Äôm a grown ass adult‚Äù i just Screamed i love you"
"this is inspirational and you're so so so hot"
"You'er NOT gender queer, you'er just queer."
"Her hair looks so good damn good in this video, why can't my hair do that :'("
"the. fucking. doll."
"I couldn't care less about what people call themselves or what gender they are, but it annoys me when in all up in my face.  But that also applies to us being all up in their faces, don't be a dick, leave them alone"
"LOL, the hot dog though hahaha"
"Chinese actually does kind of have gender pronouns.  ‰ªñ is gender neutral while Â•π is explicitly feminine.  They have the same pronunciation, thought.  They are both 'tƒÅ', so the distinction is only in writing.  However, Â•π has fallen out of favor and isn't used so much anymore, and ‰ªñ can and usually is used for women as well as men.  The left side of the ‰ªñ character (‰∫∫)means 'person', so it really is a genderless pronoun (the left side of Â•π is Â•≥ which means 'woman').    So claiming that Chinese doesn't have 'he and she' or 'him and her' is basically correct.  I'm just one of those people who has to comment.  I support the message of this video."

"'I really value humor and there's just nothing less funny than self-respect'.   Also, You're my queen!!"
"This vid is really pissing me off.  We have so many IMPORTANT problems to deal with i.e. climate change, creeping fascism/populism, insane wealth inequality to name a few.  That this lovely individual feels the need to talk about this stuff - which should be the LAST thing discussed after all the big problems are solved - is frustrating at best."
"OMG I too drink taxes and pay my scotch! Fine I'm kidding. I pay my wine."
"I mostly watch conservative right wing channels like the ones you mentioned in this video and usually agree with their arguments. It is very refreshing to see a leftist make such eloquent, intelligent arguments regarding these topics. Very Well done video."
"Your journey is amazing to watch üíû"
"Ok why can we be judge by your dna"
"All old souls are non binary and usually come with identity crisis. *hugs* I FEEL this."
"Aren't many agender people simply cis people who feel not very attached to their assigned gender? Excuse my ignorance, I haven't really had the honour of meeting anybody agender"
"are you an sjw? dont take this offensive, im just curious tbh. ive always thought of sjws as the embodiment of cringe lmao"
"ily"
"Thank you for all your great content & educational material too. I began identifying as genderqueer about 12 years ago. At this point in my life I've stopped doing my makeup & depersonalized from depression & family that doesn't accept me, so much that I'm nothing like who I used to be. But that's why I love seeing people like you & others blossom into themselves & succeed. Makes me happy someone else can do it."
"How dare you prefer me to refer to you by a different pronoun. I won't have it! I'm lazy and if I want to call you 'he' I damnright will! Everything is not how I was taught it was and I don't like it!"
"Irreverent and informative, as always."
"Only got into Contrapoints a few weeks ago and gotta say, having gotten used to the vids after she transitioned, going back to these older ones is bit weird. It's like seeing childhood photos of your goth friend before they got into Slipknot."
"Ok so I'm genuinely trying to learn about non-binary gender identities, because I don't know anything about this. If one doesn't quite identify as either male or female, but something in between, why not just be a woman/man who doesn't conform to traditional gender norms? Why not just be someone who has a lot of qualities usually attributed to the opposite sex? Why create an entirely new gender identity? What is the draw factor there? Again, no disrespect, I'm really just trying to learn more about why people identify as non-binary."
"2:07 Is this one of those 'pickup artist' videos I've been hearing about?"

"I'm relating to this video way too much its borderline terrifying"
"I can't believe how much I just lost my shit at the doctor explanation of gender."
"An issue with non-binary 'snowflakism' is when this specific group begins to ask for privileges over the rest of the demography. Although there are only minor issues to this day, we are already seeing issues that may translate into bigger ones in the future. Take for example Laurel Hubbard: she was admitted into the female category of an international weightlifting competition and she won the gold medal, big surprise. Despite the fact that she is a woman mentally, that is not so biologically and therefore I ask: how will you segregate* trans people in sports?   Another one is the issue of dating and casual sex: how can you ensure that there is consent between both parties? Especially in the case for casual encounters, it seems that it is either: the trans person telling the other person that they are trans at the beginning of the flirt which might kill the mood, to tell the person immediately before the act in which case the other person was deceived or let them discover for themselves which really is the same as last one but you didn't dare tell them.   *I use segregate before that is what segregation is to me"
"I had to take a break at the Doctor's demonstration.  I was laughing too hard to hear what else you were saying....holy shit I am so glad I subscribed to you!"
"Nice video, very ejoyable. I'm also a freak show and I love your dress."
"the important thing about you is that you would probably still be fuckin weird even if you had been cis and het, the eerieness that you exude clearly comes from a much deeper place, like the grave of whatever faeudalism-era demon you are possessed by sometimes. whatever name fits that at any point of time because humans are too paradoxically both complex and stupid to capture themselves in their own language with preciosion, ever. probably. point is, you do you, the rest of us count impersonate you, you do not get the comfort of being average and we all know it."
"0:20 seconds in and we already get iconic queen"
"I've been on an unhealthy binge watch of your videos for two days straight, so I'm sorry for the creepy comments on old videos, but I wanted you to know you're super pretty in this video. I mean, you're super pretty in all your videos (otherwise why would I be watching, amiright? Looks > in depth, enjoyable content with an artistic aesthetic and dark, sarcastic humor. duh.) but I particularly love your hair and make up in this video, and that top is amazing. <3"

"I have enjoyed your videos a great deal. They are entertaining, bizarre, thoughtful, provocative, insightful, confusing and oddly enough, fun. It's confusing that I see a great deal of myself in you, especially given that I don't have much in common with you, or not with the 'you' presented in these posts. That being said, the one thing that is undeniably clear is that you are more yourself than maybe anyone I have ever met, save myself. Not sure if that means what I thought I wanted it to but here we are. Thanks"
"Yeah actually the 'only two sexes' science fact is... a simplification, not a fact. Fact is there's a LOT of sexes (aka a spectrum). Hence lots of genders  https://twitter.com/sciencevet2/status/1035246030500061184  Love your channel and work =)"

"not to invalidate the genders outside of teh realm of biology, but i often ask and get no reply, could you or anyone please explain what gender is to you if you do not attach it to sexual characteristics? what really makes it a description of gender, cus i could get behind the 4 (feeling like either man, woman, both or a-gender as the description of not feeling gender attached to how you feel and want to be i guess, experiencing life as a human just leaving genitalia out of it), but the ones that feel like they are disconnected from those feelings regarding your biology, to me feels like.. is it really gender then, cus what links that identity to being gender? (genuine questions as i do want to understand to not feel like this is stupid and would just decide not to validate it like i wouldn't validate someone who is otherkin and believed they have invisible wings) I just want to understand, wouldn't you want us to understand so the issue of you not being recognized gets forgotten some day, because i do find it seems more like mythical pokemon that have nothing to do with gender in some cases therefore so many people make the overly used helicopter jokes, to underline the lack of explanation as to what gender is if it is not linked to description based on sex -related specifics of living seperate sex organisms that most mamals and plenty of other animals are. using genders serves a purpose after all as you wouldn't market tampons to men, or ask women to take prostate exams... like it may seem like i am only using the more obvious ones, but there is so much more in terms of male and female organisms and even though there are extremely rare cases of someone not being categorized solely as male / female but even those cases still biologically lean to having a way to recognize that that is a male or a female based on multiple biological factors, like most hermaphrodites are men who just don't fully develop male genetalia but they aren't really women, just something a small process AFTER the conception of the child didn't go smoothly. as to people with extra hromosomes treating that as a sex. sure we all have different genitalia, but they can always be categorized and not just gens make your gender it is all of it, you can't exclude biology from it and pretend that we only made up that there is a clear difference. women have less density in muscles so there is very little chance of a male of the same body mass loosing in arm wrestling to a woman of teh same mass (obviously a woman who is larger in size as previously stated that the density of our muscles is not the same) i know reality sometimes feels frustrating, and sure we made up the names and language and we decide when something can be categorized separately, but when all presented factors point to one conclusion what really is the essence of gender if the research done by people is seen as somehow faulty. and calling it a social construct is a very lazy way to avoid specifying it, since democracy is a social construct but no one claims democracy to be a gender. i want to hear what gender is in the eyes of people who do not link it to anything is all i am saying. I deeply apologize for the long wall of text, as this really is something i would like to explore more in terms of thinking about it and trying to understand that side of the argument"
"After taking so many gender, women, and sexuality classes at school which focused on science and technology, I can't get the image of most doctors/scientists being apes in lab coats mashing things together while acting very serious, and the normative population who props them up nodding their heads and applauding. It is so refreshing to see that someone else has imagined this, too. 'This hotdog, this bun!! Facts grunt grunt!'"

"WHATS WITH THE SUFFRAGETTE FLAG ON YOUR THUMBNAIL????"
"I still think being trans is kinda crazy, but I don't care because I like crazy, it's the spice of life. I'm all for people feeling however they want about themselves, and not allowing people to bully them for being weird. I don't feel a 'gender' inside me but I'm well programmed for mostly 'guy' behavior and that's fine because that's a tiny part of my personhood. Guy clothing is more comfortable in general, though dresses look nice for hot weather, I've looked into those wraps from SE Asia, nice open balls. Seems like it's only a thing if you make it a thing because of comparing yourself to societal standards. I wasted a lot of time doing stuff like that for being bisexual, so silly. If someone gives a shit about me being bi they most likely have suppressed issues themselves. Otherwise, why give a shit? Religion? I only care about religion to the extent of crazy people hurting me because I said I don't believe in their's. We're here, right now, all that stuff other gets in the way. We're all trying to understand what's going on right now from what's happened before, but right now is new. I'm drunk.   I like you, you're crazy, lots of thoughts. The self deprecation is fun. I'm wondering if anyone really has a gender, as in something inherent and important. I get the feeling it's mostly just a perceptual thing, important if you feel it's important. And that's fine, I have loads of stupid things I waste time on that I can't let go of, I'm crazy on multiple levels. Likely in ways I'm not yet familiar with, at least I hope so. So it seems to me that people throughout history have struggled with this facet of identity that's ultimately not important and that it's funny and adorable, one more example at how good people are at making a big deal out of nothing instead of covering our buildings in rose bushes or something interesting. Instead, worry worry, think think. I've probably written millions of words in youtube comments. Why?! Because I'm crazy and can't help it right now, and so it is. Laugh/cry"

The best way is your way where ppl can call you him or her. I don't define you. Asking me to use a different noun would mean asking me to give more shit about you than I give about the next guy and nobody has right to ask me that."
"I know this is an old video, but I really wanted to show my appreciation for the Laurie Penny article that you linked. As someone who struggled with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphia for a long time before realising the overlap with gender dysphoria, their experience was very affirming to read. Your videos always do wonders to help alleviate my feelings of invalidation with being an AFAB non-binary person."

If I was to be myself, I'd lose my marriage and my wellbeing.  So, I take the easier route.  Because the other option is losing everything I live for (my children, housewifery, staying at home and crafting).    It sucks to not exist.  Bi-sexual (more precisely, omni, but whatever) and non-binary are both 'not real'.  Therefore... I'm not re- oh fuck..."
"The sausage part is how lgbts do sexual education in schools."
"The way I like to have things inserted into my anus is Bit by bit and very slowly.... at first. With that in mind why don't we start this thing slowly and avoid unnecessary fissures (rectal or societal), let's just start with three genders: Male, Female and Other. Then as the relevant organs of society or body are loosened by gentle but insistent pressure, more genders can be slowly inserted all while whispering comforting platitudes.  Before you know it the slippery slope fallacy will become a transwoman's slippery phallus bringing society to a new level of coital bliss."
"'But also, shouldn't society accept, and maybe even celebrate the freakish and abnormal?'   It's not that it should; it already does. Society in itself has always been queer, and we celebrate freakish and abnormal people all the time, from professional athletes, to politicians, to artists, writers, to the stars of media that we consume. We absolutely adore the strange, which is why it boggles my mind that people waste time and energy fighting against something so trivial to them as what people identify as or want to call themselves."

"I like my feminine body, but I want to be considered as a man by society. I wonder if I should start presenting more masculine. ;) I have trouble identifying as non-binary though because I'm short and have boobs so I feel like it's obvious what my sex is. It's hard to conceive of sex as being entirely different from gender, because our idea of what gender is comes out of sexual roles."
"No objection to your wonderful self here. My sexuality is often erased too. I'm pansexual. By the way, you are beautiful and I admittedly have a crush on you for your humor, beauty, fashion sense, makeup skills, and most importantly your intelligence. Your mind is quite sexy."

I am genderfluid or genderqueer or non-binary or whatever you want to call it. I am also ftm trans. I doubt anyone other than you could understand just how I feel about my gender."

"'ass' you showed...He he...oops!"
"People asking those kind of questions, or arguing those believes ass you showed in the clips, isn't really what makes me angry.  But more...WHY? what does it even matter?   Why do they even care/object to begin with? It's like race-differences and what not...Why do people even care?....I'll never know."

"Welll... that went down quick..."
"I enjoy your videos quite a bit; as someone that considers themselves a 'rationalist/classical liberal', at times you've made arguments that have 'rubbed my nose' in certain lines of thought I've had that might not bear as much scrutiny as I thought they should. Bitter pills for sure, but appreciated none the less.  I came of age in the mid-90s, and I think my generation was pretty progressive; probably the first where being queer of whatever flavor didn't make you a complete pariah in more enlightened circles. So it really shocks and dismays me how tone-deaf and regressive my generation has become about race and sex/gender identity as we've entered middle age. I swear, we weren't like this 20 years ago. I don't know what the fuck happened.  Anyway, keep doing what you do. I dig the way you attack these issues with your intelligence, righteous fury, and subversive humor."
"'Oh no, I can't use they to describe a singular person! It's against the grammatical rules of my fucked up language that regularly ignores its own grammatical rules!' English is a bizarre Frankenstein language people, and we've been using they as a singular pronoun in literature for a very, very long time. I'd even wager you've used it yourself at least once. Example: you see a figure at the end of the street doing something odd, and you say 'what the hell are they doing?' because they're far away and honestly figuring out what gender they are is less important than the fact that they're doing something weird like riding a unicycle or something. It's not really unreasonable, English speakers as a whole have been using it to fill the gender neutral pronoun gap for longer than we've been discussing whether we should have a gender neutral pronoun."

"This kind of feels like where contra had started to not only come out as gender queer, but also pick up the aesthetic she is characterized with today. The lighting, the colors, the even more on point outfit then usual...it's all here, just toned down comparatively. This channel has been a really interesting linear story, but calling it a story seems rude in of itself to the stuff I know she had to go through...I think an experience is a more accurate term, at least how I interpret her videos."

"While everybody else seems to adore their labels to the point of self-identifying, I do not. In fact, I find most labels too small and very confining so the vaguer the label the better it is for me.  I am an earthling first, a human second and me(fill in name here) last. Everything else seems rather inconsequential. I like referring to myself as a freak, mostly because many of those that refer to themselves as normal are hateful ignorant violent self-centred judgemental sickos. I see nothing wrong with being a freak waving her freak flag in such a society. Personally, I think everyone is a closet freak conforming to some societal standard to blend in. I meet so many people I do not remember because they all look alike, wear the same ugly clothes and have the same boring haircuts. Being a freak is to be original. I like the word queer largely because etymologically it stems from 'query', to question or be questionable. And anyway, asking questions is a sign of intelligence. Better yet I like to refer to myself as classical jazz.  Because in such music, there are notes that are 'ambiguous'. A minor diminished seventh or some such. I have heard jazz instructors refer to these as ambiguous. I want to be ambiguous so I am going to be Miss Ambiguity. Love your shows as always."

"people who uses 'scientific fact' as an argument forgot that the main part of science is the constant updating and correcting of itself, like how what would seem like an universal truth a decade ago had been proven wrong, over and over again. my science books when i was a small kid still have the sectioning of the taste buds in our tongue, claiming each part sense a different flavor. but thats not actually the case! all tastebuds can sense every flavor just fine! so what if your past scientist of choice claimed that there are only two genders? claims get debunked and corrected all the time. the claims that gender is a spectrum is made scientifically too. gender is binary and gender is fluid theories might also be debunked in the future anyway!!!"

I know its a little embarrassing but to be honest I never actually understood genderqueer and non binary people (not even transpeople completely) before until I found your channel and this video.

"Well hello, young Wynona Ryder. It's an absolute pleasure. No, really. Mmm <3 Speaking of sexual deviants, you have turned me into one. All praise and blame to ContraPoints - the bitch slays me every video.  I feel lucky to be able to go back and watch all your videos now, because it's just inescapable how largely honest about your private mental machinations you are even while you're covering up, in ways that are very relatable and understandable in the great human endeavour of self discovery. I hope you haven't copped too much flak for these 'inconsistencies' (I actually typed incon*cis*tencies which made me giggle) since we all deserve our little protective bubbles to help us learn and grow. Life is hard enough! I'll admit, the thought of you as this crossdressing sexy smart feminist hetero male unicorn was fun (so fucking fun) but I'd peeked ahead, I kinda knew it wasn't going to last. As such :P  Love all your evolutions, though. You're like an Eevee who levels up in rotation from Vaporeon through Espion (fuuuck, imagine if there was such a Pok√©mon... my primary school would've turned into an Aussie Battle Royale, and I would've gone on to the Pan-Pacific level, taking on tiny Japanese 8 year olds for a box of Pocky and the promise of a Mew)"

And also thanks for putting in the effort/taking the risk to make this to help educate folks. I only know a couple of NB folks so hearing stories like this helps me understand it on more than just a theoretical level, if that makes sense."
"Two word: Two genders. Everything other is a mental illness"
"You have amazing tastes when it comes to clothing, goodbye"
"As you pointed, gender is sociological and psicological. For biology, it's sex. So the thing you would have to say against ppl pointing that there are only two genders is that the term is sex and there aren't just to sexes. But the thing is that 99,95 per cent of the time, there are.  About the argument that the term gender queer is important to be clamed due to advocacy against discrimination, I want you to consider that most of people using thoses terms about non-binarity are claming that a stereotype is what makes you a man or a woman. And that is sexist. They are also defending that we should erase female reproduction terms for them to feel included. So claming this term makes you seem like one of thoses people who advocate that. I don't see how the term 'feminine man' is derogatory."

"That doll in the background."
"First of all, that top is fucking cute.   Second of all, I feel like even if you don't believe in nonbinary, it's just respectful to use proper pronouns.  I've heard a lot of arguments saying they shouldn't have to change their speech for others feelings. But I honestly don't care about changing my wording if it means making someone not feel like shit. It's not that hard. I've called one friend they from the day I met them because I picked up on some more obvious hints they preferred they. (They never gendered themselves, they called themselves kid rather than gal or guy, it was in their secret insta bio, etc.) This was when I was in my beginning moments head first into the only 2 genders belief. Even then I still respected my friend enough to call them their preferred pronouns because it's not that hard, and if I did misgender them, they were super chill.  But I learned a lot of this with exposure to binary trans people. I saw how some of them reacted to being misgendered, having to say their dead name, etc. And that made me realize how important identity is to people."
"watching this back, it  kind of looks like your struggles of coming to terms with transitioning, but it's very interesting and by the end it kind of makes me question whether genderqueer is truly a thing, but I don't mind them, so bring all the genderqueer stuff tbh as long as you're good with yourself, i'm good"
"Even before watching this, I actually thought you were really good at shifting and changing between genders. And if you want to be called both randomly, that's fine.   I kind of feel the same way although I hesitate to pin a specific label on me.   I don't know if the reason I don't always feel comfortable being a woman is because of negative experiences with the label or if I am actually gender queer or just have an obsession with cross dressing. I think it would be great to be both though and as much as I love being a woman, sometimes I hate having to fill in gender on forms."
"was this awakening?"
"Using the grosse fuge for this topic is just perfect"

"hi ContraPoints!! i love your thoughtful content and unique perspective on so many social issues. and i discovered you from your incel vid and pretty much binge-watched you from there. i think on this piece, an interesting point of view to consider is almost a 'marxist' point of view on gender. sure sex matters when you go to the doctor or compete in the UFC, but gender is almost entirely a form of oppression. saying dresses or trucks or certain voice patterns align  with a certain gender (not bio.sex) is almost always a way of oppressing people. in the same way a marxist might say 'class' is an oppressive fiction, might we see gender as the same thing? an idea imposed by the bourgeoisie of sex, usually straight white men, as a way to keep people like us down? shouldn't we say about gender what marx says about class, and call all of it oppressive lies? i mean without gender wouldn't we all just be who we are?"
"I just thought I'd let you I think you're cute. I'm overweight so I know validation is important."
"i love you jfc"
"Thank you for this. I'm also genderqueer/non-binary (though I'm on the agender side of things) so I found this so affirming üíú"
"I'd be interested to hear ContraPoints revisit this topic, now that they identify as a transwoman. Does she still feel that she's genderqueer,  or perhaps gender fluid, or maybe that particular identification was just a necessary stepping stone to accept herself as transgender."
"I don't identify as human. Fite me!"
"So, I just found your channel. I watched your video on incels first, and this one second. It was really fascinating to see the profound transition you have made in the intervening months, and I don't just mean physically. (Though it is also profound. Your videos, the incel one in particular, have been coming up on my feed for a week or so now, and even watching the first part of that video up until you referenced that you are trans, I didn't realize you were.)   I really mean the transition of uncertainty of self into confidence, of shaky conviction into pride. It's a powerful and very intimate thing to see. Having so much of yourself on display to the world must be scary, but I guess maybe empowering in a way, as well. This video and the one on incels are very different in style and in tone, but both are very good and were very meaningful to watch.   I sometimes wonder how people find the courage to be so real in such a public space, but I'm always grateful some people do. Thank you for sharing. I greatly look forward to your future videos."
"These videos are so fascinating and insightful, both in their context and in themselves. Please never take them down. You are amazing."

"That sausage part had me in tears. Can't remember when a youtube video had me laughing that hard. Don't know what that says about me, though ..."
"I am so confused. From what I am gathering, people are just using gender terms to describe their personality. I don't feel like a woman I feel like a person. I have many masculine and feminine traits, but I don't think that would make me agender or non-binary. This whole concept is just baffling to me, and I cant wrap my brain around it."
"Dude, you're the first Genderqueer I like. And it's about rainbow flag. You don't wear that shit. Damn, that flag is so annoying. Liked your video and everything that A272 943B said in a comment bellow, except for Sargon.  Keep up with the good work girl!"
"I worry that my gender fluidity is either a desire to be a special snowflake, a result of mental instability, or a weird sexual deviance. I may never accept it as just being who I am. And that kinda bums me out."

You destroyed my soul with cognitive dissonance in this video. Calling nonbinary 'agender' made me feel like the asshole I always knew I was. I wish we had more motherfuckers like you who could describe this shit in palatable ways. When I'm no longer a pauper I'll toss you a few shillings. Then I'll toss your salad."

I still don't and never will.  But I have a much better understanding of it now, so thanks for that.  That said, would you agree that Google (and others) offering 32 (or possibly more) options for gender identification on forms is possibly too much?  Is it reasonable to limit it to maybe 8 (or 16, etc.) and also include 'other.'   I'm not suggesting people be limited to only x number of options to describe themselves, but for the purpose of business forms and operations, isn't 32 (from the previous 2 of M/F) a bit problematic?"
"Gender is a construct TEAR IT APART"
"3:26. Wow. And in real time. A magic moment. <3"
"What a lot of people forget to mention when talking about this topic is that it's also a scientific fact that there's a natural Midway point between genders called being a hermaphrodite. If people are fine with transitioning between man and woman then why aren't they okay with people transitioning to a hermaphrodite?"
"All foetus are women first lol. Also everyone has male and female traits, and a perfect male or a perfect female, in the ideal sense of the word, have never even existed IMO. So to me it's just a matter of personal liberty, be whoever you want to be as long as you're not judging me for who I want to be.  As someone from India with a very small gender identity movement I'm not very conversant with the language and sometimes nuances of it. Please correct me if that is so, id really appreciate it. I value conversations more than google."

"That top and your hair are GORGEOUS here! And all of the crazy psychos online are a biiig part of the reason I don't even bother explaining why I'm genderqueer.

"I think it's too bad that she thought she couldn't identify as a woman because she'd have to try to pass or that she'd have to change things she likes about herself. Obviously she has moved past this but it makes me sad to hear. A woman doesn't need to have any certain kind of body to be a woman. My girlfriend doesn't plan on having any kind of surgery any time soon. She let's her facial hair grow out sometimes and has told me on multiple occasions that with hrt she has transitioned enough for herself even though she doesn't pass and a lot of people wouldn't consider her a woman 'yet' because of it. She has things she does want to change, like how she struggles with vocal training but that's personal to her. TBH a trans woman doesn't even need to medically transition at all if she doesn't want to. I know of some who haven't changed the way they present themselves at all. If this is getting in the way of anyone calling themselves a woman I think that is a shame."

"@8:50  'Nu-ren' & 'Nan-ren' are Man and Woman in Mandarin...?     Couple thoughts you inspired:  (First and foremost,  I appreciate your relatively elevated level of reasoning per these subjects.) You were sharing your history/feelings at one point, which is RARELY a negative thing, but then redirected...  @6:10  The fact that you outright admit you're disgusted by yourself concerned me most...  I am curious what you did that you haven't forgiven yourself for prior to the becoming 'genderqueer'...or perhaps something someone (likely a man) did to you?  I know self hate when I see it and I have had some extraordinary failures in my life, which made me question everything, including if I was the person I thought I was..   If you really want to get down to it, we are all just collections of electrical activity between neurons and synapse in the brain.  The neocortex is a self evaluating phenomenon and its not outlandish to think some aren't going to handle it well, let alone be raised/taught the tools to mentally moderate the neurological disconnect between mind and body... We all, individually, need therapeutic outlets, but too many believe buying a new car, shoes, or from what I can see, 'gender', is the way to mask and/or solve these destructive insecurities...    When its a heart attack, we hire a professional, and so should we when it comes to the foundation of our working coincidence.  Therapy is effective because you realize how much you not only don't know, but can't know due to the inherent bias of human perspective.. Stability is paramount in a world of external threats, find purpose beyond 'who you are', only then you will discover 'who you are'.     Thanks!"

"It's amazing how much I can genuinely enjoy your content while also disagreeing with so much of it."
"So this might just be the ramblings of a drug addled neive fool, but shouldn't we strive to abolish gender labels rather than inventing new ones? First of all, male and female characteristics outside of medical sex characteristics are just social constructs anyway. Second, I don't think anyone truly fits into the 'male' and 'female' roles society assigns with 100% accuracy all the time. If they did society would fail to function. Therefore, rather increasing the number of boxes to shove people in, shouldn't we just get rid of boxes all together? Doesn't saying 'I fall outside societal gender expectations' VALIDATE that there are concrete male and female characteristics and roles?

"I'm so glad I've discovered this channel.  You're just a wonderful person, really."
"at 8:52 you say that chinese has no gendered pronouns. This isn‚Äôt exactly true 1) Chinese is a group of languages 2) the form of Chinese I have knowledge in is Mandarin which does have two pronouns, they‚Äôre just pronounced the same way. They‚Äôre tƒÅ ‰ªñ and tƒÅ Â•π , the first meaning he and the second meaning she.   There are languages with no gender pronouns like Finnish which uses ‚Äúh√§n‚Äù for both he and she. Although this isn‚Äôt really used as much as their other pronoun ‚Äúse‚Äù which directly translates to ‚Äúit‚Äù but is used in everyday speech to mean he/she/it. They only have h√§n after they were christianised and people thought they needed a new pronoun to call god because calling god ‚Äúit‚Äù would‚Äôve been disrespectful at the time"
"What I really don't get is this: why aren't there heterosexual non-binary people then?  I'm serious I'd like some examples if they exist. Cause otherwise it seems to me like  some people are living mixing their (gay) prefences with the concept of gender. Mah!"
"I can stare into the middle distance a lot over stuff like 'well how can you really be trans if you don't have much dysphoria' and the need for validation esp when you don't neatly fall into the narrative that gets told a lot of 'well I was always this other gender and felt intense discomfort about being misgendered.'  I eventually settled on bigender for myself but besides for days I want an on off switch for my breasts ( because ofc things couldn't be easy as always wanting them or not), I tend to not care what pronouns people use for me and vary what my gender performance is day to day while also going 'yeah no I'm always a boy and a girl'  And like I didn't even think to start reflecting on my gender until the end of high school. Was that because I was a tomboy growing up, was it me honestly not being trans until then, was it me not knowing that was a thing but quickly going 'oh that sounds more like me now that I know it's a thing vs there just being mtf and ftm people?'  Who the fuck actually know. When I'm not stuck on existential dread I guess it's nice to actually have some vocabulary to explain myself to other people."
"very enlightening video, i was assigned female at birth but seem to experience a sort of 'mirrored' sense of gender to you (i.e kinda both, kinda dont care, enjoy 'crossdressing' although when females dress as males its not considered such a big deal? which i kind of dont appreciate because my clothes and fashionable expression mean an awful lot to me)"
"6:28 'STOP BEING INSPIRED' Well Buhoo!! Too late, I'm already inspired by you."
"'You are the Man' or 'You have brass balls' seem out of place, so I will just say how much I admire you. I'm 54 and the product of a conservative environment but in a freer world, I would have been a lot like you (and I haven't given up)"
"Love your channel, i like you as a person, but this is one of the videos i disliked. Contrary to what you may think, you didn't provide solid proof for any of your points. And since you can't really oppose the argument that there are only 2 types of reproductive organs, you decided to joke about it with hotdogs instead... This is not an argument...  I am sorry, gender is not a social construct, it is a biological truth. There are only 2 genders in humans and that's that. I can understand that some people may feel disphoria or have some other health issues that blur the lines between the genders, but this does not change the reality that the genders are 2. Sorry."
"LOL, You could've actually electrocute yourself with that hotdog in the outlet. Would have got a good jolt and cooked the dog all at once. Be careful."
"That... Fucked up... PIXEL"
"Ive counted maybe 3 people so far that have 'corrected' (called someone else along the lines of an asshole) someone else (including me) of using the 'he'  pronoun for contra.  There is still so much confusion about the correct pronoun usage even after this video was posted.  I've been using he/she/contra and ppl still give me shit for it.  Please someone correct me if I am wrong... Im pretty sure contra really doesn't mind being called he/she."
"In chinese, when you speak, there are no gendered pronouns.  HOWEVER, when you are writing, the word is written differently for males and females."

"You're a man."
"Also, omg I like you. You earned a sub~"
"THAT DOLL IS SCARY"
"You are very cute! That said, my first argument against 'there are only 2 genders' is very basic, babies are sometimes born with both and female, or no genitalia at all."
"okay got it gender queer = non binary , but even if gender = the sex u identify as apposed to it's original meaning gender = sex . How can u have no gender as is claimed in this video. You don't identify as male or identify as female ? , do u identify as human ? because there are no other types of humans ."

"Cool vid C.P. Very interesting way that you see things. I thought when you brought up the Doctor bit you would have spoken of Inter sex people. Since their argument doesn't even fit fully in the science. ¬†(Yeah calling it the science as a joke. Long inside joke.) Still, funny and fun yet informative video. I my self m Just a T-girl in training. I only go into male form to pay bills. Cause got to have a job. Saving up for¬†steps to get to ware I want to be.)¬†But, I under stand some folks are Gender fluid or¬† Genderqueer. And that's cool. You do you. Can't wait to see your next video."

"What is the point of the concept of gender? In general"
"Nah. Gender is a grammatical category that applies to substantives, similar to e.g. animacy. :o)  I should probably add a smiley to that."
"I needed this video."
"I know this video is like more than a year old at this point, but I couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to leave these thoughts so here we go.   So something I‚Äôve always struggled with is what masculine and feminine actually mean. Like to me, they should mean nothing and people should be able to be how they please when they aren‚Äôt hurting anyone. I know that in general (in my life experience specifically) masculine was supposed to mean like sports and toughness and stuff. Now I identify as a man, I use male pronouns, but I don‚Äôt identify with most if any ‚Äútraditional‚Äù masculine traits. I‚Äôm pretty soft spoken, I believe in talking things through and being kind and trying to help people. And I love all kinds of different personalities, I find them all interesting in their own ways. I guess I‚Äôm saying all this to say, I don‚Äôt understand gender or why people people hold certain traits or qualities to either end of the spectrum. I don‚Äôt even think there is a spectrum. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm weird. I just needed to put these very confusing thoughts somewhere possibly appropriate and see if I get any meaningful responses."

"Amazing voice :P"
"Hey Contra,  Not sure if this is appropriate, or if you'll read this; Straight white male here, probably this is the third time I'm watching the video(subscriber and find your takes very interesting, to the point and most agreeable). and I'm just wondering, as someone whose never thought of myself as a sexual person(but has that drive like all others, sort of), I do not transcribe myself with any of the defined pronouns related to this subject or others. I don't really know how to describe where it is I'm coming from; like I said straight and male, not gay, trans or gender-queer, just your milquetoast quazi-normal, insanely shy person who can't perfectly navigate society or the social interactions easily, I've a personal life hampered by crippling public anxiety(most of the time I can't even write comments as an anonymous, as I edit this it's been over three hours and stressing on how and what I say will be perceived). Bad experiences with both sexes, but mostly women from a high school bullying perspective and an adult one because of the way I look, how I communicate, I still don't know why, which has resulted is some not so great, all around dysmorphia about my body and especially my face, it has also caused aspects in how I relate to women, not as a whole but individually, to be a little skewed. to that, maybe you or others have felt like this. Is there some term or idea or pronoun for this, the absence of sexual tendencies, yet still having them."

"Idk if you'll read my comment but I feel like proliferation and exploration of gender pronouns is important and good for destroying gender norms. I think we'll hit a point where masculinity and femininity and nonbinarism will because so widespread that it'll make gender to complicated to care about. Gender has  been about perscriptive presentation for too long and I think it will lead to a future of people who have no 'norms' on how to act and just act as themselves and express themselves with no prescriptive coding. Then they can look at the swath of pronouns and identities as a shorthand for what they might like and go with what feels best. It's not silly and to those that think that it is ENFORCING gender norms to use demi girl and nonbinary and all that, I feel like the ultimate end game is just to give freedom of choice to everyone in regards to how they feel and present without judgement, harm, or job restriction"

"This is all a little heady since it's all happening in 24 hours, but I'm fascinated by this channel in a way that only partly can be justified by my Male ability to find images hot by themselves (by which I mean, hey there, you're pretty :) ),  but also because of your writing style, use of lighting and content.  But also because you're both smart and clearly have the ability to think critically, and really, what does it say about me or the world that I find that specifically attractive.  Anyway, I also seem to be viewing this channel in reverse chronological order, which is itself interesting (and the thought of which may make you cringe) but its fascinating to see you grow and adapt to your gender/gender expression at the time, and despite the humility you show in this video, let me make this clear, for people like me who are somewhere in their lives which this particular video makes tremendous sense, YOU ARE ADMIRABLE, and YOU ARE INSPIRING, and can I meet you at yours for a cup of coffee?"
"the word gender is used for too many things tbh I think it would be better to just call it personal identity it would cut out all the confusion most people have"
"There‚Äôs nothing to argue about honestly, he only needs one, and uh... if it‚Äôs ‚Äúsexual‚Äù it‚Äôs understandable if that was for one person... and well, you guys being there is like studying to be male and female? Which is completely nonsense, so don‚Äôt make up new terms... it‚Äôs unnecessary."
"I love your channel!"
"Face it. You're a transvestite in a nutshell."
"That hotdog scene was way too explicit"
"I think I can understand Agender, after all, machines can be intelligent, and they have no gender, even if we acoplate a dildo on one of them. I can see how that could also apply to humans, if we consider one's mind to be kind of like software. But the other ones sound a little stupid, specially the ones which are both female and male at once."
"These terms are pretty new so I'm glad to have someone finally try to explain these concepts to me. I mean I'm quite convinced that when it comes to humans biological sex is pretty binary with very few nebulous exceptions but I am willing to believe that people have problems with how they interact socially with the concept of being male or female. As such it's nice that you're actually reaching out to your audience to explain these issues though at this point (part way through the video) I am still a bit confused and I really don't like the way using the word 'they' sounds in English but you seem like a nice 'freakish hybrid' to me. Good luck with your future endeavors (this near the end of the video) and where your YouTube career is concerned I might 'tune in' occasionally. again from the bottom of my 'cis scum' heart thank you.üòÅ"
"As a nazi (im really into marching, geometric symmetry, ethically based holiday camps and torches) im fed up with the constant bullying i recieve from progressives. Considering the emphasis they place on tolerance they quite unfairly bully me cause me to break down in tears much of the time"
"This is my honest opinion, in no way looking to offend anyone. One can have any sexual inclination imaginable. One can like to fuck men who dress up as dogs. One can have any fashion taste imaginable. One can like to dress up as a dog. But there can be only two genders because there are only two biological sexes from which we can analyze cultural patterns. So why instead of coming up with names for genders, wich don't describe any sexes, people don't come up with different names for sexual inclinations and fashion tastes? And this doesn't have anything to do with gender dysphoria (which should be called sex dysphoria) in which the brain is not in sync with it's body. Those people need help, but even with treatment, unless they can change their DNA, they will not be the opposite sex."
"i see a lot of my own 'gender journey' in what you describe here. i'm not out to everyone yet but at least with a few trusted people i identify as genderfluid now and accepting and exploring that has been absolutely amazing for my self-esteem and identity"
"Hahahaha"
"I don‚Äôt think this would be such a problem if we just let people be themselves. Even though dysmorphia is a horrible thing to deal with and I will never be one to claim that it‚Äôs made up, I feel like if we didn‚Äôt have such black and white descriptions, then we wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with the drama that comes with it. I‚Äôm a very masculine female. I was always mistaken for a boy before my boobs came in . It made me really sad at the time because I just didn‚Äôt feel like other girls. I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt dysmorphia, but a lot of people don‚Äôt fit in with one or the other. The trans issue is in your head. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll never get it. It‚Äôs not for me to get though. I still respect pronouns and I only call people their preferred names. I have respect for them, but I just wish it wasn‚Äôt such a thing.  I know I‚Äôm being insensitive though"
"He she is kinda hot"
"i disagree with your beliefs and fail to understand and empathize with how you feel and experience life but i can't really not watch the content you present  you have an interesting way of expressing yourself and in all honesty, i find your eyes very alluring and fascinating to look at. hope you keep existing and have nice and profound experiences in life  good journey"
"I only started watching your videos yesterday, but it's hard not to be inspired by you."
"I think you actually look quite normal and comfortable with the way you look, nothing weird at all."

"Do 10 situps everytime you hear gender. No gym from the next day"
"Also yas queen go off about the nebulousness of biological Sex, people are born with different chromosomes all the time, estrogen and testosterone come in plants and food, we can literally consume things to create these, anatomy can be disfigured or dysfunctional. Is a woman a person with such and such chromosomes and such and such anatomy. What if a person was born with a dysfunctional penis but functional ovaries? For some people, this isn't even a thought, but for people with people in their family and life who aren't ashamed of these things and hide them, it's the reality.   Coming from someone with doctors in the family, people are constantly born with 'defects' that we might as well not even call them defects, because parents constantly choose to ignore and hide information about their childs actual biology from them. It's still -uncommon- but the number of babies born (not a new thing btw researched for a while now) with anatomy of both sexes, and the decision to create the most passing sex of the child is a very happening thing.   My science parents really wanted me to not be ignorant on false truths, girls can be born with a vagina that looks like a dick, be born with faux testes. Like... biology is not a tool of god, it is random just like everything else that is ruled by nature."
"Woahow0pwooaohwahawhwaohaw at that ytdude saying trans pronouns aren't a thing, when he shoulda put up a picture of people saying they identify as a specific character of a tv show in a au universe where they are an anthropomorphic animal.   Like, he literally pulled up the T in the LGBTQI."
"I'm late to the party, but this is all super relevant to me now. I've had on an off gender dysphoria for a long time, and it's so confusing. Sometimes I feel like I should be a woman, sometimes I am totally confident in my masculinity. It's nice to see a video somewhere on YouTube of someone talking about this honestly, and not just denigrating the concept because it's trendy."
"Do whatever the fuck you want. Just don't get all pissed or violent when i call you him/her or whatever you want to be called before i even know you."
"I love your channel and I really appreciate your videos. BUT - I'm pretty sure mandarin does, to a very small extent, have gendered pronouns.

"So there's two sexes, but how much you conform to the norms of your sex is individual. Isn't that enough? Do we really need words to specify exactly where on that spectrum you think you are? Literally no one should give a shit, that would be progress."

"Being nonbinary is impossible unless you are born without genitalia or with both. Anyone else is just guessing and copying what they see. You may be a guy who feels like being pretty, that's ok but that doesn't make you female. Mainly because no man born with testicles can ever know what a female actually feels, due to the lack of oestrogen and 1600 other differences between males and females. What they can do is guess and reenact what they observe. Often also when trans people feel female, they exaggerate clothing and behaviour, often wearing stripper clothes or having their breast and hips enlarged, none of which is actually female but only what males would consider female.  I know, I am a female and I can go from pretty goth to swearing beer drinking nuisance. Women don't always behave like women, especially not when they amongst their own. But trans people don't see that, they think feeling female involves dresses, make up and giggling. There is so much more to being male or female than looks and behaviour, something nobody of the opposite sex will ever truly understand. Being genderqueer IMO is just wanting to emulate something you like. Good luck and all the best [you look pretty] but it's just having your cake and eat it, you are still a male."
"I‚Äôm not sorry let‚Äôs get that out. This is what‚Äôs wrong with our society now. With the transgender community being excepted now in society we now have this too. I can see it now there will no longer be a women‚Äôs section or male section of clothing but all clothing made the same with no label. Then will come all sports coed there will no longer be a mans team or women‚Äôs team. So now all our feminist are going to be out raged because they are going to lose all rights that they feel entitled to because now society has two on Weibo everybody so there will no longer be in exception of male or female anywhere this will ultimately crash our society as there will always be a group that feels left out or not excepted. I see this as a failure to our society"
"Ok honestly I like your personality but I disagree with you."
"I might come off as a hater, but I'm not, I'm honestly open for discussion and think it's more productive to have different points of view in the comments rather than just people who are naturally going to agree with most the things you say because they follow you.  So to me yes, there are only two genders and the whole idea of queerism or whatever it's called is pretty stupid.  I have two main points about this:  First of all, you have a very well defined phisical gender, aka sex. For instance, you're male. If that doesn't match your mental gender then that's a clear anomaly. Now, why are we supposed to assume that the mental gender, something aethereal and arguable is right, while the phisical, tangible, sex is wrong? If a trans has the body of a man, but the mind of a woman, what sense does it make to assume that his mind is right in wanting to change his body, rather than the other way around?  My second point is that even if I can accept the idea of gender being on a spectrum, it's pretty pointless because men and women are not that different. If we compare it to the light spectrum, it feels like male and female would be at the ends of the visible light, which is a very small portion of all light, meaning they're very close to each other. The main differences between men and women are phisical, even some emotional differences depend on hormones. So to me all this intragender stuff comes off as snowflakes wanting to feel special. How can you feel any difference in your gender when men and women, people on the opposite sides of the spectrum don't feel that different?  With all this said I truly appreciated the video, it was very informative and mature."

They are just reproducing gender stereotypes and don't even realize it."

Now with your admission in this video, it's very much like watching a successful version of myself. (Which as a vain person delights me.) So just saying thank you for your content and being a palatable translator of 'leftist ideology' and answering the what it would look like if I had become a youtube personality. Wish you all the best and thank you for sharing yourself with us."

I mean I don't understand at all how being non binary is like but I mean screw it who cares?! Half of these issues are not scientific or anything they're purely the dumbness of the English language having 2 pronouns instead of having just one.

"I just watched your most recent video your transition has been amazing to watch even if it has been in reverse. You do you girl."
"I absolutely love this video especially how you aren‚Äôt yelling at a screen to prove your point. I started realizing who I was some time ago and got a lot of hate for it, I really started to question whether I was just wrong. But growing up I started to notice that I could do and be who I wanted to be. Now I have friends who at first questioned my sanity but began to come to an understanding and are now basically my family today."
"Alright, here is my shitty hotdog biology argument. Well, first, I should make a semantics argument.  Gender is not the same thing as sex. Anyone who knows at least the rudiments of any Romance language should know this. And German speakers know that there are three genders, not two! OK, semantics over.  As for the biology argument, female hyenas, also bees, and clownfish, also amoebas."

"I fuckign love you contra! Big feels."
"Having seen your newer work, the pick-up artist video and this one: in that order. Has shown me one thing clearly: i need to watch it all. The evolution of a view and (to an only slightly lesser extend) willingness to share is really interesting to me. (especially when it's a view (of the self) i'm not directly familiar with)"
"Contra, you are one of the most inspiring YouTubers on this site. I can't directly relate as genderqueer, I'm not trans, I'm not bi, pan, or gay; I'm actually a cis, straight, male so when I say you've inspired me after watching all of your videos (and yes I've seen ALL your videos) I mean that your honesty, intellect, sensitivity, humor and overall understanding, have touched me and restored my faith in this platform. You have helped me learn so much about the beauty in this world and the people in it (while also criticizing all the dumbasses and how much longer we have left to go). You are one of the beautiful people in my life and I love you. Keep being you."

"Bigender high five!!!  Thanks for recognizing my gender.  Even my autocorrect can't do that."
"I have been pretty nasty about the gender discussion. I believed in transitioning but only two genders. I will chill out on the common folk. Anything medical or legal requiring gender expression to be reported are the only things where this stuff matters, anyway. Thanks for the great video"

"First off you don't 'drink' taxes you gently sip them in a smokey room with jazz playing in the background jeez"
"Just think back to your favorite early modern 'Queen,' David Hume. We can't postulate 'identities' or essential attributes of subjective selves. Qualia is in a state of continual flux. The post-structuralists who so frequently defend the idea of other 'genders' complain constantly about 'essentialism,' but the idea that we can have or be an 'identity' sounds an awful lot like essentialism to me.   So there aren't 'genders' at all, just feelings, inclinations, or if you prefer Humean language, 'passions.' You're a man because man is biological. If you have a penis, your morphological sex is male, if you have testicles, your gonadal sex is male, if you have XY chromosomes, your chromosomal sex is male, and all these things usually correspond with one another in the same person. You might feel feminine, and you might even be neurobiologically predisposed to feel that way due to androgen insensitivity or exposure to abnormal androgen levels in the womb, but you're physically a man.  That said, your sense of humor and intellect are both amazing (more proof you're a man, sorry) and I love your videos."

"You're still a 'mayn', and always will be.  Otherwise, my gynandromorphilia and guydyke/girlfag-ness don't make sense. ;-)   We need terms to describe ourselves, and the foundation to build them is 'The Binary'.  Sex and gender are synonyms, and there are only two: male and female.  The fact that a wild variation exists,  or that it's sometimes difficult to classify, doesn't mean there are infinite genders.  It means there are infinite ways for the two genders to be manifested, IOW 'gender expressions'.  Think of the yin/yang symbol in the Taoist context.  Terms like 'genderqueer' are an attempt to describe one's 'gender expression' (You used that term once in your video, demonstrating that you grasped the concept, yet still managed to conflate expression with actual gender the rest of the time).  Some people use gender descriptors or labels as shortcuts to describe multiple dimensions of their sexuality (gender, gender expression, orientation, interests, preferences, etc.) all at once.  I understand why it's tempting to do that.  Those long Greek, scientific words are clumsy."
"It took me a long time, way to long , to realize I was much like you or how you describe your feelings on your own gender at least. I always felt this abundance of both in my thoughts, even leaning towards fem in a lot of ways. I sort of tired leaning into both, trying to 'choose one,' but in the end found that I didn't want to part with either...and being the self-righteous asshole I am, I decided I didn't have to. It's nice to see I wasn't the only one however that's gone though a sort of 'building process' of sorts to reach the Queer marker. Though even now I find it really hard sometimes to have the energy to shave, put on makeup and be brave in even somewhat fem clothing in public."
"I‚Äôve always supported LGBT community, but I would be lying if I wasn‚Äôt completely clear on the subject. This video was a great explanation , and I have definitely learned from it"

"The comments are much nicer than I expected, wow.  Anyhow, I'm nonbinary, more specifically agender though I usually just say nonbinary and anyone who actually gives a shit can ask for that specification. I like that bit about being a 'political woman' because while it's not how I personally identify I understand that when people look at me they see tits and assume I'm a girl and treat me like one. I'd never heard that terminology before"

"I just cant help but think: so what? I am certainly not a transphobe (although some people will obviously think I am), but i allways think, what is all the fuzz about?  If you say gender is a purly social construct, i would disagree, but i would accept that it is partially a social construct and i think it ultimatly doesnt matter. My problem is, that I have the feeling a lot of people are out in the world trying to be offended. If someone wants me tell call them he/she/it, i certainly will and i have never met a person, who wont. But when it comes to Toiletts and refering to people in official dokuments and stuff I think it really is practical to keep it binary. Beside the point that the vast majority of people are in fact binary (well over 99%) i just dont see the harm for nonbinary. To expect everyone to learn a new way of reffering to people, so that a very small minority is not called by a gender they dont feel like, is asking a bit much I think. If you care, tell people to call you anything you like and they probably will. But I wont refer to a person as xi or anything like it in the chance, that the person is binary, because empirical when i see someone who looks like a woman, i call them she. If that person doenst like to be called she, i apologize and call them whatever they want to be called like. Where is the problem?  About the toilets I just fail to see how anyone would think it will be practical. Most people who will object to genderneutral toilets are women. Sexual confilct (lets call it that for a lack of a better word) will be inevitable. As a man, i dont want women to walk by, when i am at the urinal. These things will cause way more discomfort to the vast majority of the people, than it would for a nonbinary person to just choose one toilet. Noone is asking you to show off your penis, when entering a mans toilet. So what is the deal? When you look like a woman, than go to a womans toilet, if you look like a man, go to a mans toilet. If you look like someone in between, just go anywhere and you will be fine. Opening a third toilet for nonbinary is just not useful given that at any given facility there will probably be to few nonbinary people, who will use it.  As for the passport. It refers to your sex, that is something different than your gender.  So i seriously dont see why everyone is making a big deal about that. I am not saying, that LBTQ rights are not important, i am saying, that it is counterproductive to try to force policys that are just not helping anyone. Most people will out of reflex be against it."

"life lesson: there aren't only two of ANYTHING."
"How is it scientifically a fact that there are only two genders? Psychological research on the development of children shows that the roles we teach children, to be either a boy or a girl, are directing them to develop in a specific direction. This may either give purpose and clarity or a sense of 'not fitting in', but most importantly, it limits the choices they have in regards to how they solve problems, express themselves etc. Children that grow up more androgynous tend to be more creative then those who are told: 'A boy/girl doesn't do that'. (Of course, the right genes are important here too.) This clearly shows that we are not just biologically determined (which, btw, who thinks that?!) and there is more to how identity is shaped and how it influences us.

Also you said something about english pronouns being used to differently for males and females, which are sexes and not genders. So why have any other pronouns at all if they only describe sexes and not genders?"

"i've tried over the years (as the poster boy for boring, white, cys, blue collar men) to understand things like bisexuality and gender-non-binary, but i really never have been able to get my head around it.  not to say that matters at all, i think people should do what they want and everybody gets the same rights no matter who they are, regardless of my opinions on the subject.  but i've had friends who identify as bi or trans or other things, and i have a trans niece now, so i continue to try to understand like a dog who can't see rainbows.  if we're not in one now, i'd say there's definitely a war ahead on these issues, and you probably have a lot more allies than you think.  but it's easier to understand something you're living than it is for someone looking at it from outside the proverbial glass box.  i came here from your Jordan Peterson video, which managed to be both insightful and childish, and both profoundly fair and unfair to the guy at the same time (binarism!).  JP has definitely gone down the rabbit hole on his own agenda, but the only reason i ever noticed him is he tends to spearhead his points on trans-activism with the idea of free speech. i'm a vicious free-speech advocate.  and i mean it in the legitimate, first amendment way too, because he contends that the Canadian government is creating lawful punishment for people don't adopt the plethora of terms for ..  i'm not even sure what the wording is, 'queer'?  i can't imagine any wording that won't get me angry looks.  i'm an American, so i'm not overly concerned with Canadian laws, but i'd say a sticking point for people like me is being forced to do something.  that can go down a bad path and i think it's counter-productive.  and i understand the swinging pendulum of social justice argument, i'm just generally against it, which is unfortunately my privilege.  so i'm going to dive into more of your videos, the alt-right one is up next.  my brother says he's alt-right now, and my family are all trump supporters.  maybe your video can give me a way to deal with them other than fire and fury (hashtagcallback)"

"I'm sorry, but biological sex in homo sapiens is strictly binary. And don't give me that intersex crap. Intersex humans are people with a medical condition, sometimes it's harmless, but some intersex people are unable to pee normally or are born sterile or worse. It is not a third gender.  However, gender. idc identify as whatever you feel like, but don't undermine biological facts with your propaganda. We can be equal and queen, it doesn't have to be 'natural' to be okay. So don't pretend like it is natural. And I'm only talking about the sex here, not gender identity"

"How fucking fucked up are you? There is a only two genders you fucktard. Born in the wrong body? You were born either a male or female. Genitalia will match your gender always. If not. You are a sexist. Meaning  if you dress like a woman.  you say women arnt equal to men. Or men arnt equal to women. By describing your own gender by anything other then your genitals it affirms that you want the opposite sexs' disposition. And for what ever reason you prove that pronouns give you an advantageous embodiment of youself. Youre a fucking disaster of self. News flash No one gives a fuck about your body.. it will wither and die like everyother human in history or your clothes for that matter.  You are a cross dresser. You are dressed like a woman. (Because you want to be.) That doesnt make you any other gender. Your own tombstone will be your legacy.    And yes,  you can choose any pronoun you'd like on the epitaph.

"How the fuck can you be 'trans' or 'transqueer' or whatever the fuck you claim you are? You are absolutely not feminine at all. Your voice is deep, your mannerisms are male, like what the fuck?

"Oh... and PLEASE... we've seen this on YouTube before... don't make the horrible mistake of cutting parts of yourself off waaaay too soon! Sexuality and identity shifts and changes throughout life. PLEASE don't make the mistake that you can't take back. We've seen people do bottom surgery after less than 2 years ... only to have them report that it that didn't work.  Having the original plumbing gives you options ... especially seeing as you like vagina.  But more ... what animates life?  All this discussion about AI becoming a 'living being'... as if an machine that can calculate information can ever acquire this thing we call a 'soul' .... something science fails to quantify... and the thing we know not if it existed before we were in the womb. There are gifts and talents BEYOND the physical ... that historically 'Trans' people brought ... that will be needed again."
"Ah. 'The Problem.' 1.) Geneticist commonly remark that if there were only two genders, humans would have died out while still in the trees.  2.) Clearly there ARE more than two genders because ... what are Intersex People?? How can we say that 'when a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out between 1.7% and as high as 2% of live births.' (Unfortunately, these poor kids who 'came from God' that way are usually butchered to make their genitalia look like one gender or the other... rendering them confused and pain ridden for the rest of their lives.)  3.) Gender ... as with sexuality... can be a product of Nature AND Nurture. (Enter Foucault's Theory of Sexuality: He believed only 10% if the population was born PURELY Homosexual... and only 10% were born purely Heterosexual .... leaving the remaining 80% to have culture, and Early Childhood Development to imprint upon the child.... by the way, have you ever noticed that the more Macho and religiously oppressive a culture is... the more Transgender and effeminate males it produces?)  4.) JESUS when asked about Eunuchs (... the Biblical equivalent of Transgender) He replied: ...11'Not everyone can accept this word,' Jesus answered, 'but only those to whom it has been given. 12For there are eunuchs who were born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.' ~ Matthew 19:12  JESUS... JeZUSE ... said it... and that's not good enough for the Bible Thumpers (... who have no clue what those books really mean... nor what 'Jesus' is.. but I digress...) This is also said to be the only thing 'Jesus' said about Homosexuality.  (The religion of Duality ... lumps them together in the minds of those taught by fear not to study to hard...)  5.) This brings us to what I feel is the most interesting aspects: ..............(a)  Why is Hermaphroditus (the Hermaphrodite) such an important Archetype in the human psyche? ..............(b)  Why was 'God' represented as being of both sexes? ..............(c)  Why are the Angels said to be of both genders?   6.) And now... the LONG history of 'Two-Spirits' ... Shamans, Witch Doctors... Root Women... etc... and other indigenous healers who were either considered Transgender or went through initiation rites of living as the opposite gender for at least a year before they could be a true Shamanic Healer?   7.)  Intersecting 'Orthogonal' elements of body, psyche... and whatever it is that animates life... is said to be a better way of describing gender, sexuality, and identity rather than a 'Spectrum.'   8.) Was Leonardo da Vinci just a bisexual cross dresser? It's said that if Michelangelo had been straight, he'd have painted the Sistine Chapel, Flat White.   Out of chaos comes order. Out of ignorance comes a Renaissance that lifts consciousness.  Right now, we can't keep running into the horrors of Manifest Destiny. The same thinking that has us running towards extinction cannot be the thinking that saves us.   9.) We're leaving the muscular Age of Pisces and entering the feminine Age of Aquarius. No one should fear it. Only ignorant homophobes attack the obvious."

"Chinese does have gendered pronouns, just not phonetically. They sound the same, but post-simplification saw a written distinction between masculine and feminine pronouns, with no gender-neutral alternative except for 'it', which, when written, doesn't remotely resemble the 'human' pronouns.  he+she: ‰ªñÔºãÂ•π it: ÂÆÉ"
"I don‚Äôt think you should have to conform to gender rules at all, but dressing in stereotypically female clothing doesn‚Äôt make you a new gender. Can‚Äôt we just accept males cross dressing? It doesn‚Äôt biologically make you a new gender though. No disrespect, do you."

"Doesn't a collectivist label go against the idea that everyone experiences this generalized notion differently, especially when there's 4 of them that are used seemingly interchangeably? What exactly is being defined when someone says they're agendered, considering all that seems to be discussed when the topic is brought up to specific people is a list of things they are not instead of what they are.  Also, is it a genderqueer position that clothing and presentation are made up of things that are implicitly or explicitly gendered?"
"The chromosomes and anatomy not being strictly binary is where you already lost me.   Chromosomes: XY or XX. Binary.  Anatomy: Penis and Vagina. Binary.   I can take these science deniers. If you don't get the facts right first your argument is already weakened."
"I'm getting old. I was taught at uni muchof this as stuff in biological terms, including genetical stuff such as when people grow two penises or has a dick for a clit. Transgender people were fighting *for their right to get treatment* at the time which medically was obviously their right.  Now it's not a medical issue. *It's an identity issue and maybe even a cultural one* no less... People demand to be addressed as this or that, laws are being created to enforce it and safe spaces at unis proliferate in case someone just calls you a she or a he. I totally agree that you shouldn't need to justify yourself at all, cause really WHO CARES?? We're all individuals in individualistic societies, we should have mastered live and let live by now. I also get that you want your identity held to a high standard.   At the same time this whole thing with language and oppression and so on... It's a nope for me. As much as I got into screaming arguments to defend bi and homosexuality when I was younger and sexual preference was the issue, this just feels waaay too convoluted for me. I'm filled with intellectual and emotional laziness about it all, I think mostly due to how it's been done or portrayed. Rooting for each one of you I'd say, but I just cannot care about the movement you're trying to set in motion as a minority group."

The first few times you heard about nonbinary it sounded like a bunch of made-up nonsense to you too. That's because it is; gender ideology created this, and your transformation from 'this is made up nonsense' to 'I'm this!' was gender ideology. You would not even consider being like this otherwise."

"There are XX men! There are XY women! There are people with neither of those, like people with  Turner's Syndrome. FURTHER, everyone starts off intergender. The default gender is female+the ducts that would allow the testes to drop. Hormones then modify this... unless you happen to be immune to one of the hormones.  Intersex is a biological reality. 'It's biological fact' is a bad argument."

'Thank you, doctor'üòÇüòÇ But it's kinda pathetic why people care so much and why there is this desperate need for other people to fit into neat categories and how upset they get when that's not the case. Why do they care what another person identifies as as long as they're not hurting other people? I don't get it..."
"all gender is a feeling. and how you see yourself. like how there is a gender relating to the scarry things or the Gothic aesthetic   i am told anything not cis is trans.  nb is trans, agender is trans.  some say gender is the 'sex of the brain'  what about neurogenders? like genders only for people with NPD or Autism?  or genders only for otherkin, like the angels and therianthropes.  wouldn't being dragongender automatically be gender queer?  on some things I've seen, the afabs who are not girly girl, automatically think they might be not cis.  there is a gender relating to feeling disgusted with themself. I think. there is dread  and anxiety relating genders   is there is a difference between that, and dysmorphia?  there is a gender about having a lot of genders. you can even make up a new term, if you call it melangegender! and it won't be pangender or omnigender or anything else like it."
"I thought you were assigned female at birth at first so stfu"
"The problem I have with non-binary is that it has a few presuppositions that I don't believe have been proven. In order to be non-binary is must assume that binary things can be avoided or eliminated by human endeavors: namely that it is a 'social construct' and not a natural quality of the world. I would disagree and say that the binary nature of the world, namely the idea of opposites exists in nature and more specifically in our very nature philosophically. From and existentialist perspective the ability to negate is at the core of human beings. The word has shape and form because we are able to distinguish and create disparate, This is not that. The chair in my house in not the chair in your house. This approving or rejecting of a concept is the binary negation build into us. No you may wonder what this has to do with Male and Female and gender. The argument I am making is that since it is not our conscious choice to produce a binary it can not be dismissed consciously. It can of course be ignored, which is what I think gender non-binary people are doing. This would, however, be similar to pretending that our drive for sex and our fear of death is a conscious choice and I can choose not to be drive by sex or scared of death.   The other idea I would take issue with is that people's perceptions of themselves are accurate. Since poor Freud and Jung have fallen out of favor and the cognitive behaviors came into the picture people have been believing that they know why they do things. The truth is, just because you think something is the case about you does make it true. This also does not mean other necessarily know you better then you. There is that idea that you can see a splinter in someone else's eye but not the tree truck in your own. This does not somehow mean, though, that others should tell you that you need to conform to male or female.   There is not good answer to the question, the idea is that there are things outside of our control, the binary nature of our own existence and consciousness and that we tend to create similar patterns unconsciously and thus have very little hope to address it. My opposition to acceptance of the notion of non-binary is not about the person expressing themselves but that somehow if you express something in opposition to the reality that is constructed others need to alter the perceptions that did not even choose to produce in order to accommodate your feeling. The true is life sucks, it is not designed to make us happy or be fair and though he strive to make it more fair as well we should, to fool ourselves into thinking we can actually make it fair is foolish and simple minded. The problem is some on the left (I count myself as liberal) only pay lip service to this notion and secretly harbor the hope that one day things will be fair. I am too much of an existentialist and a realist men and women will never be equal, we are more similar then different but we have innate difference that will always affect us. Pretending we don't, pretending that we constructed them so we can fix them or pretending we can destroy them will not work and will get us no closer to helping figure out how to manage the difference that advantage and disadvantage both sexes in various ways."

"So, explain why animals have only two sexes? And they preform the acts of a male or female. Let me guess your dog thinks he is a cat so a gendercat for the dog? You can name them Catdog, or Dogcat or  Walking my cat name dog title of a song.    So, the Chinese  (8:51) (Pronouns) do not have gender pronouns but Japanese language there is words and how things are said by women only or men only. That is why when an American service members who dates a Japanese women and learns the language are talking like a Japanese women very feminine.  'The Japanese language has some words and some grammatical constructions that are associated with men or boys, while others are associated with women or girls. Such differences are sometimes called 'gendered language'. So that is out there.  I don't care if you are a man and wear a dress, I see it as a transvestite like Dr. Frank N Futer in The Rocky Horror Picture show. I loved Tim Curry as him.

"Contra:; What you say is partially true; you conflate the differences between genetic sex, gender sexuality with Bell curve outliers and not the mean in order to extrapolate that gender is culturally created.  Great videos, btw.  You are brilliant, but biased, as are we all."
"Nah, you're just a dude with a weak sense of identity."
"Let's be honest, aren't most nonbinary people kinda weird and freakish anyway? I mean, i say this as a nonbinary person who has difficulty self-identifying as 'human'--oh hey, that even showed up in this video! Hey, neat, my identity is being attacked on the internet!  Now where was i? Right, i think you've gotta be willing to cast aside societal norms and be willing to be a little weird and queer to identify as nonbinary. Not that i'd ever say that to the anti-feminists/TERFs/anti-SJWs/fash in general. They don't get to call me weird."
"You are adorable."
"Genuine and honest üòä loved it"
"So this is weird. I am a fan of Peterson and Shapiro. But I like the clarity of your videos. I probably have points to argue, but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is I have to deal with my dysphoria in my intellectual non-binary approach to gender. The arguments around gender identities don‚Äôt really hold with my 50+ years of accepting and rejecting ideological positions. But your right to respect as an individual is at the core of your existence and I tip my hat to you. So ‚Äúdon‚Äôt dream it, be it‚Äù Now stop smashing sausages."

"At 10:27 . Have any nomenclature you like. But don't expect the world at large to be :  A.   Automatically cognizant of it at all times  or B. Think it is part of some demonic plot to erase you from society  How about this as a strategy to deal with normie-mangling of pronouns. Imagine they are mishearing your accent and think you are from another state or country (I am Irish and have a very peculiar South East Ireland dialect and I am continuously assumed to be Northern Irish or even English sometimes) it's a bit of a pain sometimes but sometimes it can be a topic of conversation.  Incidentally there are no normies. Everyone is a freak on some level to a greater or lesser extent."
"Sometimes I wonder if reincarnation can be a factor in why a percentage of people identify with the gender not of their body, or both, etc?       If you've had the majority of your experiences in a particular gender, and then for some reason decided to switch it up, chances are, subconsciously, you'd probably still identify some with the other gender.         Switching gears some, there is a concept I've come across in some spiritual/metaphysical oriented sources that indicate as a Soul evolves more and more CONSCIOUSLY to it's original, Source/Oneness/pure Love state, that it becomes more and more merged/balanced between consciousness oriented Yin/Feminine and Yang/Masculine.        There is the infamous meeting in one of Bob Monroe's last book, 'Ultimate Journeys' where during one of his OBE's, he asks his guidance if he could meet the most spiritually developed/mature human living in his space/time reference.  The person he was led to, at first, he couldn't tell if they were a man or a woman as they seemed to be perfectly balanced and merged between these."

Mutt signed urinals that identify as Uranians and gay traps, and third-gender undocumented Latrino outhouses for Muxes with a crescent sun on the door and for guevedoces with a blood moon on the door that become lunagenderfluid during eclipse season, and I want it to accommodate attack, transport and recon as well as Three-Spirit helicopters of every tribe (including the W√§lkures of the Nazi tribe) by placing it inside a mosque (where attack helicopters dump their loads)  that doubles as a cram school for overbearing recon-gender helicopter parents and triples as a black bloc hideout so transportgender helis can give them free helicopter rides.  Oh and don't forget adult-sized baby change trays for babygendered individuals who were assigned male or female at birth despite identifying as a baby, and continuing to identify as a baby even at toilet training age.  But make sure that the handicapped stalls are tiny because large stalls are triggering unless they identify as a wheelchair. And make sure the tampon dispenser includes ultra-skinny tampons for that one gender that bleeds out of their penis.  And include urinals that identify as men with micropeens.  And make sure that the stall for Hijras has instructions on how to poo in a first-world loo, written in every language that uses Devanagari or Tamil script but not in English so as to prevent the baizuo from appropriating the Hijra gender."

"In May 2016, I sat down with a pint of raw ether and streamed Trump rallies for several hours, huffing from a washcloth, until all the ether was gone. In my altered state, I was no longer in a position to understand coherent thoughts. But my emotional self was still fully intact. It was the perfect state for understanding the Trump phenomenon.   I felt a warm glow toward the man and the crowd. Trump seemed like a masterful conductor, bringing together a symphony of emotion and chanting from the audience. With every gesture, the crowd responded. He went on and on, conducting surges of positive emotion towards various local businessmen (rarely - but not never - women), veterans, and even ordinary Joes who had done something above and beyond to show their support. Along with, of course, all the politicians who had supported him. Negative emotions were even more expertly beamed at politicians who had dissed him, and at groups of his opponents. There was plenty of vitriol for the elites of the country, along with liberals in general. The overwhelming emotion, though, was not hate. It almost kind of felt like love. Love for all the people who supported him through thick and thin, who were part of this movement. Even love for those few minorities and LGBT people who supported him.   ...and then I had an empty bottle of ether, and the rag was dry, and it was 4:30 am, and I was naked, and the orange guy started not making sense again. I think I was naked because it felt better that way. Pretty sure I wasn't jacking off. But not like 100% sure.  If anything, Hunter S. Thompson underplayed what ether is like. It is one hell of a drug. Highly recommended, and you have good taste: it is by far the best drug for understanding kekistanis."
"This video needs more views."
"The thing is all of this seems incredibly incoherent to me. If you care to explain... From what I heard and read about the whole gender theory, the first premisse is that sex and gender are not the same and are not necessarily correlated. Sex is a set of physical attributes while gender is something ill defined along the lines of the set of roles, expected behaviours, manners, fashions, etc that we have attributed to one sex or the other but that we supposedly shouldn't have because that's limiting and leaves out those who don't want to conform to what's been assigned to their sex. So sex would be something physical while gender would be something social. I think you also added psychological there. To address the incoherences so far: As to the psychological side of gender, it has been studied that there are in fact many psychological traits that manifest themselves in your personality, way of acting and reacting that are strongly correlated with your sex and that you can verify cross-culturally. So to say that there is no correlation between sex and gender is either false or gender doesn't mean what you say it means. There seems to be a very strong correlation and perhaps it's not even clear that there is a distinction at all. And this does make sense on a biological level. Men and Women are born with different physical attributes and different roles (at least in terms of reproduction) and it seems obvious that they would've evolved differently on a psychological level too. For example, being that women are born with the capacity of having babies, it seems that empathy would be a trait more useful to someone taking care of something as fragile as a baby. Men are born with more physical strength, making them capable of hunting and fighting, if only they had a bit more of aggression than women. So our personalities are also evolved, not just a social construct, and are pretty correlated with our sex. This is not to say that there is no variation and that you can't be an empathetic man or an aggressive woman. And now, on the social level: either there is something intrinsic about social norms that correlates them to sex or social norms are just social constructs with no inherent link to sex. Now if there is an intrinsic link between social norms and sex, then it once again becomes less clear to me that there is even a distinction between gender and sex, or at least that they're not correlated. But if social norms are just social constructs, then why do some people feel the need to change their sex to match their social code of preference? Isn't it incoherent to say that sex and gender are not correlated and at the same time lining up with transexuals who not only adopt the socially defined parameters of the other genders but also change their sex to match them?! Why match them if there's no match to begin with? Or insisting on being treated with the opposite pronoun when these pronouns were made to distinguish between sexes (and not genders, since all of these theories weren't around)?? Not only do I adopt the posture, manners, fashions, etc of the other gender but I also alter my body to match them, by the correlation 'wrongfully' imposed by society, and demand to be called whatever people are calling to people of that sex, while supposedly sex and gender are unrelated... It seems to me that there is both a strong insistence on breaking the ties between sex and gender and a strong insistence in aligning the things that define you sex with your adopted gender. But on to the point that confuses me the most: if the social aspects of genders are SOCIAL, that is, artificial, transmitted and learned, changeable through time and geographically, etc, HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN YOU TRULY ARE A MAN/WOMAN?! You LEARNED and ADOPTED these aspects! You were not born with a preference for dresses or pants, long hair or short hair, make up or no make up, etc! How can you say 'this is who I really am'? Or 'I'm a man in a woman's body'? Social norms are NOT who you really are! What do they matter and why do you insist on them being YOU? If the social norm was that men wore dresses, I'd wear a dress! If it was the social norm that men would wear pink, I'd wear pink! What does it matter to me?! That's no who I AM, that's what I put on and says NOTHING relevant about me! I wasn't born with that and it doesn't change a dime! And same thing applies to you! You could be born before dresses were invented or after they were extinct! There is nothing in you that says that who you really are is someone who wears dresses! That's a choice, that's a construct, that ABSOLUTELY extrinsic. It boggles me how people try to identify so hard with these minor things! You are how you act in the world."
"Quick correction, at 8:51 you say 'In some langauges, like Chinese, there are no gendered pronouns.' This statement is actually false, Chinese does contain gendered pronouns. However they are all pronounced the same as Ta (first tone), so it is indistinguishable in the spoken langauge. These are the seperate types:  ‰ªñ (he, it contains the male radical, ‰∫∫Ôºàren) , on the left),  Â•π (she, it contains the female radical, Â•≥ (nu), on the left) and ÂÆÉ (meaning it)"

"I'm a transgender guy who has had a hard time with understanding and being open with genderqueer identities. I've found a lot of hostility from Trans groups, especially ones with NB people, as a more binary trans man. I think that manifested in me as a deterrence from nonbinary people, and a myopic view on them. I too thought they were just afabs that wanted to be part of the trans community, so they adopt that label without any dysphoria. But this video has helped me a little understand better...   I know this video is old, but I have a question for you, if you read comments. What do you feel about 'transtrenders', ie, the idea that there are people that claim transgender status for the acceptance into the community? At one point I felt they were everywhere and felt hurt they were co-opting trans language and identity when they were simply gender non conforming. Now I feel that that's maybe an unkind fallacy. Do you have an opinion on this?"

There is nothing inbetween that's not a chromosomal aberration. Feminine man is enough. Masculine woman is enough. Crossdresser is also good enough. It's also kind of demanding to wish the general populace's widespread cognition and acceptance of a group of people at the fringes who clearly present non standard behaviour.

"holy shit, the girl going 'WHAT IF YOU DONT IDENTIFY AS A HUMAN' and like... mmmmm but thats me to an extent. My experience in gender is just 'I dont even feel like a real human how can i identify with their made up identities' So I've undergone hormones to make me more androgynous and got top surgery, because having sex characteristics at all made me feel disgusting and self hating. I did, in fact, have to fucking feed my surgeon this story about how I was really a man and I had to go on hormones in order to get the surgery I needed to feel okay in my body, even if I wouldn't have necessarily gone on them in the first place. I now present as male even though 'he' pronouns still give me a little bit of dysphoria-- I don't want to illicit violence from confused people who feel like they have a right to know what I 'really' am... all that aside im now addicted to your videos. every single one of em make me want to stand up and applaud.

"It sounds like your saying that what makes you who you are is those that you are similar with around you?

I wrote a wall of text on another one of your videos already regarding the gender of the psyche versus the gender of your body and well, the psyche is both and it's a lot more fluid than your body will ever be. I'm very similar to you physically, a slender 60kg, 6'2', long-haired blond. Blue eyes in my case. The masculine and feminine aspects of my psyche are well integrated because of years of inner alchemy, and while I suppose my feminine aspects suffer from dysphoria occasionally, my masculine aspects do that too since I'm fairly androgynous, much like yourself. I wouldn't actually do anything surgical to your body, just have fun with how you express yourself‚Äîwhich is pretty much what you do anyway by the looks of it. More than I've ever done. I suppose I look like a male elf right out of LotR and that's good enough for me. Okay. I'll confess, sometimes I'd like to play with blue eye shadow, but that's the wine talking.  Something I would advocate for androgynous men who want to play with their gender expression is to not give up being a man, but rather expand the territory of how men can present themselves. I'm pretty tired of men having to be boring to be acceptable while women get so much more creative freedom. Guys like David Bowie were big heroes of mine because he made it okay to be a beautiful man. Same with a lot of the '80s glam. One of the saddest things I read about the supermodel Andrej Pejic was when he transitioned, because there needs to be more outrageously beautiful men in the world who aren't scared to be remain men. It just seems like there's this message, 'you're too beautiful, you have to become a woman', if you happen to be a very beautiful androgynous man. It's annoying. There should be stunning men everywhere, but it seems like they're not allowed to be that. That really is the wine talking. That's what I get for drinking on an empty stomach. Anyway, stay awesome."
"Don‚Äôt loathe yourself. I think you‚Äôre awesome."
"I love you so much thanks for being you and for the video boo üòò"
"So you are a gender non conforming man"
"The sad part is that anyone that doesn't understand or don't want  to understand will probably overlook this video, already extremely confident in their ways."
"you are an subhuman not an genderqueer"
"üñ§üñ§üñ§"
"Tfw you're the only sane person in the comment section. What ive noticed about people like this is that they act like anyone who doesnt have the same views as them is 'uneducated'. The whole LGBT acceptance thing recently started about 5 years ago, and ive noticed many of them getting upset the whole world hasnt converted to their views. Its peoples choices if they would like to respect your pronouns or not. Dont force your views on other people."
"yes please!"
"people are stupid. (flat earthr's best example) so people that think they are genderqueer on non-whatever in my eyes are the same. waste of space imo u are funny but ur ideas r stupid."
"Mentally ill commie living off Capitalism and denying science . The stupid is great in this one  ha ha ha ."
"I think the They pronoun is the only thing that bothers me. They already has a defnition which cant simply be removed. I cannot replace they went to the station with we went to the station as I clearly am not among the group who went there. Now if I am refering to two or more gender queer people they is perfectly fine. But what about a singular gender queer person. I think we need a pronoun for that because as it stand the only singular pronoun we have without gender is it. And I definitely think it would come off as cruel and demeaning to refrence any person as it. I reserve that for Donald Trump alone. It wants to build a border wall for example. Is there a pronoun for 1 gender queer person which can be used in replacement for he or she?"
"If people would wear a button with their pronoun/s, self-identification that would help..... then no one has to be unintentionally offensive nor offended."
"I just fell in love with you. Thank fuck you made this video."
"'I don't want to surrender my male attributes'. Then you don't suffer from dysphoria, you are confused man. That's all."
"You're 6'2?  Do u wanna PM me maybe?"
"Your story sounds exactly like mine..."
"I love your dress!"
"Good to see more people who are like me. :)"
"The 'scientific explanation of gender' absolutely killed me. Love your vids"
"Radical LARPing is still strong in this one. Can you just admit that you are roleplaying a woman? I mean its okay with me, but saying that you were 'always' a woman, or that you 'essentialy' are one, is simply wrong and gets you into 'essentialism'. I dont think you wanna go that route..."
"Biological sex is nebulous? 'LOL. It isn't.  It's factual and straightforward.  You are a man.  Nothing nebulous about that.  You like to wear socially constructed attire that women sometimes do. And no, you cannot change your chromosomes. But pray tell, if you have, let us know. But we all know you haven't.   Tell us more Mr. Science!!"
"Explain to me why 40% of transgender individuals kill themselves."
"Am I the only one distracted by the creepy doll in the background?"
"Hmmmmm what is thi- AHHHHHHHHHHHH I DONT UNDERSTANDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
"Hahahaha üòÇ the banjo duel,...funny and appropriate hahaha üëçüòÇ."
"Thank you for posting this video! I can relate so much to you. PS.: I totally agree that we should embrace your freakish side, take it from my own user name."
"Ok, so this video is doing an amazing job at explaining gender in its modern interpretation and all. But can we PLEASE talk about that creepy doll in the background for a moment? Good, bc it's freaking me the fuck out. It's just sitting there, behind that half closed door (which it probably opened on its own) and staring right through the camera into the deepest depths of my soul."
"Alright, I‚Äôm gonna say that I really don‚Äôt agree with your outlook on gender and feminism but this being the first video I have ever watched of your made me realize something. You seem like a genuinely fun person to be around, like I‚Äôd want to be friends with you if we had met in like high school or something. I may not agree with you, but you are so much more self aware than a lot of people who consider themselves in the same place as you."
"Edgy adults are real too."
"anyone else feeling extreme anxiety regarding that doll in the background/??????"
"Oh, my god how can this be funny and educational at the same time? I fucking love you."
"Fantastic! New subscriber here. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•"
"So you're a feminine man? Listen, I don't care what yourself as. But, when people like you want to get the law involved to go into women's bathrooms, shelters, prisons, locker rooms etc etc.... Then we have a problem"
"I don't even know you, but I love you! Thank you for this video."
"whats that pink dot"
"I didn't realize I had watched this  video before until I saw the hotdog and bun part and then realized I must have blotted it out in my memory because that was pretty upsetting/disturbing for me. Nothing against other parts of the video, but I didn't like that bit."
"Actually, in Chinese he and she are pronounced the same, but they are written differently.  I love your top by the way."
"cool"
"Wow, wonderful video! I will share this with everyone I know because it‚Äôs so important to open people‚Äòs narrow minds. I will continue fighting for everyone and everything queer although I‚Äôm (probably) straight myself.. Keep up the good work!"
"I thought you were an atheist. But you‚Äôre asking people to listen to the thoughts and feelings of people to prove something? That makes no sense. If you‚Äôre ‚Äúgenderqueer‚Äù then that should be easily accessible via your chromosomes and/or brain scans. Like, I can prove to you I‚Äôm male. It‚Äôs a pretty simple test.   If you‚Äôre trying to explain that you like having sex with boys and girls, that‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs bisexual. If you feel more feminine (female) than masculine (male), no one is surprised by that because you‚Äôre bisexual.   Now...if you FEEL like something...that‚Äôs not relevant at all to any version of worthwhile society. You want to get sex reassignment surgery? Go ahead. It‚Äôs your body. Want to sleep with men and women? Go ahead. Adult decisions. People can think you‚Äôre weird. Who cares? Is that what this is about? ‚ÄúStop thinking I‚Äôm weird!‚Äù Have you watched your videos? Lol You obviously don‚Äôt care if people think you‚Äôre weird...so what‚Äôs the issue? This just feels like a bunch of people shouting and waving their hands ‚ÄúLOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!!‚Äù"
"The fact that you had to spend the time to make a 17 Min video to explain a gender goes to show your delusional! Your a man. That likes men. That‚Äôs that. Not no twisted 17 Min long definition....  of what you think you are. Your a man. Nothing wrong with it, but don‚Äôt expect the world to bend at your feet."
"from one freakish hybrid to another ...the doll creeps me out !"
"Thank u for this video, I was trying to understand the 'made up genders' some time ago by looking on tumblr cause I assumed what better way to give them a genuine shot than tumblr where they reside.But t was all very vague and non clear at all...Like people saying 'wow queerFairy98, your invented pronoun exactly represent my gender!' without actually explaining what they feel...point is, it just sounded like a made up teen angst fantasy, even when i tryed to open my hearth to it.But your way of explaining it really put in perspective, and in a way i could understand."
"You called yourself a ‚Äúfreakish hybrid‚Äù but queer means freak so you just called yourself a queer hybrid"
"This is the most inspiring video I have ever seen.  I needed this.  :)"
"omg love"
"Haha i was inspired anyway take that"
"I've always been kinda iffy on the whole genderqueer thing because I used to go to an LGBT youth center where it seemed like every other person would suddenly decide they were non-binary after a few weeks so it always seemed like more of a trend that a real thing. Then the people who seemed to genuinely not identify with the binary seemed to also have some crippling self-esteem issues and anxiety issues. Like it almost seemed like they saw themselves as non-binary as a way to disassociate from themselves. To be fair, that's probably just some psychobabble I came up with from reflecting on times when I felt violently uncomfortable in my own skin. I guess I accept non-binary as a valid identity but I'm hesitant to believe every other teen with colorful hair and a nose ring is going to keep this label for the rest of their lives."
"god that doll is creeping me the fuck out"
"I literally LOVE YOU, Fuck the haters! I'm Gender Queer also!"
"I fucking relate to that video"
"I would like to see you analyse this vid as well.   It is one of my favourites among your older work."
"I identify as V1000 Advance Premium Canon Laser Printer."
"thats a cute ass shirt"
"I'm honestly just pissed that I didn't come across your channel sooner. also your makeup skills are better than mine and I am LIVING for it. This satire mixed with philosophical truth and such is honestly the best."
"After I was forced to move to Russia, one of the difficulties for me was that Russian actually has no non-binary pronouns at all. Not even for situations where you don't know a person's gender. You're just supposed to use 'he'. So, when I talk about my genderqueer friends in Russian, I actually do the rapid-fire switching between 'he' and 'she', which confuses the shit out of people. Trying to explain why I'm doing it certainly doesn't make it any better, but you gotta start somewhere."
"Came here to understand this topic since I've been seeing it come up a fare share in my youtube recommendation videos and found this to be rather nice. It was nice to see someone explain how they view themselves and with seeing that it's easy to understand how that is all anyone wants to do. Something that was tough to see what the self degrading that goes on, at least from what I see, to yourself. If there was anything that stood out it wasn't how you dressed, how you expressed yourself or anything that I saw outwardly but what appeared to be going on inwardly. And with that being said I wish nothing but the best for the world that seems to be under torment inside, I don't mind much for how things should be done, I care about the person and what is going on inside. How a wonderful day my friend."
"üíñüíñüíñ"
"Finally! Someone makes a funny genderqueer video! üòÇ"
"I'd date you before I'd date a CIS male being strangled in a corset made of man stereotype. I love fluid expression, gender and otherwise. I find it delightful, unexpected and when done joyfully, deeply appreciative. Thank you for sharing. I think I might have a new internet crush! If you ever need to run away to Canada... lol"
"Absolutely loved this video! Thank you for posting it. I'm a year late, but still a fantastic video!"
"Quick clarification: Just because you denounce or choose to act like or dress like another gender does not mean you can classify as a new gender. You can definitely *identify* as gender queer, go ahead, but in no way does that make you a new type of gender. There are only two genders: Male and Female (No, non-binary is not a gender it is the absence of one). Also for those who may bring up the point that sex and gender are two different things, they are not, just different words that mean exactly the same thing, search it up on the dictionary. If you really please to say that you are 'gender-queer' or any other gender Tumblr fed to you, go ahead, but Gender is classified by sex organs, so if you desire to switch from male to female you have to switch those out (A quite simple procedure). You can easily identify as anything you want, but when it comes to gender, you have only two choices. Thank you and have a nice day."
"Even scientifically gender and sex is complicated. https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/sex-gender-and-sexuality-its-complicated/"
"Contra's top üòçüíô Where can I find it??"
"THE DOCTOR !!!! That was unexpected and it killed me. I have just discovered your channel tonight and stayed up embarrassingly late to see more of your good good content. I'm really glad I discovered you now, it's amazing to see you share your journey! Thank you for that and for articulating a lot of things clearly many of us have difficulty doing, and to do so in a 'fun breezy way'. Those objections at the end are very poignant as well, because I have presented them to myself more than once, so hearing someone else countering them is pretty cool, def reading up what you suggest. I want to say more, but just know that I have been inspired by this video, in spite of your efforts."
"Loving the light. And alles. :o"
"And I am a little green pixie"
"Objection #4. 'It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders.'  It's the 'simple' that jumped out at me.  It's true, in a simple, surface level way there are seemingly only two genders.  DING!  You get the fact achievement bucko!  But looking a bit further reveals the same goddamn thing that is surfacing everywhere:  EVERYTHING, UPON INSPECTION, IS MORE COMPLEX THAN WE WANT IT TO BE.   It shows that we're not as smart or have as much control as we believe.  DING!  I also get my 'post-modern neo-marxist' achievement in the same post."
"Love your hair in this vid"
"It's odd how your experience seems so similar to my own. Rejected queer identity for a long time until recently. Thank you for sharing your story. I understand a bit more about my self because of you."
"I would like to engage in 1-on-1, polite discourse with another LGBT person (akin to ContraPoints) who is intelligent, educated about these subjects (important because I want to be confident I can trust your information as factual) and won't get offended/angry and dismiss me if I say something they disagree with.  The reason I want this is because I have come to some conclusions that are difficult or impossible to reconcile with mainstream LGBT rhetoric. They are the result of my *own* deep thought and contemplation on the subjects--I did not pick these up from some sh0eonhead knockoff.  I am trans, born male, and the lack of further clarification is actually related to my aforementioned conclusions. If anyone is interested in talking to me, what I am seeking is basically aid in reconciling these thoughts, either by making them compatible with the relevant LGBT rhetoric or conclusively rejecting it. I would like to use probably google hangouts or maybe discord/skype to converse--youtube comments are a bit too public to have a direct, legitimate exchange of ideas."
"0:00 lol but it WAS just a phase"
"Spoilers!  It means gay."
"Whoa. I think this video just helped me figure out that I'm genderqueer. I've always felt 'rebellious' against traditionally masculine attributes but not disphoric enough to want reassignment. I feel like I would choose female if I could magically change right now though.  I never really thought about it too much but the overview this video gave speaks so much to my personal experience. I relate a lot with how you described your view of gender.  Thanks for sticking around on this shitty website and making nice content. :)"
"0:07 I drink taxes and pay my scotch. I LOLed xD"
"I find it interesting that body hair can be dysphoric, because I don't think it always is. For example, I am a cisgender straight woman, and I very rarely shave any of my body hair (yes, including armpits). I just feel like 'If men aren't expected to do it, I shouldn't have to either.' *shrugs*"
"Okay I was raised by two doctors and I nearly burst a lung guffawing at the hot dog segment. I love this video!"
"Oh dearie me."
"I don't agree with this video one bit, but I really like you. Great personality, aesthetic, and humor. If only more SJWs were like you in trying to prove their points instead of name calling anyone who disagrees with them and running away to their safe space."
"That doll scares me."
"‚ÄúI drink taxes and I pay my scotch‚Äù   Okay there is something definitely wrong with this statement‚Äî"
"As a white cis male, WHY THE FUCK IS THAT DOLL STARING AT ME!?!?!?"
"Finally! A calm, rational explanation.  Is a shame that the very special snowflakes complicate the matter."
"I don't trust that doll"
"Fuck. I think I need to rethink some stuff"
"I was randomly thinking about what my parents would think if I made videos like yours and it struck me that I don‚Äôt imagine you as having any parents. Like in my head you‚Äôre an omnipresent being that just came into existence to educate us, which I suppose must be slightly objectifying, but I kinda like the idea that you could just be a goddess passing through. A deeply human flawed goddess just hanging out on the filthiest parts of the internet to laugh at us silly mortals with our silly ideas about ‚Äúthe coloureds, the gays, the trans‚Äù (not actually how I refer to the people who may exist within these groups), and maybe just to laugh at yourself as well.   Really what I‚Äôm trying to say is thank you, because laughing at us silly mortals, and laughing at yourself you silly mortal, has really helped me to understand many complex issues and has helped me articulate to others about these complex issues.  Like good job.  I feel like a proud mum, but I‚Äôm not a mum, and definitely not your mum, although I feel like I would be proud to be your mum."
"you have my vote!"
"the muse that did not want to be inspiring....."
"For those in the back that didn't hear it ''When you tell genderqueer people that we shouldn't have a word for ourselves, you're in effect asking us to drop the banner that allows us to understand ourselves, to find each other, and to collectively demand recognition and understanding. So telling us we shouldn't have a label is analogous to telling us we should shut up and disappear.' <3"
"You just got a new subscriber :o I love the way you film, the way you explain things and your sense of humor !"
"Thank you for making this video - this is a narrative on gender I've never heard before and you made some excellent points! Collect all those labels!"
"I Am Genderqueer (And Who the #@%! Cares ? )"
"You listed a bunch of words for people who are counted as being under the umbrella of 'genderqueer', including 'agender' - 'people who don't think of themselves as being any type of gender'. So what would you call someone who doesn't feel like any particular gender (myself) but who also thinks that 'gender' is an incoherent concept? I take it that this is separated from your meaning of the word 'agender', as I take it that you mean by 'agender' 'someone who identifies as no particular gender, but in doing so, acknowledges that genders exist', whereas, I mean that I don't think the structure of the very concept of gender is logically coherent, thus I cannot ideantify as any gender. What would you say to all this? How would you categorise me?"
"It's amazing how whenever people say 'there are only two genders' the fact that intersex people exist or that the goddamn world health organization and the american psychological assocation said that sex and gender aren't the same thing before gay marriage was legal, and that the majority of psychiatrists have followed suit somehow isn't enough to convince them."
"This would be a perfect video if it weren't for the airhorns (sorry I hate airhorns with a burning passion)"
"Some of those youtubers in the beginning like Jaclyn, I‚Äôm subscribed to , but i don‚Äôt agree with everything they sag"
"I think I might be trans or nonbinary, but...I just don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. I feel so stressed out all the time, I think I just wanna die at this point. I don‚Äôt think I can kill myself because I‚Äôm too scared and I wouldn‚Äôt leave my husband alone to take care of the kids, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a life for myself now ‚Äî I have a family and a house and a job, but I don‚Äôt even know who I am. I wish somebody would‚Äôve told me it‚Äôs OK to question yourself ‚Äòcause now it just feels wrong. I feel like if I change now, everyone will be disappointed in me or think I‚Äôm doing it for attention..."
"That red dot is really fukcing with me"
"Saw you debate with blaire. Why  did you not call her out on the ableism? Autism needs no cure, we need societal acceptance. I know it wasn't the issue, but if you want a 'cure' for autism you want to commit a form of genocide.That was a point that was valid and obvious"
"Pretty sure you can be gender queer while also being a mentally ill, alcoholic, perverted sexual deviant  those things neither preclude nor imply each other."
"I'll let you decide, but the answer is yes."
"'But I don't experience a lack of gender so much as an excess of it. I've just got too many fuckin' genders inside me; they're just fillin' me up deep inside.'  Holy shit. This."
"Hey, I've only recently found your channel (as in within the last few hours), but I've already subscribed and I look forward to seeing more of your content. The videos I've seen thus far have been insightful, informative, and extremely funny. As a new fan, thank you for putting up your work; It's already given me a lot of joy."
"So different now..."
"Do I look like I know what an nb is I just want a picture of a got dang hotdog."
"Even though Natalie came out as trans female, this is still one of my favorite videos as it has helped me my own identity. Plus it's really good to show people to help them understand."
"did that doll have to be on the left, though"
"I'm a woman, and have been told I'm 'very feminine', but I never DO anything to try to be feminine.  I never think about it.  I never wear makeup or do much with my hair or try hard to wear pretty clothes or sit like a lady or do any other feminine thing, and I often do/wear/think things that are traditionally masculine.  But I have the face/voice/body that tags me female instantly.  I don't think I care about gender at all, for myself, and kinda feel like maybe I'd be happier if I was a man, but no way could I pull it off and it isn't worth the trouble to fight the system for something that doesn't really matter much to me.  I don't know if I'm agender or if there's any particular name for what I am.  I have a hard time understanding why this is something important to anyone else (the idea of trying hard to express as any particular gender).  I want to be nice and not an insensitive dick about this issue, though.  It obviously must matter a lot to some people or they wouldn't go through what they do over it.   Guess I need to study up on it more."
"Aww. June is just an idiot, be nice to them."

"From one freak to another,  I love listening to you it's just great to hear someone who listens to all sides"
"I dont really see the use of having dozens of nonbinary gender labels. At that point you are trying to sort something so complicated as an identity into categories that are both too specific and ill defined at the same time. You could often sort one person into one category just as well as into another and people can have vastly different ideas of what someone means when call themselves a specific gender. If gender is a huge issue for someone it seems the most prudent in my mind to explain it in their own terms to people, if they want them to know about it, or use the non binary label."
"So glad I found you from the Michael Brooks Show =)  also, I *love* your style and that red dress from your 'transvestite' video? omg, wish I could pull that off!"
"9:55 Why you gotta drag Kierk?"
"i'm  sure once people see me on you tube and in public i will get nothing but negative comments your right why can't people have the right to be who they are and want to be with out being cast out of society as having mental issues or having other issues  i hate it i love everyone from transgender to transexuals and everyone in between even you rotten people who judge others"
"This was amazingly funny--and informative. Thank you!"
"(Beforehand i apologize for my english its not my motherlanguage) Very interesting to hear how you  learned  more about you¬¥re gender identity and about the different phases you went through  ( Do i fit in the image  of trans people? Am i to... old, young,feminime maskuline etc etc)   i guess a lot of us trans* folks know these kinds of questions ;) But after a while we all recognise there isnt a specific way how  trans*persons are .Some trans* people are younger some are older. (I also have a lot of older friends who are nonbinary, two of them wanna marry next month :) ) Our society has to learn a  lot about us! There are so many different gender identities under the umbrella term trans* there are binary-, nonbinary people, Agender,etc .We all made different experiences and have different ways how we transition.  Just because youre a trans* man or a trans*woman doesnt necesscarilly mean you want to take hormones or you wanna underwent surgeries or have problems with your body ( some of us are fine with their bodies).And also a nonbinary person sometimes want to do hormone therapy or surgeries .There is no right or wrong way how to transition long as you feel right about it. I am a binary Trans* man i am out since i am 15 now i am 23 and a trans* activist :)  And dont worry about your shoulders you look perfect thereare also other women who have larger shoulders;) Which person has  a body who fits perfectly in our stupid society Norms? And just because it doesnt fit in the norm doesnt mean it isnt beautiful. Take care of yourself and dont take the people who selfdeclared themself as Genderpolice and saying stuff like only two genders, Adam and Eve not blabla too serious. Liebe Gr√º√üe aus Deutschland und lasst euch nicht unterkriegen von euren verr√ºckten Pr√§sidenten!Viele Trans*menschen aus Deutschland denken an euch!"

"I‚Äôm a heterosexual cis-white man. I have no idea why people in my position have difficulty accepting gender pronouns. My view has always been that I should afford mutual respect to someone I‚Äôm talking to, and if they tell me they prefer a certain pronoun it isn‚Äôt going to bother me. If someone says they prefer being called ‚ÄúBob‚Äù instead of Robert they aren‚Äôt trying to trample free speech, they just want to be called the name they feel comfortable with. *IT ISN‚ÄôT HARD TO RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄôS DECISIONS*"

I was sort of expecting more description of the actual experience of being genderqueer though, as I used to think of myself as genderqueer, but I don't anymore and I'm not really sure what has changed, if anything.

"I‚Äôm a classically trained singer and I have a lot of dysphoria around my voice, and attribute some of that to how the music industry trained me to sing.  I really appreciate how you are able to respect your voice.  As a non binary person, I have felt like I had a lot of trouble passing and sometimes feel that people will see a disconnect between my feminine voice and my more androgynous presentation. When I watch your content I seem to associate your voice with you and sense no disconnect between the way you present and your voice. It has made me re-evaluate the way I believe society sees me, and the importance I put on ‚Äúpassing‚Äù as androgynous and non binary."
"Omg. I can't believe I just found this video. Preach, hun. I'm AFAB but entirely empathise with this from start to finish."
"This honestly made me realize i'm not trans, i'm just non binary(probably genderfluid)"
"*collects all the pronouns*"
"you are a man with gender dysphoria"
"Oh look! It's HowToBasic"
"Fun fact: attack helecopter gender jokes have been around since 2010. Meaning. This joke has been around for 8 years. Meaning anti-sjws need to FIND NEW JOKES."
"That fucking doll"
"When talking about examining a wide range of experiences, I'd say great, but treat anyone younger than 18 with caution at best or a grain of salt at worst. I'm not trying to give some contrived patronizing bullshit about how teens are 'just confused' or 'just at that stage in their life', but I am gonna say this: kids and teens are dumb. Like, really really fucking dumb, but that's kind of the point of being young. You make dumb mistakes and say dumb shit and either learn from it through inquisition and 'help' from others or you become a very dumb adult. Summarized: give greater credence to the person with a calm rational manner first before you end your journey into gender politics and identity with some kid who's just learning about it for the first time and decided to post about it on social media (y'know, like kids do)"
"O.K were do you go from this am a cross dresser that like to be a women but to old."
"Corellon Larethian, God of the Elves was androgynous, both male and female until he met Araushnee (Lolth) and decided to become wholly male in order to mate with her... Just putting it out there I don't know why..."
"youre a delight, and as another genderqueer person i relate to a lot of how you see yourself and the identity itself. im so glad i found your channel. also your doll in the background is creepy"
"that fucking doll in the other room is staring into my soul. I'M FREAKING OUT MAN."
"I know it's been almost a year since you posted this, but I'm necocommenting anyway. +1 on everything you have said. I had many (many, many) similar feelings and experiences, including being okay with some aspects of my assigned gender. Be true to yourself. It's okay to collect them all. Don't let the Truscum or HBSers get you down.  And beware of the fnords."
"But! She (i mean the other girl (with black hair)) said Non-Binary isnt nothing! That means it is something!"
"Even when I didn't know about this whole thing with genders, hearing that 'there can be only two genders and that's a fact' seemed very similar to 'you can't be born in the wrong body' or 'it's impossible to be naturally left handed'."
"That fucking doll peeking in the door behind you! I kept watching it to see if it was gonna move or do something creepy."
"Please hide that creepy doll. It's scaring the sh*t out of me."
"that shirts still pretty as fuck"
"You make up the perfect human being. Wish there were more people like you in this world. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I am a biological woman and i have periods and I look a mess sometimes and I just resent the fact that becoming a woman is now becoming synonymous with putting makeup on, doing your hair, wearing a dress, shaving your legs and walking in heels. Its like fuck me i may as well be barbie. That don't make me a terf though, i am fully supportive of trans but also entitled to this opinion."
"I think I'm in love?"
"2:10"
"Fuck everybody who dislikes this video."
"It means you are deeply mentally ill."
"<3"
"okay, but the real question is: which horoscope sign(s) do you identify as?"
"My favorite pronouns: dude, bro, brodude, d-bro.  You so beautiful, girl she."
"I'm coming from a genuine and not argumentative or hateful place. When you talk about collectively demanding recognition and understanding do you mean as part of the larger LGBT+ community or as a specific subset? I think sometimes things get a bit muddled between the personal and public. Like, if someone in my life like a friend or co-worker was non-binary, I would make the effort to understand how he/she/they identified and what pronouns I should use. But sometimes it feels like in the context of the larger culture it's difficult to sort through all the labels and I do feel like it's still a very confusing space for a lot of people as they struggle to find the label that feels right. I don't want to practice erasure and yet it can be a bit exhausting when there are so many specific labels to describe a personal experience that doesn't affect the baseline of treating people as human beings worthy of respect and decency."
"Yo the doll is CREEPY."
"That hog dog demonstration was still better than Catholic School"
"I love this video! I didnt love that creepy doll though."
"I DEMAND A DUO VIDEO WITH HBOMBERGUY :O"
"It's sad to watch someone's descent into insanity."
"I've been marathon in your videos. I adore your lighting setups. So vaporwave."
"I will NOT stop being inspired!! You bring so much clarity, wisdom and beauty (and humor) to youtube, I really appreciate your content. I'm afab, nonbinary, transmasculine, whatever, and I really relate to being dysphoric but not wanting to try to conform to society's idea of ''passing'' I like a lot of the attributes I was born with, (tho HRT would be nice) and I wish others would associate them not with a construct of femininity but with me as an individual, and associate them with masculinity by proxy because I have a masc identity. Its hard to talk about that or ask people to make that mental shift though because people often take it as a personal attack and act like I'm forcing them to make this monumental change to suit my whims. Is it that people don't understand the basic concept that relationships are founded on mutual respect and understanding and require a little effort to make them work or do they just fuckin hate trans/queer people too much to make the effort to treat us like people?? also you pass rly well wtf"
"The sausage science in this video was unethical. Pigs were harmed in the making of this hilarious example."
"The beginning was amazing üòÇ"
"Thank you. This was very helpful."
"**No, seriously, what does he/she want to have sex with? Either, both, none of them above?**"
"**Correction: the Chinese language doesn't have a specified gender neutral pronouns. However, it doesn't matter in speaking, because all singular third person pronouns are pronounced the same. Unless clarified, it is understood that the sex/gender isn't relevant or important in the conservation. And even in writing, the male third person pronouns are used as the substitute for gender neutral third person pronouns. And the excessive use as third person gender pronouns to refer to people is discouraged, as it will lead to confusion, such as 'he give her a gift.'**"
"I love your channel. It's nice to know I'm not the only self-loathing, agnostic atheist, gender fluid, dank meme queen who crawled out of the cesspool that is the chanosphere. All that's missing is half-black, autistic, unattractive, woefully out of shape, and living in the heart of Europe. 'The alt-right *hates* them! Find out how they toppled western civilization by *simply existing!'*"
"You really like Sarabande. ;D"
"Just out of curiosity, you have some preferences in terms of dating? (Or just fantasising, if you don't date, whatever)"
"Good video. I appreciate the honesty. I find it hard to deal with what appears to be criticism from all sides, when it comes to *overwhelmingly common* issues. I can't imagine what it's like for you. I'm not even sure whether to sign this with a mention of my cishet white guy status for the purpose of using my privilege to benefits others, or if I should keep that part out because allyship can be better done by exposing oneself to similar accusations as the person I'm supporting, or because it's better to normalize everything by not specifying, or because the possible appearance of empty virtue signaling could be discrediting. Oi."
"Hey so thanks for making this vid for me to chew on and then return to after literal years of lying to myself (I know you don't really identify with genderqueer anymore, but it's still helped me a lot)"
"I identify as a non binary attack helicopter which means on some days i wake up as a transport helicopter and some days i wake up as an attack helicopter. On the days that i wake up as an attack helicopter i lets my missles show and my guns show but on the days when i wake up as a transport helicopter i cover all that stuff if with a sports cover and look like  something different that im not. In the beginning of time there were two kinds of people 1 with a vagina and 1 with a penis. Now dont go and get butthurt but all these new terms like Genderfluid were created for people that can just accept what they were given in between their legs at birth and wanna make then feel better but the fact of it is is that you are a Woman because you were genetically born with a vagina in between you legs not a penis. So you can say ohhh i feel like being a guy and hiding my breasts and looking more manly no even transgenders cant change what they actually are you are what your were at birth and you cant change that and if you need to know what a male and female look like and how they function at night then whatch how children are made because thats the only two genders in the world."
"'Only when we recognize that 'manhood' and 'womanhood' are made-up categories, invented to control human beings and violently imposed, can we truly understand the nature of sexism, of misogyny, of the way we are all worked over by gender in the end.' -Laurie Penny."
"I'd love to see an update on this! ¬†What changed in the last few months to make you decide to transition?"
"I‚Äôve been hiding behind intersex label as away of expressing and defining who I am. But after trying to comprehend this whole video I think I‚Äôll go back to square one. So for tonight I‚Äôll define myself a something who is undefinable.  No I‚Äôm transgender, no bigender, no that doesn‚Äôt fit. Oh heck just call me Hannah, because not mater how you look at the word Hannah I see myself the same way."
"‚ÄúGRAH! GUR BDURR MAH!‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you doctor‚Äù"
"You said your reason for feeling genderqueer was experiencing a bit of dysphoria but not wanting to transition, enjoying 'women's' clothing and not liking body hair.  So my question is this, what stops you from being a male with those characteristics? What about those characteristics changes your gender?"
"Honestly. This video really just helped me put to words shit that I have spend forever trying to understand about me. There are like 800 ways I want to thank you right now"
"Can maybe, Bowie and Prince be considered as genderqueer?"
"So basically you're comfortable as a 'guy' or 'gal' and dress accordingly? (Quotes cause I think that may be oversimplifying but genuinely trying to understand.)"
"G E N D E R T R E A S O N"
"PS Is this strange - you look a little like Winona Ryder!"
"I love that creepy doll hanging in the dark room behind you! ¬†You are very entertaining and funny. ¬†Thank you for your down to earth - don't stop your brilliant commentary friend. ¬†xxv"
"Your comedy is on point. Yes, I like the sound of your voice and that dress looks great on you. That damn doll is creepy though."
"being human is a social and psychological construct."
"This shit made me laugh so hard.  I feel a lot like you do; my gender is just kind of in the middle, and I don't give a god damn about what pronouns people use.  It's so hilarious how some people get so hung up on an issue that really shouldn't have to be a big deal.  Love your videos dude, keep up the good work!  I know I'll keep watching.  :D"
"baa hahahahahhahaha that was awesome!"
"I really want your shirt"
"I fucking love you like omfg :D"
"Youre a man dressed as a woman. Sorry, but that's what you are. Doesn't make you bad, or invalid, but it's just reality. Gender and sex are the same thing. No one suggested they werent until 1948 and that was not widely accepted by the medical communtiy. What you are telling us is what you believe, not what is realistically true."
"Intersex people prove their is no such thing as two genders."
"My partner has just came out to me as a trans female. It started with them saying they thought they were gender fluid but then a month later felt they were fully trans. They are 32 yrs old. And made no action towards transitioning out of fear for were we live :("
"I love your outfit and necklace , where did you get them ?"
"2:07 hahahaha omg I'm dying"
"You look amazing !"
"i've only seen pics of you and thought you were a cis woman."
"It pains me to admit,  I'm trans...  and for a while I got very aggravated for a long time at non binary folks.  I felt like the whole thing was well,  sort of an assault on who I was.  I feel terrible about how angry I used to get."
"Im here laughing my ass of, subscribed!"
"Awe she is adorable!"
"This is the besttt ‚ô°"
"LOL 'hot-dog biology'. I'm definitely using that one in my next argument! x"
"Great Video! Found you through Philosophy Tube, and I gotta say, you are a freaking GEM!!! BTW Love the Pokemon bit there!"
"oh my god I just found you and I love you! keep up the good work (even though you won't read this) you're hilarious!"
"Fuck! I‚Äôve never ‚Äúloved‚Äù an artist before!  i‚Äôm in my mid-twenties and you popped my obsessive fan cherry you! Shit this sucks.    Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck P.S. I love you and you deserve to be happy."
"Informative, thanks! I‚Äôve been interested but not really enough to google a bunch of stuff. Your videos are dope"
"I absolutely love your dress.  Also totally crushin', can't lie <3"
"You should be ashame of yourself... Those poor hotdogs were innocent, you monster."
"I know I'm 7 months or so late but I HAVE to know where that shirt is from I need it"
"why the DOLL THO? WHAT IS THIS?"
"I can't stand the 'Science says two genders' argument. One day, I was really dysphoric and this girl, who regularly saw my trans posts and let me be, decided to attack me on the worst possible day. I didn't want to fight, so I just left references from the APA, World Health Organization, Harvard school of Anthropology, and Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling of Brown University which explained that both biological sex and psychosocial gender were much more complex than she claimed. As someone who has been studying mental health and cultural anthropology my entire life, and am making a career out of it, I'm tired of people trying to do my job for me and either claiming trans people were mentally ill or that our Western binary was a human universal. Thank you so much for this video. I've used it to help both people who never learned about gender complexity as well as friends who are non-binary who struggle with validating how they feel."
"I can definitely understand how people can feel like they are both genders. I feel like I'm in the middle of the gender spectrum myself. I don't understand how someone can be agender. It feels like asking someone if they are an extrovert or introvert and they say neither. How is that even possible?"
"Yay"
"Excuse me sir/madame, I just want to say that your dress and haircut is really lovely. And for you to have a good day."
"Dude, you know how to use make up. But, you should work on the lighting. The lighting you use is cold, and some shades it casts on your skin make it look like you haven't shaved. Look closer at 1:01..."
"David Bowie, Annie Lennox, Prince, Michael Jackson, Grace Jones, Freddie Mercury we're all at times androgynous. These are some of my favorite musicians. I started watching your channel because of how intelligent and detailed your descriptions of the Freddie Gray tragedy and also your criticism of Neo-Nazi inspired hate groups calling themselves the alt right. I don't care what you look like. You also have a brilliant sense of humor."
"inspired <3"
"Oh also, I am okay with calling someone 'she , he or they' but I think things like xi/xir , etc is too much."
"I know this is way past the time this was posted, but I still have a hard time grasping 'nonbinary' . I do think that there are people who fall more outside of the gender norm, and are not necessarily trans, but I also think part of it lies in having a narrow idea of what each gender really is. I also believe that there are people who have negative associations with either gender, or don't want to take the label because of all the heavy crap that is placed on it.   I have met people who , to me, were obviously their birth gender, but maybe they cut their hair , or something else minor like that, then claimed to be nonbinary. I mean maybe they are just figuring themselves out. But if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck I call it a duck. Again, I am not one of these people who denies there are people who fall outside what we think of male and female, but some people who don't still claim the nonbinary label.   I also may be saying this because I used to have nonbinary feelings, but always realized I am very very feminine overall, I just am not motherly, and have an attraction to more feminine people."
"I‚Äôm new to this channel and I appreciate your perspective. I think you express a movement away from judgement in a fun way. I hope you grow in your confidence ya glorious betch"
"I love you ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è  Platonically :D"
"I think i am genderfluid (biologically male) because it‚Äôs like every week at least once day or even more I feel really feminine and I hate my body then all of a sudden I feel normal again and I‚Äôm okay again it‚Äôs been really shitty most of my life because I couldn‚Äôt explain all these feelings I have"
"I Love you So much right now...."
"Its just a simple scientific fact that there are only 2 genders"
"Oh.... OH!  .... oh."
"Man, I shat my mind! I love it <3"
"congrats on coming out and figuring urself out! its not easy for any of us i think."
"You are a man and you can identify as whatever you want, why is that reality any problem?"

"Contra your so cool! I have only watched 2 of your videos and feel I have found a voice of reason that I have been looking for. Thank you!"
"phases are under rated, being a child is just a phase but that doesn't mean it's somehow not real or meaningful."
"I LOOOOVE this video."
"subscribed! this is cool"
"Excuse me sir or man or what ever the hell you are but you have a mental disease probably caused by the unnecessary amount of alcohol you consume"
"How did you get the sausage out of the electricity plug?"
"I used to be a SJW and then I got 'redpilled' but I felt like I was somewhat in an echo chamber so I've been watching your vids and really like them. I disagree with you 50% of the time but you really made these issues we often dismiss as SJWs being triggered much more complex than I thought they were :)"
"It's just a simple scientific gender that there are only two facts."
"I just discovered your channel and I think I might love you.  Seriously."
"I honestly came here because I was curious because I've seen a lot of hate on both sides of the political spectrum. I surprisingly enjoyed this aha. I have no idea about any of this gender stuff. It's not something I personally ever think about, especially in regards to myself, I just live. It's just really interesting to listen. I hope this wasn't disrespectful. I like the way you did the video, I think it is pretty good))"
"'I'm just not an inspiring person stop being inspired.' Oh, no, I can't help it the inspiration is too powerful!!!!"
"haha liked that video, greetings from a bigender :D"
"This resonates a lot with how I feel. I have recently started the process of transitioning (changed my name, but haven't started HRT yet, as I need to go through a series of interviews at the hospital first). I'm probably a little gender fluid, as I feel my gender identity changes a little from time to time, but it leans heavily in the direction of female. It tends to fluctuate between 'I'm fine where I am with make-up and long hair and stuff and this whole hormones and surgery thing is just too much of a hassle' to 'I desperately want to go all the way'"
"11:24 i was gonna say no, now i can just say how can someone so intelligent and self aware be so little convincing, you think if you rise a child out of society is gonna have transgender disphoria or whatever? so being a transgender is about how it affects you?, should i make a movement about 145 iq males kinda socially impired with kinda self esteem problems and kinda narcistic who live with their moms couse absolutely hate and cant get involved in society, pretty much fucking pussies bla blaba apache helicopter blabla you get the point? whats the fucking difference, numbers? there is no fucking difference mate there isnt its fucking horrible to be a 145 iq person in this world and if there was a pill to lower mine and become socially stable and fucking have a propeller on the top of my head i would take it, but i wouldnt fucking want it to affect anyone else, beggening by having them to name me apaccio and ending with having them to pay for the pill. If you have a dick you should pee wit hthe dicked ones and if you have an xy chormosome or whatever the fuck the correct tems are it should say male on your id. we can agree that people with gender disorders like hermaphroditism are more conflictive, you fucking shouldnt be though"
"'i dont experience a lack of gender so much as an excess of it. I've just got too many fuckin genders inside me' lmao this is an excellent way to put genderqueer-ness when explaining it in contrast with agender-ness."
"So does that mean attraction towards u is gay no matter the gender of who‚Äôs feeling it? OwO"
"I don't understand the bonkers obsession of cis people with gender identity of people they will likely never met anyways. Live and let live."
"I drink taxes"
"I've always seen gender as a spectrum with two sides, and so when people said 'non binary' I always thought they were referring to being on some third side of a spectrum or something that has nothing to do with the masculine feminine dichotomy, and so I thought the whole thing was stupid. I believe this video proves me wrong though, which is honestly nice because I wouldn't consider myself very gender conforming."
"Thank you for framing my own reticence on these matters so well. I will remain in the closet for a month or so yet and do not intend to start a channel till I'm well out of it. Thank you for demonstrating it is is practical to be honest, though."
"WEEEEEEEERK"
"New to your channel and loving it; gotta say, as a 28 year old genderqueer who has always had difficulty explaining this nebulous shifting dunescape of an identity to other people I'm just going to relax now and carry a link to this video around with me at all times."
"Saying something is 'non-binary' indirectly reaffirms the 'binary'. Why do you need to legitimize the categories at all?"
"5:40 Fantastic point about 'pre-satirizing yourself so bullies don't get to have the fun of insulting you.' I do that a lot myself but never really had a way to describe why I do it."
"I love you oh my god, you are stunningly beautiful and you are the person I'm aiming to be"
"YASSSSSS FELLOW GENDERQUEER YAAAASSSS"
"That doll is wanting to kill u"
"I really feel like many trans-activists overly complicate this scientific phenomena with redundant labels. Everyone's experience of gender can be broken with two questions:   1) Do you identify with any particular biological sex or associated socially constructed gender identity and if so, which do you feel is the same as you?   The only applicable answers here are Yes/No: males, females, both or neither.   2) Do you desire to express your gender and if so, do you desire to gender express in a way that others will recognize either your biological sex, your gender identity, both, or neither.   This really does cover the entirety of all labels."
"You don't live near the southern Ohio do you? You seem like a fun person to hang out with. Wanna play board games with a complete stranger and a complete stranger's wife?"

"those people were mean and raw ether lol i wish i had some of that now also im gay and gender queer"
"*keeps trying desperately to pay attention* the Doll: *S T A R E  I N T O  T H E   V O I D"
"It means to me 'this is how I psychologically feel about my sex, irrespective of the physical fact of my gender.' And why should I say that's an incongruity, like I know how the human mind should be? Nah, not me. But I still think I can respect your right to do Anything that hurts no one and not be held by any positive obligation to agree. I think if more could see that tolerance doesn't mean condoning, maybe they'd be less scared of allowing others to discover the benefit and harm of lifestyles by their own merits, and not just some zealot's testimony. But do know that I have the utmost admiration for your intellect, your eloquence, and I certainly resonate with your irreverence. Lord knows. I don't even agree with myself from day to day.. there is no one with which I will always agree - on everything. I can disagree and still admire. That's why I bothered to say it in prose."
"I'm not up on the whole pronoun thing. May I just call you 'fabulous' instead?"
"I'm confused, and would really love to see you do an updated commentary on this video specifically."
"That creepy fucking doll in the corner though lol"
"Truth has a way of working on us."
"I actually used this video AT WORK today to explain what Im about to do to our Directors...  Im amazed. They got it after watching this segment. They didnt get it with my previous 6 months of trying to explain 'what the fuck was going on'.  THANKS! Contra."
"There arent just two genders :x X, xx, xy, xxx, xxy, xyy"
"Well dammit, I'm inspired."
"Google is actually how I came across genderqueer and non binary which is what I now identify as. (To clarify I use genderqueer and non binary interchangeably. At first non binary felt too loose so I used genderqueer. Somewhere along the line genderqueer started feeling off so I now use non binary.)"
"Thanks for the explanation! You are gorgeous, BTW! Love ya and take care."

"'I don't bang dudes' *snaps* darn"
"Talking about your feelings like a gay is excellent :D you‚Äôre such a gorgeous person and I love this video!"
"this was a really long way of saying you like dresses and dolls"
"This actually really cleared up a lot of questions i had about non-binary gender expression.   As a Trans-Woman myself I didn't really understand the expression of non binary gender. My own gender expression has always been VERY much female and I think it's quite easy to fall into the habit of thinking everybody thinks like you do.   I have a few non-binary online friends but i didn't wan't to press them for details for fear of bringing up personal details they may not be comfortable talking about."
"Thank you."
"so you're not gay ....¬† could've fooled me with all that leftist bs"
"The voice is wonderful and female when you're looking lovely and feminine, masculine on the voice over, remaining very appealing."

"who gives a shit what boxxy says about gender"
"Yeah, yeah dude looks like a laaydeh, yeah yeah dude looks like a laydah!"
"You a sexy girl tho"
"The first time I mentioned you to my friend, I rapidly switched confusingly between 'he' and 'she' and made them quite confused thinking I was talking about two people, then I said I didn't know what pronouns you use, turns out I extremely accurately guessed."
"Watching this again because I love my light mother Natalie"
"This explains a lot. All you do is project your internalized issues onto other people. As for you passing as female, when you want to pass as female, you do."
"The problem with the 'science says two' is that biology is an unmanageable, inaccurate, spray-and-pray creator. It's not going to hit a mark every time. It's not going to hit one mark at most. Any and every variation and combination is imagineable, or biology would have been considered an accurate science."

"That doll is going to stalk me in my sleep I fucking know it"
"I think most people are fine with they. Though Ive had people complain to me about putting male pronouns as preferred pronouns, i was like...... What? We speak english right?"
"Please argue against Ben Shapiro, Peterson, Steven Crowder and Gavin Mcinnes! They used to be very influential to me. But now, I've truly became open minded listening to you. I actually thought about your video all day today. I want to be on the right side of things, I feel bad for being your typical average guy. Thank you for opening my eyes"

"Your accepted to do whatever you want until you tell others to accept you.  At that point you can screw off just like any religion telling people how to live, what to accept and so on.

"6:26 'I'm not the most inspiring person, so... STOP... Being inspired!!' Oh my god, that the MOST _I N S P I R I N G_ THING you've ever said <3 <3 <3"
"Well, I'd just like to do the 'clich√©d affirmative speech' thing and point out that you can have ALL the hormones and ALL the surgeries, or only hormones, or only (whatever) surgeries, or whatever other measures, or none of it, regardless of whether you're conventionally binary trans, nonbinary, or even cis. Yes, this is a free country (I'm not even in the US but you are, so w/e), so nobody can keep a cis guy from taking hormones and 'cut his dick off' (trololol), have facial surgery and boob enhancement, epilation and voice training or surgery and body language training and change his legal and social name and gender and wear ALL the makeup and ALL the femme clothing IF HE FUCKING WANTS SO. And you can be binary trans or nonbinary and not do any of it, and it doesn't make you any less trans or nonbinary. I mean, it's just about what you feel comfortable with yourself, after all. It's YOUR life and what you do with it, nobody else's. By the way, hormones won't change your voice, so if you like your voice, well, that's not a problem at all. And if you don't want to deal with the gatekeeping, just DIY it, gurl. You can always try hormones and drop them if you don't like the experience. Just saying!"
"I'm genderfluid myself and it's great! I just wish more people actually understood what it was."
"Thanks for the video Contra. Something that confuses me about the all genderfluid, bi-gender and similar labels, is that it assumes the person identifying as such knows what feeling like 'one gender' feels like, with only a single personal experience to go on it seems odd to label yourself based on how differently you feel in relation to others when if fact you may have no idea what that is.  So, as I male, I identify as a man, but that identification means nothing apart from I likely have XY chromosomes, sex organs etc. To assume how I feel, how I think and how I want others to see me is annoying. I shouldn't need to label myself, give myself different pronouns or dress differently to be treated as an individual.  I sometimes feel like when a non-binary person identifies as such, they are assuming what I feel like or making assumptions about me that they have no right too.  These are just my thoughts on the matter and I don't mean to cause any offense, but I'm interested to understand how a non-binary person thinks a binary person is different to them."
"hey, hey, im an original and special attack helicopter. Insert joke using the word gay here, its a fun word. honestly though i wish all these sissy fags would stop using the word queer, i like my overused Lovecraft word that has like tots lost its meaning and its like annoying i have to specifically add the caveat to it every time i use it that states 'I am only using this word in the old timeyway to refer to something that is strange or bazaar'. fucking dyslexia fucking up my words, at least everything is almost probably phonetically correct"
"That's not gender, it's personality.  You express your personality."
"This might be my favorite channel that I've found in a long time. Well spoken and great humor.  Keep it up!"
"god damn it, you are wonderful <3"
"Lmao one of the videos you referenced in the beginning was from ShoeOnHead, who on your cultural appropriation video, talked about how great you were. Then in their own video they go on to say your identity is bullshit.  What a great gal she is."
"History first as tragedy then repeated as farce. The USA is the reenactment of the Weimar republic. Liberalism psychological/emotional roots are infantile. The core emotional economy of liberalism is that constraints are always to be resented and removed, such that the individual is/can (and should be - liberal ideology loves to assume it's own normative status) self-authored via the action of volitional will. Thus we have liberals such as ContraPoints argue effectively that sex and sexual dimorphism is at best a continuum (as if clining and clustering don't both occur in biological systems; nor indeed do transition theresholds exist) and at worst as a 'construct'. This despite sexual reproduction (hence the sexual reproduction dichotomy) being part of biological systems for 100s of millions of years. I guess to that species and other natural kinds are just 'constructs' etc.?  Liberalism is an absurd proposition and has been a long unfolding nightmare that can only result in nilhilism. Welcome to the system - shopping & fucking = 'freedom'. What a ghastly and incredibly thin notion of human existence.  As for ContraPoints 'feelings' this raises another rather tricky topic. The possibility and reliability of self-knowledge. ContraPoints naive position (and self-serving rationalisation) is thus:  I feel X ergo X describes or has a  correspondence with a true thing in the the world thus X is true. But is it? I watched an interview on Norwegian TV of a woman who claims to be a cat in a human body.  Would ContraPoints think this is normal? That this person is being honest or convinced of that idea, that she really is a cat in a human body? If not why not? See this whole 'feelings' are realible guides to reality argument doesn't match the world. People can be and frequently are deluded, self-knowledge is incredibly difficult to achieve. Furthermore deluded people are not knowingly being dishonest but they are still mistaken and deluded.  Still I doubt CounterPoints would engage or respond to these ideas. And this boy fancies himself to be an 'intellectual'. The decline in societal standards really is out of control.   Transgenderism is liberal ideology on steroids. That by an individual act of will black becomes white, or man becomes woman (or vice versa). Absurdities to anyone with a functional intellect."
"love this video, you are gorgeous.... but that doll in the background!! ¬†creepy!!"
"Hmm .. this was somewhat enlightening for me. Since I was about 15, I've joked that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body. I  love my lady parts and have never wanted to trade them in - at 5 foot and about 110 pounds I could never look very 'manly' anyway. I remember quite a few times growing up,  my father would suddenly look at me and say 'you were supposed to be a boy, you know.'  in no way, shape, or form do I feel connected to or identify with women, never have. It caused a lot of problems in my marriage.. My husband once said that if he hadn't watched me give birth with his own eyes ,  he would have sworn that i used to be a man ... my son recently referred to me as 'dudely'. .. not in appearance, but manner."
"Freckle we meet again"
"Cannot get enough of this channel - also digging the creepy doll in the background"
"Hey thanks for this. Thank you very much"
"I really like your channel, but I gotta say I was a little disappointed because I wanted to be convinced in multitude-gender theory because none of it currently makes sense to me. I feel like the way you present 'gender' and 'gender expression' could be make more explicit and help clarify especially at the beginning since you only really distinguish gender from sex but don't go off very far into what that means aside from each other.   To me, gender is the cultural distinctions of male and female states as expressed in commonality that determines pronouns, and goes along with gender roles in the sense that our society attributes X or Y concept with A or B gender and is extremely generalized. Gender expression on the other hand is the individual aspect of gender which one approaches to convey the gender roles attributed in either a subversive or loyal manner. To me either approach is okay, but the ideas 'gender' and 'expression of gender' are completely different things.   Intersex is a common retort which I do not see as a true distinct sex but rather the state of having an abnormality to which reproductive function may suffer (that's the reason I think it's an abnormality as it's defined by specific conditions seen as outside human norms).  I mean I'm not afraid of being wrong, but this is what I've come to accept regarding gender since everyone else's arguments go completely over my head; this maybe a communication issue and not necessarily an indication of stupidity on either side (though it would more likely target me as a common thread). Let me know what you think, because criticism is welcome üòÑ"

"I've come from the 'right' and I'm here to learn."
"Chinese actually has gender pronouns (‰ªñÔºåÂ•πÔºåand ÂÆÉ - male, female, and other) but they are all pronounced the same (tƒÅ)"
"I love this so fucking much. You seem real and genuine, thank you for speaking up. I really apreciate how you speak about this with humor. I have a lot to say but I can't put it into words.  My friend sent me this and I love you."
"IF you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, ' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And for fucks sake, you've earnt the right to define youself."
"Yeah boiiii! Preach gurl <3"
"Thanks for doing the captions for those of us that suck at hearing shit"
"Having recently discovered your channel via anarchist facebook, I'm surprised and impressed with the progress your videos illustrate over the past year or so and relate to a lot of your experience throughout (and in roughly the same timescale and period, coincidentally enough), jumping terms from 'gender indifferent' to 'agender' to acknowledging that my use of 'agender' sits in the vague area of non-binary and genderqueer. Also, what's the deal with the creepy doll?"
"'ALL THESE FAKE LITTLE GENDERS!!!'  yeah, that's me~"
"You've earned a new sub. I admit I don't always get the non-binary thing, but as someone who  thinks everyone should express themselves how they want & be happy, you do you. Also you're very charming and funny.I always joke (not completely facetiously) that inside this 5 foot 2 woman is a 60 yr old male English professor who smokes a pipe and writes indignant letters to the Guardian. As a believer of the animus/anima theory,I say if part of you is feminine and needs expression, go for it."
"damn i guess i am non binary!"
"I recall having a phase when I was much younger where I did very 'incorrect' things to elicit emotional, or physical sexual responses from both men and women.  I also used to dress in female clothing, where some makeup, and generally be faux romantically involved with men and women.  Then I kinda got older, forgot about everything and moved on with my life.  I enjoy women, I think women smell nice, I think women look amazing- not sure how much I care for every single personality I come across, but I digress.  Men are men, they aren't physically repulsive, they aren't intimidating to me, but I struggle to connect with them emotionally in most respects, however I have been getting better over the past two years.  I don't look at men as if I'm sexually interested in them, I would most certainly enjoy the company of like-minded men or friendships with them obviously.  I had a very bad childhood, a childhood that painted a very different picture of life and what it meant to be a person.  I believe we've all had strange things happen to us that have altered who we are, including our characteristics and how we view ourselves or relationships.  People are just people,  can't blame any of them for 'feeling' the way that they do.  I think if more people accepted that.. we'd probably all be arguing a lot less.  Good video.  Enjoying the channel and your ideas."
"But it's a scientific fact that there's only 2 genders, because hot dogs."
"The funny part is that it actually *isn't* a scientific fact that there's only two genders, so anyone who uses that argument is either talking right out of their ass or is operating on primary school level biology! Isn't the inexorable advance of scientific understanding and the continual recontextualisation of old evidence fun? :D"
"Chinese characters are gendered, they're pronounced the same but the 'male' pronoun is written as ‰ªñ and the 'female' pronoun is Â•π. Traditional Chinese characters for 'you' are also gendered, smh."
"I'm sorry but I'm fucking turned on by this somehow! I'm sorry. I'm really fucking sorry! with that aside, I love your voice but man! I couldn't understand you! had to turn on captions (yeah, not a native speaker) . also, some of the terms you used were offensive. maybe you don't care but it may offend someone else and make their day worse so maybe limit that please."

"'I'm pretty indifferent about breasts and surgery - and indifference is not enough to justify surgery' YES!! FINALLY SOMEONE ELSE WHO FEELS LIKE THIS"
"I'm seriously asking myself if genderqueers would still exist in a world with less stereotypical gender models.  I don't like sports, cars/trucks, guns, red meat, model fps, action movies and hunting (animals and women). I don't really feel like a man, except in the cases when mens are judge as a whole, but I also REALLY don't feel like a woman. I mostly identify as a leftist geek :)"

"when ur headcanon becomes real canon"
"'THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS!!'  Me:... what about Hermaphrodites? Who literally have both fully functioning female and male parts...  This of course is just using their 'logic' of what gender is. Not all of that brilliant stuff you just said there."

"YOU ARE A GORGEOUS HUMAN BEING!"
"I don't agree with much of what you say, but it's great to see someone making clear-minded (not to mention entertaining) videos trying to explain their point of view and experience in an honest way. Keep it up."
"you should do drag"
"Dude.  You're a dude.  Everything you believe is tainted by this denial and refusal to accept your true self.  A white MAN.  Instead of trying to become a quirky and effeminate man, you have adopted this fake identity.  Look at you, you are not expressing yourself, you've created yourself an identity.  You are obviously talented and smart but you are not real.  It isn't the truth, it looks real, it feels real but it just ain't true."
"Hello ContraPoints,   I have a question and understand I mean no offense in my asking, I seek only to increase my understanding.  I am so used to the idea that Gender is only a social construct, and in fact I have read excessive research showing evidence to this idea. If gender is a social construct, how can one person identify as one gender or another? What makes a male human want to identify as a female human if the labels, or at least gender roles, are simply socially constructed? Is that not a conflict of logic? I can understand choosing not to identify with either of the socially constructed roles, but choosing to identify with your opposite seems problematic, if it is simply a construction for the female sex in the first place?  What makes one sex of person want to conform to the societal constructed gender role of the opposite sex? This is my confusion with this topic."
"Well you got the queer part right"
"How uninteresting and inconsequential...."
"'A rapid, disorienting alteration between the two'? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!! Srsly tho, I'm going to do this any time I talk about you and your videos to anyone! I'll even throw they/them into the mix as well if you like!"
"you are my new fav youtuber!"
"I recently (two days ago) decided to label myself as genderqueer, but I still make fun of the lgbtiq community respectfully. I like attack helicopter jokes and I think it's okay to make fun of something as long as you aren't offending someone present atm. It's possible to take something seriously and still joke about it pretending that you don't take it seriously. That's just my opinion tho."
"As for pronouns, I'll just call you ContraPoints„Åï„Çì. Also, maybe we need a different word than gender, since it already has very particular association. What, you want _me_ to come up with it? You do it."
"Fantastc, you are who you are....  Superiority condescension delivered on a well spoken plater comes across as someone trying to mask something they may not like about themselves by compensating and trying to make themselves appear better somehow (in this case more intelligent and well spoken) therefore, in their minds their argument cannot possibly be wrong or even questioned especially by the lesser 'idiots' they're lecturing.  For some reason condescending people always seem to wind up doing or demonstrating the exact thing they' were so offended about in the first place.  Speaking as gender rigid person I'll tell you that, if you're at all interested (I'm reasonably sure you're not even though you've based your whole life around having a freak sensitivity to sexual offensiveness) I wasn't offended by your demeaning and crude characterizations of heterosexual sex."
"There is gendered pronouns in Mandarin in writing though like Â•π (she) and ‰ªñ (he) but they're both pronounced 'Ta'. Â•≥ meaning female and the ‰∫ªmeaning people (instead of male) in radicle form the proper word being ‰∫∫. So there's still a form of gendered referencing and men as always are the 'norm'. ÂÆÉ is the gender neutral 'They' and Áâ† is 'They' for animals. Like in french, when referencing the singular unknown gender 'Il' (he) is used instead of an equivalent of 'They' for a gender neutral term."
"I'm gonna kill myself now"
"Comrade is my favorite gender neutral pronoun"
"So isn't everyone 'genderfluid' or 'nonbinary'? No one 100% fits into these 'male' and 'female' boxes. I dont like the term gender because I don't understand it at all. It seems that of course the thing the term gender refers to (social experience of sex? male and female roles?) is fluid. So I am a biological female, I have no gender/sex disphoria, sure there aret times I wouldn't mind having a dick but that's not my lot in life and I'm happy with a vagina..and I usually present in a feminine way. I do however LOVE androgynous styles too and will play around with that in the future. I don't really know how to 'present masculine' soo..there are certain male characters I would love to cosplay but frankly that is just hard for me, I am curvy with long hair. I would like to try anyway. But I do have both strong fem and strong masc traits in terms of personality. So idk what that means about gender, but it's never felt very prudent to me to have a gender label. IDK!"
"Very relatable video. Thank you for making it!  <3"
"I was searching everywhere for a definition of genderqueer, but it was hard finding a clear answer (someone hinted I might be genderqueer so I wondered what the hell that means). This was hilarious, informative and very helpful. Thank you"
"I identify as a liker of pretty things and I perceive you as pretty. Unfortunately my predisposition toward penis-in-vagina coital engagement renders me less compatible to many not-vagina-having people whom I consider pretty. I wish there was a shot I could take that would suddenly make buttsecks not seem gross to me anymore and also make dongs at least the tiniest bit appealing, but I don't even like my own x_x but because I'm a human, I like pattern recognition and crave to identify a pattern that matches me and attach a label to it so other people can possibly grasp what the fuck my deal is even though possessing such a label would just prompt them to discard me as some sort of sexual deviant and/or 'fag'. But hey I'd totally take you out on the town for drinks or food or a movie or whatever and I like knowing that so I've got that going for me I guess which is nice."

"Ahh. This video is wonderful and I appreciate its existence. Thank you for expressing some info on genderqueer folk and the differences between that and NB and cis and yeah! Go team."
"I love you Contrapoints!!!"
"Contra, I have literally had a bloody revelation. I am 16 years old boy, and am bisexual, but my experience with sexuality has never been consistent, it has been fluid. Some years I liked dudes, some girls. I thought this was the reason that I felt the way I did, but I realise now that I have a similar dysphoria (I think it‚Äôs mild) I HATE body hair on myself SO MUCH, especially facial. I pluck every day. I have a small waist, and a generally feminine figure, but   I am not and never have been dysphoric about my day breasts or genitals. I am also dysphoric about my shoulder with, hair line and jaw and chin. Which makes me think, is my dysphoria not strong, because I already have a lot of femenina features? Is that maybe the same for you? But I feel like we shouldn‚Äôt Throw the word trans around unless someone has medically transitioned. It just gets confusing. Why not use the word ‚Äúdysphoric‚Äù because it Maia a lot more sense. Despite what you say, I will fail to see more than 2 genders. However some non binary identities make some sense now that it isn‚Äôt just an androgynous hair cut and gender isn‚Äôt just black and white to me anymore , but I won‚Äôt label myself with anything, dysphoric will do for now, but thank you so much for this video, it has changed ALOT for me."

"This video has made me question my gender _fuck_"
"It clearly sounds like you have not sorted any of this out. You have rationalizatied it, but rationalizations are pretty arbitrary if you don't go through all levels of analysis.  The reason people take you more serious than other self-proclaimed genderqeers is that you are very entertaining, somewhat witty and self-aware to a degree. Still doesn't make you right. You clearly are troubled and admit to it. How do you know this genderqeer-buisness isn't just the manifestation of some of your known or maybe unknown issues? You might be fooling a lot of people, but it won't do you any good in the long run."
"Well the reason sex can't be strictly divided into exactly 2 perfect categories is because life exists on a spectrum naturally..and human languages FAILS to convey this variety and complexity well. As I think is to be expected. The result (sex) is greater than the sum of its parts (hormones, genes) but at a certain point you've crossed the threshold from man to woman or vice versa and we usually understand approximately when. Just as in birth there is no exact moment of birth (will you count by second? nanosecond? this is pointless trying to cut time down into smaller and smaller bits to understand anything). at a certain point you are unborn and at another born, trying to figure out exactly when so you can fit it into a label box is not realistic or even very helpful.   To me, if gender is the way we are treated or expected to behave socially, that's not a very meaningful thing to me. Certain pressures will affect me, such as possibly being embarrassed if I had to explain my lack of kids if I had chosen to be child free due to the expectation that women want and will have babies, but I don't identify with that shit if anything it's a nuisance. I just dont understand why social roles and preferred behavior need a label called gender, isn't this very vapid and shallow? As a future psychiatric nurse practitioner, looking at the social pressures and reinforcement, and general social environment that a person has grown up with/lives in is VERY useful, we are all SO complex, but why would I limit these social pressures/desires by creating two groups arbitrarily called 'woman' and 'man' and try and squeeze people into those? That's stupid. If gender develops from something social, then yes there are infinite possibilities for identities that develop there after. Like fingerprints. But creating groups from this.. well, factors like abused/not abuses, socioeconomic status, parents views on sexuality etc etc all color the person but where do we get man and woman from! You like to wear dresses and makeup, contra. That these things are feminine is arbitrary! Unless you very specifically enjoy these things BECAUSE you like to pretend to be a woman (I assume this is not the case), then it is not 'unmasculine' for you to wear these things! It is 'traditionally unmasculine' if you give a shit about traditional gender roles, but gender roles are bullshit so men can do whatever they want and unless they are specifically trying to feel like or be a woman, then they are still masculine men in my eyes. You can knit and cook and work as an art teacher and like reading- I dont care, thats just your perosnality and preferences, you are still a man on every level unless you begin to experience disphoria.  I think this entire problem comes from semantics. 'Gender' is a shitty vague word for a not very meaningful and limited view of a much wider concept."
"Inb4 she comes out as a transwoman lol"
"Fashion for men and woman is a social construct. So everything from hair length to cocktail dresses is just social. Just do you. Don't expect me to guess or care about your pronouns though."

"So, you have the same pronoun as desire from sandman? That's really kool!"
"So wait...what pronouns do you prefer!?"
"I just found your channel and I wanna marry you really hard."

"Love the creepy doll behind the door.  XD"
"Thank you for this! I am so happy you can be you!!!"
"That Fucking Doll Is Fucking Creepy!!"
"Not liking body/ facial hair is not gender Dysphoria. Also, while yes the clothes you are wearing, are not technically 'women's clothes' because they belong to you, they were designed for women, so I don't think the term 'cross dresser' is really un fitting. You are wearing clothes designed for women, hence the term 'cross dresser'. To me it seems like your a man who wears clothes designed for women. That doesn't make you 'Gender queer', it makes you a man in a dress and makeup."
"Please do not use that outlet unless you clean the smashed weiner out first.  It smells terrible, trust me."

"Holy shit! This video made me realize I'm fucking genderqueer! I never looked into the concept but for the last year, I've been more and more uncomfortable as being identified as female, but don't identify as male either. I eventually became so fed up I kept telling everyone I was human not a woman (since my not behaving like a lady is a point of interest in my family). In any case, thanks ContraPoints!"

I enjoy stereotypical male things (weightlifting, tattoos, boxing, heavy metal, science) and I grew up being a tomboy. But I don't feel like a boy, either. I feel more like a girl than a boy, but not 100% like a girl. Like something in-between. What is wrong with me :("

"Ok liked this saw you briefly with Blair White so searched more.

"Insistence on the preservation of the binary model isn't about denying anyone's existence, it's about preserving a foundation of how we function as a society. People generally don't care about others enough to deny their existence."
"Gender is a ''social and psychological concept'' while ''sex is biological'' only if you define them like this with the explicit intent of leaving biology out of gender (which is precisely how and why the term gender was reinvented in the 60-70ies). This gives you an asinine concept that has no basis in reality which is why ''gender science'' makes so little sense. To fully explain gender you'd need a complete model that includes the biological, psychological, sociological and cultural componenent, basically: Gender = sex + bla + bla + bla..."
"I've already watched this video three times and GENDER TREASON makes me cackle every time."

"Thanks for this video, I'm on a similar journey from transvestite/weirdo to realizing I'm probably non binary/genderqueer."
"I love that you made this video, because it puts words to an aspect of myself I've known about for a long time but have kept to myself, and it's providing sufficient inspiration to come the rest of the way out. I hate that you made it for the same reason... Video response in the works. Thx, ContraPoints."
"Why is this the best explanation I've heard of genderqueer identity on Youtube? Also, I'm just so grateful for your honesty. Judging by your persona, not being smarmy and detached about it might 've been hard. I really enjoy your self-esteem, and I hope to emulate it someday."
"Look you idiot, don't you know this is the INTERNET? What the fuck do you think, genuine, reasonable emotional honesty will achieve?  I watched your debate with blaire and it only took me 8 minutes to realize you factoring in fuckin gay ass EMPATHY would render any argument pointless. This is the internet, where being maybe kinda but not even really technically true is a good enough reason to speak to people HOWEVER I want because I'M RATIONAL GODDAMNIT.  Seriously though your content makes me feel warm on the inside and it's really nice to see someone trying to just like, discuss topics? it's been a while since I've trusted a Youtubers intention because while you try to be comedic, there's a genuine vulnerability you allow to be in your videos. I can only imagine the shit you get. Anyway keep up the good work hun, it's really great stuff."
"Aww, cheer up sweetheart; *we're* horrified by you too..."
"By the way there are gendered pronouns in Chinese: ‰ªñ(him) Â•π(her) ÂÆÉ(it). But I believe they are only used in mainland China while HK, Macau and Taiwan just stick to ‰ªñ"
"You are sooooooooooooooo beautiful and to me your body just looks perfect to me. Sorry if this sounds objectificationish but really I'm trying to make a compliment. TvT so beautiful and so intelligent."
"I love everything about this video, except for that damn porcelain doll, which is for sure going to give me nightmares.  Seriously though, thank you for creating this."
"yes you are a man in womens clothes. They are yours, but they were still designed for a woman to wear. They are female attire.  You are a very feminine man. be proud of that, not something to be ashamed or horrified at. There are many men like you. you arent trans, what you described leads me to believe you arent. Transition isnt for you. I could be wrong, perhaps getting some help to solve that may not be a bad idea. But with your education you may be more educated on the matter than any professional."
"your wonderful and beautiful!"
"I spent the entire watching if the doll would move"
"The genderfluid flag is green and purple?    >:] noice"
"This is super fucking late to the party, but it's really cool and comforting to see an adulty-adult genderqueer person out and about in the world, you're one of the few I've seen that isn't my age or younger, and you're angry and loud. Bonus points for a fellow drinky hedonist genderqueer person! I can't tell whether to be attracted to you or adopt you as my genderless alcoholic parent. Maybe both, that sounds fun and horrifying!"
"I'm as anti-SJW as they come but in this topic I totally side with 'SJWs' and you. Let people have the freaking gender (or any other definition) they want. Just don't fine people up to 250k for calling them the wrong pronouns, as it already happens in New York."
"For people watching this who are thinking 'I don't *feel* I'm a man/woman, I just am' maybe that's because your assigned gender fits you, and it feels natural? It's easy to forget we're swimming through 15lbs of air, because we're used to it."
"Only 2 genders"
"'I'm genderqueerly transitioning between something imaginary and something non-existent! IM SO SPECIAL! Don't think of me as a gay man Just because i'm a bloke who takes it in the arse. NEVER! I'm a genderqueer snowflake fucktard man!!!'                 -----Why not just move on to a less retarded trend... Someone said yoyo's are back perhaps you'd enjoy that."
"you are a fucking badass"
"Non binary =‚ùå= Transgender"
"Well there goes my straightness, *yells from a distance* byyyyye straightneeeeeess. I literally just hitted on all those genders you listed. I'm gonna go eat something now LOL. (Luv this vid though). <3"
"You are my hero, heroine, whatever. You are great. Peace."
"you're...... ethereally beautiful??????????? i'm gay"
"I think you're cool c:"
"Just wanted to say I'm a new-ish fan; love your videos, love your humor, and your fashion is always so Goddamn wonderful. That top is amazing."
"Actually Chinese does have gendered pronouns, but only when they're written down. Â•π (she) vs ‰ªñ (he) Both of them are pronounced 'ta' though."
"This video made me so happy! Thank you for making this awesome video!! ‚ù§"
"You are wonderful and I love you, in both a 'you affirm and inspire me with your clever arguments and rhetoric' sense and a 'I want to jump your bones you wildly sexy man/woman you' sense."
"Thank you for this. My girlfriend (who was born male) thinks genderqueer/trans fits how she feels. I identify as straight, but I love her. She is still figuring this all out, so I am just trying to learn all I can so I can be supportive as one's favorite bra!"
"First video I watched trying to figure out me and I found you. Thank you ContraPoints"
"I was born biologically a male. I am a male. Do i therefore identify as a male or is the whole identity thing just here-say breezy grass that changes depending on what time of the fucking year it is. It just doesn't make any fucking logical sense.."
"First video i watched and I'm already in love! Your content is great! The way you present it is EVEN BETTER!"
"Where did you get that top from? Also your aesthetic reminds me of the counter culture theatre days that I haven't seen much later."
"lmao transexual is not a gender. Jesus Christ, these people are stupid."
"I've never cared much about my own gender. I'm male, but not a particularly great example of masculinity, and if I was somehow instantly transformed into a female I don't think I'd find that either disastrous or miraculous. Therefore it's kind of tough for me to understand these kinds of concepts.  But the thing is... so what? I don't have to fully understand, or be able to completely empathise, to accept what *other* people feel about *their* own selves. I will never understand why so many people feel this bizarre desire to enforce their own standards, to police the way other people define themselves."
"8:50 - Wrong, while spoken Chinese lacks them,¬†they exist¬†in written Chinese."
"Question: can one be both pansexual and a trans boy?"
"I'm honestly fucking inspired"
"I am proud of you though"
"There are only two genders"
"go die."
"OMG I think I found my new role model!! I thought I was weird for wanting to 'randomly' switch up my preferred pronouns (well, maybe it is still weird, but at least now I have concrete evidence that it is not exclusively 'me' weird)  I tend to believe most of my queer friends think I'm just in some kind of 'coming out limbo' when the reality is I'm just not super concerned with how other people perceive/refer to me, as long as they're respectful. LOVE the videos! you make me think AND make me laugh. And. really, what more can we ask from our dear content creators? Keep it up lovely ;-)"
"Your awesome!"
"you are basically a gay lunatic who would like to be a woman because he cannot compete with his male environment as his crappy genetics left him to a pathetic low-testosterone body"
"'Alleged emotional benefits...' Beautiful."
"the fucking hotdog part oh my god. lost my shit"
"To anyone who is looking for info on genderqueer people: Dutch filmmaker Sophie Dros made a documentary called 'Genderbende', about the lives of five genderqueers. I think it was done really well. Doesn't really 'explain the term' but does give viewers a frame of reference. Sadly in Dutch, but maybe there is a subtitled version."
"I thought you were a MEYAHN! Everyone was MEYAHN in 2016!"
"I told my grandpa I was gender queer and he told me that queer is a very offincive term and I just walked away got a monster energy and got to explaining what gender queer was let's just say I am never doing that again"
"I like your voice"
"This is pure degenracy dressed up as pseudo intellectualism"
"I drink genderfluid for breakfast in my cereal"
"like the honesty also he/she/it has a great taste in fashion."
"and some just did it on weekend for fun   i love that dress"
"Your not a unique gender, your are just a cross dresser."
"It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders"
"You're a guy, though."
"You got one thing right,its just a fucking banner.Real humans dont give a fuck about your psychosis."
"Wow!"
"Is it weird how I am like fucking falling in love with this god damned human being? like omfg, shaddup and stop making me love you more."
"contra, thank you for this vid. when you talked about the relationship between your self-loathing and gender identity...you may have sparked something"
"It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders."
"TL;DW  It means you're an enspasticated freak. Self defined enspasticated freak, but enspasticated freak none-the-less.  Wow, I guess post-portmanteau, anyone can make up words."
"Good video but OMG that doll in the background creeps me out!!!"
"I like the sound of the hot dogs hitting each other."
"Please don't show your dolls in videos. They are very creepy and distracting."
"wow thanks for this video! helping figure myself out, thanks again!"
"Gender is an intersection of cultural and biological influences. To declare that it is ONLY a social construct is what I am opposed to. Thus is a dangerous cultural trend. Sexual dimorphism evolved to protect our species. Also, that dimorphism, at the biological level, influences and contributes greatly to how sexes behave and relate to one another. There is a clear genetic interest behind how the sexes relate to one another that is well-studied and well-documented by scientists. There is years of data accumulated on this that can't just be dismissed because some folks who have a gender dysphoric condition have made an arbitrary decision to do so. I am all for people expressing  wherever they are on that intersection, (I myself have gotten a lot of thrills from being a cross- dresser, although I have gotten away from it), but I don't agree with outright dismissal of the dimorphic category and the importance of what it has contributed to culture. There are reasons why the 'free-love' part of the Sexual revolution never really became mainstream too. Gender and sexuality are, in large part, a social and cultural construct, but what is being misrepresented in this new cultural fad is how much biology has played a role in giving rise to those constructs. I'm not moralizing here. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' sexuality or gender identity, but I have seen this idea being abused. The treatment of gender dysphoria (and whether or not it should include sexual reassignment to any particular patient) is not something to be taken lightly. To interrupt and alter ones hormonal with synthetic hormones and undergo the change can have consequences that must be considered and understood. There can be serious risk of it interfering with normal organ functioning.    Some people are being so unbelievably reductive in their reasoning on this issue, and I am really bothered by it."
"I need help. I identify as a girl and am straight (I like guys), but I prefer wearing male clothes (MOST days) but some days (VERY FEW) I actually feel feminine and wear female clothes. I 'behave' and feel like a 'male' most days, but some days I feel and 'behave' like a 'female.' SOMETIMES when I get mistaken as a guy, I secretly like it, but I still correct them that I'm a female. I, however, don't really want to be a male. Sounds nice, but I wouldn't transition. Help."
"Your voice is actually pretty androgynous as it is."
"You're hair is really pretty btw üòÑ"
"Everything that Contra says about gender ideology is just fucking idiotic...  but dammit I can't help but like him."
"Why do you act like you can't be queer AND drink yourself to death?"
"Your take on sex education had me laughing hysterically!"
"Let me guess: the doctor was wearing a handkerchief on the head?"
"Feminists, anti-feminists cmon why can't we get along. What's that one song I'm thinking of?"
"i love you contra points"
"I'm old(ish) (60). Growing up, you would have probably expressed yourself as a cross dresser. What's the big deal? Why all the semantics? Why especially, all the claimed victimhood? I grew up in San Francisco, and have known gay and transgender people all my adult life. Acceptance was much lower in my youth, but they sure complained a lot less, and seemed just as happy"
"I'm a non-binary YouTuber, and have gotten a moderate amount of hate in the comment sections of my videos, but the comment section in this video is amazingly civil. Your style seems to be an effective way of reaching people in a way that disgruntled, humorless liberal feminists can't."
"So how many people now are considering the preparations requires to have a kinky night in fucking their electrical sockets?"
"I respect you 'cuz you seem like a nice person (<- problem solved) but i don't respect the ones which think that the world roundarounds around them and tragically taint this topic with bad vibes you know what i mean?  live and let live. i don't care. everyone that thinks i must care because i'm cis, bad luck, i don't. myself treats everyone as same as i can. i won't go punching altrighters, i won't go punching fags, i won't go and punch people that couldn't read the word fag without a social-justice standart-protocol-operation happening in their brain. I will stay here and have no issues with you. no matters. i don't care. (blablabla but you do care cuz you write, no i don't, i don't care) i don't care, i won't learn the pronoun list and refere to anyone as 'you' and use the less awkward pronoun in 3rd p. What the fuck is the problem. if anyone did just that zap zap social meritocracy more or rather less."
"u look so good in that dress im shook"
"As an old fart, I really thought the different genders was all a bunch of silly teenager nonsense... until I saw this video. Don't ever feel like you aren't making an impact on people or changing minds. You are.  And this is coming from somebody who watches Sargon..."
"Shit... The doll... Its scaring as fuck üòÇüòÇ"
"Can I make out with you a bit?"
"your point from 1:40 to 1: 51 is wrong. It's actually just to simplify things as the binary easier to handle and works in the majority of contexts"
"I will call you schglee and schgler."
"There are guys, myself included, that don't like their body hair or facial hair and see it as a nuisance. However, I am often too lazy to do anything about it because worrying about my body hair is just takes a lot of mental energy, and takes work to maintain that. I usually won't shave until it starts to get uncomfortable. Something to consider is that body hair just sucks in general."
"THAT FUCKING DOLL IS CREEPY AF!"
"I still think the non-binary premise is dumb, but at least the video isn't un-pallatable.  I think in your mid-40's you are just going to be another dude who works a normal job and is long over this trendy, hipster identity."
"It's weird seeing so much of myself in what you're saying, and how much of the broad strokes also apply to me, while at the same time when you look at the details I'm nearly the opposite of you."
"You bring up the counterpoint of these feelings not being unique but dont really refute it (or did i miss it?). I don't think many people feel 100% male/female. Most people consider something part of their identity that is generally associated with the opposite sex. Doesn't this make the term obsolete?"
"Good job!!!!!!  i don't beleive in genderqueer.  However, this is by FAR the best video I've seen to help people understand it."
"You had me at 'I drink taxes'"
"I can handle you because you allow do not demand I call you by something made-up, nor something grammatically or biologically incorrect. Simply, you do not try to confuse me.  English is actually the only language I know that does not even use gendered pronouns to refer to inanimate objects. Say, in German, you would call a table 'he.' It is just how it it. It is not about feelings; it is about structure. If one were to make a new language or learn Japanese, where there are no gendered or numerically indicative pronouns, I would have no issue with calling people by genderless pronouns. Unfortunately, this is just not how English works. It is not.  I learn languages based off their utility and the cultural aspects behind them to which I relate. I use grammar properly to keep track of which language I am speaking. If something as necessary as grammar is too much for some people, they can learn a language to sate that part of themselves; and I will encourage it."
"I love this so much. ‚ù§"
"Great video. I recently became a fan of your due to a shared video by the1janitor. I do have some questions thought that I have been struggling with. While I fully realize that there are more than 2 genders and totally understand why someone could be somewhere in between, how does agender work? I get being somewhere different in spectrum between male and female genders, but being off the spectrum completely? What kind of evidence is there to support this? There has been a lot of study into gender, particularly recently, and there is some hard science behind there being a diverse gender spectrum. But how could a person exist completely outside of that?  Also, it seems to me a lot of gender terms mean the same thing, or are just terms people flock to because they like the idea of it. How is Two-Spirit (an old negative American term) any different from non-binary? Wouldn't it be better to be specific about gender definitions to make the overall message easier to communicate?  Finally, you mentioned people doing this for attention, while I don't think most people change their gender identity for attention, do you think that this ever happens? Gender identities outside of male and female have existed in some way longer than written history. There is no denying that. But based on the prevalence of the topic now, it seems that some people who never would have given a second thought to gender or pronouns 10 years ago are now a whole new gender with a new set of pronouns, and sometimes those things change daily. Do you think this is helpful or more hurtful toward people struggling from real gender identity issues?  Anyway, great channel and thanks for your point of view on the topic."
"Did you just call Mandarin 'Chinese?'"
"Where has this channel been my whole life???"
"I just subscribed to your channel and I'm going back watching some of your older content.  It's only the special snowflakes that get upset over what somebody politely asks you to call them."
"Pretty sure it's not polite to call people transgender people 'a thing' ;-)"
"That fucking doll is so goddamn creepy"
"Damn I live this dudechick"
"You like Black Music right? we turned freak into a positive word back in the 70s do you"
"I love her so much, y'all. It's a problem.  And on a completely unrelated note: just so folks know, there are a lot of clinics/health centers/planned parenthood centers that administer HRT for trans people on a model of informed consent; i.e. no permission slip from a therapist required."
"I identify as ContraQueer. As in, I'm straight but would totally go gay for ContraPoints."
"i really appreciate this video but holy shit the entire time i could only focus on the doll in the background"
"THis editting is awesome."
"This is hilarious"
"Thi TRAP is definitely gay."
"Browsing through your catalogue I click on video after video telling myself 'get ready for the fucking cringe' and you don't deliver. Where's the cringe? Why don't you validate my established beliefs? C'mon, throw me a bone here!"
"The stereotype is accurate in this case. You are a cross-dresser. Fine, good for you. I have no opinion of you, what-so-ever, based on that. The rest, however, is a pretense. Your life, your pretense, your business, but a pretense none-the-less. Are you familiar with the woman who insists she's a cat? Is she a cat? If so should she have human rights? You know, the rights humans have and a cat does not... Then there is the heart-warming tale of the woman who decided she was trans-disabled: a blind woman trapped in a sighted woman's body. She got her deranged therapist to pour bleach in her eyes and, well, now she really is blind I guess. BUT, is she, you know, sane? At what point do we take a step back and admit we are dealing with a delusion?"
"YO my respect for you just SKYROCKETED. From one nonbinary person to another, thanks so much for this. For like, everything you do. I do want to say, though, that despite what some of the community might say, you don't need to seek surgery or HRT to be a trans woman. I'm a nonbinary trans guy myself and aside from one or two nitpicks, I'm not interested in hormones or surgery either. There is no right way to be a man, or a woman."
"Most of the teenagers who go around screaming 'two genders' haven't taken any further biology classes. They can't concieve that things might be more complicated than their high school biology class"
"I JUST FOUND YOUR CHANNEL AND I ADORE YOU"
"I am so inspired."
"So I know you brought up a good point and spent a lot of time editing your video together, but you aren't actually a genderqueer, because sargon of akkad and paul josep watson told me that not identifying as a man or a woman is wrong and you shouldnt do that so i've alerted the authorities to come over and make you into a real man(tm)"
"Sounds pretty reasonable to me. üòó‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"What is being mentally ill? And why is gender dysphoria not the same?"
"contra is a beautiful bae and i love her and he will always have a special place in my cold dead heart ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"'you're a fucking white male'"
"'I'm not that inspiring of a person.' Fuck you, as of now you're my favourite genderqueer representation on youtube. Ily, you make me proud to be genderqueer."
"You're a fucking freak!"
"just found you yesterday and I love your videos honestly. I'm non binary and I love your humour and the way you articulate. your videos are aesthetically pleasing too üëÄ"
"I just started coming into terms with being genderqueer myself. Thanks for this."
"for how I see it, when it comes to biology there is only 2 sexes and those who are trans, who are those who simply want to pass from one sex to the other gender instead as a concept have been changed so much by now that have no more a real meaning since everyone can create something new to use as an aboslute self definition ,so for how I see it is just a personal preference that may or may not have some connection with sexuality or the lack of it... by definition I am a male, but when it come to the way I express myself I act/talk like such but I dress/look androginous on the feminine side most of the times , why ? because is just a way I like to express my self and have NOTHING to do with my gender/sexuality also when I dress in 'girl mode' how my friends call it, I never try to pass or act as a girl since i'm not one and I don't want to be one...I'm just a guy with an open mind and more freedom than others when it comes to self expression I do realize however that this description for some may not work the same way it does for me, ultimately the most important thing is being happy with yourself the way you better feel YOU, and I respect that but only until you respect others( who may not see things the same way you do) as well is simple, if you don't respect you won't be respected !"
"Definition of gender 1 a :  a subclass within a grammatical class (such as noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb) of a language that is partly arbitrary but also partly based on distinguishable characteristics (such as shape, social rank, manner of existence, or SEX) and that determines agreement with and selection of other words or grammatical forms"
"when i was in school we had no words for how i fealt so i identified as 3rd gender. guess the technical term for what i am is bi gender now... hm"
"Nice! I'm genderqueer too, and an adult. I hate when people say it's an edgy teen thing. Gender variance is as old as humanity itself."
"Honestly, hearing you talk about your gender like this kind of made me a little more confident in my own label. I've always had doubts about like... not being feminine enough to claim feminine pronouns, but at the end of the day, 'transfeminine' fits me fine. I have my masculine aspects, and I shouldn't be ashamed of them. And I can claim whatever fucking pronouns I want. BE GLAD I DON'T CLAIM GORBLAT/FLORGAN/DROOGLE AS MY PRONOUNS, YOU CIS HET SCUM!  (Seriously. Caling people cis het scum NEVER gets old.)"
"Oh, yes. Calling people cis scum never gets old. It's literally the best part of the whole package."
"My son is trans, this is a brilliant explanation, thank you. You're wonderful."
"Is there room for being a part-time genderqueer? What if you feel gender neutral 60% of the time and more polarized in the remaining time when you need to put on some performance for fun or for utility or just because the mood strikes you?"
"Fuck your hair is pretty. Maybe I should condition.  I feel pretty learned from this, thank you."
"It has always just baffled me when people say 'there are only two sexes /genders' as if intersex people do not or have never existed."
"Mikey-chan loves this video!!!! We should hang out"
"that doll in the doorway is gonna kill somebody"
"anabel in the background, y'all."
"let me borrow that top!"
"you may say it's too much to ask for a rapid disorienting switch in pronouns but my friends and i (who already rapidly switch between 2+ languages in conversation) have been doing this across all the languages we speak and it's been fun and not difficult at all!  hope you're doing well and good luck with everything!"
"animals are normal than us smh"
"not gonna lie... i love that dress/top"
"Ooooh, I get it. You're mentally ill. That's cool."
"Part 4 answers- 1) No, you're asking, demanding in some cases, people to accept your trendy bullshit. You aren't the first bisexual cross-dresser that has wanted to feel special. You aren't special, you're just a dude.  There's that word. Demand. You're literally demanding something you are not owed. 2) pointless is as pointless does. WHY doesn't matter to me. WHY has to do with your, and others, feelings, and I can't be bothered with those. 3)Trick objection, as I haven't seen a GOOD feminist since the 80's. You know, when women actually needed a movement in the civilized world. Extra points for using a multiple time debunked insane rich white girl from the posh section of Britain as a reference.Reproductive rights is a misnomer, by the way. We live in a society. If you wish to be part of such, and, honestly your only other choice is leaving, you follow its' rules. If you want abortions, go somewhere where they're allowed. If you can't, sucks for you, it's not really my problem. Callous, I know, but there it is. Society. I don't have to care about your  problems. 4) It sort of is, though, as gender is more often than not been used as a synonym for sex. I see your post grade drop out studies with my degree in English. I'm afraid when it comes to words, I am an expert.  You can call yourself whatever you like. You just can't expect others to go along with it."
"I mean, it is fake. lol."
"Do you have a good argument as to why society should make some fairly radical changes to accommodate an extremely small % of the population. especially considering they are unlikely to do so? Do you feel like things like bill C16 is creating more problems for genderqueer people such as yourself? Do you have a video that explains how someone can be 'nowhere' on 'the spectrum'? It seems to me that gender is an important part of human identity. While I'm not gay or transgender, I can imagine what it's like to be these things by simply comparing my own sexual attraction or feelings like a man. OTOH, I cannot even conceptualize what it's like to be a human without a gender identity (that is, to be 'nowhere' on the 'spectrum'."
"But you can't write it off. If you are what you say you are, you must explain it, defend it. The proof is your weight, not mine."
"it means you're an attention whore  hope i helped"
"When it comes to the defintition of gender, society up until recently has used the term gender and sex interchangebly (sp?).¬† In our current society We realize that they are not the same and that sex should only refer to ones reproductive system-which in the past also determined ones Gender (not their sexuality or nowadays 'identify').¬† I disagree with you¬†though when you say that anatomy¬†and primary or secondary characteristics are not binary!?¬† In humans, If it can only be altered medically than yes¬†they are.¬† Yes I am aware that certain species of fish, amphibians and even reptiles can change gender! When it comes to humans and mammals for that matter the binary system is pretty much set in stone.¬† Sure if one takes hormones, the body will accept them and alter characterstics and functions because it reckognizes them and do exist in minute quantities.¬† However mens bodies do not produce (enough) estrogen to become feminine/females nor¬†do women produce (enough) testosternone to become males/masuculine.¬† At least sciene hasnt found yet how to turn on those receptors and activate the glands which produce said hormones.¬† Even if so biological 'binary' men and women are still going to retain their respected reproductive organs.¬† Perhaps you could explain a bit more in detail what you meant when you said that 'primary and secondary sex characteristics are not strictly binary'¬†¬† Thanks"
"Thank you (sir and or maam) for explaining the different genders to me without the patronizing tone or sounding like a bunch of rambling teens in high school that cannot stick to one point at a time.¬† Even though I am not sure if I agree to all of your points or not, I do again appreciate your videos and speaking points which are done in a practical, logical and civil non accusatory manner."
"There's nothing wrong with being a gender nonconforming male."
"Hey, why not try to be tolerant?  You show the same bigotry you chastise people for by dismissing one gender, no matter how ridiculous it might seem to you. Grow up"
"Ironic Homophobia is SO last year.  If you do ever enter the Alphabet Soup that is currently LBT, please hyphenate G-Q in the acronym so that people don't mistakenly think the gays are still in it.  +3 for the response to Objection #1, catching on to the perils of assimilation-erasure."
"I wonder what June would think of this now..."
"I feel three genders is fine as well as three sexes after that your just making special term for your unique spot on the spectrum   Male - intersex - female   Male - genderqueer - female   But I think there needs to be a middle ground to these feelings   I am a cis male   Contrapoints the faggot girl he is a genderqueer man"
"protip, getting HRT is kinda not that hard. go to an informed consent clinic."
"I'd like to preface what I'm about to say with this: I'm not trying to speak solely to non binary or other individuals with  non traditional genders, nor am I speaking solely to trans individuals, or solely to cis individuals. I don't understand why gender is thing. Like at all. I appreciate the biological aspects, as well as the fact sex gender are separate, even if intertwined to a  extent. At the heart of it, my question boils down to 'What is a man?' besides a miserable little pile of secrets, of course. What does it mean to be a man, or a woman, or something else entirely? What purpose do those labels serve? I mean, I generally use masculine pronouns and identify as male, but that's only because I'm 6'2', broad shouldered and look good with a beard. But those are just antiquated traditional characteristics. I don't see what purpose they serve in our society and I really want to know what other people see in them."
"Love your channel!!!! I have a video editing question too! How do you get other videos so you can edit them into your video?"
"Biology effects your gender expression. Men and women in general have different behaviors. To say gender is just in your mind is bullshit. To say transgender people were born in the wrong body implies they have a brain which is opposite of their physical sex. Which means that their behavior is NOT a social construct. It is built into their minds. The double speak you people use to explain all this is just mind boggling."

"*There is a difference between Gender Queer* -- relating to Gender Expression (and these personal preference can develop over time at a much later age -- which can lead to moderate gender dysphoria). *And Transsexualism* - relating to innate Gender Identity (where a person is *born* with their brain-sex being incongruent wrt to the sex of the body, which can lead to persistent and intense gender dysphoria).  Gender Expression is a Social Construct; but Gender Identity is not.  ============= *Here are two links on the subject:*  Professor explains Gender Identity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erexuu8PTo8  Perhaps there can be a far more reliable way for diagnosis in the future. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322308010871  Transsexualism is a pretty rare intersex condition of the brain being incongruent with the body. However in recent years, the TransTrender movement have taken over to conflate crossdressers and fetishistic transvestites as part of the new 'Trangender' Umbrella. TransTrenders do not experience Gender Dysphoria like Transsexual people do. But rather, they experience 'Gender Euphoria'.   TL;DL (More Dicussions) Being a transwoman, I believe a clear conceptual distinction needs to be established between 'gender identity' and 'gender expression/roles', etc. I do acknowledge that it is possible for bi-gender individuals who are wired with a brain that is somewhere between a male-typical and a female-typical one do exist. Perhaps some of these people might end up feeling that they do not belong to either gender category (aka agender), which is perfectly fine too.   I only take issue with the political SJW TransTrender claim that 'gender' is merely a social construct.   In contrast with gender-roles and gender-expression; gender 'identity' is NOT a choice that one need to 'figure out' and something that we consciously choose for ourselves to adopt. Actual trans-people are already keenly aware on some level of our gender identity since a very young age even if we may not understand at the time how to put that innate sense of our gender-identity into words, and may struggle to admit it while living in a society intolerant of trans-people. But when we discover what transgenderism means, our experience of gender incongruity, since young, should immediately 'clicks' and make sense; not something that needed to be 'figured out what their 'PREFERENCE' is' as these TransTrenders claim.  * Gender-expression IS a social construct -- though I do support either sexes to freely express whichever way they want to.  * Gender roles and expectations too are social constructs -- and no body should be forcibly confined by it IMO. * However, the psychological 'gender-identity' of people are certainly NOT social constructs -- but rather, it is something that is innate to a person, based upon how they are wired mentally from birth. Evolved tendencies that had determined the survivability of our ancestors during prehistoric times.  Even physically or genetically 'intersex' individuals can be consistently categorized as a subset of the common binary 'sexes'. And similarly, so does the above-mentioned 'bi-gender' people, who are ultimately simply a sub-set of the gender binary category.  A vast majority of people of the two sexes do have intrinsic gender identity -- and associated behavioral patterns/tendencies that are recognizably and categorically 'typical' of them; and that is independent of nurture or social influences -- for instance, there was a story of a boy who lost his testicles due to an accident and his parents got the doctor to perform sexual-reassignment surgery (SRS) on him, and he was raised as a girl; but he ended up with intense gender dysphoria and attempted to medically transition physically back as a male w/o much success at the time, and committed suicide in the end. Even though he was raised as a girl, and have undergone SRS, psychologically, he remained as male as that was how his brain is wired from birth.  **[[A bit of discussion on Transsexualism first before moving on..:]]** The chromosomal-sex of a fetus is ‚Äúdecided‚Äù when the sperm and the egg combines, and after which, the genitalia starts to develop. The brain only develops significantly after the physical/genitalia sex of a fetus have been decided in the first 13 weeks, and is dependent upon the proper formation of the testes and its production of androgen and also the hormonal environment within the womb. Any disruption to the hormonal balance (or due to genetic insensitivity towards androgen, or other reasons) after which may result in a brain that significantly remains 'female-type' even though the 'sex' is that of male. If this 'disruption' occurs within the first 13 or so weeks during gestation, the baby may be born intersex (having both male and female characteristics -- even though the brain may remain female or have significantly developed more towards male). In a sense transsexualism can perhaps be viewed as an type of extreme intersex condition of the genitalia w.r.t. to the brain. In the past when the plasticiser DES (a xenoestrogen) was widely used, it have lead to a significantly higher rate of homosexualism, transsexualism and other intersex babies, coupled with higher rates of breast cancer for females and prostate cancer for males, and the effect was found to carry through a several generations. There are also higher cases of transsexualism in babies born from mothers who have taken certain premature-birth prevention drugs, and other xenoestrogens exists all around us (including insecticides, and even breakdown products of laundry power).  Why should person-hood be defined wrt to the 'brain' and not the body? -- We can think about it this way, via a thought experiment. If a person's brain is transported and swapped with another person's, does the person's ego (sense of self-hood) gets transported with the brain or remain with the body? So this is how I explain why the gender identity of diagnosed transsexual people (male-to-female, or female-to-male) who identifies with their 'gender' (that is incongruent to their 'sex'), *since very early adolescence*, can be justified in this sense.Yes, there may also be those who are agender, or perhaps mentally 'identify' that they fit somewhere in between (although I can't see how that will cause them to experience the same level of dysphoria that trans people experience); but none-withstanding all these are still *w.r.t.* to the *two* existing gender category regardless. The ad hoc introduction of 50 something 'new' gender category is just INSANE! But He, She, or a simple addition of 'They' (or just refer to the person by their name) do sound reasonable to me.---   *See Links:* https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/ https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan/ ===   What the majority of self-identified 'gender-queers' individuals (whom used to be referred to as Crossdressers or Transvestites) are referring to by the term 'gender' is more about their own current preference and experimentation in 'gender-expression' and presentation. In a way, it is similar to the 'emo/scene' trend. Although, there may be a minority within that do struggle with their bi-gender identity, experiencing sufficiently intense and persistent dysphoria, and a sense of gender-incongruity that is present 'since adolescent' (e.g. not something that only came up after finding out about the non-binary TransTrender culture from Tumbler or Youtube).  I am not against Transvestites (TVS) and Crossdressers (CD) exercising their freedom of 'expression' though (and I do believe the stigma against cis-men dressing as women for reasons other than due to a real conflict of innate gender identity should still be perfectly okie too) -- for instance, I think ContraPoints is pretty cool and I do enjoy his wits and his channel. However my only beef is his conflation of TVSes and CDing men with actual Transgender individuals who experience real gender-incongruity, and not doing it as an experimentation of gender-expression as a 'social construct'. My problem is with people like Stefonknee, a 60 year old man claiming that he is a 6 year old little girl; abandoning his wife and kids to live with his role-play adoptive 'parents' and have sex with them, while claiming to be a transgender person; when HE is obviously a fetishistic transvestite living out his BDSM fantasy. These is ultimately detrimental towards growing a proper understanding of the NEEDS of actual trans-people (e.g. those who suffers from persistent intense and maddening gender dysphoria as the result of the persistent and strong innate sense of gender incongruity ever since young -- not something that one suddenly 'discovered' from Tumbler or Youtube videos).   The incorrect claim by TransTrender groups that 'gender-identity' is nothing more than a social construct -- that people can pick and choose for themselves, or need to 'figure out' whatever they 'prefer' (like nothing more than figuring out what genre of music they like, or fashion suits their taste), etc. is harmful actual transpeople who experience REAL gender-incongruity, and transition not because it is a choice or a fun experimentation in gender-expression, but a clear NEED, to safe themselves from gender dysphoria.  Their introduction of an endless possible nonsense arbitrarily made-up 'genders' [sic], and an equal number of impractical pronouns to go along with them -- with the unreasonable expectation that it is even possible for people to adapt to a potentially infinite number of them -- are simply making a mockery of the experience of trans-people experiencing and struggling with ACTUAL gender incongruity (due to an actual brain-body incongruity intersex condition)."
"This is the first video I've seen by you, and as a nonbinary person, I'm really glad to find other people who are able to address these topics in interesting and informative ways. On another note, I spent half of this video terrified of that doll in the background."

"It's all binary. It's all 1s and 0s. Just because it isn't presented to you that way, or you can't see it that way. Doesn't mean it's not that way. At least if you approach it through science, and not feelings. Everything¬†brought up in this debate¬†is at least made of two parts. That is binary. You are made from the most basic reaction of two cells. Binary. 1s, 0s. I guess maybe I am using the actual definition of binary. Not some new PC definition though. So where in one aspect I would find myself to be correct, if there is another meaning that I don't understand. That might make my statement false. I'd like to see first how any other meaning was established before I decide to use the word in that fashion. So if anybody can explain to me what I'm missing I'd appreciate it. I know, this isn't my crowd and I may be abrasive. I really am though, trying to be nice and get into a conversation without being so serious that it gets heated. On a side note. Don't be disgusted in yourself. You don't owe anybody anything. You owe yourself happiness. If whatever you do doesn't hurt or cause damage to others. Do whatever it is that makes you happy. Those that mind don't matter and those that matter don't mind! There are a lot of freaks out there. Some of us freaks have far worse shit than sexuality or gender that makes us a freak lol."

"I don't recognise genderqueer because it assumes there are people who have a 'normal' gender. There are no people who are fully masculine or feminine. everyone has a gender that consists of a mix of traits from both genders. Everyone is genderqueer so the term is meaningless.    Shut up and disappear... well, to be honest I want you to shut up and disappear because I don't think you should have a reason to complain. As long as you do have a reason to complain I think it would be better to either promote acceptance in general instead of focussing on identities, or to actually work on a case by case basis."
"It's a bit sad how it's very obvious that people who find the fluidity of gender a hard concept to grasp,  must have never really studied history and anthropology thoroughly.  There are countless examples at different points in the development of Western culture that troll any of our current perceptions of gender. e.g. pink was originally a colour for men, being a derivitive of red. (Take that sexist toy companies...)  And just look at Hinduism!!! One of the oldest religions/culutral groups on the planet and it's full of androgynous, non-binary and other types of deities, that people worship!  ....here endeth my essay....

"I'm a fairly androgynous faguette but I still identify as male and to be completely honest, I do not see the need for labels suchas 'genderqueer', 'genderfluid', or 'non-binary'. However, I will always respect someone's wishes to be referred to with certain pronouns IF they're being reasonable and respectful about it.  Also, I am completely in love with your attitude about yourself. You're very honest about your insecurities while still making fun of yourself and not taking yourself too seriously. I'm pretty sure that if all the 'transtrenders' (I know that word has a negative connotation but I think you'll know who I'm talking about), were a little more chill and less SJW-y about their identities, they would experience a lot more acceptance than they do now."

"I feel pretty normal as I am, but I'm just incredibly indifferent to labels & also feel like all people, regardless of gender (or any other characteristic for that matter) are on the 'same team' so to speak. Does that qualify me to start using the term bigender to describe myself? Would pangender be more accurate? Do my feelings of normalcy disqualify me from the get go? Since I feel the same about race, would it be accurate to call myself panracial? Is that insensitive for some reason? I already call myself a cosmopolitan, which intentionally ambiguously means 'citizen of the world'. These are all legitimate questions I have. Loved the video, btw. Someone please answer.  P.S, Disregard the profile pic. I know it seems nationally specific, but I was just really uncreative when I set it, and I only keep it up because, much like your voice, it seems to incur a desirable level of treatment. Tried changing it once. Treatment was definitely different. So yeah. That was my conclusion."

You can identify yourself as ‚Äúgenderqueer‚Äú and others can identify you as man. No problem. BUT this is important: your term genderqueer has NO and i repeat NO evidence of existence in the world outside your head. Other than man. *So identify as you, but dont force it on others!!!* If you dont understand now, I cant help you."

"Well after seeing your debate against Bliare White, I'll admit that I mildly lost some.. I won't say 'respect' but credibility I guess and I'm still going to admit that I don't think Non-Binary is an actual thing. It's not from a lack of trying to understand, I tried so hard to understand but I just don't see it. But I'll admit that your explanation for 'Gender Queer' and how you think of the term, it does make sense as a form of expression. Particularly when you were explaining how you didn't feel intense dysphoria to justify transitioning or to be considered trans, how you don't necessarily hate your body but just the trait of body & facial hair (and believe me, I know the feeling, I hate that myself and would love to have some natural smooth skin instead of constantly shaving lol), and how in the end, you dress the way you want to dress (same here).   So I will say you did open my mind to at least your definition of Genderqueer and what sets you apart is that at least you're able to not take yourself too seriously. I can accept 'Genderqueer' as a form of expression but I think that's as far as I can mentally go with. I've seen that 77+ gender list and I firmly stand with my thoughts on them as a whole but it was interesting to hear you explain yourself a bit more and why you identify as 'gender queer'   Good video. :)."

"Though pronounced exactly the same, written Mandarin (what I assume you mean by Chinese) has male and female pronouns, specifically Â•π (she) and ‰ªñ (he). These also extend to her's/his (Â•πÁöÑ/‰ªñÁöÑ) and feminine/masculine they (Â•π‰ª¨/‰ªñ‰ª¨). I don't have any issue with the video, just a small correction."
"I am sooo confused by all this. Gender and sex are different, yes? So, you can identify as genderqueer but be a man, biologically. I mean, is this all about gender, or is it about sex? Or is it about both? So lost in this. And often do I hear and read that it's really so simple and why it's so difficult for the public to get it. Because, it IS difficult to understand! And this video isn't really any better. You pocking fun at the sciences is really weird since you are explaining everything via science. Or is it natural science against social science? Okay, so what I think: Sex is biology, it's not 'assigned at birth, the doctor doesn't decide against your will. He or she makes an assumption based on sex characteristics. Yes, that can be wrong, but in 99% of the time, it's correct. People mostly identify as male or female. I'm still talking about sex here. When it comes to gender, I am really lost though. Yes, certain things are assigned to the sexes. Such as females are more caring and males are more analytical, mostly due to hormones. But a lot more is very arbitrary, like the colors pink and blue. So I think it's really normal not to fall in those categories, and no surprise here, that most people can't find themselves in those but does that mean we have to debate on whether we need to assume sex is a social construct? I don't think other animals care about that? I highly doubt they socially construct their sex. Again, this gender thing is so weird to me. But I do thank you for explaining your own situation. Still, it sounds to me like their are so many genders as there are people. Categories exist to make things easier, not more complicated. Everything else to be seems to be a defensive stance. I mean are you troubled by your gender or your sex? I guess my issue here is to understand how we always talk about gender, but it's so very often about sex. Why is it called transgender and transsexual. If a transsexual feels they are born in the wrong body and have gender dysphoria that's one thing. But is it the same as transgender. Sorry, obviously no one has to answer that, I could just try to research this, but I get differing answers all the time."
"The idea that the gender binary is scientific doesn't even make historical sense. It isn't a scientific theory and the idea wasn't popularized because it had some sort of predictive power that made it better than other ideas of gender. People weren't spending ages trying to figure out 'what is this gender thing' and then someone came along with the revolutionary idea that gender is binary. No the idea existed long before the enlightenment and it just stuck with us. It is tradition not science."
"Your point about voice got me thinking. I think of myself as a woman, specifically a transwoman, and while I pass on pretty much all fronts imo my voice doesn't really. So I've started to try to change it but I'm wondering if I'm only doing this to pass and not because I want to myself. Thinking back to before puberty I'm not sure whether I liked the changes my voice was going through. But maybe the reason I don't hate my voice is just because I've been forced to live with it. It's not an easy question to answer and I guess in a perfect world I may not try to change my voice because it is a lot of work. But idk."
"When you hear younger folks discuss gender, they're simply referring to 'masculine' & 'feminine.'  Non-binary folks are people who present both masculine & feminine. It's overwhelmingly about appearance. Although they don't choose 1 or the other (masculine or feminine), they are ironically very binary. They simply work with both columns of the binary. Whenever you hear someone under 30 discuss gender, what they really mean is masc & fem. 'I don't identify with either gender' simply means they don't like the constraints or social responsibilities of masculinity or femininity. Doesn't sound as edgy as they'd like, I know."

Personally, I think that not fitting entirely into traditional gender roles isn't an entirely new gender, but simply deviating from the generally acceptable. Of course I am perfectly willing to address you in the way you identify, however, calling it a whole new gender is where I begin to question. Please feel free to criticize me if I'm incorrect. Thank you!"

"Being a teen in the '70s, I was deep into the counter-culture (sex, drugs and rock n roll), and we were very proud to be a part of that, and celebrated the fact that we were NOT normal... we despised the thought of being 'normal'.  To this day I feel the same way.  I think this is way I find it hard to stand by all the pronoun and gender-plus/minus issues.  Why do they want it to be 'normalized'?  I actually hated the point when rock music started getting too mainstream (about the time MTV came out), because I knew it was only a matter of time before good rock was a thing of the past.  IMO, they should embrace their uniqueness'.  Why try to force others to change their vocabulary and thought processes?  Why even care?  Part of the fun of being different, is not caring what other's think about it... giving them the finger :)"

"why are you so gorgeous tho"
"Too bad you didn't sound this eloquent during the debate, I feel like you needed to prepare better for the debate."
"king"
"Lol I really don't agree with most of what this video said... but I love this guy so much OmGggggG whyyyyyyyyyy"
"so I hope this isn't too inappropriate, but if you live near seattle, wanna go on a date? :3"
"I came from the Blaire debate and i gotta say, i am strangely attracted to you. But you're not really a girl or a trans girl....I guess I'm bisexual. Shit. that sucks."
"10:08 This is the only point in the video where you actually talk about what the fuck genderqueer means (other than quickly saying that it's 'basically a synonym' for non-binary at the beginning) and the language you use is way too vague for me to get any kind of useful information out of it. This has been the case with every single video I watched that tries to explain something about gender and that makes me think that there's very little value in using the term."
"OK, slow down bronco. All I got from this video was that you think transvestites are somehow dirty weird evil people, but because you now call yourself genderqueer, you are better them. To quote your good self, every time  you debate someone that uses language you don't like. 'it seems to me' that's what you just said."
"I'm here from Blaire's channel after the debate :) I enjoyed both of your POV's, you got a new sub in me!"
"fugly"
"How did I get here..."
"there actually are gender pronouns in chinese but only in written chinese"
"What is with that creepy doll just standing there?"
"The Chinese mandarin language does have gendered pronouns. They are pronounced in the same way that is true (tƒÅ) but they are written differently Â•πÔºàsheÔºâand ‰ªñ (he)."
"So...going by shoe...Contra is the Red/Ash Ketchum of Genders?  I like it."
"Came here from the Blaire debate. You're great, keep it up :)"
"This obsession with labels that are moving targets and explain nothing to boot are the main reason I can't take this conversation seriously. What makes me angry and upset as a mental health advocate is that I suspect that the alphabet soup community is mocking the mentally ill. Mental illness is not an identity, it is a condition."
"I don't agree with your views, Blaire white brought me here after all.  But dammit, i have to admit your videos are well done and entertaining."
"I am actually confused, this has to be a parody account"
"so you're a crossdresser man. Ok, thanks!"
"Anyway, he(or whatever) has a beautiful face. And voice."
"I wear mens clothing as well as womens. does that make me genderqueer? This is moronic and always will be."
"Cant stop watching"
"Non-binary identities are highly abnormal. Albinos are highly abnormal as well, but I don't see many people apologising for saying that."
"Can I give you a hug? You're describing me here"
"So if you're not a male or female, what are you?"
"You are so delightful. Found you through your debate with Blaire White. I will be watching you from here on out. Thanks for your vulnerability, as well as your sardonic sense of humor.  Much love! üåπ"
"lol people here would sacrifice me bc I came here from Blair Whites channel but I had to say this: *you are really really pretty.* like... I can't stop staring at your face...wahhhh"
"As a person who has his own sexual hang ups (thanks to the Church and a case of undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome) I empathize with you. I hope you find your way. By the way, go easy on the alcohol. My step grandfather died of cirrhosis of the liver. It's not a pleasant way¬†to go."
"I like you a lot (here from Blaire White's channel) and you're awesome, but the whole 'identifying with some or one or both always or sometimes or never' thing **with** the *socially constructed* labels of man and woman is completely illogical considering the labels *are* socially constructed, *as are* these new thrown-together labels!  So I just can't listen to any more talk about that crap.  There are two sexes (unless theres a birth defect), so it makes logical sense for there to be two labels for the two sexes.  Just because you dress yourself in a more feminine way (and you look great by the way) doesn't make you not a man, and most certainly doesn't make you anything separate and unique from either the label of man or woman.  As someone else said, we should just be extending the notion of how the concept of 'man' is viewed in society, which is LITERALLY just someone that was born with male genitalia, not someone who is naturally masculine, 'alpha', tough, or any personality attributes like that.  Same applies to the concept of 'woman'."
"I'm impressed by your willingness to make jokes and be a little politically incorrect during this video. It gets annoying to see all of the language policing floating around."
"This is extremely offensive!!!  Dead pixels are a serious issue.  You can't just spend an entire video ignoring something that glaringly obvious while talking about trivial matters like gender identity.  ;-)"
"I honestly do not give a shit if I don't agree with your perspectives on gender, and feminism etc. your fucking funny and I love your content and I don't think that because I don't agree with most of what you say shouldn't affect how I view you're humor, new subscriber"
"5:30 hashtag relatable, I cried."
"Uhh why are you so fucking beautiful üò´üôèüèª"
"i dont agree with you, but youre pretty entertaining imo. keep doing you"
"found out about you on blaire white's stream, your videos are fantastic!"
"Im sorry but there is only 2 genders :)"
"I thought you were great on blaire's stream. subscribed."
"most everyone is nonbinary which is why I don't care about it."
"I'm so sorry for the long post.  Where this premise fails is when we start to propose that proclivities towards one of these categories are indicators of your gender. A woman's superior height will most likely be due to exposure to testosterone, though it won't make her any less of a woman. Now pushing this idea onto a more psychological macro example. Girls who don't like wearing robes and who like to play with trucks are most likely the result of exposure to testosterone, however, we must understand that motivations are the determining factors of our psychological nature, not actions. For this at least, intentionalism and not consequentialism.  For example, our way of thinking shouldn't be that pink and blue have been colors for both men and women throughout history, so, because they aren't a rigid indicator of gender and are dependent on culture, they are invalid insights into what constitutes gender. We must analyze this a little further and address what is the motivation for the gender disparity in blue and pink appreciation. What if pink was a sign a calmed rage, a mixture of nobleness and male control, both harmoniously maintaining each other in control, while blue was this symbol of fidelity and value? (not that women were privileged in the middle ages for fucks sake). Now what if we analyze both these colors in today's mentality ? What if pink is a symbol of emotions, virginity and of proximity to the heart, while blue is a symbol of fidelity, rigidity and responsibility? Both of these representations are adequate illustrations of the two genders. Both of these colours are intrinsically installed within our minds because of their prevalence in nature (blood,sky). I won't elaborate more on this micro example, because I would, but I hope you understand what I mean. Certain things are unavoidable not in their physical manifestations but in how we adapt to them. Trucks move and carry large set of clearly defined things while clothing and barbies are social, emotional and identity based objects.  Same for the truck. And maybe the motivation for playing with the truck truly is a more masculinely inclined one, though, when does the tally of masculine traits to feminine traits transform a proclivity towards masculine tendencies into gender dysphoria? It's not a 'gotcha' more of a clear certainty of 'not being in the correct body'. Essentially, having tendencies that are associated with feminine tendencies doesn't make you less of a man, but rather, more of a man with feminine tendencies. How the fuck is that wrong? (I'm talking to the more conservative types here, not saying BE PLEASED WITH THIS CONCLUSION). This doesn't invalidate your psychological matrix in any way. If THAT is what being gender queer is, meaning having behavioral traits that are motivated by your biological gender, but that are extremely similar to the behavioral traits of another gender, then sure, gender queer is an excellent term.  I'm all over the place, right now, but my main point is that even if trucks are highly associated with boys for a variety of reasons, girls liking trucks for masculine reasons and having abnormally high testosterone levels doesn't make her lose her innate feminine tendencies, except if she truly has gender dysphoria. Again when does proclivity turn into dysphoria.  My issue is when we start to suggest that, dysphoria or not, adapting behaviors that are associated with another sex/gender closens you to that sex/gender. Sex and gender vary independently from one another only when you look at the world the same way that deemed blue and pink irrelevant indicators of gender specific attributes.  We know that, even infants have sex specific preferences. Attraction to motion is highly correlated with prenatal exposure to testosterone while attraction to faces is highly correlated with prenatal exposure to estrogen. Does that mean that these categories are so rigid that if a boy is attracted to faces he is statistically more prone to being a female? No. My issue with your points, concerning gender, isn't that they are stupid, it is that they are built on a set of misleading premises. For example: if science is a binary, then it is rigid, therefore science cannot accommodate its framework around nuanced cases, therefore, the biological view cannot fully describe something nuanced, such as gender. The issue here is that you made science more rigid than it is.   Removing multiple elements of sexual dimorphism and limiting it to what is clearly most often used to define gender, is misleading.    I don't expect you to read the whole thing, but if you are starting from down here:   GREAT VIDEO, YOU MADE YOURSELF VERY CLEAR AND BECAUSE OF THAT I APOLOGIZE IF I DIDN'T REPRESENT YOUR POINTS ADEQUATELY."
"I checked out your channel after Blaire retweeted your post about the debate. You make some really good points, and I'm interested to hear what you two have to say tomorrow."
"unrelated~ but i love ur outfit!!"
"I was recieving this really well until it got to the 'they' pronouns thats just ..... I dunno that really is made up bs. Choose one of the two dont invent new shit because you feel like wearing make up, wigs, paint your nails and I dont know what. ultimetly it comes down to your penis but once your passable enough not anymore. Also I hate it when people diverge a simple thing like having a penis or a vagina between your legs in 30 category. Its like metal fans talk about what specific genre a cerain song of a band is 'Well normaly (insert band x here) does (insert insert death metal subgenre here) but in this song they do (instert subgenre of thrash metal here) with nuances of (insert I dunno here)' when you could just say 'Its fucking Anthrax they do fucking Thrash Metal now shut the fuck up and talk about more important stuff. Who cares what subgenre the specific song is do you like it or not is the question'. I feel like people that surround themselfs too much with gender study shit try to over complicating such a thing. ContraPoints for example is a dude in woman clothes and make up for me, no matter how he calls himself or what pronouns hed expect me to use when interactinfg with him. Its just an obvious thing, it doesnt bring down my respect for him nor do I want to denounce him for that. If thats what he wants to do so be it. I could not care less but inventing new pronouns for every little thign of nouonce to how you feel only because you can feel special in a certain way and expect me to use it in your prensence is laughable. Dont get me wrong I may use it just to avoid the confrontation about such nonsense but itll be still nonsense and laughable in my head. Plus, I just wonder if there arent any other problems in this world that are alot more urgent. And at last it does not matter how long the 'sjw' community will keep pushing this and creating conflicts through it you wont change a thing in the eyes of the general public on something so natural like determaning a gender. Ever helped with a pig giving bith, 18 little shits come out there you look between their legs and count how many of them are female and how many are male you write it down and thats the end of the story. Of course the human psychjology can fuck that up but it wont change the fact."
"Bully for you. Really enjoy your videos. Subscribed."
"I love your style!"
"Is something wrong with 'effeminate'  or 'tom boy' for that matter?  Should those also have the special distinction of being a new gender?  Doesn't this new paradigm essentially make gender roles MORE strict by labeling a lack of conformance as something entirely different?  What is the uniquely enviable distinction of a gender label, above terms like 'effeminate' or 'tom boy'?  Why not say, I'm a man and that fact says very little about me-- I can enjoy expressing myself in traditionally women's clothes sometimes.  I thought that gender was supposed to be something that could be medically diagnosed with some professionally established consensus-- this appears to be getting established (if one could even call it that) from a more haphazard place.  I mean, is there such a thing as an illegitimate gender label?  Could there be one?  How could one objectively determine that?  Sorry for so many questions.  I do genuinely want to know and I'm not trying to be an asshole."
"So what it really comes down to is that you're repressing, and don't actually dare to transition, because you think your physical situation is too far from being able to successfully transition?"
"I kindly disagree with you."
"I think you freak a lot of people out so much, simply because you're so damn sexy. And if people are attracted to you, it might make them insecure.  Lucky me, i'm not bothered. So i'd never kick you out of bed :)"
"Well, my initial concept was that you had two main differences based around the sex role played whilst fertilizing an egg. Then the further away you get from that concept the more it becomes a clusterfuck of natural variation.   I guess I've learned more about the clusterfuck of natural variation when I  ran into the gender dysphoria thing. The case of dysphoria just seemed like something really unfortunate that happened. With natural variation you will have states that are... undesirable. It seemed like there were some major colors(gender binary) with shades spread on the sides since nature always paints in broad strokes.  That view never changed even during my encounters with variations of gender expression and identity. I figured that the norms were just arbitrary expressions lathered onto a strategy that led to the most births. They existing during times when circumstances were just as compelling forces as human fiction. Now circumstances aren't as compelling anymore so more people are becoming aware that such variations exist.  Part of me thinks that nature will decide in the end what changes about this fact since the deciders will be those who leave progeny behind. Another thinks that this is all just happening because people couldn't tolerate gender variation so philosophies are being construed to tackle this point. Part of me wants to sneak into the culture of gender variation and let it transform me. I know not what I will become!   In the end I'm even more confused.  Thanks?"
"Hi contra - Chinese does have gendered pronouns I'm afraid ‰ªñÔºåÂ•πÔºåÂÆÉ mean he, she, it, respectively, but the pronunciation for all them is the same (tƒÅ), so when speaking people just go by context. When it comes to 'they', this is more gender specific as there is ‰ªñ‰ª¨ÔºåÂ•π‰ª¨ÔºåÂÆÉ‰ª¨Ôºåmeaning they (male) they (female) etc. But after this long ramble, I agree it's easier with Chinese as the pronunciation doesn't change, but writing is a different matter...."
"wipe yourself from the face of the planet please"
"was great except for where you perpetuated cringey 'a thing' stupid idiom garbage crap shit."
"This was a fucking fantastic video. It gave me a lot to think about and cleared up some things for me."
"When it gets to the part where it says ...younger than me assigned female at birth and date the same sex or each other and you just awkwardly shrug"
"I love you"
"Contra, I think we need to be friends irl. Trust me, I'm an internet expert on friends."
"Is this all still a thing. I came to your channel from folding ideas. I am in my 30`s and i do not give a single rats ass what people identify them self as or who they date and choose to f*ck with. As long as nobody get's hurt i am fine with whatever you choose to be happy with. Maybe someday we all can just fucking be! cheers from Germany"
"It's weird that anyone cares one way or the other what others say or think about themselves. Also, I spent the entire video trying to figure out who you remind me of. It's an actress. It's... right... there... nope. Can't place the face."
"I... I love this so much. Your content be tres good. Me like!"
"Please make an instagram I love your aesthetic"
"Haha, i drink taxes..."
"contra...your makeup is fucking amazing.  I just has to leave a comment saying that.  As for the rest   I don't give a fuck what you call yourself.  It just doesn't matter to me what gender people claim.  I ain't fucking you so it ain't my business."
"Premptive: I'm not a troll. I am genuinely trying to get a better understanding of the 'progressive' view as the anti-sjw crap is creating an echo-chamber effect on social media with the retreat (or screeching) of progressives giving a defacto victory for the anti-sjws. One person suggested I check out this channel.  Nothing said here was new to me. There is an inherent problem with the understanding of gender as expressed here: it assumes the individual dictates gender. You were correct when you said that gender is a social construct. This means society gets to decide what genders are, not individuals. While you are free to see yourself as anything you wish, you have no right to demand that others also see you in the same way. You can call yourself 'gender-queer' or 'non-binary' all you want but I am under no obligation to also see you that way. In fact, given that gender is a social construct, your identifying in a manner that society does not recognise directly violates the concept of 'gender' as a social construct.   Basically, society sees you and identifies your gender."
"well honestly having the transgender day of visibility a day before April Fools day seems slightly poorly planned. I am still assuming that this is real, because i like both you and nonbinary people."
"I'm not trying to be a jerk, and I'm 100% fine with whatever you wish to do, and I'm sure you don't really care what I think anyway.   I guess I don't understand what it actually means to say that you feel male or female. How do you know it's femaleness you feel? I don't know what it is to be a bat (Nagel!)... I'm not sure I understand what it means to feel female (or partially female) either."
"I love you"
"the hotdog and bun i'm dying XD"
"I just love and adore professional weirdos!!! And you're the best. I just wanna call you NICK, while you're IN ME."
"Did I hear that right? You're 'pretty indifferent' on the 'issue' of breasts? Well, that settles it, then."
"It means you're just another mentally ill moron, but you think you'e special."
"you are so fucking cute!"
"I had to think about any objections to this video, or even if I had any.     If I had any objections they are certainly not any of the things you listed.  I guess what I would be worried about is this over obsession about self identity and this need to be validated and acknowledged, and if someone doesn't its seen as phobic and I am not so sure that it is.    I would argue that this is driving the consumer market that is why you are seeing big business so on board with this    I think it might be a form of narcissism, look how interesting I am, a lot more interesting than being just being comfortable in your binary gender like the vast majority of people.  Being gay used to be a big issue, now look at it, and maybe that is a good thing.    Everyone likes to believe and think they are more interesting than they actually are, it may sound kind of rude but you are not, and I am not.    Your videos are interesting and you have a talent minimally for entertaining and perhaps more importantly make some people think.   It is that that makes you interesting, but who or can I say what you are really isn't as interesting as you think it is."
"you look absolutely gorgeous in this video btw"
"Your makeup and hair have become really on point over the course of your youtubing"
"I never understood people denouncing anyone that doesn't fit either genders.  I'm relatively new to genderqueer people, but likening them to Pokemon???  Drink acid, you jerks.  BTW, you just gained a new subscriber :)"
"Wow, I've been watching your videos for a while mostly to have a good laugh and nod in agreement and simply because it's been refreshing to see something other than the 'free-thinking liberals', as you put it, make humourous and sarcastic videos about these subjects. But this was really heart-warming and quite beautiful, how you just drop that sarcastic fasade (well, mostly drop it anyway) and express some genuine, personal things about your self. I have no doubt it must've been scary, it's always scary to drop your defenses and become vulnerable like that, especially on a place like YouTube that isn't necessarily the friendliest place. But that fact that you did really gave me some newfound respect for you. I don't know if I thought you were particularly inspiring before (I pretty much agreed with everything you said to begin with after all), but now I certainly do. I'll try to keep in mind to frantically switch gendered pronouns if I ever end up talking about you in third person. You go girlboy!"
"That doll gave me anxiety lol"
"I'm fuckin sorry that you even have to defend yourself, and on this level. I can certainly relate - I mean, look at me, my goddamn profile pic is a non binary pride flag. Anyway, well done, and welcome to the snowflake gender cult I guess."
"well now im confused. you make fun of the notion that there are 2 genders, but i dont understand where exactly other genders come into the picture. as far as i understand, you identify as both female and male, and you mention agender and genderfluidity. to me, this seems to be covered under 2 genders. you can be no gender(agender), one of them(male or female), both(genderqueer) or changing between all of this(genderfluid). Are there other genders? what exactly makes them genders as opposed to other social identities? id love to hear anyones thought about this and/or explainations what i misunderstood. thanks"
"Good video. I think I learned something. I'm not going to roll my eyes at all this gender terminology anymore, but instead try to understand. How about that? I should pat myself on the shoulder. Not being sarcastic, by the way. I'm a total leftie, but I have had some trouble accepting more variants than male, female and full blown trans. Now I think I realize how silly it is for me to even care. I should just mind my own business and let people do what they want and be who they wanna be. Doesn't ruin my day, so why be a dick about it? I guess it took you to put a human face on what I didn't understand."
"Still not buying it"
"Dude, god damned girl, I love you mate, you're just awesome lady!"
"Yes!! You have a new subscriber! Hilarious, smart, and informative. <3"
"That dead pixel on your camera is terribly distracting. I hardly saw you in the image."
"'Genderqueer' literally means nothing."
"Contrapoints, your video is very inspiring. It's good to see someone so open about themselves. I have been wanting to try to get into female clothing, but I'm not sure where I could get such clothes. The problem is that I'm 6'2 and a lot of the lolita dresses that I see online are super cute but they look like they're made for petite japanese girls. I also feel too shy and scared to go shop for stuff in public. I know you're 6 feet tall and I was wondering how you find stuff that fits you. I would really appreciate some advice, thank you!"
"You didn't go too into the subject in this video, but I have a feeling our views on gender will differ since I don't completely subscribe to the progressive view of the subject (that it's a completely social construct.) I find most non-binary people on YouTube take that view. I'm non-binary myself and  thought about making a video on the biological side of things with research I've read (and I've read a lot of stuff at this point trying to figure myself out.) But I'm putting it off for now.   This video took a lot of guts to make. Many people won't realise, but it can be very alienating when everyone thinks you're insane or making things up, on top of the internal sense of being different.  Also your videos are very entertaining which is refreshing."
"Fucking Finally. A non binary person that makes a little sense and a lot of sense of humour. Well done."
"You're a drag-queen, nobody cares man..."
"I am pretty sure that all these 'genders', since they are psychological, are simply mental disorders."
"As long as you don't try and legislate what i can say or think they you can be what ever the fuck you want.  Also why can't we just ignore gender since its a social construct and focus on sex? Then everyone can be as masculine or feminine as they want, still fit in on either side and not have to write up three pages of pronouns."
"GROSS why haven't you hanged yourself yet?¬† Those meds your taking aren't getting the job done!!!!"
"ok. now I will stare at the doll for the rest of the video..."
"Contra: 'I don't bang dudes, not yet anyway...'  Start with The Golden One üòº"
"oh man I just realized something. she looks like Taylor swift when you look closely"
"YESSSSS! you are seriously my favourite youtuber. to exist. ever. i'm also nonbinary!! congrats on coming out my dude :)"
"The girl with the thick eyeliner is just jealous that you apply it better! Funny video!"
"I feel very similarly to you. That's all. You're not the only one. There's a reason David Bowie is my profile picture lol."
"YESSS!!!!"
"Definition of gender      1     a :  a subclass within a grammatical class (as noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb) of a language that is partly arbitrary but also partly based on distinguishable characteristics (as shape, social rank, manner of existence, or sex) and that determines agreement with and selection of other words or grammatical formsb :  membership of a word or a grammatical form in such a subclassc :  an inflectional form (see inflection 3a) showing membership in such a subclass      2     a :  sex the feminine genderb :  the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex"
"(5:40) It is unfortunate and shit-heads like Suit Yourself (in my opinion)  only make that worse."
"Good luck, but how exactly are you not a dude? How are you in any way a woman?"
"God, your videos are so ridiculous and funny. While I disagree with you sometimes (I'm a leftist, disagreement is in our nature), I can generally get a fun chuckle out of them, and I can admire your attempt to at least communicate with some right wing/right leaning people. Keep on being you Contrapoints, you beautiful ridiculous person."
"I can not get over how good you look in that top and that hair. How could anyone deny something so beautiful?"
"is this parody? i cant tell?"
"Sounds more like a disability to me...  By that I mean this sounds very similar to my own journey to being comfortable identifying as a 'disabled person', being a deviant like yourself for ages I refused the label and I wanted everyone to know I was just 'a guy with a few bits that don't work very well, and I used to out-right reject being a 'disabled person', but over time I've realised it is who I am and I shouldn't hide it. Don't get me wrong I, much like yourself, am still a cynical jaded fuck, but labels aren't always bad.  Great vid as always!"
"Does 'being born in the 'wrong' body' mean there's a non-physical entity that we should call the self and is not restricted and casually effected by the 'wrong' body???????? I AM CONFUSS   So, you are yourself? That is, something other than your body. But then you need to change your body, to become oneself? How, does, that, make, sense? Why would you need hormones and surgery??? FUCK THE BODY, LONG LIVE THE IMMATERIAL SOUL! I AM A GENDERGHOST AND YOU SCIENTISTS CAN'T EVEN STUDY MY FUCK YOUR TESTOSTERONE AND XXXXXXXXXXY CHOMRNOSOPLILLAS"
"People are different. What's so hard about that?"
"Thank you for this. Its great to see representation on youtube :)"
"So in summary, youre mentally insane."
"You know, the more I think about the whole 'Only Two Genders' argument, the more I am reminded of the 1984's '2+2=5' scene.  I understand gender is neither clear cut nor set in stone like mathematics, but there is something eerily Orwellian about all these people trying to deny the existence of anything or anyone that does not conform to their understanding of the world."
"That creepy doll in the background tho . . ."
"It may be true that there is some psychological component to gender in terms of people's feelings about their own bodies. This doesn't make it like, a real thing that should be respected though. Anorexics think they have too much fat on their bodies but you wouldnt tell them to continue starving themselves in order to validate their feelings. Some people have body dismorphia, some females have huge amounts of internalized misogyny brought-on by growing-up in a women-hating culture, and some males understandably feel very uncomfortable with the masculine roles that are expected of them and in their male bodies. The thing about labeling oneself as gendered in some way is that it enforces the notion that gender is an actual property of human beings- and therefore continues to perpetuate these harmful and restrictive notions of what it means to be a human being. We are just people with preferences and personalities. Some of us are biological males and some are biological females, and a very very small percentage of people are intersex. But thats it. There is no 'gender' anywhere.   Gender is also a HIERARCHY not a binary. Masculinity and femininity dont exist in the universe like some cosmic ying-yang sign. Gender is a brutal arrangement of power, socially constructed, just like race and class, which affords males privileges over females. 'Femininity' is ritualized displays of submission to men. To claim its internal is extremely p r o b l e m a a a a t i i c c c.....  Infact, after watching yr video about psychiatry- this is kind of the same thing..... you said yourself you dont now understand your depression and anxiety as 'an illness' but just part of being a human. Gender is the same. Big Pharma and plastic surgery are HUGE businesses. I know i sound like a cynical party-pooper- but follow the money....... $ $ $ $ $ $ $   Gender kills."
"Small correction: in Chinese, you have words corresponding to he(‰ªñ) and she(Â•π). But they are homophones, so in spoken language you just say 'ta' and context must take care of the rest."
"Informative and very well done! Eye-opening material for someone who generally doesn't give this topic much thought because, well, as cis-scum, it's just not part of my daily life. (A mostly-irrelevant side note: I first subscribed to your channel back when I was an active member of the atheist community---something I abandoned once I discovered Swing dancing. I almost never watch videos from my atheist subscriptions anymore, but this one caught my eye. Glad I tuned it: thanks for making it!)"
"People,stop insulting. This can be used as an excuse of''how non binaries are marginalized''. But seriously you don't have to call yourself non binary to stand out for gender non conforming individuals. You're excluding individuals who are gender non conforming just becuase they don't go with the non binary cult."
"Nice video. I like that you approach this issue with a good deal of nuance that is profoundly lacking in discussions around this particular topic.  I agree that gender can be non-binary and that other gender identities exist. But what do you think about the trend or compulsion to label and categorize all these 'other' genders? I personally think that gender and sexual identity exist on a broad spectrum of traits, roles, behaviors/performance, preferences, etc., all of which are informed by social codes, roles, biology/physiology, individual psychology, etc. The insistence on labeling and categorizing is incompatible with it at the end of the day. By putting dozens of names on possible gender identities, you lose something essential in the process which is that fact of individual gender/sexual expression itself. There will always be those that identify with the 'other.' Thus I question the need to detail out an endless list of 'alien genders.' Where do we draw the line?  I feel I should mention that I think things like 'genderqueer,' 'agender,' 'androgynous' and such are perfectly valid, like 'masculine' or 'feminine.'  Ones built on or are variations of the binary or third-gender makes sense. It's the ones that stray further and further away from basic ones that I'm suspicious of (like the chart with two dozen different identities or whatever). Even if they're socially constructed, they're still rooted in our culture and biology, which is why I think 'masculine,' 'feminine,' and 'androgyny' are the three 'pillars' of gender identity and expression. For the more outlandish ones, where are we getting them from? Do they really have any practical use?  Psychiatric diagnoses suffer from a similar problem, which is translating spectra of behavior into discrete categories. However, these diagnostic labels undergo tons of psychometric evaluation and validity testing, so they at least have clinical significance. Can we say the same about some random otherkin teenager's self-described gender identity on Tumblr? At some point I feel it's less about crafting a common language and understanding and more about just trying to feel special by fabricating a new box for themselves to fit in. Again, no disrespect towards those who identify as non-binary."
"What is your opinion on Rachel Dolezal?  While she does not look black, she feels shes not white.  If you went back far enough we all technically come from Africa I guess.  You don't feel like a gender, does that not just make you somebody who does not feel like a gender?  Does not seem that complicated to me."
"When in doubt, freak them out.  Honestly this change from you was odd at first, but now I don't even give it a second thought other than stylistic (makeup/clothes) critiques. But that's obviously subjective so not relevant. Keep doing what you do."

"The 'up next' video for me now is 'Is Genderqueer real (starring ContraPoints)' by a channel called I,Hypocrite.  The thumbnail is of a boxer dodging a punch; captioned 'me' and 'gay shit' respectively. And their channel is festooned with '#FreeDevon' (AIU/roo), 'religion of peace' and 'gender of peace'  [insert gif of NOPE spider]"
"what a brilliant video <3"
"So you make something up as a social construct and want it to be accepted by people. Where does the line get drawn at this point? This was a crap shoot of a video that doesn't say anything but I'm gender queer because I can't make a choice. If that's what you want gender queer to mean..I kinda get that or that you are 'both'. Whatever the fuck that means. But how much should people play and go along with other peoples self delusional and mental gymnastics? The reason people que the helicopter meme is because it's expressing the absurdness of the newish social construct. The reason this even matters in the first place is likely because of how weight and values are shoved into either gender instead of treating people as ya know people. Male/Females are very different and you debunk yourself when you talk about being 6'2, having broad shoulders, and etc. This is what gender is. Those differences..it's not clothes, cultural norms, personal feelings. It's the nuts and bolts that make up who you are and have some impact on you in life. I think you weigh far too much what matters to society in regards to gender rather than what matters to actual gender. Rejecting the biology of sex and trying to play it as some dumb ploy is sad. It's watching someone being told the difference between a human/ape and just going ape with monkey and human doll. I think you should ask why you value the social construct of gender far more than the biological aspects of it."
"this is a good ass video and i love your dress."
"okay I don't necessarily understand all of the other genders or agree with all of them, but honestly if it makes people happy then for gods sake just let them be happy. it doesn't effect you or your quality of life. just don't associate with them."
"Check out pages 176-180 titled 'Passing-Centrism' in Julia Serano's 'Whipping Girl'. You might enjoy how she breaks down the idea of 'passing'. She says 'upon closer examination, it becomes quite obvious that the concept of 'passing' is steeped in cissexual privilege, as it's only ever applied to trans people.' Then she goes on to say how odd it would be if cissexual/cisgender people were called the wrong pronoun, for example, and were told they were not 'passing'. Rather, people would say that someone IS  their gender but was MISTAKEN for another gender if they were cissexual/cisgender and were misgendered."
"Honestly, when you said 'stop being inspired' those few seconds were so adorable I may have cracked up so fuck you I guess I'm inspired. I'm gonna go out and watch birds.  Also, can't help but notice that the attitude with which people discard gender theory is very similar to, say, Juggalos talking about science. 'It's ridiculous, you can't prove it, and whatever stop complicating my life!'"

"You look very attractive in your makeup and stuff.  GOOD!"
"As a fairly right gendered gay man, I feel you.  Although I do wonder about labels.  It is important for people to not feel secluded, to be understood and feel like they belong to a community, but I fear the labels sometimes are more damaging than they are helpful.  When people begin to categorize themselves and others, it leads to people being able to dismiss others because they don't belong to their column.  Especially the 'cisgendered' concept.  I really hate this label, because I feel it has been placed upon heterosexual men and women as a pejorative term.  I have never heard the term used as a non pejorative, only when describing how 'cis' people just can't understand, or when complaining about heterosexuals.  It feels like a good equivelant term to 'fag' or 'dyke' in my opinion."

"Sorry this is a little pedantic but mandarin Chinese does have gendered pronouns. ‰ªñ is male and Â•π is female - both might be pronounced ta but because of the pinyin system it's actually pronounced differently."
"My position on the whole gender identities out the wazoo is: If you're someone I deal with frequently, and you aren't a terrible person, I'll treat you as you like and call you by whatever pronoun you want.  Otherwise, I really don't give a shit.  If you look male, you get 'he' and if you look female you get 'she' and if I can't tell, you get that person wearing <whatever it is>, if I have to talk about you at all.  I find it to be inconsiderate to expect people you don't deal with on a regular basis to know or bother to ask your pronoun or gender (some people do).  I find it equally inconsiderate to expect someone else to conform to gender expressions that fit into a neat box based on their genitalia.  That person is free to be whoever they want to be.  Fuck you for putting them in a box.  In situations like the above, I don't find it inconsiderate to go with the most obvious pronoun, as you will almost always be correct, and pronouns are there to facilitate speech not make interaction slower.  If you are wrong, whether misgendering a cis or a non-conforming individual, apologize (as long as their response was civil) and move on, you don't have to deal with that person again anyway.  And if you are incidentally misgendered, ignore it.  People will rarely do it on purpose, in real life.  I've not been misgendered much, but when I have been, I just looked at them quizzically and went on my way.  There really shouldn't be many things more of a non-issue than this.  If someone is aggressively misgendering you, I'd say that's verbal harassment and a different story entirely.  Anything else: let it go.  If you think someone is a snowflake and they aren't harassing you/trying to force you to do something you are uncomfortable with: let it go.  People need to chill out in general."

"Almost everyone is 'genderfluid' or even 'queer' to an extent, its hard to believe that the majority of people are 100% straight and never explore the habits/interests/dress of the opposite sex. What annoys me about these labels is that you don't need an identity to describe what in actuality is just something pretty normal. Many straight men crossdress, many straight women play sports or wear boyfriend jeans. It doesn't make you trans or queer or what have you."
"I feel like I can honestly talk with you because you are, as you say, a grown ass adult and not some child who is going to end up crying because I asked them an offensive question. Hopefully you can clear up quite a bit of my confusing, because as you point out, there isn't really a whole lot of people who are honest about this stuff online.  First, with your skit with the doctor, was the point that the medical community doesn't have a scientific understanding of gender? Are you suggesting that the medical community just looks at penises and vaginas and doesn't consider anything else. Are hormones, and chromosomes, and ect, not part of the understanding of gender in the medical community? Or were you just trying to be funny? I'm just not sure what you were trying to do here, because I think the skit left your answer up to interpretation.  Second, yes, I've heard of transgender people and about how they're 'born in the wrong body.' But I can't figure out how maybe its not the other way around. How do we know that their 'body is born with the wrong mind.'? I'm genuinely not trying to be a dick here, but I don't really accept the cartesian dualist (hence why I'd never call myself a rationalist) concept of self; that is mind+body. I think its much more complicated than that. As a result, transgenderism is a much more complicated issue than being 'born in the wrong body' as well. But I understand why you wouldn't want to take a 'body that is born with the wrong mind' approach, because then it sounds like transgenderism is a mental illness. I understand how that can be an issue and is imposing a moral/logical framework on psychological diagnosis, so maybe some transgender people wouldn't want to go that route, and I totally get that. I'm certain that some transgenders do have a cartesian understanding of self. So I don't actually have a problem with them undergoing hormone treatment and sex reassignment, necessarily. I think that should be their choice, but at the same time, I do think we're harming everyone when we're unwilling to have a discussion about the 'self' and its highly controversial about what that even means. These aren't simple issues that everyone agrees on, and I don't understand why its just assumed that we all have the same understanding of 'self.'  Third, yea, its made up nonsense. Gender roles are obviously socially constructed. I mean, the Greeks even knew this. Fire burns red in Greece and in Persia. But, in Persia men wear makeup but not in Greece. Now, yea, there are some aspects of gender roles that do make sense given the biological dimorphism of the sexes. Testosterone generally makes men stronger for fighting and hunting and working; where estrogen gives women breasts making them better for child rearing obviously. However, that doesn't mean that women can't kill a man with a dagger/sword/bare hands. That doesn't mean that men can't take care of the children. It just means that one gender is better suited for certain things than another. As a result to put both genders in boxes about how they *ought* to act from how the *are* (deriving an ought from an is) is to artificially create socially constructed boundary (such as chivalry for example). So I totally get how you could make up even more definitions to describe how you *feel* about those socially constructed gender norms; but what I don't get is how you can say that you feel this way objectively.  Sure, I can understand how you would feel genderqueer in 21st century America, but what about 200 B.C. Persia? 1000 B.C. China? 1230 A.D. India? Its not like the stuff that you're saying is 'made up;' But its that all this shit is already made up and this non-binary thing seems to be the shadows on the wall versus the man made objects carried in front of the fire to me. Its not that I disagree with you about your desire to act against the gender norms; its that the gender norms are already made up, so why not just rebel against them? Why make your own socially constructed norms on top of the existing social constructions. That's what I don't get.  Nick, don't tell us other people's pain is funny, sometimes it is; other times not. Other people's pain is funny when you don't have a connection with them, when you can't see the emotion on their face when they experience it. Hitchock realized this, when you watch someone fall from far away its funny, but when you watch someone fall in a closeup shot its scary. It sounds to me like you're deflecting here; and if you're going to emotionally shield yourself you're (a) going to make us not care about this nonbinary issue which is obviously important to you, and/or (b) not give an honest perspective on the issue.  Yea, I really mean no offense, but I really didn't get a lot out of your video. There's a lot of assumed concepts here when people talk about gender, and I think you just glossed over them. Like I said, if I lived in 200 B.C. Persia, I'd probably look just how you look right now, call myself a man, and not even be concerned with a label such as genderqueer. I'm just not following what the deal is whith accepting the socially constructed gender norms and building your own social constructions on top of them. Why are they being taken for granted?"
"Well done, go you."

"It's just not a simple scientific fact that there are only 2 genders.  There are species of jellyfish with 14 distinct sexual multimorphisms.  And it's not even true for humans who may possess different development in different parts of their body or brain, and that's not even taking chimeras into account, whereby a person can develop from two completely different fertilized DNA sources (this is real).  Anyone who still believes nature/God is that 'Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve' simple is just plain ignorant."
"i love your videos"
"I like you."
"If the idea of there only being two genders really is political, which it may be, what makes you so sure that preserving it isn't useful, or even necessary for a civilization to flourish? Traditional gender roles insure that males feel obliged to practice masculine virtues (e.g. industriousness, self-reliance) and females feel obliged to practice feminine virtues (e.g. elegance, compassion). Men and women (see differences between male and female brains and hormones if you don't believe me) tend to excel in different areas, so if gender roles are dismantled and men and women feel obliged to practice the same virtues, one gender will out perform the other. If society places emphasis on technical skills, men will unfairly dominate, and if it places emphasis on social skills, women will unfairly dominate. If society demands all virtues from both men and women, most people will fail to live up to expectations, and society will be forced to change its values lest its population be stricken with shame. If society allows for every individual to shine in their own individual way, then people will not feel pressured to develop any virtues whatsoever, and they will degenerate in the absence of societal expectations. The gender-binary and the expectations that go along with it may have tragic consequences for the few who are so irreversibly unusual that they're unable to conform sufficiently to the confines of one gender, but it insures that the majority of men and women can live fulfilling lives within different and complementary social roles (and instead of complaining on social justice forums nonconformists will create interesting artistic subcultures)."
"You know better than this, man. Biological sex is a very specific category that is decively binary. I don't know what changed you, I'm hoping you're playing Sith Lord and trying to sabotage this stupid fake gender movement from the inside out. You're too familiar with creationist Christian tactics to not recognize them when they're used by another movement. The stuff you did in your videos was the same dishonesty and misinformation tactics that you used in some of your videos would've gotten anyone torn to shreds in 2008 before the normalization of this navel-gazed b.s. The ideas you claim to espouse are the fabrications of gender studies idiots with no scientific training coming up with these idiotic ideas by sitting around watching paint dry while picking lint out their belly button. No experimentation, no background research, no research of any kind, just stupid word games and double-think. 'Gender is a social construct,' so therefore 'it's what you feel on the inside?' Premise does not support conclusion. It's like they took the problem of nature vs. nurture, chewed it up and spit it out as an undifferentiated glob. 'It's a learned behavior, so therefore it's innate... derr I has my gender studies degree, I is so smart!'"
"Part of the problem, in terms of how others view it, is that people who are 'on the spectrum' gender-wise, as it were, basically don't feel strongly enough about it to either mention it, or to identify with a certain label. So it seems (I assume) that suddenly people are uncertain about representing themselves in certain ways re. gender norms, whereas the case might be that a lot of people who slide towards that simply don't talk about that because it doesn't come up. It is far more convenient to live this cis way in terms of society, and some who have questioned themselves may have already have prior ideological beliefs which will consign such questioning to a 'phase'.  Kudos for feeling comfortable enough to 'come out'. You are an INSPIRATION. AN INSPIRATION. FEEL THE WEIGHT OF MY EXPECTATIONS, INSPIRATION. INSPIRATION."

"Even you are using terms such as 'they FEEL their gender is X.' and 'gender EXPRESSION'  I can FEEL i'm an Apache attack helicopter, and I can even express that by running around and flapping my arms making machine gun noises. But maybe what I FEEL is actually wrong! However telling someone their FEELINGS are wrong is 'MEAN' - can't do that! Aaaaaaand now enough people, since they haven't been challenged, are disillusioned into thinking that their thoughts were right, and now we face the problem we're in today."
"I'm so proud of you! As a genderqueer teen, I always look for more genderqueer people to look up to. While you might not be the best role model in the world, I'm really happy to have someone like you out there making videos. Thank you for being you!"
"Your brilliance manages to overcome the somewhat trivial, and even banal nature of these types of categorizations. This type of very authentic expression has existed in cultures since the dawn of time. I remember the 'Hejiras' in India. As for freakishness and self loathing - these are two personality attributes of many great artists - Now that's interesting!  I wonder how this level of multfaceted gender stuff would play out in a more primitive society, on one at least where so many articles of clothing were not so cheap, pretty and available. A little too much postmodernism for my taste personally, and I think that's where the categorization on steroids comes from... but I love what you do with mental illness, lead paint, political divisiveness, the problem of academia and other more immediately worrisome issues. Don't get me wrong, I am  a huge fan! Thus the word 'brilliance',"
"aah thank you for this! theres not many nonbinary people on youtube. when you look it up all you get is 'cringe compilations' or whatever. also, you're so cute üò©"

A plus, for being not particularly tolerant and just part of an echo-chamber social media cult referred to as Anti-SJW.   Congrats on that one."
"Is it truly possible for a (probably) cishet person to understand the gender spectrum?...asking for a friend."
"What gives me pause about aspects of this discussion is that in a roundabout way it seems to limit what is considered a man or a woman, by giving an undue weight to gender signifiers, which we all seem to agree are social constructs and diverse between cultures. I wouldn't consider a tomboy as any less or more of a girl than any other for example, its just another type of girl, but that seems an ill-fit to current discussions of gender."
"keep crushin it!"
"I understand having to prime the people you are around before coming out, even though (like you suggested) it's not surprising. Still an inspiration, though. ;p"
"Okay... ... oh wait, appearently, according to the current culture on the Internet, I'm supposed to call you... wait a minute, I wrote it down somewhere.... ah, here it is... Cuckbetaregressiveleftisttranstrenderspecialsnowlakelibertard.  But in all seriousness, good for you. It's nice to see when someone finds a way to express themselves in a way they're comfortable with. Also, I'm surprised that theres so few down votes. I've honestly expected to see a lightsaber here. Neat. Then again, I don't think you're the kind of person who cares about something like that anyways.  I've never been a fan of the gender as social construct thing though. Gender roles are a social construct but gender itself to me always seemed to be an naturally developed thing inherently linked to ones biological sex. Ones sex determines ones role in the process of reproduction wich in turn determines the kind of hormones the body produces wich in turn determines the gender wich is, as I understand it at least, ones general physiology like on average more muscle mass and height for men and less of both for average women. I might be way off but this is how I always understood it.  I'm also still sceptical of a bunch of those gender identities since it seems to me like some are similiar enough to eachother that you could easily lump them together no problem. Non-Binary and Agender for example feel kinda similiar."
"In this whole video, the only thing that worried me was the ether."
"I only have two gandeerrs"
"Yep, you've pretty much summed up how I feel in terms my own gender identity. Just that I'm too chicken to really express it anymore or really ever outside of maybe talking about it online. I still mostly identify as a woman but it's complicated considering I don't have any hate or dysphoria in terms of my genitalia (they're just there, and so long as they don't cause me any complications in my need to relieve myself I don't think it's all bad) and much like you I don't have any interest in getting breasts (already had bitch tits due to obesity for most of my life, they seem overrated IMO). >_>  BTW your hair is soooooooooooooooo cute. ^-^"
"I seriously love the fuck out of your videos. It takes guts to identify as queer when you spend so much time arguing with the 'rationals', especially ones who would've been lenient towards you and your opinions on account of you being 'a straight white dude' (fuck that bullshit way of thinking btw). Anyway, your channel is the best, you are totally an inspiration, and major kudos for the lack of fucks given. <3"
"No problem with dysphoric people identifying as non-binary. I just take issue with the claim that non-dysphoric people are 'not cis' based on interests, mannerisms or clothing. I think it enforces gender norms and it would be better for both the person and society as a whole if we didn't decide gender based on those very subjectively 'masculine/feminine' traits that are very specific to time and place. I mean, men used to wear high heels."
"This is absolutely hilarious. So so much bullshit I don't know where to start."
"you're a fucking treasure man, i love your work, you're a babe, i get stoked every time i see a new video from you. i hope you keep doing what you're doing. one love, stay real, god bless sister."
"Congratulations on coming out as gender queer. Welcome to the fold. :)"
"I watched this with my boyfriend on his account when this was published... but I just needed to say, damn, you did awesome with the hair, makeup... everything! ;) <3 Noticeable improvement!!"
"I think of the gender binary in the same way I think of newtonian dynamics where  higher values of measurable phenomenon, throw off any workable modeling like in the case of physics, high values of velocity, gravity and temperature throws off calculations and outright breaks the models of relatively simple and intuitive behavior.  Quantum mechanics even though it‚Äô a better way of describing the universe, is still not used by the masses simply because it‚Äôs so unwieldy and counter intuitive.  The same goes for genders in terms of increasing populations which in turn increases degrees of interaction and social/economic and psychological autarky, this allows for new degrees of expression, orientation, sex and identity"
"You made some good points and you're genuinely funny and interesting. However, you can't just repurpose the word 'gender' to mean whatever you want and expect the rest of the world to go along with it without any issue. Google, Webster, dictionary.com, etc. all define gender first and foremost as being 'either male or female' with no room in between."
"I'm beginning to think you might be a fucking genius."
"While I do not agree with your points, I did enjoy your presentation. It was clear and easy to understand while making me laugh and giggle. I found myself learning about the issue. I agree that your voice is very soothing. The top you are wearing is stunning and looks amazing on you. I also enjoyed the set up for your video. It was very interesting way to present your topic. The doll in the door frame was darling. It doesn't matter what I think about your gender identity. That is for you to live and deal with. It is my job to be respectful of you as a person as long as that respect is returned. Very interesting video!"
"You've got a dead pixel on your camera that I cannot stop staring at, it drove me so crazy I didn't hear a word you said. Sorry."
"Male or female. Pick one. Not that hard to actually think."
"wow i love you üòÑ"
"As a NB person, I always suspected, until the video when you said you weren't, then I knew I had to respect what you said, while deep, deep, deeeeep down, I knew that we were lying to each other"
"Dear +ContraPoints how much money do I have to pay to  get dir of that red speck on your camera! I keep thinking I have a dead pixel! Love your work <3"
"How dare you attack helicopter shame me bigot."
"Not to echo Objection Eins too hard, but something I've always struggled to understand is why males who like things not traditionally associated with masculinity and females who like things not traditionally associated with femininity often attach various non-binary labels to themselves. I feel like that goes against the goals of destroying gender norms and empowering boys and girls to be themselves and enjoy what they enjoy without all the worry that I assume comes with 'coming out' as some non-binary gender identity. Not saying you're wrong. Just not getting it. Keep on keeping on. Love the vidjeos."
"My frustration with the labels business is that they can't pick one, or two, or ten. If you are constantly propagating new labels before people familiarize themselves with the old ones, you reach the point we're at now, where people need you to explain what the label means almost every time you use it, making the label a drag on communication, not a facilitator. Also, what does it mean when you say your identity effects how you experience your body? This is gonna sound like a deliberately dense question, but isn't the way you experience your body: the senses? If your identity is how you feel about your body, why say 'experience'?"
"I used to think that the term Transgender only meant someone who suffered from gender dysphoria (I think that is a common way the term is used.) After watching this video, I looked a few sources and it seems pretty common that the term is also used to define anyone whose gender identity doesn't match their birth assigned sex. That cleared up the main confusion I had about this video."

All these stupid names for dumb ass gender shits ain't the real issue. The real issue is the dark overlords trying to control us with mass media and spiking our drinking water, making the frogs gay, our people dumb, and our president orange. We got to buy back out government from the illuminati (which by the way turns out to be pretty freakin' cheap.I mean it only took sum 600k to sell out our info to ISP's).  Excuse el English mio. No soy de America. A mi gente hispana. Esto gringo estan loco con pinga."
"Congrats on joining the club, kiddo! I'm happy to know I might have had some hand in converting you. Idk if I'm different from other young enbies but I personally enjoy self-degrading language as well. I laugh at comments calling me a trans weirdo because tru. Call me a transgender menace anytime (tho a lot of trans ppl would hate this). One thing you should know about estrogen, though: it doesn't actually change your voice. While t changes trans boys' voices, trans femme people have to go through voice training to change their voices. So you could go on HRT and keep your voice. Informed consent is also a way to avoid therapy to get on HRT. Doctors are still a thing, but it's really pretty easy. Are you still going by the same name and pronouns or is there  something else you'd like to go by?"
"I can except that your gender queer but only of you let me be your big strong sexy panda bear and give me some honey.  also your name need to change to Peggy on our marriage license and you need o call me Al . Also,how do you like he last name Bundey?"
"Thanks, despite being supportive of the gender revolution and LGBTQ rights, I often find that there are fundamental aspects of the community that I don't understand, in part because it seems like a lot of conversation revolves around assholes complaining about something they don't understand."
"Thanks for being human - Realising I'm not alone is comforting. Will always cherish your content. :)"
"I wrote a 5 paragraph essay responding to your video then realized this is youtube, no one gives a shit.  TLDR; Treating Gender as a binary concept is a mistake in the first place.  The only people who ever get any voice on the topic are annoying dipshits, making the whole conversation a toxic minefield.  I appreciate hearing your perspective, because you have repeatedly proven to be rational and super chill.  Which is incredibly hard to find on the this topic."
"So you said you don't bang dudes... yet. Do you think you might be bisexual? Are you bi-curious/questioning? Do you think you've been socialized to repress any potential feelings towards men and do you think most people are somewhere on the sexuality spectrum rather than just plain straight?  I apologize if this uh, came out of left field, im just curious for your take on it. I'm aware life is pretty much an ongoing process of figuring shit out about yourself and some of this stuff might not be clear to you either as of now."
"I know you put this in your comments, but I sorely wish you'd delved into how the biological binary is also complete bullshit."
"9:24 okay, u got mee there. hah!"
"you should read The Whipping Girl sometime"
"When I'm not swimming in so much debt, I am definitely becoming a patron of this channel. I love your content and the mix of actually, intelligent discourse with clever, hot dog smashing humor."
"People dumb down reality so they can handle it better and language falls far short in describing reality."
"LIKE A GAY"
"This video is amazing!! I love how you preemptively respond to the bullshit 'freethinking rationalist' (<- lmao at that part) while remaining highly entertaining and funny. You provide a lot of information really effectively while avoiding SJW tropes, i really hope it gets seen by a lot of people and you don't get any straw man response videos :)"
"great video, great hair"
"I guess my only frustration with the whole genderqueer/nonbinary is the number of people that seem to use it when they only have very superficial connection to the gender opposite their sex (mind, this is just an interpretation to begin with).  It seems like there's a number of tomboy lesbians that really glomb on to this idea when they're just a little atypical of the modern conception of what it means to be a woman (and sorry if that comes off prejudicial or shit; I'm just going off personal experiences here, so if I'm wrong, I'm wrong).  The fact that you have LITERALLY dealt with some dysphoria makes me far more willing to accept there's a bit more to this than I had in the past, and maybe people like I described above do deal with it to some degree as well.  However, I'm sure you can at least admit the occurrence rate among the younger set DOES make one wonder (even if incorrectly) if it's not sometimes more for the attention than actual feelings of dysphoria.  Anyway, thanks for another great video there; keep doing your thing and actually be willing to talk about things like a mature adult.  It's one of the main reasons I'm actually willing to watch and listen despite differing opinions on a lot of these topics.  ...in addition to you looking damn sexy in your choice of wardrobe. >.>"
"This was flat out brilliant. I've enjoyed all your videos but this one is so matter-of-fact and self-deprecating and undramatic and yet entertaining and...just perfect. I love the tone so much."
"your makeup is very pretty in this video."
"Spoken Chinese has no differentiable gender pronouns. Written Chinese does have characters for gender pronouns, but it is the same pronunciation."
"when i first saw one of your videos i thought you were a trans woman who'd already transitioned."
"Gender is a spook anyway."
"Hey ContraPoints I really like your videos and your perspective is sorely missed on Youtube.  But can you lay off the romanticizing of alcoholism? To me it comes off as a bit edgylordy and I imagine it gives a bad example to your younger audience members.  Thanks!"
"As another AMAB non binary person in their late twenties, I find a lot of what you said very familiar. You're basically where I was about two years ago.. and I feel you on it seeming like the NB social circle is dominated by AFAB folks 5+ years younger than me."
"It's a joy to see you settling into your craft with confidence and humor and nuance and insight and evolving good looks. Love it...grl..Nyk..dude...snowflake"
"For the duration of this comment i will indentify as an attack helicopter, specifically a gunship, infact i like gunships. as warmachines they make me possitively emotional, a stable airborn firering platform that can take on a main battle tank.(see glorious scene in rambo film for example. and yes they eventually ram into each other.) the problem of me demanding to be called whiffim or whiffer for example, is that my strictly romantic reverance for flying warmachines has no social relevance or context. i don't have chainguns, missile lanchers and rockets attached to my 'frame'. but when i(i am male by the way.) can demand to be recodnized as any flight of my fancy, it essentially boils down to social gender based gasslighting. especially when there is a whole fleet of me, with +600 models that require specific treatment unique to our specfic identification. just like how men and wemen(and other genders that did exist in the past that were destroyed by our current civilization.) are treated differently due to the history of hotdog and bun bashing action. i mean we, my fellow attack hellicopters and i are a fleet, we have enough passenger room¬†amoungst us to carry an army. an invading army. don't get me wrong, i have no problem with transexuals, hell, why not add afew more genders into the mix. traditionalism is hardly natural. both & nethier i don't have a problem. why not settle on afew more words, but over 600... bearing down heavily on our society. to the point of individual gender tailor-ship. its great to 'feel' like a gunship named after a heroic native american warrior tribe. its possitively empowering, but when i start making unreasonable demands, its only right that i be 'gunned' down for violating sovereign air space. female equality? homosexual rights? transexual rights? yes these were battles that needed to be fought, people were litterally oppressed, sweat, blood and tears. and deaths over this. yes there are more than two binary genders... but are we so oppressed now? by what right does my airborn fleet have to invade? be warned all who have read this far, my chainguns are metaphorical, if you misslabel me by model or design, or refuse to acknowledge my airborn divinity,¬† i will cry injustice and rightfully gun you down from my high place."
"It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders. Everybody except two people on this planet are closet agender."
"I am demigender call me whatever you want. I like to be feminine and wear skirts"
"I am demigender. I don't care what my pronoun is. I like be feminine and wear skirts."
"Greetings! Proud of you for coming out despite the hate you are now going to get.   I myself am a trans woman of 30, I just came out to friend and family and recently started hormones. I was questioning my gender for a long time prior.   I am commenting because you said something that really struck a chord, mostly because I felt very similar to you before transitioning. I'm 6'3', broad shouldered, deep voiced and have/had thick coarse hair everywhere. I had the sentiment 'if I can't pass, I don't want to even think about transitioning. It's too late for me so why even bother?' for a long time.   But I eventually realized I needed to transition, (At least socially and get on HRT.) and I've never been  better.   Getting on hormones was shockingly easy once I actually found a doctor that was willing to treat me. (In Ontario the hardest part is finding a doctor who actually treats trans people.) If you find a doctor who is an ally and understands trans people, the process is pretty painless. No hours long interrogation to see if I was 'really transgender', and I had it in a matter of weeks.  I understand that I got very lucky and that I am certainly NOT the norm. But I just wanted to let you know that the process of getting HRT doesn't need to be hell, and the benefits GREATLY outweigh the trouble."
"Really, Boxxy?  Surprised."
"Ooh my date mates gender queer this helps explain it's too me more so thanks a lot!!"
"this was so emotional and important for me as another genderqueer/nb person!! (and yes, saying 'cis scum' does get fun, and your makeup looked amazing in this video also) ‚ô•Ô∏é"
"HAHA ‚àö"
"This video makes me wish America lost the civil war and we somehow adopted a romance language with gendered pronouns."
"Hello...I learned about you from The Distributist. (Great live stream you had with him by the way.) From that intro, you may surmise that I tend to be a right wing Christian traditionalist type. (Forgive me.)  'Gender queer' seems a bit fuzzy. Clearly there are (and always have been) homosexual people. Clearly there are and always have been womanly men or manly women.  In some ways I myself might be a bit effiminate, if truth be told. There are also people that describe themselves as 'asexual,' and seem generally disinterested in sex.   The problem I see with all this, beyond my own personal moral issues, is that sexuality and identity seems to be becoming too subjective.  For example....lesbian couples often include a sort of masculine person and a sort of feminine person. If the masculine person dresses and acts, well, masculine, does that mean that 'she' should more properly be called a 'he?' If so, then is the 'feminine' person really a lesbian?  Likewise with homosexual men (though as far as I can tell, the sort of gender roles are often less obvious in gay men than in lesbians).  This, as Stefan Molywhatever would say, is not an argument. I see little point in arguing over the internet about this. I suppose my point is that if gender identity (or whatever) is so subjective and so perspective based, then why is the perspective of any one individual any more or less valid than any other individual? If someone describes themselves as a man, but to me they are clearly a woman, why should I conform to their preferences? That might be polite, but it is also dishonest on my part.  True enough, I am not God...no one really need pay attention to my opinion. But so many today want me to pay attention to theirs.  This is no criticism of Contra Points...hshe does not strike me as the 'I am different, bow to me!' mindset some seem to adopt. Rather, I am curious what hshe or anyone else will say.  Anyway, this has been Werner Voss, poster of long winded posts. Have a nice day."
"'these aren't women's clothes, they're my clothes!' Are you paraphrasing Eddie Izzard maybe? Because i distinctly remember him saying this exact same thing years ago. You're in good company!"

"there are 3 genders male female mentally ill"
"I wonder if the people who post videos ranting about people who want to use their gender identity to get attention... I wonder if these people even realise that they're ranting just to get attention themselves. Have you ever wondered just how exactly the other side lives? I mean. Just. Wow. I'm trying to picture myself in their shoes but it's simply beyond me. How could they not realise? Can cognitive dissonance lead to comatose? On another note, Nick, your fearlessness never fails to impress."
"You're definitely my new favourite YouTuber"
"I like you so frickin much. You've truly made this era of social politics livable. Hope your channel thrives :3"
"As long as you don't demand people to use made up pronouns or call you a 'she' when you're not passable as a woman, you can identify yourself as a dinosaur if you want to.  Also I hope you don't go in the women's bathroom."

"I've thought about this video for days and the concept of pronouns...and I've come to realise, I've never really thought about any societal implications to pronouns, like I always treated them like descriptive words, like a 'whatcha got in your pants?' type thing. I don't know, I like the idea in future where everyone can just be whatever and no one really gives shit so ,meh, it's worth the change in my eyes,¬†but like I feel really sorry for people wanting to have lots sexy times in the far future¬†cause you may charm the pants off of someone only to find their equipment is the wrong thing to rock your world .RIP.  I've honestly watched this video like 7 times now help, I identify with you too much."

"Rocky Horror's interesting and complicated because the writer of it is genderqueer (which explains a lot of why it's appealing despite its problems) but has rather TERF-y views on binary trans people. It seems that a lot of old people (TERFs, 'Harry Benjamin Syndrome' types, and Richard O'Brien's sort of reverse-HBS anti-binary trans views) fall into the trap of thinking 'gender works this way for me, therefore this is how gender works for everyone.'"
"I love you more and more with each video.  That hotdog bit killed me.  Literally.  I literally died.  I was resurrected by necromancers and the first thing I said was 'I need to watch that again!'"

"Great video as usual. I very recently started identifying as 'polyhomunculun', which essentially means that I experience life kind of the same way that I imagine Garnet does. It's probably actually some shade of schizophrenia, but 'polyhomunculun' does a better job of conveying the idea that both minds have a right to be here. Your content is really helping me to better understand myself."
"Genuinely happy for you mate."
"also your dress is lovely, I spent most of the vid staring at the lace <3 and that doll <3"
"I'm so glad you were able to discover yourself and find your means of expression.   On transitioning I have a few remarks. The notion of breasts was something I was neutral on prior to hormones and even considered a slight negative; I do have some athletic interests and shit just sounds inconvenient. However after the fact I found I really loved the way my body was changing; it's a very powerfully affirming characteristic. Obviously this is no guarantee for anyone else, but I thought I'd share.  From the date I wanted to start HRT to when I actually got to begin was about 2-3 months. I'm sure you know of informed consent, but while it was an option I actually didn't take that route and went through the more conventional system, because I wanted a professional diagnosis. It was three sessions with a specialist for an assessment crammed into a month, followed by a month and a half wait for my first appointment. Some of this was easier for me than average (great therapist), some is harder (endo is an hour+ away, my area is kind of ass for us snowflakes), but overall it wasn't difficult or terribly time consuming. If you feel dealing with therapists and doctors might just be holding you back from something you feel interested in, know it probably won't be too bad."
"Congrats on coming out, Contra!   I'm bigender myself and can relate to balancing femininity and masculinity in my expression. And I also used to call myself a crossdresser before I learned about non-binary genders. Tbh my family is so cis and straight, they were the kind to mock queer people so when you grow up with that, you try your hardest to fit in."
"Gender is actually more than just arbitrary roles society gives people.  Males and Females have slightly different brain chemistry, and you can be born with the wrong type of brain chemistry for your body, like you installed the wrong type of operating system, which is why most trans people feel like they're in the wrong body.  Here's the thing though.  Just like how Sexuality isn't strictly liking men or liking women, you don't just either have 'male' or 'female' brain chemistry, at least, a small portion of us don't.  So while gender roles are a social construct, actual gender isn't.  You can choose not to be trans or queer about as much as you can choose not to be gay."
"Ah yes! The Rational youtubers 'debunking' non-binary gender was my favorite youtube period. The irony is that the 'science' they champion is against them."

"Great vid, all the power to ya, and lookin' good!"
"I am; Normal, Normal Male, A Normal Male, or A Normal Person. This reflects my lived experience. I don't expect everyone to call me a Normal, I request people who choose a non binary label for themselves call me Normal, particularly in groups, to avoid making me uncomfortable and invalidating my lived experience."
"Can't hear that Handel piece without thinking of 'Barry Lyndon.' :)"
"Thank you for making this video. I'm gay and have had some difficulty understanding the gender queer/gender fluid identity, so hearing an articulate explanation of your own experience, plus a more general guide to the various identities and language used is greatly appreciated. Oddly enough, I've had numerous discussions on the pronoun thing, and my boyfriend - who is Chinese-Singaporean - said that sometime in the 80s modern Chinese started using gendered pronouns. The pronoun thing is a seemingly pathetic obstacle/argument when it comes to accepting non-binary identities, but I can't help feel it is a really big one - especially in the UK, where we have this obsession with wanting to be polite and make people feel comfortable, but avoid meaningful interactions with strangers like the plague (i.e. many people get angry and frustrated if they are unsure how to make someone feel welcome, but the last thing they want to do is acknowledge their ignorance openly to their guest and discuss their preferred treatment) - it's a farce, I know, and we need to educate ourselves out of it. Basically; thank you for doing what you do here on YouTube; your provocative sense of humour is hilarious; and a moment like this when you talk frankly about something that will likely get a ton of hateful comments from strangers, is really, incredibly precious."
"I'd BANG you either way. *WINK* Thanks for having the courage to have this discussion."
"I had an argument like that some time ago. He just wouldn't accept that gender is a sociology, not a biology thing. So rational."
"love you"
"You cucked your own coming-out, LUL."
"Still not as complicated as metal genres i think"
"My wife and I love your videos. We watch them together whenever a new one goes live. We're both really pleased for you.   I almost never comment on videos, usually because I get halfway through typing and then wonder who gives a shit about my opinion (Self-Deprecation Squad, assemble!) I also like to drink my taxes."
"As a skeptic, I approve this message."
"My dear, this was joyful to watch and I am so happy for you! Congrats, and very good words on this whole thing.  Also a sidenote, this is a fucking LOOK, my god your hair is like [fifty clapping emojis] and your makeup looks phenomenal and I am LOVING the top. I know that concentrating on looks is a weird thing to do in response to intelligent and personal remarks, but I also want to affirm the You Look Great bc putting yourself and your body out there is scary and it's cool that you can do that. Go n drink celebratory gin."
"You're a straight dude in a dress.You're not a different gender. Get over yourself."
"Is it corny to say I'm proud of you? Also welcome to the nonbinary/genderqueer club. I've always been kinda self-conscious abt my own nonbinary identity bc I don't conform to the 'ideal' androgynous look, but in the end I just decided binaries are dumb & who cares. I guess I can very much understand the stance of being nonbinary but also a 'political woman'. Anyways I'm glad to have someone I can relate to, even if you staunchly refuse to be a role model (I will find you inspirational, damnit!). Keep up the great work! <3"
"Hot dogs and buns. Lol I am crying!"
"'none of which is strictly binary' I mean its almost strictly binary,but hey another form of faith is on the rise."

"I like the majority of your content, but this was pretty sloppy compared to all the other videos.   Especially since there was no argument against the biological issue, which is the main issue."
"You should read West and Zimmerman's article 'Doing Gender' if you haven't already. It helps break down and conceptualize gender separated from 'sex' and even the self."
"This video is touching and emotional and good. But still witty, which is also good. I'm also a fan of genderqueer for the vagueness of it. I like it more than other specific terms."
"I have a feeling your content is too political for me to be too interested in, but your winning personality just earned you a new subscriber. (also you're hot kbye)"
"omg i subscribed so fast you are so witty"
"<3"
"i like your voice too. and i have to confess i've thought about it a bit before. early on while watching your videos i admittedly did wonder how many people watching would have clicked away rather quickly if you simply had a 'gayer' or more effeminate voice. as you acknowledge here, people tend to take voices like yours, which has a pretty conventionally masculine timbre, more seriously by default. it's also interesting to observe, as i believe you've also noted before, that some of your detractors (people who may or [most likely] may not have actually listened much to the content of your videos) seem to somehow believe that your voice is effeminate, or at least say so in an attempt to belittle you."
"We have no gender pronouns where I'm from so learning German was a bitch. How the fuck does a table have a gender? (I'm sure I'll get responses from rationals who can't figure out a joke.)"
"Makes sense, but when I saw Rebelle Absurdity's profile picture in the video, I almost cried again. I don't even associate that face with the philosopher anymore, and now Rebelle is gone! ;-;"

"Good stuff.  I tend to be annoyed by genderqueers, because they've ruined things for transsexual men and women who just want to go about their lives without a fuss; but you seem very concerned about not co-opting identities that don't really apply to you."
"Awesome video as always."
"Hey stupid, you are born a female or male then if you like the oposite gender congrts you are straight if yuou like the same gender congrats you are gay. is that simple. gender dysphoria are a minoriy of people! Transquer and another tumblr shiit simply doesn¬¥t exist!"
"You are a beautiful human being, Contra.Good video, nice explanation.Reactionaries : human beings are complex and there is a place for everyone in the vineyard of the Lord."
"Strictly speaking there is a gender difference in Chinese pronouns. ‰ªñ (he) and Â•π (she) have radicals that correspond to man and woman and are quite clearly different characters. Though they are both pronounced 'tƒÅ' so if you were only speaking Mandarin you would be right that there isn't a difference. That said, I am just being a shameless pedant who's spoiling an otherwise insightful and personal video about a subject that Youtube asshats would definitely do well to learn."
"I kind of appreciated that you identified as a man. I felt like you broke stereotypes for what it means to be a man. I like the idea that men can still be 'men' and wear clothing typically seen as feminine. I love that you wear YOUR clothes, and not a woman's clothing. You own it.  When you label yourself as genderqueer, does that mean that men who wear feminine clothing cannot self identify as men? Or that they shouldn't?   Thanks for your videos as always. You have become my favorite youtuber (: <3"
"You talked about a lot of really good interesting important stuff but I've just gotta focus on the shallow thing going on here: your hair/makeup/outfit game just gets better and better with every video. that eyeshadow highlight is A+++"
"That doll behind the door in the background was creeping me the fuck out Thanks for the vid btw contra"
"Congrats!  One of my friends from college later came out as genderqueer, and they are pretty goddamn cool, so you are in excellent company.  (On a much shallower note, that ensemble is fucking on point.  The hair, the makeup, the clothes, all of it. Would that I could blend that well.)"
"Awesome video as always, ma'am/sir. :) I've always had respect for you, but yeah, I'd say thanks to this video, it's at a high. Not a big change though, to be clear. Stay awesome. If you want. I'm not your boss."
"Interesting! I like the video, and it has made me realize that as far as gender identity and general appearance goes, you are just like me, except prettier. In my case, perhaps I'd explain it with a few subtle differences: I do generally feel much more comfortable when I look at a feminine version of myself in the mirror, but the whole hassle and all the risks of transitioning discourage me (else I think I probably would want to do just that), and overall, I just don't feel like I'm dysphoric enough that I *need* to transition or anything. I wonder if you can relate to that in any way?"
"such a wasted oportunity of not having the doll on the background sometimes changing position or pose between takes...oh well =P"
"Why can't we use ''it'' instead of ''they'' ? It would get rid of the confusing of people thinking ''they'' is referring to a group"
"Loved every second. I feel very similar to you."
"8:00 'Passing would take a lot of work' I mean yeah, unless you're extremely lucky and won out on the genetic lottery or come from money then it's going to be hard; however, it is doable. That being said I totally support you :D"
"honestly, i think it was around a year or half ago but i look back cringing pretty hard because i`de use my personal experience of being 'ex genderfluid' to de-legitamize others. as i move farther away from the 'rationals' im learning to put compassion and understanding above skepticism. i still dont quite know how to feel about non binary identities, and i think there should be a distinction between binary transgender people, otherwise,thanks to people like contra ive improved so much ._."
"The comedy in this episode was quite good"
"i can rel8 to this"
"@2:45, whoa whoa whoa! Maybe a bit of a semantic point, but my aim for being on HRT is to recognize myself in the mirror and feel confident in my appearance. It definitely varies from person to person, but my intention from transitioning is exclusively about alleviating dysphoria. I would love to pass, sure, but even if I never reached that point I'd still be incredibly happy with how much the effects of HRT have positively impacted my life.  By the way, super happy for you for this video! Again, knocked it out of the park. :)"
"april fools! contra is actually a straight white male"
"I'm still working out my gender identity. I feel more feminine than masculine.  A little while ago I didn't feel like I was either or anything else, now it's one this week, and next week, another. It was really great to hear your thoughts and experiences. I have met very few amab non-binary people (1?) nlt counting myself. It's comforting to know there's someone who's had similar experiences."
"At this point since there is no reconciling people's opinions I think we should just do away with the social construct of gender in general"
"Quick note about mandarin: Â•π=she„ÄÄ‰ªñ=he, but  thats only true in writing because they're pronounced the exact same"
"The timing here is so weird. Either you're fooling us, or you're fooling us into wondering if you were serious only to later confirm that you are."
"As long as I can keep referring to you are 'your majesty.'"
"As another adult, scotch-paying genderqueer human being, high five. Or slightly ironic high five, because I've probably passed the cynicism threshold for fully unironic high fives.   More seriously though, I appreciate this video and the (shudder) vulnerability you express during it. Also, I appear to be falling in love with you and/or your hair and makeup. I already agree with the majority of your points so I'm a little concerned I'm only watching you for a) personal validation and b) aesthetic enjoyment."
"you are so pretty !!"
"You rock Contra."
"I love you"
"Happy that you were able to be honest about yourself. And thank you for the great content in your channel. And I totally agree on the Muddy Waters point and would like to add that even though I identify as a man, listening to Kate Bush is the closest to making me feel like a female."
"Good for you, ContraPoints. I hope you're happy. Personally, I love having a penis, so I can understand that at least. It just wouldn't be the same, or half as fun, without one.  I'm just gonna leave it there because I haven't researched this topic, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings."
"im the same as you but im still hesitant to call myself non-binary and i think thats because im scared"
"What proper noun do you find appropriate for internet discourse?  I see some people using a given name, but like is Contra good?  Contrapoints?  Do you have a preference?"
"Anyone who would call someone a 'bad feminist' for being genderqueer or whatever is themselves a *very* bad feminist.   ... Also please accept this humble gift of an emoticon heart. * shy voice * <3"
"It just occurred to me how close you came to releasing this on April 1st.  Boy, that could have been awkward.  Right under the wire!"
"It's all a bit of a long winded way to say you like wearing dresses, make up and sexy little panties, but you are inspiring, my man üòú While I don't agree with it all, your videos are some of the best I've seen. A very interesting thoughtful view on 'that type of thing'. Keep doing you, fagg! üòò"

"The issue with a lot of this stuff is that it¬¥s based on denial. Let me explain before you assume I¬¥m a bigot or something. Let¬¥s say I belive the way someone dresses up is ridiculous, that gives me the right, perhaps, to say why I believe it looks ridiculous, but that doesn¬¥t make it ridiculous, it¬¥s a subjective thing. The issues come when: The person demands me to say it¬¥s not ridiculous. You don¬¥t  get to ask that, sorry, but I think Mormons are silly. They can be beautiful, and brave and whatever, but I think, their beliefs are just dumb. That doesn¬¥t give me the right to go and harass them, but they don¬¥t  have the right to demand me to respect them internally, or to censor my opinions. I can make a film exposing the Mormon faith for the sorry expectacle I believe it is (this is just an example, I don¬¥t give a fuck about mormons) Now, the second problem is that a lot of genderqueer, gay, etc people do things they themselves see as decadent or ridiculous. There is a LOT of shame and trauma and pain and psychological conflict that is evident to everyone, behind the psychological structure of homosexuality. The issue isn¬¥t that people act in a way that I deem ridiculous, the issue is I have the right to evaluate the available data, my own experiences, and come to the conclusion that homosexuality, genderqueer lgbt people are (among other things, since that aspect of their person doesn¬¥t determine their general worth as a human) Sick. Sick in the sense they don¬¥t aknowledge the trauma that led to their current psychological structure, and instead are mostly trapped in cycles of pathological behavior. It¬¥s actually well known in psychological circles, when you study they why and how of 'all that' surprise surprise, it¬¥s not pretty (example: no gay men had as a child good relationships with a father their considered strong and good) it¬¥s not about seeking out men because 'they look nice' it¬¥s because you want to compensate for a lack within. I can evaluate the logic of it not by measuring it with my values, but by seeking to understand it¬¥s own logic, on its own terms. It¬¥s clear that you¬¥re in pain, and confused, and that doesn¬¥t mean you¬¥re not a wonderful person or whatever other language construct you need to label yourself with at the moment to avoid emotional collapse. People are right to deem you 'sick' thought, they don¬¥t have to agree with your judgement that you are a valid construct. They have the right to judge you as sick, and your behavior as ridiculous (I actually think you¬¥re really funny also). Everyone is sick, but everyone needs to reject ALSO. An identity is about rejecting as much as it is about embracing. Rejection should remain sane and legal and polite thought, if you can manage it, and people should. But this hard push to normalise everything, including all these really creative, weird sexual fetishes etc, I mean, it¬¥s not gonna happen, first, and you¬¥re just inciting violence and pushing people to the extreme right to seek refuge from the whole postmodern insanity. I¬¥m actually all for postmodern insanity (there¬¥s no fighting it actually), but you have to understand, the world of language, the world of culture, cannot the total dissolution of all the value structures that held it together, and start using the terms crazy fringe twisted people come up with to try and sleep at night, specially when they change every five minutes. I don¬¥t demand people to like Tarkovsky. People don¬¥t  even like Kurosawa, some stuff is meant to be perceived as twisted and weird. I believe to a huge degree the reason why all these identities work, including homosexuality, is because of the pleasure that comes from doing something you yourself perceive as perverse at heart. To sum it up: I don¬¥t have to agree that you¬¥re not fucked up when it¬¥s clear you believe yourself to be. Just because you can be critical and deconstruct something doesn¬¥t mean anything goes (because you don¬¥t direct that critical eye to your own value structures that are a degenerate (I mean that in a clean technical sense) consequence of those same structures. The line, everyone draws it somewhere, the only truth is the void."
"I think what underpins most apprehensions of those skeptical of the explosion of genders on offer today, is a.) the non-stop popular conversation about trans this or that, that is grossly disproportionate to the number of people it effects, and b.) it seems to be of a piece with an affluent (decadent?) culture afflicted with an unhealthy narcissism that perpetuates a seemingly endless train of obsessions turned inward upon the self. It's not that most clear-thinking people deny these genders or trans related issues in all of us, it just seems symptomatic of a much bigger problem in our culture that needs much much more attention than trans and genderqueer issues. That said, I appreciate your videos and find you stunningly attractive. And that's coming from a straight guy."
"You had my curiosity but now you have my attention!"
"whenever i am forced to actually talk about my feelings, i too always add a verbal footnote of 'like a fucking gay' lmao. also that is probably one of the cutest tops ive ever seen you wear in your videos. where to cop?"
"there actually really isn't a scientific basis for only two genders/sexes anyway. even biological sex exists on a spectrum hence the existence of intersex people. even then your chromosomes may not necessarily match your hormones which may not necessarily match your sex phenotype. tldr; science definitely does not support the existence of only two sexes once you get into the nitty gritty parts of reproductive physiology."
"I don't really buy it. All gender identities are fake, thinking that you belong to one or the other or that you're born with the wrong gender identity is basically just accepting the traditional gender identities and then building on that, which doesn't work because it's all bullshit to begin with."

"I could write many paragraphs in response to this video with lots of questions and my own thoughts, but it would probably be read by almost no one.  I'll ask just these:  What do you think is the source (or sources) of your gender queer identity? Physiological? Developmental? Cultural? Something in your socialisation? Something in your genes? An effect of ingesting chemicals over a long period? Or something entirely different? I guess the question is--what is it that makes your gender identity different to that of more statistically typical 'males'?  And do you think you've always been gender queer, or is it something more recent?"

"I have a pretty libertarian approach to gender identity. It's goes something like 'you do you, boo.' :)"
"My NASCAR hat, shirt, and Jacket express an important part of my personality. If anyone criticized my outfit I'd get hurt and angry. If I were to just toss my whole NASCAR get-up because of someone's ruthless comments I'd be tossing a part of myself in the garbage. Fuck that! Fuck you bud!"
"I thought this was a really great piece. Your way of analysing the world is on point."
"I have no issue with people identifying as whatever they like. It's really nothing to me. But that doesn't prevent me from having an opinion, and thought that's all it is, it is one based on considerable experience. I work at a university and have done for more than two decades and we have staff members who have were given a gender that they no longer consider accurate. Some are post operative, some pre-operative and some who aren't having any procedures done but still consider themselves to be of a different gender to that assigned by their parents and that doctor who once glanced at them once before signing a form.. They're all people whose gender identity I accept happily.  With the studentry though, I think things are kind of different. I have watched numerous students discover that they were living a lie, discover themselves and start living their truth. And that's great but there are also a number of people who claim (although I don't think any of them are deliberately misleading anybody) to be various things such as gender-queer or non binary who then, after graduating, forget all about it. In fact, these are probably the majority. At least recently. For them it was just a phase, and unfortunately they are usually the ones shouting loudest about their rights and being offended by everybody who ever says anything that they don't like. Now, I think that's fine too. People should be able to experiment with identity without having to stick to their experimentations for their entire life. But they're the ones that give ammunition to to the people you mock in this video. Personally, these people nark me. Perhaps because they give a bad rep to my friends who really have had difficulties with their gender and identity. However, I still keep opinion this to myself when around them as I also talked a load of shit when I was in my twenties Or, more accurately, a load MORE shit.  I hope that makes sense. I will probably now get a shitload of abuse from people who think it's all fake and also from people who think that my suggesting that not all people identifying as these things are actually those things makes me a Nazi; but then as I never read the replies to my comments you'll be doing so more for your own satisfaction rather than to cause me any distress with your no doubt hilarious insults."

"You never say what you mean by 'gender'... Given that so many people use sex and gender interchangeably, you can't just assume everyone's on the same page. Just saying that it's a social/political thing and that sex is not strictly binary explains a difference between gender and sex but does not  explain what gender itself is. This is a problem since, as you point out, the Internet is not helpful for finding info on these things."
"I have a question: How do you define the word 'Woman' and 'Man'? If both gender and biological sex are a spectrum, then what is the difference between a 'Woman' and a 'Man'?"
"You have a thingy in your hair. Or in your camera presumably."
"I think in some contexts the prefix 'trans' doesn't signify a finite journey between an established origin and a clear destination but rather a state of permanent flux; a conscious embracing of the condition of being unmoored to any point of cultural or biological fixity.  I haven't seen this understanding applied to the trans of transgender (although I imagine it probably has), but if it were it would line up pretty well with your experience of gender fluidity.    Another great video by the way.  Excellent work."

"Actually, in Chinese both the pronouns 'you' and 'they'  are gendered: they each have a male and female version:  you = ‰Ω† (male), Â¶≥ (female) they = ‰ªñ (male), Â•π (female)  That said, it is true that (1) the pronunciation of each one is identical, so you can only tell the difference in reading/writing; (2) most people don't care about such things and just use ‰Ω† and ‰ªñ for anyone and everything."

I would, in my unprofessional and biased and complete stranger opinion strongly urge you to look into transitioning. You can pass, like I honestly wasn't sure if you were born male or female when I first started watching you, and you have only contemplated transitioning.  That said you do you and you are one of the most androgynous people Ive seen."
"Seeing this made me really happy. I'd been feeling recently almost a bit embarrassed about being non-binary, because it felt like the arseholes were dominating the discussion, and there were very few people I could find out there who felt similarly to me. Certainly very few people so eloquent and good at countering the shite they come out with. Thank you <3"
"For what it's worth, as an 'older' woman (i.e., older than the current trends and vocabulary), and one who is a professional in a traditionally non-fem discipline (I am a computer geek), I appreciate your efforts to break out of the constructs that arbitrarily confine us. Forgive me for conflating the sexism of the workplace with the day-to-day struggles of gender identity, but I think there is much to be gained from looking at these two issues side by side. I see my own social preferences for self-expression hobbled in similar ways, and I focus on what society expects of a 'computer geek' versus my own idea of my persona. Am I a bad feminist because I like being feminine? Do I shock my colleagues when I am willing to be dominant in a discussion because, goddammit, I know what the fuck I'm talking about and let's fucking do this the right way for once? Yes, yes I do. Deconstructing this shit is a good thing. Don't doubt it for a second."
"'It felt like the identity wasn't for me'  this is so sad, a non binary identity shouldn't have any guidelines or restrictions, but sadly it kind of does. I 'fit' that guideline  (afab, teenager) but I don't want to be associated with irrational, hateful, ignorant people. (I'm really not trying to throw shade on anyone but they are a lot of vocal irrational non binary people who really puts a bad name on non binary people. it's not about a statement for me it's about being... me)  I just want to be me and feel good with me."
"It took me quite a while to finally accept that I am non binary and my gender is valid. I was in denial for a few years, thinking that it was all a phase or a made up kids thing, but deep down inside, if the government had a third gender to put on my legal documents, I would have taken it. I tried being a girl, it didn't work, and I tried being a boy, it also didn't work. I'm not sure how to explain this, but whenever I'm in female or male social circle, I just really don't fit in either of them. It wasn't because I didn't get along with them. They were cool, but I really was not connected to them. It was as if I was....Different from them? I think they looked at me differently too. Even looking at pictures of me presenting as my assigned sex is a little weird. It's not like I hate them, it's just weird to see where I came from. I won't forget my assigned sex experience because it's a part of who I am and part of my journey in life. Sorry for the cheesy shit, hahaa. Good on you for coming out, you're a good and funny person. I hope with more people coming out as non binary, people would start to understand us more."

"Still trying to wrap my head around it, but this helps. Genderqueer is a lot harder to 'get' than trans which is pretty simple in hindsight, but seeing you enjoy and and adopt traits from both genders makes genderqueer into this cool mishmash of x, y and z.  P.S  Also wanna clarify that even though I'm still coming to 'get' it, I've never really been bothered/offended/disgusted by it. Always assumed it was out of my own ignorance than anything else. I despite this whole attack helicopter bullshit reactionaries come up with to make fun of something they don't understand and scared of."

"You are honestly pretty cute"
"Maybe the reason for the 'misunderstandings' is that there are a lot of contradicting infos out there. Like you have people that say that clothes don't have an inherit gender and that anyone (including boys) should be comfortable wearing them and then you have people that use differing styles of clothing to express there fluid or non-binary gender. So is clothing inherently gendered or not?  Also you are a self-deprecating feminist with a sense of humor. A rare breed. You are inspiring as fuck."

"I understand how the language may be important to you as an tool of understanding yourself. That's entirely not where the issue lies. I can't speak for other people, but personally I just don't really give a shit. So it's not so much the language, as it is the unwillingness to shut up about it that puts me off. To me your just a fucking freak. And that's cool. I'm a fucking freak, most my friends are... as a matter of fact I think most interesting people are. Being different is not the problem. Constantly talking about your experience as 'a different' is what comes across much more as 'feeling special' than as 'being different'.  I just read through that again and have come to the conclusion that I am not exactly a word-smith... but I guess with a bit of good will it's comprehendible enough."

It provides a very well-rounded look at the whole case while still being comparatively short.  That's a really great dress Contra, it looks amazing on you."

"Congratulations fellow genderqueer! Owl and I adore you and all your videos."
"I'm still not onboard with all of this but this video was actually quite good and made me understand a lot of this. I assume I'm okay with people being non binary but I'm still not gonna use 'they' pronouns, I'd prolly just use the pronouns for the gender you look like or the gender you want to be. In the case that someone's nonbinary I'd just alternate between 'he' and 'she'. Fuck you this is the way I am and using 'they' pronouns just sounds wrong to me. It sounds as if you can't tell how many people you're talking about."

"I get the feeling the reactionary anti-nonbinary folk are spiritual descendants of prehistoric fish who refused to accept that lungs and legs were a thing. Have fun in the ocean, I guess. I'll join the rest of humanity in evolving into Schr√∂dinger's superposition of not-being *and* being septenary-gendered while downloading our consciousness into the quantum foam for guilt-free overwrites of weekend sixty-seven-way fuckfests with aliens and nanomorphing sex toys on eightballs of stardust, before getting back to work on the Cosmic Monday, reformatting the cosmos into a stable nirvana for all life in the universe.  I'm sure we'll all pause from time to time to remember ancient YouTube randos who opted out of existence rather than let someone else be happy."
"Wait shit this kinda resonated with me a bunch shit I thought I was just bi but fuck this is a whole other can of worms I was not ready for"
"Hmm, hey thanks for this video it taught me something of worth. I've always been an advocate of trans rights and the rights for people to use labels that fit their perceived sense of self...   But that always came from a place of 'just let people do whatever they want, at worst it's irrelevant and has no impact on your life'   Thats sort of a backhanded version of acceptance. 'I dont give a crap what you do' is very different to saying 'I empathise, understand and accept what you do.'  So yeah, thanks for the insight!"
"I was under the impression that biological sex is not gender and that gender is how other people and society see an individual not how the individual sees themselves.  Is this incorrect?"
"This video should be mandatory viewing for just everyone. Also, it makes me happy. I feel like I've met the real Contrapoints. Don't do yourself down - you are doing a very brave thing; but believe me, the level of self-understanding and self-acceptance that comes from being able to put a name to who you are brings such fulfillment and security. The future looks up, believe me."
"You and your video came out. Yay for you and me! <3"
"Thoughts on this? https://ursavita.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/the-nature-of-gender/  Your post script 1 comes closest to addressing this but i'll restructure it in relation to the article. Why can't you just wear what you like and use words that AREN'T the words that also refer to sex. Insisting that one IS indeed a man or a woman because of gender is needlessly confusing.   You make the sex/gender distinction at the start of your video but every other discussion in this space seems aimed at making that distinction blurrier. When someone says 'you're a man' to someone who is male by sex but female by gender, are they wrong? Why do people feel the need to correct this seemingly correct statement given this distinction between sex and gender? Why couldn't the correction be more along the lines of 'I might be male but I'd prefer to be a woman.'? (or whichever definition of gender you'd like to use).   I've no objection to trans people. I think everyone ought be free to do what makes them happy so long as they don't hurt others. Obviously gender expression and identity aren't hurting anyone. I just don't quite think they make sense. My interest is really academic. I like to think clearly and I think others ought do so as well. If something doesn''t make sense then I'd like to make sense of it."
"This might sound harsh, but if you want us to not be inspired by you, stop being inspiring. This video helped me a lot by the way, I've been confused by my feelings about my gender identity, so thanks for giving a face to being genderqueer. I love you honey!"
"Isn't telling people that you are genderqueer a bit like reporting your eye colour; most will have been seeing it more often than you and others will argue over the shade/colour/luminosity/signs-of-possession, (though this video is probably educational for some.)"
"Loved it!"
"Thanks for candidly addressing your own exploration of identity tying in with this.

"What I find funny is that people have made careers on youtube through the 'there are only two genders' argument, the reason for that is that there are people who want to find out other people's baseless assertions that might be better hidden within a seemingly decent argument. It seems that a lot of people have at very least a reasonable interest in the gender discussion and, while of course, historically (like, take homeopathy today as an example of the contrary*) a lot of people seem to be interested in just pushing their heels into the dirt and not letting this happen. Also this idea of labeling, things are confusing enough as they are, like can a depressed person say they are depressed or is that trying to collect all the labels and will deserve ridicule for daring to express such a thought that they fall into a group, a group which carries with it a name, which helps identify the people of said group. *Reading back, this seems unclear, I am basically saying that in the case of homeopathy the majority rejects it and wants medical science to stay in the 'hands' of the established knowledge, and that that is correct to do as homeopathy is stupid."

"Hey! Hey! Don't rain on Rocky Horror's parade! It's on our side, Contra! It's great! And subversive and queer as hell!  D:  For real tho, it's one of the most radically pro-queer feature movies made before 1980... this is the sort of thing I could talk about all day, but mostly if you rewatch it with its queerness in mind you'll quickly realize how much it is glorifying the 'pervert deviants' and making fun of its stupid heteronormative protagonists. It may get thorny in that it asks a lot of the audience, more than a typical non-arthouse musical at least, but at the end of the day I can't help but get sad when I see so many people on the internet taking the most superficial interpretation of the movie to heart and calling it transphobic and whatnot, when actually it's a text so full of maniacal twists and turns that there's a stronger case in it for a hedonistic brand of satanism than there is for transphobic nonsense... look, it's one of my favorite movies and I'm a commentator on the internet, that's all. It's a movie that helped me a lot and it's the farthest thing from Silence of the Lambs's serial killer. It gets a bad rap nowadays, mostly due to a potentially shitty fanbase (the sort that goes to the screenings I mean, and which I do not count myself as part of tbqh)."
"I found your channel by watching Lindsay's livestream. You're amazing! And I think I like this video the best yet. But I am a sucker for sincerity"

"Can't we just go back to the days of a YouTube that was that kid Boh3me reviewing movies and video games, and that other kid doing movie reenactments? Postmodernism is giving me naughis und schvilkis. Sorry."
"that creepy doll in the background o.O"
"You echo so many of the things I think of A lot.  Many of your stances echo with me."
"I use self deprecating humor all the time because I want to feel 'normal.' But, let's face it--you really can't hide yourself from others or yourself. Calling yourself stupid or ugly or sick or whatever does not convince anyone that you are those things. I don't think we are fooling anyone with this kind of talk at all. Maybe it comes off as asking for validation? Maybe we should just own who we are and get on with it. But what do I know. I'm just an idiot."
"I don't agree with your position by a long shot, but you entertaining as hell and your not talking down to people"
"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I imagine that the same people who deny trans or non-binary identities also think psychology as a science is 'just a bunch of bullshit', since that's where most of this stuff comes from.   Of course those same people have a made up fear of people exploding when they get misgendered, when the worst you'll get in the majority of cases is a stern correction."
"Is this video safe for work?"

"awesome job as always! sorry so many people are doing the whole 'WELL HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HOW YOU FEEL???? WHY DON'T YOU USE (insert inadequate word here) TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF INSTEAD????' shtick; it's shitty but also super common. Apart from that, I can now proudly welcome you aboard the down with cis bus!"
"Do people typically dislike composing a philosophical excursus justifying themselves? I always thought that was one of the more enjoyable aspects of being a fucking weirdo."
"I love all your videos, but this is one of my favorites. I'm transgender and I often have a hard time explaining clearly and concisely why my identity matters. This video is going to help me out a lot in explaining. Thanks! Also, you are absolutely inspiring."
"I think that most of us on the other side are cool with you identifying, dressing, or fucking how ever you'd like. Just don't throw grandma in jail for mis identifying you at the piggly wiggly.  Also you have my love regaurdless how you identify yourself."
"You inspired me."
"Cool, good to know, thanks!"
"I love this video, but I'm going to have to say this was the fucking worst thing to watch at 4 in the morning when I'm supposed to be up early. but that's on me"
"I'm here for this Contra :D"
"The more I read and listen to discourse on sex, gender, and the interplay between them and society as a whole, the more I've come to the conclusion that it's a complicated cluster-fuck with no one right answer or universal truth.  And on a much less philosophical note, anyone else freaked out by that doll lurking off to the side?"

"I'm glad you found yourself, I didn't really encounter gender queer until I was slumming it in Minneapolis and started living with my wife who is also queer"
"That whole section from 0:29 to 1:00 is actually why I tend to dislike the 'Well, it's not my *job* to educate you, do your own research!' argument."
"I've noticed that a lot of cis and binary people seem to demand some kind of 'proof' of non-binary gender identity before they're willing to respect it, which seems to me to be in itself disrespectful. I can't recall ever having to convince people that I deserve to be referred to with male pronouns or otherwise gendered as male, ergo, in the interests of equality I won't demand that non-binary people convince me of their gender identity. I'll respect a person's gender identity as default, just as mine has always been respected as default."
"Ps estrogen doesn't do a lot to undo the affects of testosterone on the voice.  The vocal changes in trans women are to the best of my understanding mostly performative.    Trans women and anyone assigned male at birth on estrogen please feel free to  correct me."
"I feel weirdly relieved about this because as a fellow gq, I actually had to keep reminding myself 'No! Contra identifies as a man!' before because you kept automatically slipping into my 'nonbinary zone' of gender. So now you can just stay there, or here I suppose, seeing as it's my mind and I'm also in that zone. Also re your presentation, I also never felt like you were really 'crossdressing' either, it was just your gender expression, and the few times you were wearing more masculine stuff I felt THAT was crossdressing or at least out of character. The thought of you dressed in like... normal button downs or something outside the house feels disturbing. I'd prefer to meet you in the dominatrix outfit, it would feel less weird."
"Congrats for exploring and better understanding yourself, and coming out and sharing this stuff to others also doing 'odd gender jazz'. -from a trans peep who is also a good bit fluid and jazz and non binary and stufffffl, also I lie to myself a lot :P"
"I'm not going to pretend like I understand what this is like. But honestly I don't give a fuck what you are or what anyone else is as long as you're happy and not preachy or calling me transphobic for not getting it or thinking that it's not even important in the first place."
"I love that Bengali doesn't have gendered pronouns. Everyone is 'shay.'"
"Ugh thank you soooo much for including Arielle in your call out! She needs to back off the gender identity and trans content because she's so happily ignorant and rolls out trans NB etc folks to be talked over by her and give her extra views and I find it super yucky :/"
"Nicely timed with trans day of visibility ~ <3"
"I'm drunk right now but I swear I'll come back and write something coherent, you sexy minx."
"I remember asking you about this a good while ago and you said you didn't read people like Judith Butler anymore but for others who might be browsing the comment section, I think it would be instructive to do some research on the field of Queer Theory and other related philosophy. I myself am a novice in this regard but I find it fascinating and wish more people would give it some thought.   Academics can be our friends."
"I'm really glad you made this video! Your sense of gender identity sounds almost exactly the same as mine, including the thing with the pronouns. It sounds like you took a similar journey to me as well to understanding it as well; took me years to unpack it all. It's nice to know that there are other people in the world who are weird in the same way, common-uncommon human experience you know?  Also I TOTALLY CALLED IT! YESSS! ONE OF US! ONE OF US! :D"
"I need giant ass posters of those last images, for uh, personal reasons. Cheers."
"Well you help me understand better non-binary people and some misunderstanding I had with the numerous labels that are used by those communities to describe themselves. Thanks. Also I am glad you found a term that describe you best. What you did took a lot of reflection and questionning yourself. I respect that.   Keep up with the good work."

"It's interesting being an agender person with a best friend who is trans bc my experience with gender is pretty much 'gender isn't real wat r u guys doing' while also acknowledging that it's very real and important to people that aren't me."
"A good handful of the humour here required a disclaimer, you even had to have a frame saying JOKE.   A big part of what pulls me away from this shit is how much, even if you're part of it, you're tediously walking on eggshells."

"Thank you for sharing <3  CP - I would like to argue biology with you because it seems people (incl yourself) give up too easy & allow this argument to fester.  While you glossed over the variance in the definition, one thing to add was up to 80's (& in some areas, beyond) ALL intersex people's genitals were 'fashioned' to appear 'non-Ambiguous' & their goal was to fashion a penis (because they all have the x chromosome - but this practice happened before the discovery of chromosomes). If that proposal was unworkable, they would then fashion a vagina (which is easy). The thinking was that the natural state of a human is male in sex & all babies were psychologically a blank slate & therefore would adapt to the gender binary regardless of whatever 'gender' they grow up as.  NOT because a gender binary exists, but because they 'fashioned' it that way surgically to all babies that did not conform to look at in a binary way most of the time at, or as close as possible to, birth. (Can I go out on a limb here & suggest Adam & Eve had something to do with this 'penis' envy paradigm?) This is the reasoning behind the 'gender is a social construct' because .. well, it is! The gender system we are familiar with was 'fashioned' to be that way physically & all minds were blank slates able to be molded into adopting this 'fashion'.  This is how we know about gender identity & that it exists, as this 'paradigm' fundamentally failed due to the problems (GID) intersex people were experiencing. This 'experiment' yielded very poor results which led us to a fact. All babies are NOT blank slates. There ARE intrinsic 'directions' a human mind will follow if left to their own path. We know gender & sexual orientation are 2 of those paths & persuasion to go against these natural paths, in favour of another, often resulted in poor mental health for the individual.  Thankfully we treat individual patients now, not paradigms.  The fetus develops genitals in the 1st trimester. The fetus develops the brain in the 2-3rd trimester (synapses at 17 weeks (Quickening), rapid expansion at 28+ weeks).  The point is, there is no evidence to suggest that the same process that initiated biological sex, has any or at best, an easily interruptible influence on the formation of the brain & later the development of the minds internal sense of gender therefore you cannot link sex to gender post-hoc in any meaningful way.  There is however, decades of evidence to suggest that 'gender (social expectations of gender groups divided by sex)' was only a goal/meme/paradigm & 'gender identity' (which gender social group one identifies with) is not intrinsically tied to biological sex as per Intersex & nor is their mind a blank slate as per intersex. Evidence to suggest that encouraging someone to repress their natural path causes a range of mental health issues as per intersex (which for the Fiscals, costs us a lot of money so it is a problem to solve, cost effectively). There is centuries of recorded observations of human cultures having up to 11 genders in their society & that those paths happened naturally when left to choose their directions.  I point this out because the one group of people that have had science interrupt their lives with experiments & failed treatments (Intersex) are often overlooked when dealing with social attitudes to anything that doesn't 'look' the same when it comes to gender & sex. These people are people as well but were used as social guinea pigs. It's deplorable & we need to do better in our attitudes to make sure our arguments do not take away the actual journey intersex people have so often been forced to endure."
"Great video, as always, also why the fuck is that doll just staring at me from the background"
"I always found the term 'non-binary' stupid, because most people are either or, not binary, except the likes of you. But anyhow, I really enjoy this channel because I hang around Kekistani YT a lot, and you are virtually the only person on the other side of a lot of those talking points that makes any coherent kind of sense, and in a productive and well thought-out way, which to me seems more norm-defying than dressing like you eat a lot of cock. As such, I'm kinda bummed out that you adopted some new age identity label, because I always liked that you sort of understand the kind of system you are in and are totally comfortable with falling outside of it. Now you're kinda saying 'people like me should be in the system and this is an open show of solidarity'. And fair enough, but I'm revoking your badass pass."
"knew it, hope putting a name to your gender ID helps :)"
"Are you saying that you need a newly socially constructed gender because neither of the ones already existing in our culture describe you?"
"happy tdov!"
"Congrats on living a more true version of yourself.  Very happy for you."
"CP (incidentally stands for other things of varying indecency), I wanted to say that you're awesome, and I've been stalking... I mean keeping up with ya since you were making videos riffing on the piano with your classical skillz!  It seems you've come out of your shell more and for that I'm glad!  I think a large part of why people aren't as taken to your ideas as they should be is that you exist outside of their scope of convenience, which says more about them than it does you.  Anyway, keep up the good work and don't become an alcoholic if you can help it!"
"IMHO, the problem with gender is that we apply so much meaning to it that people feel they need to escape it to be who they truly are. I'm siding with biology on this topic, that there are two human genders, male and female, but then that definition stops there, as does its significance socially. You can be a man and wear dresses, makeup and be just as feminine as you'd like, it doesn't make you any less a man. And I don't mean that in a demeaning or restrictive manner, I actually applaud you for doing so, and to be honest, even like it. I mean, it's just your gender, and in no way should it inhibit you from expressing your true identity. When people start making up new genders because they don't want to fight the stereotypes that are attributed to the two actual genders, they're just being cowards and running away. It's not helping anyone, least of all yourselves. Be brave and fucking fight the stereotypes. Be a man AND be who you are. I want to live in a world where being a man or a woman means nothing more than biological function, and you can express yourself freely from that point, unrestricted. I don't want to live in a world where you have to shop for labels to find one that fits you. You're never gonna find one that fits you perfectly anyway, so we'll just end up with a unique label for each individual, and you'll actually have to TALK to that individual to find out what that label means. Why not just skip the labels to begin with and do that instead? You may not like being called a man, Contrapoints, but I like to call you a man (and you are one), not to take away from you who you really are or attempt to change you or silence you, but because I want that shared gender of ours to INCLUDE who you are. There's a lot of 'manliness' that I'd rather not subscribe to, but I like who you are, and I like the message it sends to other men. It tells every conflicted boy who sees you that yes, you can be a man or a boy and be just who you want to be and be unafraid. How is that message conveyed if you refuse that you are male? I didn't mean to be this ranty, but I really feel like your fight is lost the second you divorce yourself from your gender. It's like Louis CK said about gay marriage : 'Fight for your right to marry! And then don't.' Own your gender, but show that it cannot and should not, ever, restrict you from expressing your true self. As a genius (me) once said, 'Chicks with dicks. What's not to like?'"
"Honest question, not trolling. What would be the answer to someone who says 'why can't i identify as an attack heilocopter'? I'm not really up to speed on gender issues and debates. Thanks in advance."
"I wish you were a woman, you look very pretty."
"After hearing you in the Internet Persona Live Stream, it feels very natural this video happened. Anyway, feels good to see a youtuber I like be under the same Nonbinary Umbrella as myself^^ (specifially, I'm genderfluid)"
"I'm still involved in figuring out what I think about the scientific ideas relating to gender, but even if I decide I disagree with you... more power to you for unabashedly owning your personality & having the strength (or blood alcohol content) to be self deprecating about it. I'd share a bottle of scotch with you, but I don't think it digitizes well."
"yyaaaAAAAAaa im so proud of u!!! This makes me so happy cos my friend came out to me as NB yesterday and its crazy how so much more comfortable and happy they are ; O ; Btw your hair and makeup is gorgeous!!!"
"This was wonderful, funny, and honest. I know you said not to be inspired, but I like to do what I want anyway."
"...that's a cute dress."
"Lovely. Thanks for sharing."
"psssssst  reddit.com/r/transdiy  also estrogen and testosterone blockers don't affect your voice ;)"
"As someone who recently came out as genderfluid to a couple friends, this video is something of a comfort to me. I might show this to my family when I tell them eventually. Not right now tho because lol I'm not ready for that fucking conversation yet.   Also I WILL be inspired by you, YOU CANT TELL ME WHAT TO DO."
"You say not to be inspired but honestly this is super inspiring"
"This is so good, Contra. This is the kind of stuff that broadens my own views and fosters empathy. Top work!"
"good day to come out, trans day of visibility !"
"You are absolutely one of my favorite people now, thank you for doing what you do. We need some more educated opinions like this that can explore epistemic and phenomenological questions and then bang together hotdogs. I mean that in the most sincere way possible. You gotta speak to people on their level and this is one more bridge over the gap constructed in a necessarily messy, but beautiful way."
"You are confusing me because you look pretty."
"I did make a response to your original Non-binary video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgMMKNbRp28"
"Faggot. Here, in the realm of normalcy, we use such word for this phenomenon.  Geez. If it wasn't my crippling autism, I'd make a response video.  EDIT: regarding pronouns. In Polish all nouns are gendered. Table is masculine, Milk is neutral and Closet is feminine. No way around it without butchering the language."

"thank you"
"Serious question: where did you get your dress?"
"Congrats!"
"You're a cool guy Contra."
"Not to be confrontational, but just looking to understand: What is the point of considering yourself transgender or transitioning if you don't have dysphoria? Is it just an aesthetic thing? I really can't comprehend why someone would want to medically transition if it wasn't a matter of feeling uncomfortable with their gender. I'm asking this having been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and been on HRT for over a year. Also I realize you may not want to transition medically, but I feel like you may be able to clarify this question.  Also, you're super pretty no matter your gender, and if you do decide to transition I think you'd do a lot better at passing than you think. Voice training is absolutely possible to get good at and proportions change very quickly. Congratulations on coming out :D"
"I love this video so muchIt's just genius"
"Can't stop me from feeling inspired! That dress looks amazing on you, I love your boots from two videos ago, congrats, and big high fives. I love your channel, I love your videos, and you are fantastic."
"stunning top my dear"
"I was surprised only because I thought you would have associated with one of the non-binary genders sooner if you had any intention to at all. I enjoy your videos all the same, so I hope you keep it up!"
"i've actually received a 'rapid disorienting alternation' between male & female honorifics from 3 different people on the telephone. it only happened after i told them that i am  male. :P they thought i was a girl from the sound of my voice XD"
"Ok, now I see why you were tweeting about picking hot dog bits out of the light socket"
"I still regret mentioning attack helicopters in my video on the topic.  It's the deadest of dead horses."
"here's a nice shallow comment about how adorable that top is, this whole look was very, 'soft summer witch' and i love it."
"That fucking creepy doll..."
"You'd think by now they'd know the difference between gender and sex. It's not brain surgery, lol."
"Abolish gender."
"I just wanted to stop and say thanks for this video. I'm a cishet (ish) white dude. This video changed me and the qay I think about stuff in at least 2 places"
"Gender can be fluid because it's a social construct.  But can't one say that sex is biological and there are only two sexes?"
"Not gonna stop being inspired, 'cause you seriously make some of the best and most interesting content on YouTube. Much love"
"2:22 :o"
"This reminds me of the german √ºber race scientifical videos before the war"
"can someone elaborate on objection 1? why does that label need to replace your gender label? why can't sexual deviancy or some new term suffice?  btw you look great with wavy hair"
"The contrasting images in the credits are beautiful."
"Alright 6 minutes in intermission comment time, I have been pretty neutral for a while on genderqueer because I'm not learned in that area but anyways genderqueer reminds of an old sci-fi novel I never finished years ago and I'm not sure I still have. In the book, people would change genders (binary) up until they were young adults when they had to choose between being a man and being a woman only that some people didn't want to choose like the main character."
"there can be X (male fly), XX (female fly), XY (male fly), XXX, XXY,  XYY, ZW, ZZ, temperature dependent, etc...."

"I'm twenty-one and I have always had a high-pitched, expressive, effeminate voice, even more-so as a kid. When I hit puberty, my voice dropped and I developed this deep, monotone voice which I kept for the remainder of my teenage years, even though it didn't match my personality at all and I really hated it. I didn't like sounding manly because I wasn't manly. My voice still had feminine inflections, but combined with my deep voice it just felt jarring.  But during my senior year of high school, something changed in my voice once again. I noticed that I was speaking more expressively again and my voice sounded slightly higher. I began exercising my voice (I was also in choir during this time, which helped me gain control over my voice) to both get rid of my light southern accent and to regain my expressive, more effeminate voice.   Now I have the voice that I want, for the most part. The voice that most matches my personality. I honestly hate male puberty. I know that objectively women suffer much worse during their respective puberties, but I have always felt that male puberty sucks because you lose your expressive voice. Most men just sound monotone to me.   I was often wonder if there's, like, a second puberty for some people. Where your voice changes twice as you grow.  I also worry that my not being traditionally 'manly'‚Äî in appearance, personality, mannerisms, speech, and interests‚Äî will impede my personal life. Worries and insecurities aside, I'm not exactly keen on changing my entire personality in order to fit into a social 'box'.   I used to be profoundly insecure about not being traditionally manly, and I even got bullied over it growing up (having a high-pitched 'little girl' voice and being able to belt like Mariah Carey until puberty didn't help matters). But at some point, you just have to own it.   I embrace it now. Honestly, I don't even 'want' to be manly. I don't want a gruff voice or burly muscles. I don't want facial or body hair. When you grow up and finally gain the ability to take control and autonomy over your own body and life, it is truly a liberating and poignant feeling.   However, there are some days where my voice just drops and I can't speak or sing in the voice that I want. I want my voice to be more effeminate. During high school and my early college years, I had severe body dysmorphia due to being overweight in middle school. So when I lost the weight, I still thought that I was fat. Every day I would purge all of my food.  Eventually, as I obtained the body that I wanted, I developed another dysmorphia/dysphoria: a voice dysphoria of sorts. I wanted my voice to be more expressive and more effeminate, so I learned that every time I threw up by using a toothbrush, my voice became higher. Every time I vomited phlegm, I was able to get my voice to a more effeminate, higher pitch. But doing it every day eventually took a toll on my throat and I just couldn't do it anymore.   As of last November, I haven't purged and I haven't done a painful 'throat cleansing' and I've been trying to find healthier methods to keep my voice in a higher pitch. I usually just gargle salt water and that does the trick well enough. My voice still causes me extreme anxiety when my voice isn't on the level I feel it should be.  I've been trying to find resources online to see what exactly my problem is and all I can find is transgender-related threads and sites, but that isn't my problem. I have no problem with being biologically male‚Äî I have just always hated having a masculine voice, body hair, and conventionally 'manly' things, ever since I was a kid.   I wonder if voice dysphoria can exist in non-trans people. Sorry if I was rambling, but I just needed to articulate this. I just wish I had my girly, high-pitched kid voice back. Thankfully, today my voice sounds passable: it's a bit nasally, but it's still high-pitched and expressive like I want."
"I have a friend that came out to me as transgender while also being my FWB. It was tough to adjust since she also helped me to figure out more of my sexuality as Im more gay than orginially believed. It scared and sorta angered me that she was keeping this bottled up inside, but its a process like finding your sexuailty in a hetronormaltive socity. I realize now its why some hetro (and uncomfortable amount of homosexual) people may have trouble with addressing Ts and Qs with the correct pronouns. They've never had to think about their sexuality that intently."
"We're all on a spectrum or several spectra, but honestly, asking for recognition is overextending. How do you expect strangers or the government or whatever to categorize/treat you? Can't genderqueers(with the exception of transsexual people) recognize  that 99% are binary and demanding recognition is setting a regressive precedent?"
"Creepy doll aside, I'm nonbinary myself. I'm also intersex. I was born male bodied but at puberty things got weird. When I turned 30, things got *very* weird, and I had to accept that there was something different about me. At first I thought I was trans. I went all-in with the femme. However, it didn't quite fit. Chromosome tests confirmed that I was a case of 46 xx/xy chimerism. I have the DNA of two separate people in me, one of which is male and the other is female. And that's the way I consider myself: Both male and female, at the same time.  This also means that not only am I more qualified than most nonbinary people to use the singular plural 'they,' I'm more qualified to use the Royal We than the Queen....but I'd probably sound more like Venom if I did, so I'll stick to first person singular."
"I'm proud of ContraPoints. He did a great job with this video and I'm proud of her."
"The stereotype you break best of all is that of the perpetually offended snowflake. Good video, I've never seen one on this topic that is as, for want of a better term which I've spent some time thinking about as I type,... 'aware'."
"What do you think about not identifying as anything and sitting under a tree for 49 days?"
"I don't understand what genderqueer/nonbinary means. I don't mean 'I think you're describing an impossible mental state' but rather 'I can't even parse which mental state you're describing'. Perhaps that means I don't understand gender at all. From what I can tell none of the traits generally associated with this or that gender are essential. Everything seems to be able to be divorced from gender identity (sexual attraction, what clothes you wear, biological sex etc. etc. etc.) but in that case isn't the concept just empty and meaningless?  To be sure, I don't have to understand to respect. If you want me to alternate between he and she I don't mind except insofar as it hinders communication. I don't care what clothes you wear, what plumbing you have, what bathroom you use, who you're attracted to or really about anything of that. If you feel strongly about it and I don't care then we'll go with your preference. But it bothers me to no end not understanding and when people talk about some non-standard gender identities it's like they've started spouting word salad to me and no amount of trying to read, watch and listen to your and others experiences have helped. Neither did the linked videos.  I realize this might sounds slightly like I'm one of those 'freethinking rationals' you were talking about, here to argue hotdogs and apache helicopters with the implication that you're wrong because feminists are icky. But I'm genuinely not, I agree with most of your videos, from what I can tell we have similar political views as well. I just don't understand. :("
"I keep getting distracted imagining what you'd look like with bangs."
"god i hate hunter so much"
"At what point does gender expression become gender identity? At what point can gender expression act in opposition to gender identity?  If I identify as a man, but like to play with dolls, like to talk about feelings, and like to wear dresses and makeup, I still identify as a man. My gender expressions, in those specific instances, are opposite the gender expressions accepted and promoted of the gender I identify as (i.e man), yet my gender identity still remains the same.  If I have more and more gender expressions that are opposite my gender identity, does it mean that at some point I identify as the opposite gender? Or does it only mean that my gender identity is still constant (i.e man), but only the gender expression changes, and both are independent? Can anybody recognize these two scenarios on themselves? I.e can a person definitely state they are cisgendered with trans-gender expressions, or definitely say they are transgender?  The subject is confusing, because even when finding out about the experiences of non-binary people, transgenders, etc, it seems that they are confused about their identity and gender expressions too, and thus when they communicate with others it adds to said confusion. Are they really what they say they are? If they say they identify as non-binary, is it really that way, or do they just have different gender expressions but still have a core cisgendered identity, which confuses them making them believe their identity is not binary?  I completely understand the feelings and experiences of such people are legitimate, but I am not comfortable with the concepts and theory of gender being developed. I don't see much scientific and philosophical validity to them. Their experiences prove the current mainstream theory of gender (and gender expression, etc) is wrong, but it does not mean the proposed theory of gender is right either. I guess it's the best thing we can come up with so far, and a 'necessary evil' to make transgenders not feel discriminated/left out and not force them into categories they are uncomfortable in."

"I empathize with this a lot I feel like my indifference to a lot of my body is why I still identify as cis. I have also, like you, occasionally had feelings that I might call dysphoria (thou I'm never really sure) but they're not strong enough or consistent enough for me to feel like identifying as anything else than what I was assigned at birth is worth the effort. I am very aware that my feelings about this could change at any time tho and I am young so I think I'll wait and see."

"Oh yes and good video. I've had semi-similar thoughts in various moments of my life. Hell, I dress in dude's clothing and always wanted to play the dude roles when there was a play happening. Me and Basti should make a video about this one day as both of have masculine or feminine aspects of ourselves that are opposite of what is expected of our gender. Also, we share the same clothes because we are similar in size, but it goes deeper than just clothing I suppose. Anyway, good topic. ALSO, FUCK YOUR MAKE UP ABILITIES and perfect cheekbones.

"You say you're genderqueer because you don't want surgery but you don't identify as a man. Why don't you identity as a man? Because you don't match male stereotypes? Because you wear dresses? The clothes you wear are not women's clothes. Therefore they really shouldn't be preventing you from being a man. If you remove all stereotypical reasons for not identifying as a man, what's left?  I have no problem with people identifying as intersex. My problem is with social gender because it doesn't seem to be based on anything. The words 'man,' 'woman' and 'agender' are being used to describe personality and I don't think they should be.  Side note: I hate bearing and blaire white with a burning passion and I dislike the approach most mras are taking towards the topic especially in terms of 'You're not a real woman if you don't get expensive cosmetic surgery.' Unlike the others, I'm not a hypocrite that accepts transgender identity while rejecting non binary identity. I reject both.  (bracing for being ignored and labeled a TERF)"
"Freaks rock! \m/ <3"
"This was great, one of your best. I've really enjoyed what seems to be watching your views develop alongside your content style as your channel grows.   I think it's reasonable to assume that there are many, myself included, who can relate to a lot of what you're saying but, for whatever reasons, have felt alienated by our experience of gender, whether from grappling with self-expression and self-identity, or how various socially constructed descriptors of gender influence the ways we view ourselves and interact with others.   Gender alienation doesn't necessarily arise because of faults with given terms or the inclusive communities and academic disciplines that champion them, let alone our personal struggles with identity, but because of broader dynamics, like the systems of domination that have sculpted the sociocultural landscape we're immersed in by fomenting identitarian antagonism (not to be confused with identity politics, fundamentally speaking, which is a critical, if often exploited, part of how social groups interact) in order to mask class oppression. Alienation from ourselves and others is just as much a byproduct of power politics as it is one of existential distress.   Not long ago I read the late Mark fisher's take on how large-scale social and political forces contribute to depression and help us to understand its causes, and ever since the theme has popped up and appeared to be relevant again and again.    This gave me a lot to think about. Thanks, Contra!"
"It is a truth well acknowledged, that a YouTuber, approaching their second decade, will want to finally fricken express themselves and who they are.

"Once I learned about the mosaic brain the spectrum of gender identities made much more sense. & in many cases I see self loathing as a self defense mechanism  to compensate for social threat evulation and going against whatever stupid arbitrary social norms the lemmings  blindly follow. Personally I just prefer the Fuck you you lemmings response rather hating myself."
"Keep being awesome, ContraPoints"
"Damn your ability to be prettier than me! This makes me loath you and your beautiful face!"
"Should have checked out Tumblr."
"Awesome video, but you have me wondering: is part of what makes you genderqueer the strictness of male gender roles?   I'm not trying to pull some queer-erasure bullshit, but honestly, I've experienced a lot of what you have from the opposite side: I've hated the color pink for as long as I can remember, and I have for a long time and still do wear both womens' and mens' clothing. A few times when I was in college I wore a several-sizes-too-small sports bra, shoulder pads and 'men's' clothing and just wandered around in public, looking as male as I could. In many ways, you're probably more feminine than I am. I paint my nails a few times a year and never really learned how to properly apply makeup. I shave because hair is scratchy and uncomfortable, but pretty much only ever wear pants. I enjoy math and science and video games and anime and correcting assumptions people make about me based on my gender.   Now I know this video is a super-condensed summary of your experience, but I feel like it's fairly similar to mine. But I always have and still do feel quite comfortable calling myself a cis woman. Idk if that's just because feminism's made it easier for women to defy our roles and hasn't done as much good for men (or at least, people socially categorized as men).   I'm not trying to say you're not really genderqueer, but I guess I'm happier broadening the category so that my weirdness can fit rather than leaving the category narrow and finding a less-common more-narrow category to belong to, and I wonder if making these less-common categories more common removes some of the impetus to say 'no, you can wear whatever clothing and take care of your body however you like and still call yourself a man (or a MAYN!) if you want to.'  Also because it's awesome and relevant, you might like Vi Hart's video On Gender, idk if you've heard of her but she's a mathematician who occasionally discusses social things and it's great: watch?v=hmKix-75dsg"
"i think labels like genderqueer/bigender/agender/nonbinary are pretty good ways to describe how someone feels about their gender identity, but it's still always going to be combination of male and female or defined solely by not being either of those, which is what i think some people mean when they say there are only two genders. where nonbinary identities cross the line into being silly are the tumblr identities that are just emotions, personality traits, or random shit that means nothing like abimegender (a gender that is profound, deep, and infinite; meant to resemble when one mirror is reflecting into another mirror creating an infinite paradox), amicagender (a gender that changes depending on which friend you're with), or astralgender (a gender that feels connected to space). i'll always try to use whatever pronoun someone wants me to because it's the nice thing to do, but i also think that if you present yourself in an androgynous way or insist on a pronoun other than he or she that you shouldn't lash out at people who accidentally use the wrong pronoun or are still getting used to using pronouns like singular they or ze. overall, another really good video."

"From someone who is politically left, but also a bit tired of the extreme left, I feel you are a good example of a 'SJW' that actually makes sense. You aren't preachy, you aren't pandering and you are actually funny while being calm. Good job being a representative for an important cause that needs people like you."
"When I tell people I don't really identify with either male or female they look at me funny or say that I'm just a tomboy. See, I don't feel like the label of tomboy describes me well. I've also had a history of not really accepting with what's happening between my legs. I also fall under the asexual spectrum and when I tell people that they ask if I have some sort of disorder. I say to them 'Would you call a gay person mentally ill?' Granted, I'm in a fairly liberal bubble and if I attempted to say this to a religious conservative I'm sure they'll try to convince me to pray to god to make me straight. I really don't get why these reactionaries get all pissy and insist that there are only 2 genders. How about intersex people? Whatever. Glad you made this video. üëçüèº"
"Thank you so SO much for this video.   Not only is it going to help other people coming to terms with their identities, but it just makes me happy to see someone making progress in understanding and accepting who they are. Especially someone whose channel I love and whose personality I find pretty awesome.  I don't want to write something that comes off as patronising, but I also never know when someone might need a nice comment. So just in case I'm gonna re-assert that your identity is valid, your personal experiences aren't up for debate, and you are not a snowflake for feeling that way.  A lot of randos are going to attack those ideas so y'know always remind yourself that they're wrong.  Thank you for continuing to make awesome videos!"

Don't let concepts of what may or may not work or think transition is impossible if you get to that point. I know too many girls who killed themselves thinking it was impossible to transition.   Good luck finding what works for you and I hope you don't catch any shit for your embracing GQ identity."

"While I completely agree with you, that there's no reason you shouldn't self-categorize this way, I take slight issue with the apparent biological antagonism. At the prospect of being ridiculed for being overtly teleological, I find it peculiar that nature would sex us as humans if this doesn't correlate at all with behavior or temperament. While I agree with Simone de Beauvoir's argument that there is no biological argument that can be made for the restriction of women's rights for example, which was the prevailing argument of the day, I still think there is a qualitative difference between both sexes and genders that isn't simply reducible to a power relationship.  If you are a woman, your life is actually quite different from a man's, because you have to resolve the antagonism between wanting a career and wanting children. If you're a man this antagonism doesn't exist, so you can do as your humble servant and drink quite often.  My point being that while you are free, in my opinion, to characterize yourself this way, does this change the essential character of your life as being sexed as a male? Abstracted from my standpoint it doesn't, because you're not a woman in the biological sense. So whether or not you identify as male or whatever else, is presumably your business and not mine, in the grand scheme of things.  And yes, I am drunk, so bear with me if you will."
"you're amazing"
"I won't stop being inspired by you, that's for sure. No matter what you say!   Glad to hear that you're starting to edge away from the self-depreciating humour a bit. I think it's best to find a balance of being humble/self-aware and also confident. It also makes the self-depreciating jokes more funny when they're less often.   I think this subject confuses so many people because they make the conclusion; isn't everyone Genderqueer to some extent then? But like you say, all these terms are about understanding each other and how we feel. It's not for the sake of a label, it's a means to greater understanding. Hopefully we reach a point where we just accept each other as human beings."
"eeeeeeeey! Thank you so much for doing this video! I really am glad, this is a great beginners guide approach on the topic of gender queer and non-binary, definitely gonna bookmark this to share with friends and family!"
"This was so great. Thank you!"
"About the pronouns. A girl in German is neutral, basically an it. I'm surprised more people in Germany aren't miffed by this, especially girls."
"Genderqueer is a fine term, but what if we need more granular identities like a genderqueer who is born female who dresses male and vice versa.  Its still kind of broad.  Honestly, coming up with non-standard gender terms makes it easier for everybody, since its a hassle to have to specifically explain someone else's gender identity, I don't see why people are against it.  As long as you don't FORCE people to use these ad-hoc gender terms then who cares what gender you identify as.      Oh and FWIW, Contrapoints is much prettier than the two tatted up bitches, and the Sarah Silverman wanna-be at the beginning of the video."

"You should really keep the pearls.  Joking aside, I really don't see the issue some people have with non-binary, genderqueer or generally people who don't go strictly male or female. My main concern would be that you find some degree of happiness in this life, no matter what label fits you.  Personally, I am a demisexual male with a preference for female partners. And for my entire puberty, I thought that I was just weird for never fawning over film or popstars like my fellow guys did. It wasn't until recently that I discovered the grey spectrum and just knowing that I'm not damaged or just alone in the world really gave me a confidence boost.  And don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you rock those clothes!"
"i know you feel like you have to defend your identity to the people who watch your channel but keep in mind that its your identity and you dont HAVE to argue for the validity of your existence. u still u fuk da h8rz"
"Hiya, really do love this video. My experience with gender has.. well.. lets say been up and down. I grew up as cis as two functional groups on same side of the carbon chain. Only when I got to my latter teen years did my gender journey start and quickly escalate into a cold lonely confusion of continuous self doubt and dread; fear that the ever crippling pain that having the body, expression and perception of the gender I felt inside would never be realised.   After around two and a half years of this retched confusion (and really I don't think this comment conveys how difficult the whole ordeal was) did I luck out, spectacularly in fact. All the confusion, self evaluation of what my gender was and what it meant, all within a matter of months, seemed to for no clear reason why... disappear.. no more dysphoria.. no more confusion. Just a cis life with cis ease.. and all of the benefits and comforts of cis standards that come with it.  I'm not genderqueer but I absolutely felt like I was, and before that I felt like I wasn't so what am I all in all? I'm the seemingly non-existent counter example.. I actually am the kid who went through a phase (and absolutely don't get me wrong, just because my gender-qeerness was temporary for me doesn't mean it is for all or even most gender-queer people).   What's interesting is my rediscovery of a cis identity has given me the privilege of largely being able to ignore all these issues. I can go about my day without thinking about my gender even once, that's actual impossible madness for my 18 year old self, and wow is it easy.. like drastically unfairly easy.  Anyways the point of this comment more than anything was just to thankyou for reminding me to be thankful because the struggle of gender identity is really one that simply can't be appreciated unless its tapping away from inside your own body and head.   Contra-points, I know you said you don't feel inspiring or really of that much self worth either, but suffice to say for what it means (and at the risk of sounding mushy) you certainly do inspire me. Goodluck out there, as long as you keep making awesome stuff I'll be at the front of the line to watch with glea <3 (also you're hot and I'd definitely kiss you xxx)"

"gonna be inspired by you regardless! found you via Lindsay Ellis's stream, watched all your videos at least twice, and I went and did the patreon thing. also if hormones aren't your thing, spearmint tea/capsules have mild anti-androgen effects! but if hormones do end up being your thing, the assessment process is a lot less painful than it was, even for genderqueer/nonbinary people, it's usually a few appointments where you claim to be a Stable, Coping Transgender Person and they refer you to an endocrinologist. edit: oh and hormones won't affect your voice!"

"I'm nearly thirty and agender. I know how you feel about feeling weird about how it seems like mostly younger people who are non binary."
"So I'm curious about one thing. You say that when you wear makeup or femme clothing you 'feel like I'm expressing my own gender'. I'm curious as to how cultural gender roles can affect your fundamental identity. Clothing and makeup are neither masculine nor feminine beyond the value as such that society gives them. If makeup were as universal as, say, jeans, I presume you would not feel they expressed something fundamental about your identity. So are elements of your identity simply determined by cultural gender roles, or is it just that pursuing both, instead of just one, of those roles is an outlet for expressing feelings that would be there regardless? Just to be clear, I don't think there's a wrong answer here, I've just never known someone genderqueer who I could feel comfortable asking :)"
"Glad you made this video, congrats on your official coming out <3 wish you the bestest"

Congrats and good job on daring to take this leap :> I'm a trans woman myself, but I'm always happy to see more AMAB non-binary folk. Thanks to you doing this, maybe other non-binary people will discover that being non-binary isn't just for people who're AFAB! Wrt facial hair dyphoria, have you considered getting laser hair removal? It's done wonders for me in the past."
"From reading the comments I'm starting to feel like we are all using the same word to describe different things. If we can agree that words like 'boy', 'girl', 'man', and 'woman' are 'genders', than the way that I, and most people, utilize these words is to differentiate between adult and youth males or females.  It seems that many people in these comments are using the word gender to describe expressions of personality. Which in this case would COMPLETELY change the meaning of boy or girl or man or woman. I understand that many people in the gender studies community like to lump gender expressions and roles into one all encompassing word 'GENDER' but the reality of it is that very few people speak like this. And in order to make any sort of progress on this topic we can't all be speaking different languages.  tl:dr If you use 'gender' synonymously with 'sex' : There are 2 genders. (+ anomalies) If you use 'gender' as a form of expression : There are an infinite number of genders.  Please correct me if there's something I'm not getting here. Honestly trying my best to understand this topic."

Glad you are coming closer to your identity. <3  Cis-scum is pretty fun to throw around."

"Why are all the anti feminists and feminists who scream into cameras online always fucking genderqueer? Congratulations on coming out, Contra! You have gotten so much better at styling your wigs since you came out!"
"Which is true 'We make choices' or 'Our choices make us'? Because that ultimately is what this is really about. Further, people making jokes about identifying as an attack helicopter pretty clearly miss the point. In fact, that same joke can be made about almost any complex identity, not just gender.  I'm a Market Socialist for instance. As much as I like to say I'm open minded about economics, at this point its basically my economic identity. Its a specific economic stance that is distinct from, say, a Marxist Leninist, or even a Mutualist (Which is basically an Anarcho-Market-Socialist).  People who identify as 'Hardcore Gamers' identify as a specific hobbyist who typically like playing a specific subset of games, and/or to a intensity that differentiates them from the norm.  People who identify as American are technically identifying with a nationality, and that's 100% all in their heads, but is totally legitimate in contemporary culture.  So yeah. I feel like this whole conversation is exhausting and possibly even sort of distracting from more important topics. I feel like we should be over this shit by now. Its all in our heads, sure. Our actions and choices however stem from what is in our heads.   If people saying they identify as attack helicopters are making the point that identifying as anything other than man or woman is absurd, guess what: existence is absurd, to borrow from Albert Camus. All their hang ups about what's 'normal' are just spooks, to borrow from Max Stirner."
"I am so glad you did this video. I'm from a small southern town and just came out. I can't agree more with like, all of this"

"Happy Transgender Day of Visibility!"
"You win at gender ^_^"
"Just when I thought I couldn't love this channel more than I did when I first started. Congrats on your coming out and I just want to let you know that you look great( as a Woman, Man, or any other gender you might be feeling.)    P.S. Spread the positivity my kindred!!!"
"Gender really isn't that hard to understand tbh. Using sex as a comparison you have XX and XY, but there are other sex's that exist outside of it. Like XXY. So if you as a cis-person are with an intersex (XXY) friend who presents as a female (and prefers to be presented as a female) you call them a female regardless of their genitalia, not my 'Intersex' friend.¬†(and asking to see your intersex friends genitles would be kind of invading)"
"While I agree that gender is not sex, you seem to be the one confusing the two. You claim 'male' yo he a gender, when its a biological sex. You might not ve 'binary' but that doesnt mean you arent a man. that constant agresion hoy feel towards yourself, doesnt make you 'more honest'. On the contrary,   I think it is a unapriciation of what males can be; including yourself."
"'It's just a facile simpletific scent that there are only two genders!'  (seriously though, well done on a beautiful and incisive piece of videography. Taxes and all.)"
"Crazy respect for you Contra. I'm ostensibly a cis man but I could honestly care less about my gender. I just haven't put that much bank into the performance of gender to honestly give a dam if someone calls me he/she/it. The only thing motivating me to continue the charade as a 'man' is the political significance of identifying as a 'gay black man'."
"No, you're a dude. A faggy looking dude, but still just a dude."
"Question for any genderqueer people: I know ContraPoints touched slightly on it in this video, but could you maybe try to explain to me why it is so important to you to find a box to be in? The thing is, as I see it we should treat each other as individuals, which is why I refer to people however they want to be refered to without raising a fuss, but why does it matter to you? Take Contrapoints for example - I would always refer to him ('unmisgenderable', I'm allowed to call xhi him :)), because that is the physical impression they give me.* Knowing this, why would you ever take it as an insult or anything like that or even take it as me trying to erase the existence of people - I feel like a lot is being read into simple going-with-the-instinct.   Note that I a compeltely fine with using whatever pronoun or talking to you in any way you want me to, and will apoloize in advance for messing anything up - I understand that this is important to you, and realize that this question is pretty difficult to phrase in a way that does not make me sound condemning or dismissive of you - it is entirely unintended, and I apologize.  *Grammatical note - cleared up by Santarii"
"I freaking love you. You make me laugh, make me feel better about myself and I relate to a LOT of what you say"
"Had to turn it down at the hot dog part, not that it helped, I was laughing pretty hard."
"Even if Contra and everyone else talking about non-binary genders and the like were 100% wrong...  Why does it matter? Who cares if people want to explore their sexuality and gender more than others do? Who does it hurt? I will never understand the mindset you have to be in to be so mortally wounded by another human telling you they see their gender - something non-affecting and exclusive to them - is one that is not what you usually encounter.  That so many people have made half a career over 'debunking' them - or rather, legitimising transphobic nonsense - is saddening of the pathetic state of many members of the human race.  Frankly, we should have the mental fibre to be above petulant stress over gender theory.  As for me, while I am male... gender, sex are both spectrums, with more than 2, and there's no science that *proves* there are only two. You're on the wrong side of history bigots - just like with gay legitimacy, just like with 'scientific' racism, just like with 'gender differences' that 'proved' women are intellectually stunted and whatever other claims you've tried to legitimise discrimination with through 'science'. Concede now, to avoid any further embarrassment.  Nice video as always Contra. :)"
"another great video!"
"I feel like the gender spectrum is the same as the political one, there is a wide range of variety between both ends but you're expected to identify as either leftist, centrist or rightwing. These labels don't mean much but give a feel on who you are and people who want to know more about your ideas can just ask but the general crowd can just paint your label onto you and that's okay because they don't really matter."
"Congrats on coming out and great video too ^_^"
"I really respect you for doing this, contra. I know personally that it takes alot to be genuine AND come out to people who might not accept you or even try to hurt you, internet or not. I'm nonbinary as well and its always a struggle especially when people are unfamiliar with the concept or just think its ridiculous. I've identified as agender for a couple years now, tho i typically go by the broader label of gender non-conforming, and i think im ready to publically transition and/or be out but im currently a student and know ill be forced to be around people who arent accepting. Im still super on the fence about doing it, but one things shit sure, nothings gonna get better unless i go the hell and do it."
"I'm a guy who dresses like a woman from time to time, and I just don't care that much if the clothes I buy are from the women's section or the men's. I often ponder whether I feel more... included(?) with women or men, and whether I'm more man or woman in my head. Everything seems kind of 50/50 with me. I have exactly as many male friends as female, I look 50/50 male and female, I'm bisexual, the list goes on. If there is a real category like the ones you mentioned maybe I would fall into it. However I don't feel ready to accept the social meaning behind it all, and prefer to keep being just a strange, freaky man. In that way I'm even more of a snowflake, aren't I?"
"First of all, thank you for making this video. I'm a very shy, not very self-confident person and I never could have even edited this sort of video, let alone posted it online for everyone to see and comment on so thank you for all the effort you put into this video.  I myself am still working through my gender identity, I tend to swing back and forth between a couple frequently and will honestly probably be happy if I never settle on a single label simply because I don't feel like I have to. I identify primarily as male, simply biologically male, sort of as a baseline and so I use 'he/him' as pronouns and feel very little diaspora (except for my own hatred of my body hair so I feel for you there!), but, sort of above that, I find I move between demigendered (demiboy= male, but not as strongly male as the 'normal' male, basically I don't think of myself as a 'man' because I find that too masculine a word to describe myself) and a little androgynous because, though I identify as male, I enjoy the fact that I'm not very masculine and very skinny with wide, feminine hips and I enjoy the contrast that brings.  I think this video really does a fantastic job at giving an overview of genderqueerness and the arguments that surround it and I have nothing I would change about this, though I would add that those who say that there are only two genders are really being very exclusionary in their thinking and rationale considering that there are many cultures all around the world which completely believe that there are more than two genders. Cultures like Thai and Indigenous Hawaiian have a third gender as well as the 'Two Spirit' term used by some modern Native American and First Nations groups to represent numerous different, ancient beliefs around gender which were often stamped out by European colonialism. So, I would ask to anyone who says 'There are only two genders' what they would have to say about the hundreds of different, ancient cultures all around the world who have more than two and have for thousands of years? Have all of these cultures been wrong for thousands of years or is your Western view of gender and sex a little limited? And, if you think that they are wrong and you're right, then why do you see it that way.  A good, but limited resource about cultures with third genders or two-spirit beliefs can be found here: http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/"
"What is the red dot?"
"Yay! Pumped to find this after work. Thanks Contra, you do you. I'm sick of people that don't know what they're talking about just ranting about things that are unfamiliar and shutting down things they don't understand. You're a breath of fresh air"
"You're getting better and better at make-up. What do kids say these days? Ehm, you SLAY me contrapoints üò©üò§üí¶üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà.  Jokes aside, great video as always! Lots of love from The Netherlands."
"Me encanta que seas travesti"
"From finding your channel 2 days ago, to watching almost all of your videos, including the skype chat with lyndsay ellis where you talk a bit about this... I feel like I've come full circle on a character arc of yours by coincidence. And it was amazing. Positive, funny, entertaining, relatable and humbling. Being a white cis straight male it's too easy to fail on the empathy and detach yourself from all these topics, I can't wait to see what you tackle next now that I'm on the subscriber train (wish I had enough money for the Patreon train, which has better seats and food)  I'm glad I found Dan Olson, which led me to shaun and jen, which led me to Hbomberguy and yourself. Before, all the internet seemed like a bunch of misogynistic children that didn't think it was enough to be bullied, they had to become bullies themselves... Now it's still that but at least I'm laughing more. I admire how you walk the line between the language, humor and offending people, with an open mind to listen to criticism and consider you might not be perfect and commit mistakes, instead of writing a comment or a new video saying that everyone else is wrong. And now I'll stop, that's long enough to scare you or anyone away from reading this. Greetings from Spain and good luck on your new life as a minority, because you didn't get enough hate before!  ... wait you wouldn't PUNCH A NATSI? YOU HUCKING GAY!!!"
"me: 'i prefer they/th-' fuckwads: 'ATTACK HELICPOTER HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEH'"
"why is that doll in the back of your video pls do not sir"
"Try to answer this honestly, to yourself.  Why are you genderqueer?"
"For what it's worth, you may be able to get access to hormones without needing to involve therapists ‚Äì you may know about this already, but if you search 'informed consent HRT clinic' you might find a place within your reach?  Also: you can take estrogen and not change your voice! I changed my voice once but slipped it back most of the way later. That's totally a thing!"
"i love you!"
"contrapoint is a cool person. she has all the vindication of a great preacher. he's also very self-aware and perfectly willing to engage in verbal dispute with people, which is admirable and laudable.  anyone that disagrees can go get a therapist to deal with the rage they feel inside and need to project on others :)"
"Subscribed to you since they beginning, Nykyteen2.   If gender is just a social construct, then why do most sexually dimorphic species behave differently depending on their sex?  Their behavior is even predictable.  Is that just a social construct they came up with?  I mean...do what you like.  I don't care.  However, I have to disagree that it's *just* a social construct.  Men an women have different reproductive prerogatives, which shapes their behavior just as much as it shapes their bodies.  The hormones alone can greatly shape behavior."
"I would be genderqueer if I thought gender was a valid way of categorizing anything. I don't have a gender, I have a personality which I express as I please, and I don't see why that has to be arbitrarily categorized. Gender has always seemed like nonsense since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. I like wearing purple so that make me a splflarg. But I also hate Brussels sprouts and that's clearly a g'grundus trait. Which am I? How perverse! How confusing!"
"This was a really good video. Thanks for exploring this topic and telling us about your disgusting feelings.  Also, I think your camera has a dead sensor because there was a little orange dot in the upper right corner that was driving me nuts! Also, also, your hair looks really cute when it's curly."
"great to hear as a cis hetero male i like to hear an understand"
"you are inspirational <3"
"I watched.   And hey, this has been very informative. Excellent video.   ...there's a thing my grandfather used to say. 'If there is any good in this world, it is only because good people made it so.'  Explaining things to people in a way that is accessible to them is doing good work. You're doing good work. Even if it's just a little bit, you're making the world a better place. Considering the amount of misinformation and outright contempt for non-binary people there is, that couldn't be more necessary.   Excellent video, by the way."
"Well, however you choose to identify, i like you :)"
"If I'm real for a second...transsexuals disgust and horrify me. Gay dudes are only mildly agitating.  If I had to compare it to something, my reaction is somewhere between seeing a horrifically mutilated person and a morbidly obese scooter person eating a bucket of ice cream in walmart. This is a reaction I cannot help, and do my best not to react in any way, including facial expressions, speech, staring, or oppressive legislation."
"Also, on a serious note, is transitioning really *completely* about passing? As an outsider looking in, it seems like a lot of it has to do with trying to find a happy medium where you're comfortable in your own body. I guess for a lot of people, that makes passing important, but I dunno."
"So my real question at the end of this is:  'Genderqueer' people usually object to the labels of Man and Woman, or more accurately the pronouns he/she. Since your identity is a social negotiation, and a major part of the way we assign pronouns to someone is based on superficial physical characteristics based off of social queues, are people who feel they've been 'misgendered' really allowed to make that decision for the person they are speaking to?.   If you are biologically male, and dressed feminine, but you have overtly male features.  Is the other person really wrong to call you a he? (Either Technically or Morally? I'd wager no they are not on both counts)  Obviously I don't mean for you personally since you don't care what people call you but I find most of the discussion about this topic comes down to 'genderqueer' people wanting to dictate how pronouns are assigned and I just don't really think they have that kind of authority over the people they are speaking to. It's a social game, with moving parts both conscious and unconscious that lead us to determining what someones gender/most appropriate pronoun is and a MAJOR portion of it is biological. So if someone doesn't feel male or female but is biologically male and presents as biologically male since they don't feel 'female' and therefore take no special steps to look like anything besides a person, are they really a 'they' or just a 'he' who doesn't feel traditionally masculine?"
"If identifying as non-binary means we're gonna get to see you put more effort into your hair then I'm all for it. Those curls are qt af."
"Congrats on coming out. I'm 29 and I've only been out as genderfluid for a few months. I've networked with a lot of nonbinary people online though, and although the younger ones definitely seem to catch on sooner (they have the internets these days you know), there are definitely a lot of us in all age groups. Once again you've created a great video."
"Bruh that fucking doll"
"I still think it's about personality types, not gender."
"You're six foot two?????  Holy shit the camera makes you look super short.  I'm 5'11' and I've always visualized you shorter than me."
"That doll ... Nope ..."
"You drink Texas ? What is wrong with you ?  Unsubscribed.  j/k"
"Happy Trans Day of Visibility, you wonderful little snowflake!"
"I think your use of the word 'freakish' makes sense with your self-depricating sense of humor, but it doesn't make a ton of sense to use it specifically in relation to one of the most-marginalized identities on the planet, which many other people share and could be harmed by your description of. Society should accept the 'freaks', but for now, it doesn't, and so calling enbies freaks isn't going to help anyone."
"Very proud of you! I'm glad you're able to come out and make a great example for other people who struggle with non binary feelings! Also, great video as always but FUCK YOU FOR PUTTING THE DOLL IN THERE DAMN IT"
"Still the best channel on YouTube."
"That doll... it stares into my soul.... But aside from that, I'm happy for you!"
"The hot dogs though I just died laughing."
"Haven't mentioned it yet, but I like all your videos. Thanks for making them!"
"I feel like the impasse in the discourse is mostly caused by people equivocating on the difference between gender and biological sex. I think that sex is a scientifically useful concept for explaining a reproduction strategy that lots of species use--sure, the concept blurs at the edges, but so do lots scientific concepts. But they still have some explanatory power so they're useful.   And then you have gender, which is more of a social concept that we use to describe all sorts of things that have absolutely nothing to do with biological sex--like what shapes of pants people wear, how they interact with other people, what they do with their hairs. These things are interesting and important to people but again, they have nothing to do with whether or a person was born with a dick or some other thing. Why should the relatively hard science fact of being born with a penis have any relevance for the amorphous social world of pants shapes?  So, I think we should just divorce these concepts, and stop being mean about people's pants shapes based on whether they are dickborn or not. Can we do that? No.... no we can't."
"Congratulations on finally noticing!  No, but seriously, congrats. As badass as you are, coming out in this current climate can't have been easy or perfectly safe. Basically, you're cool and amazing and this just makes you even cooler."
"STOP    MAKING ME   FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU"
"Thank you for this amazing video! I love you, bro-sis."
"2:23 I knew I wasn't doin' the sex wrong all these years.  People lyin' to me.     Also good video"
"I hate patreon but I want to give you money. ideas?"
"Please kill me."
"Love me some Schubert :3"
"Congratulations on coming out, as it were."
"This is why I love you."
"I WANNA MARCH IN THE STREETS ABOUT HOW HAPPY I AM RIGHT NOW!  A lot of what you said in this video resonates so hard with me and even if you didn't think it was uplifting and reaffirming it goddamn was for me and a lot of my own internal questions and self-loathing.   A million thank yous for this video. <3"
"Welcome to the club :D"
"quite a different turn for your video. congrats on being genderqueer and very good facts on your video  about gender identity and expression."
"Hair looks fantastic in this video."
"I don't understand why people are so sensitive over the idea that humans have a complicated relationship with their biological sex and the cultural and social ramifications of it all. So much of all this feels like some sort of weird politically motivated lack of curiosity. Like some sort of social anti-intellectualism? If that makes sense? It goes hand in hand with the idea that 'social sciences arnt real science', etc. I mean, obviously, most of the time when people say 'there are only men and women' they don't really *care* about that question, its more like a statement meant to signal themselves as being assertive and non-PC, its not an actual subject matter they put any thought into. These opinions are mutually exclusive with having genuine curiosity or interest in the relevant subject matter."
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawt"
"keep up the good work! your a breath of fresh ass :D"
"I only realised I was agender because the library where I worked happened to have lots of academic books on gender I could read while pretending to work."
"People tend to think that Trans and Non-Binary identities are a tumblr 'invention', when in fact they are older than we think; from Native American Two-Spirits, to the Ancient Greek Galli Priests of a Cybele (they were crossdressing, feminine eunuchs who served as priestesses to the harvest goddess Cybele, or Demeter)."
"Quick question: are you okay with being referred to as 'they'? In your video you don't seem to outright dismiss it as an option, but since it's a bit vague I'd prefer to double-check.   Also, high five from a fellow genderqueer person."
"hey. really like your videos but in written chinese there are 3 pronouns ‰ªñ(m)Â•π(f)andÂÆÉ(n). though the last one is typically used for objects. they all sound the same though so i see your point in regards to spoken conversation"
"They/Them as a singular pronoun is correct English, with roots in Middle English usage. It is also very polite and proper."
"Once again, an excellent and patient explanation. I love what you're doing so much."
"A new ContraPoints video? Hold the fucking phone, I'm all in!"
"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings on this issue. I'm a great fan of your videos. No need for self-depreciation, though (unless it's used as a comedic device ;) )."
"This isn't exactly related to the topic at hand, but you are SO pretty!"
"I've never really understood the difference between 'personality/preference' and 'gender' in this sort of context. Why does a preference for traditionally 'feminine' things make one not a man? I've always thought a large part of feminism is the idea that people's personalities, hobbies and preferences should have nothing to with their sex. Therefore it doesnt make sense to me that people are opting out of calling themselves a man or a woman because they enjoy activities society does not associate with their sex. I feel like I'm missing something vital or obvious here, please could someone help me ahaha"
"Nice lips, I mean Schubert trio piece."
"Biological sex you say? NOW YOUR SPEAKING MY LANGUAGE. While I don't want to pile onto the whole 'there are only two genders derp' cluster fuck but I do have a slight contention with the statement that biological sex is 'nebulous' at least when we're talking about humans (the only animals that matter amiright).   While hormones are on a sliding scale somewhat, all the hawt dawg biology inevitability boils to chromosomes. There are two chromosomes that define sexual characteristics; X & Y and the two sexes are from the combinations of XX or XY. Now there are some interesting clinical deviations with this; trisomy X, monosomy X, XXY, XYY and some I've probably missed but the point is for most cases biological sex is a pretty open-shut you aren't or you aren't sort of thing. This is obviously not the same as gender which is simply informed by biological sex, as well as societal expectations and how the individual sees oneself in relation to the two other things.  There, now no-one is allowed to say that there are only two genders (everyone probably will). In summary; Good video, biological sex is chromosomes and any chance of make up tips for men because DAMN Contra, you look FIIIIIIIIIINE."
"Thank you ContraPoints for the things you do. I'm afraid I don't have anything particularly insightful to say about the topic of the video, but I'd still like to (for what it's worth) offer some words of encouragement. While I don't share your experience concerning gender, your work has helped to alleviate some of my own sense of loneliness in the world. I'm glad to hear that you are coming to terms with these things and I do hope the mean-spirited people in the comments don't get to you."
"Good video. Why can't we as a society just get rid of gender altogether (including male/female) and let people act and dress how they want? That would be so much simpler.  And the curly hair looks nice :P"
"cool. i too consider myself genderqueer. also you are refreshingly less ignorant about these issued and that is cool."
"Watch out, Golden One might project onto you if he sees this video."
"I still think it would be more productive to dismantle gender rather than play along with it and say you're changing sides. You're yourself at the root of it all why play with restrictive definitions? The result of playing along is a lot of misunderstandings because definitions are so close together they're essentially overlapping with the 'no it's different, here's a paragraph explaining the minor difference' defense.   We're making a small issue of not fitting into definitions into a huge societal change that's rough and confusing rather than just throwing away an outdated idea that boys do this and girls do that and there's no argument otherwise!!!"
"You look absolutely beautiful in this video."
"I'm male, but I'd very much love to appear more female. Sadly genetics has not blessed me with any femininity (I'm only half an inch shorter than you, can't shave without bleeding everywhere, deep voice, stupid belly that won't go away, wide face, broad shoulders, hairy back, ...), and I'm afraid I would be rather mocked if I dressed how I'd like to look *sigh*."
"A toast to you coming out! Damn the resonance cannons, full speed ahead! Never give up, never surrender! I was going to say something like 'PREPARE FOR THE PARADE OF DOUCHE CANOES,' but to nobody's surprise, it is already well under way."
"from what you said in this video I feel like I experience my gender (or lack of?? idk) similarly to you. especially in regards to physically transitioning. although I don't identify as genderqueer, or any specific label really, this video put a lot of my feelings towards my gender into words, thank you üëå"
"Well someone's seen Sausage Party"
"I identify with the doll silently longing for the cool top youre wearing...(sarcasm). Great video."
"Congrats, I'm proud of you."
"I don't think most reasonable people give two shits what someone identifies as long as it doesn't effect them much like cool you identify as agender but don't get angry when someone ((ASSUMES )) your gender based on how you look (male or female) because that's just the norm.(not saying this to you specifically just in general) i feel like if you want to identify in the transgender spectrum you need to accept that you are a 1% minority and people arn't gonna change how they interact with the other 99% to suit you, just my opinion of course. amazing video as always trying to open my eyes to more progressive view points and your channel has def helped."
"Marry us all, Saviour. For your blessing is truly amazing.  And let your Mother and Father be forever... radiant?  *mozart resurrects to play some music*"
"Ok I'm sorry about this. You don't bang dudes? seriously?. I don't feel like it's my fault that I thought you were. For some reason I thought I remembered you mentioning that you were an aging cross dressing twink, and I construed that to mean gay with a male gender Identity? Anyway, mad respect, be clear and explicit about yourself if it feels right."
"Given this video, I'd now be very interested in a video of you on Jordan Peterson. And I imagine you're the person who'd invest some time consuming his stuff and making a more in-depth response.  Speaking of videos, I really like you're experimenting, especially with  space and colors. If you were to ask for my input, I'd say don't add so  many shortly appearing things and sounds.  Thanks for the heads up here. If you're dedicated,  do more analyses of topics form more perspectives. You do that well.  More than your own perspectives, I mean.  When I wear my t-shirt with the genderqueer flag, I feel like I'm expressing an idea of freedom of people, and I really like it. But as the topic is getting bigger, I don't like carrying around the ties. I associate the non-binary gender folks with people who either feel bad very often, or who are relatively degenerate. That's just my experience. I like the cross-dressing idea and identification, because I feel it has something bold. The people who have the whole non-identifying spiel going on come across as the opposite: You have to really watch out around them to not upset anyone. For example I have a male friend who is transitioning and I dislike how I can't relax and be careless around him. He'd be upset if I 'mindlessly' say our typical black guy's money wallets are masculine. I like being around 'freaky' (as you write) people, and I'm pretty sure they'll gain acceptance anyway - let's go to issues where we don't already know the outcome. Let's solve some actual problems. Talk more about money."
"Oh, somebody adores Barry Lyndon as much as I do. Lovely!"
"Is it weird that that being non-binary seems more mundane to me than being a dude who cross dresses?"
"can i sexualise you"
"Can we fuck i'm lonely and full of great musical taste"
"You are inspiring goddamnit and you've got one of the best channels on YT. Give yourself more credit, you deserve it."
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!  Oh wait, you're serious...   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!   Oh god, please, just keep making up these fucking dumbass genders. This just gets more and more retarded and i can't stop laughing."
"'Gender is a social and psychological concept, whereas sex is a term used by biologists to describe an organisms biological anatomy.'  But with massive overlap between the two, since behaviors common to the sexs are based on those biological characteristics. I.e. men have 1000% more testosterone than women so they behave in a more violent/aggressive/domineering manner. What those differences certainly are not based around is purely social constructional-ism.  'Biological sex itself is a pretty broad and nebulous concept.'  Not really. Outside of intersex people you can tell any child's biological  sex by looking at their genitalia. Nothing 'nebulous' about that at all.  'Don't strictly conform to conventional social roles.'  You can use your life however you wish. You can live entirely by the social norms of a women, or chart your own path between them, but defining your own gender is just narcissism. Contrapoints in a dress is still a *man* in a dress. In-fact we already had a word for that: *transvestite* a concept that has been around humanity for thousands of years (Alexander the great loved to dress up as female Goddesses for example - he wasn't 'Genderqueer' either though, he was also a man).  'Non-binary.'  Does anyone but a caricature embody every stereotype about their gender?  Being a feminine man or a masculine woman does not a new gender make. We had 'tomboys' and 'pansy' before we had Tumblr.  'Bunch of fucking made up nonsense.'  Yes, narcissism masquerading as morality. People who desperately wish higher meaning in their lives, who want to be part of some great movement to change society in an age where most of the great battle have already been fought. There is no new front in the civil rights battle here however, only white noise.  'Usually assigned female at birth.'  I imagine. Most cults and religions, including 'Progressive-ism', tend to be more popular with women than men. It's why even in oppressive Muslim countries like Saudi women tend to be more religious and socially conservative than men, supporting the very structures that treats them like property.  I stopped watching this video at the 7:11 mark. I'm sure my critiques of the first half will apply to the latter half as well.  Contra, don't feel bad about yourself. You are intelligent, attractive and (despite it's inane content) you have great skill at video creation and editing. You should feel less ashamed about your cross dressing (hardly uncommon) or possible latent homosexuality (ditto) and more than you spent so much time and energy promoting this neo-puritanical cult. Nothing you people want to achieve would actually make the world better  (quite the opposite I imagine) and if you, as a grown ass man, find yourself in agreement with the fads and obsessions of the 15 year old girls that inhabit Tumblr, it's far less likely they they have discovered some grand new insight into human nature than it is that you have just deluded yourself."
"rationals: 'your genders are useless labels to make you feel unique' also rationals: 'refer to me as EGALITARIAN MISANTHROPIC NEW-CENTER MODERATE SKEPTIC'"
"Thank you, that was just beautiful!  One thing that prevents me from identifying as genderqueer or some more specific term is the fact that it is still perceivably grounded in the gender binary system, albeit turning it into a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimentional spectrum (depending on which factors you take into account) instead of just two discrete poles. In an indirect way, these terms (being perceived by the general public as 'Well, there are males and females, and in this system I'm [the term]') legitimize the current genital-based gender system, making it harder to abolish it or change it into something independent of the culturally intuitive 'biological sex' perception, which is one of my ideological goals.  I may easily be (or even want to be) mistaken in it, since I know that I'm very biased against gender as a classifier for individuals, and some personal trees may prevent me from seeing the forest."
"'I don't bang dudes'  WHY MUST YOU HURT ME IN THIS WAY?!?!"
"I think a lot of people who get picked on, or face bullying or social exclusion tend to fall into routines of self-deprecation as a coping mechanism.  Many people feel that self-inflicted predictable pain is often better than unpredictable rejection. Especially by people we see as peers or loved ones.  I think a lot the 'angry criticism' that goes around online stems from people trying to cope with their personal demons.  I'm glad I found your channel.  Also, I love your doll.  (PS: I know that the whole creepy thing is a form of self deprecation too. I do it myself.  Creepy fist-bump.)"
":)"
"Could you please shut that door in the hallway. That doll scares me."
"Please, you are just a guy that likes to dress like women. You are not some special class of human because you do this, men have been doing this forever."
"Good for you. :)"
"Thanks for this. It's remarkable how much I relate to the way you describe yourself and your feelings about it. Perhaps the only major difference is that I do want breasts in a way and want to pursue HRT (also for said alleged emotional and skin benefits), but am also afraid of dealing with a medical community that, in some cases (I've heard) is understanding of non-binary people, but in other cases is hell bent on making you live 'as a woman' by some horrible conservative definition, and that freaks me out. Still something I want to pursue though. But on everything else, including liking my 'masculine' voice and indifference to pronouns (I'm also fond of my existing name but also don't mind 'Erika'--a simple modification). Anyways I don't know why I'm saying all this except that you've made yourself very vulnerable here so I feel empowered to as well. And the trolls can go kill themselves."
"eyyyyy congrats on coming out~"
"God, you're beautiful"
"Why, instead of defining yourself outside of 'man', do you not extend what 'man' means? Certainly stating that you're genderqueer, you're defining 'man' as a strict category, where only gender conforming macho-men fit.   The reason I really liked the fact you defined yourself repeatedly as a man is that you were widening what 'man' means. Therefore opening it up so other men could see men like them and be willing to step outside the confines of what society expects from them. Aren't you upholding the gender binary by defining yourself outside of it because you don't fit a strict definition of what man is?   Is it not possible that many men feel the way you do about yourself?"
"Your hair game is way too strong."
"huh, I actually surprised, I thought it's just a provocative act"
"I wish I had a fraction of the confidence you have in yourself. Keep doing you."
"I always saw you as more of a Gender-Awesome myself."
"The self-satirical, humorously 'problematic' take on being nonbinary is really refreshing. I always felt like I was betraying the cause or whatever when I told jokes about my gender. So thanks for this, congratulations, and have fun exploring your identity."
"That doll in the background is creepy."
"So... If I want to talk to my friends about ContraPoints I can tell them she is a funny self-deprecating comedy channel, but he hates bullies and had a distinct pro-social justice bent who like to unpack shitty internet culture?  This is fun, why do people hate this?"
"As long as you dont want to force people through legislation to refer to you as a your prefered personal pronoun and criminalize misgendering i dont care how you identify and hope that refering to yourself as genderqueer helps you to squeeze a little bit of happiness out of this rock that is life"
"One of my main problems with the whole 'science says there are only two genders' is that what we know as scientific truth right now isn't going to be fully congruent in the future due to new information being discovered by professionals. Scientists used to not think that being gay is natural, so who's to say being trans,non-binary, etc won't ever become accepted as a natural phenomenon?"

"I relate to this. I'm on the agender side of GQ identification and this is the most concise collection of defenses of non-binary identities I've seen in a long while. thanks for this."
"The pink-purple-blue lighting in the hallway is clever and looks fucking great, just like you. :-) I support and accept you, and trans and genderqueer people in general."
"I drink taxes, and I pay my scotch."
"I love you so much, tho"
"'I drink taxes and I pay my scotch'  killed me :D"
"Where did you get your top? Its really cute and I need it."
"'like a gay' omg üòÇ"
"I don't mean to be shallow, but you're really pretty in this one."
"The only thing I don't like about this wide array of genders is the pronoun stuff, it seems stiff and unpractical to me. I wouldn't like someone asking me to use a special pronoun just for them, expecially because I often find them cacophonic. Still, Language is fluid and costantly changing, so I guess I'll have to hope society finds a way to get around this impasse."
"Try as you like, but I could NEVER stop being inspired by you! <3"
"You do you, person of nonspecific pronouns."
"I'm glad to see you coming out. I love your content, but was always a little uncomfortable with your general self-debasements and (clearly) preemptive defensive claims to be mentally ill. We all love you no matter how you identify."
"whered you get that top it looks really good"
"You pull off looking 'feminine'  pretty good to me, even your voice.  Also, I just realized you use to be one of those philosophy youtubers and remember a more obscure youtuber I watch respond to one of your now deleted or privatized videos years ago."
"your doll scared the shit out of me"
"I donot know enough about the topic to have a well formed opinion about it (my current stance is: Eh. you do what makes you happy) so i am going to say this: This is the most femme you looked so far. The eye makeup is stunnig, the hair frames your face perfectly and i want to know what lipstick you are wearing cause I need it."
"What I've always liked about you is your willingness to acknowledge how your views and mindset have changed and grown over time, and the process you went through in order to get where you are now."
"Dolly is watching me"
"And another thing, I'm genderqueer too. So you know, great done!"
"What'd ya do to your hair, it looks amaaaaazing!"
"Ah yes the three  genders: Sausages, Sandwiches and Electric Outlets  very informative vid 10/10"
"Love you contrapoints <3"
"Love your content your stuff is amazing. I just don't get (and by that I mean I don't understand but would like to) why this stuff is so important. At a time when we're thinking of going to Mars, how come you fixate on your own narrow intersection with the world? Male/female just seems like a convenient shorthand based on biological characteristics - spending more energy than that seems so trite and pedantic to me.   I guess I just don't buy into the identity politics of this stuff, despite being in no way intolerant of it."
"You broke out the good hair for this video, holy shit."
"Congrats on coming out! <3"
"hair game too strong bro, got those cute af ringlets so pretty (also great video, really liked your takedown of gender essentialist arguments & how simple/straightforward it was)"
"I identify myself as agender, but tbh I wish we could live in a world where we could leave this labels behind.  'Can u feel male and having dysphoria with your penis' - I guess yes and this is why the concept of gender in the long end is nothing I want to support.  But at least the society-part of the genderaspect isn`t even close to this... so we have to deal with compromisses imo.  Glad to hear you talking about this - let`s have a good live - all together - I don`t care what gender anybody identify as. Just.be.happy! (or try to be...)"
"there is only one gender...the human gender"
"Glad you came out Contra :D"
"I've been loving what you've been doing with the colored lights in the past few videos.  Also your pronouns are make me think of BMO."
"Love this video, Nyk. You're rocking that dress, and the puppet is very disconcerting, so mission accomplished! :D"
"You're a low-key style icon idgaf."
"I don't personally have anything against gender non-conformity, but I just worry about how it can be used by society to de-legitimize the medical concerns that transgender people have. Obviously that's not the fault of gender queer people, but it's still a bigger pill for people to swallow, and we should take importance in distinguishing those of us with gender dysphoria that require medical and psychological attention, and those who do not."
"The only surprise in this video for me was how hungry the hot dog bit made me."
"Chinese does have gendered pro-nouns, though they sound the same when spoken. ‰ªñ=for males, Â•π=for females.  Also, I now have a troublesome mental image of you cleaning the hot dog bits out of your power outlet. God bless."
"How much do we want to bet that the parts of reactionary youtube that's previously been nice to Contra (like Shoe0nhead) will start to be really toxic towards him after this video?"
"uuuuugh I just love your existence. I had to pause this too many times to finish laughing"
"No, I will be inspired by you, damnit  Edit: Also, welcome to the genderqueer club. Glad you finally walked in the door"
"Please teach me how to drink taxes, Contrapoints."
"Charles Murray even accepts transness and genderfluidity as scientific fact at this point. Yep, that guy. Mr. Far Right 'Race and IQ'. Even he's embarrassed folks continue to disbelieve and not accept the science on this issue.  Ignore the title. He RTed in agreement with this: https://twitter.com/psychoschmitt/status/823274244041801728"
"makes sense i suppose. I never really paid that much attention to the idea of pronouns being used by not just those referring to a group but also by the group themselves. feels almost like how African Americans reclaimed a word used against them and now can freely use it without stigma when talking about themselves and a group. the way i see people that decry any other gender identity than the male/female dichotomy are that they are not prepared to look into a complicated issue and instead decide to shut down debate to preserve their views, despite recognising that their view is not whole. Hopefully they can one day be convinced to open their mind and understand it's not an attack on them to allow another person to identify as whatever they please.    congrats on your self actualisation, I recognise you don't really need praise or support from some random people on the internet but you have it from me and your other fans regardless. good luck with dealing with the backlash (hopefully there is none.)"
"A lot of this video is addressing the negative comments you'll get. I hope the slew of positive ones will feel good.  And y'know, being genderqueer doesn't mean you can't also be a sexual deviant. <3"
"Excellent Vid"
"its just a scientific fact that contrapoints is the hawtest youtuber"
"awesome video as usual!!"
"I'm femme agender and a sex repulsed asexual.¬† Also not alive or reproductive so any illusion of sexuality is purely aesthetic on my part ^_^"
"How is it a Hebrew decadence?"
"I'm sorry, I didn't listen to a single thing in this video because I was too focused on the creepy doll in the corner and wondering if you were actually going to do anything with it."
"I do like your voice :D"
"Is there not a better word than genderqueer? I like you, think you're really entertaining and you can do what you want with your life and body, but Genderqueer seems like such a ridiculous term, I can't think of a better one but maybe the genderqueer community could? Probably my own fault I grew up in a rural community where queer was just a derogatory term for gay."
"My only issue with nonbinary was that it seemed an unnecessary closing of words when to me it was simply enough to say that men and women aren't cemented moulds and that we can have different even near contradictory examples of both gender without assuming titles. This is still may main barrier into accepting the terms but I understand at this point it's merely an argument of semantics for me based on biological sex while for others it's an actual issues of stating identity, and honestly worth more to them then my pedantic language conservatism."
"You don't are just what you think you are. You are defined by others to."
"i fucking screamed when you said my name that was terrifying when i said 'non-binary is a nothing' it was in the context of transitioning. as in 'you cant transition to a nothing' like i said in the video, i do believe people can ***feel*** like neither/both genders. but not that it falls under the trans umbrella and that it's impossible to *look* like neither.  hot_dogs.mp4"
"Great video! Also, have you cut your hair? Awesome!"
"The doll...make her stop staring at me...SHE CAN'T HAVE MY SOUL!!!   Also, respect for this coming out video!"
"It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders."
"That dress looks GORGEOUS on you!"
"I just gonna keep saying 'he', to keep my 'undercompensating alpha male' joke intact."
"9:52 Did you also hear that Rebel Absurdity deleted his channel?"
"As a trans woman; Hrt is magic. I can't begin to explain, but if you want to experience like... emotions. estrogen is pretty nice."
"You're a gender nonconforming male. Doesn't make you not a man. Ugh."
"There is only 2 sex anything else is mental illness"
"How did you get howtobasic to cameo?!"
"thank u so much for this video"
"B A N G"
"I like  your channel buy this video was pointless."
"I thought you were genderqueer already."
"Beautiful beautiful video, I have a pretty similar indifference to gender and it's interesting seeing it put in words. A+ for combating all those shitty attack helicopter jokes too."
"well if you are happy.  I mean you were going to be called freak anyway so this is better."
"Fuuuuck tell me you didn't get hotdawg meat stuck up inside that electrical outlet. Do you have any idea what you've done."
"Like the hair."
"Ayyyyyyyyy congrats though, so am I :3"
"I see you've stumbled across hunter avallone.    I'm so sorry"
"Best Youtube channel!"
"I am genderqueer and I'm not even bothered by people saying 'its not a thing' anymore.. it's not my problem if they dont even understand what gender is to begin with"
"Great video but some of these labels still sound like nonsense to me."
"That dress is ridiculously flattering on you holy cow"
"Contra it's so cool to see how far your channel has come. I mean, I know he's past his prime, but you still got to partner up with the HowToMake guy for the hotdog bit!"
"I love you so much. Thank you for all of these videos, and especially this one. My partner is genderqueer and this video is so wonderful."
"Well that cleared up why you were picking hot dogs from wall sockets in any case. Good on you for coming out."
"The Hot Dog part felt almost inspired by Lindsay Ellis"
"02:22  tried it"
"I get so excited when I get notification on my phone saying that ContraPoints has uploaded a new video."
"Yo! I'd love if you talked here you talk to @JFGariepy about this in more detail. He has a PHD in Biology and has some weird philosophies I don't agree with."
"HELL YEAH I LOVE U"
"Ah it's super cool to see you come out, big fan!! congratulations"
"See the description for links to a couple good videos about related topics. If you want to argue about biological sex, please first watch the C0nc0rdance video on the subject, so we can at least stay above the hot-dog biology level. If you're curious about gender identities in general, I suggest watching Ash Hardell's video, which presents a wide survey of different perspectives."
"Hi friend. Also second lol. you make pretty cool videos"
"Props, dude. I think you're the only male-sexed (is that the right term? I'm not very good at this) non-binary person I'm aware of, really. Thanks for this explanation mate. I MIGHT (and I that's a strong MIGHT) be somewhat non-binary, but I don't know. Or care really. Whatever. Just, thanks. This just seems like a situation for a thanks."
