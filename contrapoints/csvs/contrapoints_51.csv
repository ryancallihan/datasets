"Risky title I know. I really did my best to avoid making this video, but sometimes an idea nags you for month after month and you can't stop thinking about it, and when that happens it's sometimes best to trust your creative instinct and hope you aren't out of your mind. Of course sometimes you are out of your mind. And maybe I am. But that's not for me to say."

"I like Count Dankula, his mad lad videos are great. Oh and trans people shouldn't be forced to identify themselves unless they wish to, neither should straight people be forced to identify trans people with their desired pronouns."
"Tbf count dankula's charges were a bit rediculous, he taught his dog to put it's paw up like a nazi salute, not really a criminal now is he"
"Eh, I'd date a tranny."
"Bruh, is it bad that I nutted at the video at the 00:01"
"The fact that you call someone like Count Dankula a nazi based off a false arrest over a meme video, really just makes me think you're not to be trusted with determining if traps are gay or not, I didn't like you already and now my opinion is permanent, you are a waste of time."

"I' was so clueless about the issues discussed in this video that I had never heard of the 'Are Traps Gay' meme and didn't even know what 'Traps' meant. So I Googled 'Traps' and 'Traps Slang' and came back almost none the wiser,¬† But after watching the informative video, I believe I have become semi-enlightened.  I still don't fully understand the obsession that right-wing Youtubers have with trans women (OK, maybe I do have an inkling). But why don't they spend more time championing limited government and fiscal responsibility like they used to? Jeez, does everything come down to sex?  Also, gotta say, this video was a work of genius. Smart advocacy topped with a delicious icing of edgy humor. Brava!"

"Although this is super informative, as nearly all your videos are, this one wasn't the most interesting. That being said, it's fucking hilarious! You're writing is amazing; possibly your funniest one I've seen. ...except for maybe that one where you drowned those babies. That one was funny _and_ had class. Keep up the good work; a fan from Canada."
"An absolutely DEAR friend linked me to this EXCELLENT video. GREAT content, WELL spoken, you are GORGEOUS and I nearly shot snot out of my nose from laughter when you cut to the VHS tape XD Thank you for this :D *Edit* 'I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole AND get dicked, is that a crime?' MAY be my favorite line I've heard this year!"
"holy fuck dude this is dank"
"A can't get over it, every time you ask, 'are traps gay.' I hear the Game grumps asking, 'Does Bruno Mars is gay?'   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uy4jBAc6NQ"
"React too leah tverly she's disgusting."
"A classy, artistic and creative 'educational video' that, being a transgender woman myself, deserves my utter admiration."
"Count Dankula did nothing wrong.  As for the rest of the video, pretty nice and clear. I like this. Except for the calling Dankula a convict."
"Woah, these comments.Is this some sort of brain-washing video?Everyone's calling them-selves a bunch of fancy words, and screaming about how saying something hurts a community as a whole.It's hilarious, and frightening."

"the current connotation of trap is a subgenre of crossdressing.."
"as a gay man i would not be attracted to a transgender woman, or a man that dresses as a woman. its alright if you are attracted to them, straight men... ur not gay lmao"
"The phrase 'I may be a woman, but I'm more of a man than you' was so fucking powerful it burned my eyebrows off"
"¬´ ''but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow ?'' to which the correct answer is shut the fuck up ¬ª -as a sceptic i feel so called out lol"
"Congratulations! You're a breeder"
"One thing I sort of take issue with is how you talk about the sentiment 'Sure, trans women are women, but they shouldn't expect men to date them unless they're *into that sort of thing*', and you claim that the that implies they don't actually believe that trans women are women. I think that's an uncharitable interpretation. If a young straight man dates a 80 year old woman, he may well get the 'I didn't know you were *into that sort of thing*' reaction, but it's not because people are questioning if the old lady is a real woman. That's not mean as a degrading comparison, all I'm saying is that a lot of people do have certain common preferences that go beyond just whether or not they're attracted to what they socially consider to be in the broad category of men or women, and lame people may be surprised if they learn someone isn't as restrictive as they are."
"what is the oral sex etiquette for sucking girl dick? Like would deep throating be enjoyable for a transwoman?"
"empowered and intelligent transwomen can be so attractive. I am a cis and het guy that has come to terms that I am also attracted to transwomen in addition to cis women. What Natalie talks about near the end, about how hot it is for a woman to be able to get her dick sucked is interesting. I don't think sucking a women's dick is different than eating out a woman with a vagina. I like being submissive also more. I would certainly be open to this if a transwoman was into getting attention on her dick. It's just hot to treat a transwoman or cis woman like a queen. It would be an honor and a liberating experience to give a gorgeous and intelligent woman with a dick an enthusiastic blowjob and make her feel loved and respected"
"me: why is this woman getting so upset about traps being or not being gay?? also me: ooooooh shit....."
"I know it isn't the same but hearing the line 'living in a country full of people that will jerk off to you but won't give you rights' as a cishet black women really hit me in the gut. I think from an early age I never had an issue accepting trans people because I have always been fetishized, stereotyped, and disrespected and I could recognize that pain in others. I'm still learning of course I still fuck up and it's embarassing but I'm still gonna try"
"7:28 Problem is, Gwen Araujo _did_ trick the men she had sex with: ‚ÄòAraujo first met Michael Magidson, Jos√© Mer√©l, Jaron Nabors, and Jason Cazares in late August or early September 2002.[11] The night they met Araujo, she flirted with all four men and they smoked marijuana together. After she left, Nabors asked the other three 'Could this be a dude?' but none of the four men took the thought seriously.[12] Later, she engaged in oral sex with Magidson and anal sex with Mer√©l.[13][14] She claimed to be menstruating and during sex would push her partners' hands away from her genitalia to prevent them from discovering that she had a penis.[15][16]‚Äô She didn‚Äôt lie about being a woman, but she definitely did lie about being cis. She basically tricked them into sex under false pretenses, which makes her a rapist."
"Since I was pointed your way (thank you Armoured Skeptic) I've very much enjoyed your posts.  I love how thought out and creative your posts are.  I can't imagine how long it takes you to put these together, between the writing, costumes and impressive makeup effects.  It's soooo refreshing to watch a presentation that is enlightening and entertaining.  And also, thank you for talking about things that I'm sure are not comfortable to talk about in such a public place.  I look forward to more posts!"
"You say straight men either are grossed out by vaginas or trying to climb inside? Really?"
"I very much agree that hyper sensitive worry about being gay is awful and has lead to terrible violence in the pursuit of maintaining this ridiculous and wrong idea of masculinity.  However, something not brought up in the video was the idea of procreation. Evolutionarily built into most people is a desire to procreate and pass on genes. With a trans individual procreation is not possible in a natural context and not synthetically yet.  The unhealthy manifestation of this is what you describe of insecure men (and possibly some women too) casually fucking around and getting all uptight about whether it makes them gay or not.  The healthy manifestation of this is when people avoid casual sex and date to find a life partner. In which finding out that procreation is not possible with someone you fell in love with can feel like a devastating betrayal. Especially if it doesn‚Äôt come up early on in the case of people who want to wait for a good relationship before sex.   If one takes the lack of procreation as the means by which homosexuality is determined then the argument can hold ground. This of course classifies any infertile individual as being a gay partner as well, but purely on the basis of determining attraction ion in the latter group, it holds.  Now the majority of the violence against trans people is committed by the former group and not the latter. I personally fall into the latter category. As was stated in the video ‚Äúsexual attraction is complex‚Äù and for me casual sex is not enjoyable. The idea of having children with that person is a significant component of my attraction to someone; finding out that it wouldn‚Äôt be possible would kill that component. Unless I had enough of a connection with the person to overcome that missing component things would probably end there.  I wish sometimes that I my attraction wasn‚Äôt tied to that so much. I have sexual impulses with great frequency and it would be nice if casual sex could satisfy that. I am attracted to trans women having met a few really nice, beautiful people who have gone through hrt and the penis doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. But the attraction remains surface level and can‚Äôt easily progress with the potential procreation component missing."
"you're very atraptive..."
"nice smear of dankula, shitebag. he trained a dog to do a trick. he‚Äôs not a criminal"
"Came for the aesthetic, stayed to listen to your amazing ideas and fluent speech... and the aesthetics too, of course."

"23:24 I'm getting a Silence of the Lambs kind of vibe. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"Ehhhh I'll take Dankula and your introduction of him as a 'scottish hate crime convict' means you believe dog tricks are potentially racist. That's certainly an interesting stance."
"How can a plural form of a noun naming a rap-subgenre be gay?"
"Great video! 40 min felt more like 10. Sadly, topics like this usually get a lot higher dislikes rates. You presented it in the perfect way. - trans woman"
"Straight men will beg cis women for anal and oral but refuse to have sex with a trans woman because she doesn't a have a vagina."
"What the fuck did I get my self into by watching this"
"are traps gay? yes."
"Traps are gay, so are all of contrapoints videos and anyone who likes them, why all the costumes and props, do they have no logic or reason to use? Or just like playing dress up while expecting people to take them seriously, this MAN in the video doesn't even know what a trap is and has been completely wrong on almost everything HE has said, HE is just repeating the ultra radical far left extremist nonsense from twitter, wake up people."
"Just the ordering made me think trans women have 5 vaginas"
"Men pfff there is only one man, THE MAN, of course, John Maclean."

"You are doing a much better job of creating trans acceptance than gender pronouns ever will! more important you make me laugh! The world needs more humor!"
"mental gymnastics around the simple facts lmao"
"Fifteenth, maybe 20th time thru this video and while it has educated me beyond past recognition,  there's something else.  It makes me wish I was a hot, straight man, with his priorities in order, a brain like Natalie's,  and a few dollars in the bank. So I could try like a maniac to date this woman.  But alas. I'm an old straight, married woman, with a marginal brain and fading looks. But a girl can dream."
"Second time seeing this production. And it is amazing how much it has grown in me, as one hs de capability of evolve his reality paradigma. Before it was something beautiful and secret, but risky to share, waiting while surviving and getting stronger. Now it is a message and life experience i can begin to share with those who need protection, caring, friendship or some de construcci√≥n. Lots of love, and thank you."

"Anyone who thinks its gay tbh hasn't been around a person through transition. Opposite hat but I'm a lesbian who's known a good amount of trans men, and myself have the two year rule: no matter how hot i find a pre-testosterone trans man, after two years of T that attraction will have shriveled up into nothing. They have man hands and scraggly facial hair and a deep voice and as soon as my dumb brain has properly agreed with me that they are indeed male, there is no chance i'm into them."
"Stolfo in the background lmao and I mean c'mon juxtaposition"
"You really don't have to eat well or use enemas or any of those things to have anal sex/play. Just shower/wash and make sure to go to the bath room beforehand."
"Awesome video, thanks!"
"So what you‚Äôre saying around 36:30, is that the definition of being gay is someone is constantly attracted to people of the some gender but then you just said it‚Äôs not gay unless you identify with being gay so I‚Äôm a little confused on your logic or I just didn‚Äôt fully understand you."
"(I'm only halfway through this video) A biological man with a trans woman is gay depending on your definition of homosexuality and heterosexuality. To me, homosexuality means somebody of one sex being attracted to that same sex. it's based entirely on sex, genitals, that whole biz. But nowadays the LGBT community is trying to shift that definition to social gender roles and whatnot, and that's cool. It moves the understanding from, as Contra said, from biological to identity. But everyone has different understandings and views on what sexuality is, and that has to be accepted. Straight men ARE attracted to vagina. from what I've seen, heteros are about half attracted to the social roles of the opposite gender, but a good chunk is also reliant on the genitals. and that can't be changed just by emphasizing how trans women are women. Most guys just don't like dick. even if it's a woman's penis. I'm sure she'll cover this but I like writing."
"Omg thank you so much for these videos... like i never thought or new about a lot of these things and it is great to know, like i feel like my brain is growing, and i do hope that anyone who needs to watch this will watch it"
"I had problems at 38:00 when you said that 'a real man is not the kind of man who let¬¥s other people¬¥s prejudices control his life', etc, as if man=courageous, not insecure, etc, because those statements could be interpreted as if you are saying that only men can be havers of a lot of virtues, and the people who are not men are cowards, insecure, etcetera. 'A real man does this', has been a sexist, transphobic and homophobic phrase used to legitimize 'one type of man' while throwing to the garbage the men that dont fit that and alz√≥ the people that are NOT male. An example would be ' A real man owns what he loves'....soooo females and non-binary DON¬¥T own what they love because if they did they would be men? 'A real man drinks a lot of beer' so if a man doesn¬¥t like beer, he isn¬¥t a man? And what if a non.binary person or a female drink a lot of beer? They are men now? 'A real man defends justice'...sooo only men can defend justice? I hope my point is understandable. Love your videos, Natalie <3."
"It's funny how everybody is so concerned with labels. You said it best 'If it feels good, then who cares?'"
"A huge thank you for this vid!  I'm a gay guy who works with youth (directly with first year university students and indirectly with street kids). Trans and trans-questioning kids have a REALLY rough time, and find it hard seeing what is ahead for themselves. This vid is great not only for them but for those trying to support them. I have recommended this video to co-workers and the resident assistants at the college's dorms as a solid intro to trans issues. And I love it that this video will come up when someone searches for 'traps'. Nicely played!"
"I think this may be my favorite of your videos."
"Hay otro lado: '22:5¬†¬†La mujer no llevar√° ropa de hombre ni el hombre se pondr√° vestidos de mujer, porque el que hace esto es una abominaci√≥n para Yahv√© tu Dios. 22:6¬†¬†Si encuentras en el camino un nido de p√°jaros, en un √°rbol o en el suelo, con polluelos o huevos, y la madre echada sobre los polluelos o sobre los huevos, no tomar√°s a la madre con las cr√≠as.' Deuteronomio"
"Sorry but you saying that straight men don‚Äôt know the difference between crossdressers and trans women is wrong. I‚Äôm a trans woman on hrt and I know a lot of men that are strictly into trans women but not cross dressing men. Traps usually refer to cross dressing men."
"Wow. This fucking chick is probably one of the coolest people I have ever seen on the internet. What I wouldn't give to be able to hang out and converse with this girl! Probably more intelligent and learned than 90% of the people I've ever personally known. Thank you for pumping out this content! Also, please be my friend! Let us fan the fire of the revolution which will consume the world."
"Are traps gay? Are they not? Doesn't matter, they're all hot."
"If you date a transwoman and your friends call you gay, beat your friends. Then they have to live with the shame of getting their ass kicked by a gay man. They won't say shit then."
"You do know this is a joke right? Just because some douche bags take it too far does not mean you should be offended by this simple joke. I could make similar legal or objective arguments against any joke. This misses the point of comedy and restricting comedy does no one justice because comedy is about habitual line stepping. It is an art and some people get it wrong, but it is still comedy. I understand your point of view and have no actual context because I am not trans, but I think this issue comes down to what should be allowed in comedy. I think you would argue that you cannot make a joke about rape. I would disagree and say that it matters on the joke. I personally find the joke tasteless, but would not make any rules on limiting comedy because anything can be funny."
"I love your videos so much! You're hilarious and really informative"
"But *are* traps gay?"
"Come on, it's simply disingenuous to suggest that thinking it's strange to date a trans women is the same as thinking it's strange to date a woman from Cinciantti.   edit: 27:45.  No. No no no no no _fuck_ no."
"Your videos are so great, so well executed. But, I feel like referring to count dankula as a ‚ÄúScottish hate crime convict‚Äù is kinda lacking in nuance. I haven‚Äôt really ripped into any of his other content besides the Zieg hieling pug, but are we really operating under the premise that he deserves to serve time for that? I‚Äôm honestly asking."
"Tucking the penis just always sounds painful...like I can't touch those guys they are so sensitive. If anyone touches them I freeze up and panic. I can't imagine pushing them up inside me...so to every woman thank you for all that you do for yourself."
"Wow this video was fantastic! It was funny, it had such good arguements, and it was easy to understand, I'm def subscribing !"
"Oh I'd do you. But only if you used a strapon.  Anal or vaginal, I don't care. Does that make me gae?  Maybe I am just a dyke.  Oh by  the way, I have a cheap way  to get a vagina.  You register in the Netherlands for six months, get 100 euro basic medical insurance  for those 6ix months, then you qualify for surgery,  enter the few months surgery waiting list (probably not even that), travel to the Netherlandss, get surgery that's covered under medical insurance.    Blammo. One two way trip, negligible paperwork, about 600 euro, wait six months, another two way trip, surgery.  Yes this is ligit. You can get tits this way too.   Can you do a video on transhumanism?"
"But what about anime? Obviously I'm not going to call real trans people traps. I'm not going to make a blog about Grell Sutcliff from Black Butler and call her a trap. But what about the anime girls/boys that the author purposefully made to look a certain way to trick the audience? Would that be offensive?"
"hate crime convict is a bit unfair on dank considering it was 100% a joke"
"With that Logic, then kissing ur sister is not incest because ur 'just experimenting' NUFF SAID"
"Count Dankula actually agrees with you on this, at least by definition. I'm glad I watched his video on it, because you can't tell by watching this one."
"'Signing up for a vagina' is an amazing way of referring to getting bottom surgery. Almost as good as the term 'teet yeet'."
"I was with you mostly until @36:11... and we're done here lol"
"'Scottish hate crime convict' is very far from a proper title for PaPa Dankula"
"Tl;dr 'Trap' is just a fun word and people shouldn't lose their shit over a word. If you get offended, it's your fault for being overly sensitive.   BUT. THere's a difference if someone uses words for the sole purpose of making someone else feel bad. But I doubt that's the only way people use the word 'trap'.   So please, can we not cry over every single word in the world... Please. :T  Edit: Also, a trap isn't a trans person. Trap is a person who PURPOSELY tries to look like a woman/opposite sex for the sole purpose of 'tricking' the other person."
"0:19 warn me? HA nothing is disturbing to me, and just TRY to get me triggered, I dare you XD"
"Never knew that 'traps' had such a negative history with it. In the otaku culture, traps are just literally guys who look like girls, or guys who dress up and look like girls. Of course that'd be gay if looked as such. I myself am a 'trap' lover, though, in the otaku's context.  Thanks for the enlightening  info."
"Need a brochure to hand out so people might know how to talk around me, you, we, them ..."
"I really really really really really really really really reallllllyy LOVED this video. This is the first vid im watching from your channel, but definitely going to subscribe and watch your other content too. Actually, i really really appreciate and respect the courage you have to just be yourself.. cuz i think it takes real courage to just stand strong in the world and be the person you are,,putting all gay trans straight stuff aside. Also you're very funny hahaha (i had genuine laughs),,,  intelligent and of course very very pretty! Mmmuahh !"
"10:10 Ulver? :D"
"I wish I was somewhere else."
"So basically everyone's bi/pan"
"I was on board until you called my sexuality a preference"
"LOVE!"
"I always thought traps were men who are in the act of cross dressing well enough to ‚Äútrap‚Äù another guy, and that being trans is a completely different thing.  So in that case, traps would be gay, but whether trans ppl are gay would be a different issue."
"All of your videos really are helping me through my own, weird kinda' dysphoria. Trying my way forward, so far I mostly know what isn't me but not what is me. Anyway, choke me please."
"I had never heard the term 'Trap' before this, and am now horrified by its meaning. I'm sorry to anyone who has ever been called this, it's like when I learned the meaning behind 'Zipper head'.  I watched this video like a month ago and am still haunted by this term, how terrible, what's a Trans woman supposed to do?!?! Stay single her entire life?"

"Some men in America are so afraid of being gay that they don't wipe their own arses when they have taken a shit."
"I watched this, liked it halfway through. Then was like damn good argument. Tried to like it again. Was sad I couldnt't. Forgot about this incident. Heard you say some more bomb shit. Tried to like again. If that doesn't show you how much I enjoyed, I don't know what will. Keep being a badass. You're so influential and you've taught me a lot. Thank you for being another visible queer person :)"
"Degenerate scum..."
"Okay, I‚Äôm going to be honest. I‚Äôm one of those edgey white shitposters who has participated in this meme. As you said, and I really appreciate the understanding (undeserved I know) from your side, that it‚Äôs intended as a joke and nobody in the group I‚Äôm with has any sincere hatred for trans people. I say (and I‚Äôm sorry for offensive terms) ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm bi, are traps gay?‚Äù and the agreed meme answer is ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù But of course, under the meme I did have that sincere curiosity. Especially being bi, inexperienced, and not completely understanding how being attracted to one gender works.  This was very enlightening about all the questions I had on the subject and I really appreciate the video in that regard. I also appreciate you bringing to light the meanings it brings to mind for trans people and the stigma. It‚Äôs something I kind of knew but didn‚Äôt know how serious it could be. I can‚Äôt promise I can be the person to stomp the meme out of my ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùedgy‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù friend group, but I hope my understanding now can help me handle the meme when it comes up with a bit more care for the trans community.  I know you probably won‚Äôt read this, but I hope you know that this video was appreciated. :)"
"What happens if a white person led a conversation about the disproportionate attacks on trans, black people? Like can't any talk about something regardless of sex, gender, race etc? I understand it is a bit odd as it isn't there issue. But if a white person wants to talk about it, then they should be allowed to."
"I don't usually write comments like these but I thought it would be good to articulate in words how I feel. Keeping in touch with feelings being something I have recently been having a hard time.   What I wanted to say was that I found your videos, and I have been absolutely delighted watching them. You are super funny and I have felt my pulse rising by simple watching your beauty.     Looking forward to watching more and you have earned an eager subscriber.   Greetings from Sweden!"
"Are traps gay?  Here's a better question.   Does it matter if it is or not?  If you wanna go have fun, you do you. Nobody cares except for homophobic bigots who get off on people who do get turned on by one."
"i'm a straight, cis gendered female and I was very attracted to natalie before her transition. I still love her, and wanna be best friends with her, but I am not attracted in the same way anymore, because I am sexually attracted to men. Her chromosomes are still the same, so I am living proof it is indeed about perception. And being attracted to Natalie is just unavoidable anyway. LOVE YOU QUEEN!"
"'Orchidaceous invitation to a proboscis.'  Damn, it took me several seconds to parse that. I'm still chuckling at that one."
"in the anime sphere,traps are just male characters who looks female but they are usually strictly male identifying characters. This is because it's usually the case in anime that the aesthetics of a male and a female usually only differ with the chest and even that is not reliable an identifier.   It was kinda surprising to learn the true history of the term but please don't be mad when weebs use the words because they love traps"
"Ah yes.. How naive I was.  Thank you for making this video.  I had no idea that trans people have to put up with this abuse."
"The only way to win is to hijack the car."
"I love this and the incels video especially. I think your authenticity really sells it."
"What did we learn today? Date bisexual people"
"Great video! At this point in my life, I find their arguments so tiring but being from a small town where the trans community has to stay hidden, I can think back to my ignorant days and remember some of the f-ed up stuff I believed. It's online communities LGBTQ creators share with us that enlightened me. Please keep up the excellent work. I truly believe you are changing hearts and freeing thousands from their bigotry chains.   On an unrelated note, I feel so much better about being attracted to you knowing you're pan. I always feel awkward being attracted to straight women or gay men because that's not my demographic. Sweetheart, you are killing it. I love the drag outfits, you bring it every time, but I love to see you in all your feminine beauty. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing people comfortable and women in baggy clothes is my weakness, but to me you are your most attractive when you're in everyday clothes. That's just my preference, though, so keep being you! I love hearing you speak and watching you have fun.   Be safe out there and I appreciate the discussion of having sex with trans people. I've thought about it (as if my sex life is going anywhere) and I've been so afraid of hurting the one I was with or making them uncomfortable. I think the more I read about it, the more I realize you just need to have a conversation. The point is to have fun, and gender dysphoria affects everyone differently. Find out what your lover wants, then proceed. Thanks for the perception!"

"Okay so I really do agree with most of the stuff you say but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to put Count Dankula on the level of the alt right because if you look up his ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù it was just Britain wanting to suppress his speech"
"Not that it matters anymore, but 'traps' were never about the LGBTQ+ community, it was only boys who looked like girls, the joke being that you find them hot, till you realize they're not female... Hell, most of them have some elaborate reason as to why they wear female clothing, and many of them just wanna be more manly... That's where the joke started for me, at least. It might have degraded to a completely different thing, but it wasn't initially a slur and I've never seen it as referring to trans characters (not that there are many in anime)."

"So enough people have referenced this channel and this video, finally decided to watch it.   Firstly I don't need an answer to 'Are traps gay' cause the answer is simple - 'No', why you ask:   Scenario 1 - The straight person is attracted to a trans person that's usually because the trans presents themselves in a way that matches straight person's expectation of the opposite sex, and assuming this situation happens in a bubble the straight person has no way of finding out that someone else is trans until they get to sex. So, no, being attracted to a trans person, while being ignorant to that person being trans is in fact not gay.   Scenario 2 - The straight person is aware the person they are attracted to is trans, this one is more complicated, only because what it depends on what you are actually atractted to sex or gender, and for that I play a little game with (straight) people once I get comfortable with them 'If you had to choose between sex with trans man or trans woman, which would you choose and why' here are the anwers from my small sample group:  - Straight man 1 'Trans woman, because she has boobs, and we can always have anal' - Straight man 2 'Trans man, because he still has a vagina' - Straight woman  'Trans woman, because she still has a penis' Are they gay for their choice? No, because currently there isn't any objective way to say what makes the opposite gender attractive to a straight person.    Why trap being interpreted as a slur and why that doesn't matter.    Before I start with why it doesn't matter I wanna debunk a little bit just because people who have commited violent crime against trans people have used it, doesn't mean anyone who uses it queally is inherintly the same person or even has the same mentallity - just because Nazi Germany speak German, doesn't mean modernday Germany has the same mentality.    As to why it being interpreted as a slur doesn't matter - just like retarded used to be a medical term but is now an offensive, language changes and what is considered offensive also changes, so people will stop using the word trap, and a different word will arise  to hold the same meaning, or an old one would take up the meaning."

"I've met plenty of guys who claim to be straight yet they love anal sex with women, they say it's the best way to dominate a woman. I've yet to find the logic of that statement. And when I proposed oral as the 'ultimate' female hole'' domination', I was told, no no, anus is the best subjugation hole. When I asked them if they were secretly gay (they can confess to me, I won't tell their dad), they were offended and declared with certainty 'NO HOMO!1!!' and that they are super hetero.   I'd call them traps, since I signed up for vaginal penetration and ended up with begging for my tender anus. Insert ''it's a trap meme''  Ah and on a side note,  in perspective the guys that said that had a fairly modest penis size. Even the one I lost my virginity to was hard to be sure if he was still inside at times. So they may actually be super straight, just need a goat or really petite woman to fit them snugly like an anus, I assume feels for them.   And for any virgins reading this, a small penis doesn't make things easier, men have fingers and they are generally thinner than their penis. You can get a nice fingering to loosen up that skin then upgrade to the good stuff. And good luck with any guy that doesn't know these things. Google is your friend....the best you got in that situation, anyway."
"Great video!  Personally, I like to refer to tucking as 'penile origami'"
"'Sucking a feminine dick is not gay' Uhhhh.   Great video. But sucking a dick is gay no matter how much you try to explain it away lol. Though, if someone is preoccupied with this sort of thing at that point what does it matter lol."
"When she said she is a woman but she's more of a man than you I can't. 'Man up' boys."
"I am talking mostly about myself but also I think this for other men, as you said most men are most interested in femininity. I would be fine to date a fully transitioned trans woman but she would have to appeal to my conscious going 'ooga booga she a girl'."
"Oh shit I think I am in love with you. IS THAT GAY? Seriously you are great and making hilarious, but important content. Amazing job."
"My reaction to the question 'Are traps gay?' is. 'It depends what kind of trap. Are bear traps gay? What kind of bear are we talking about, if you know what I mean?'   That was my reaction when I didn't understand the question. At the point of knowing slightly more about the question, I was turned into a short-circuiting grammar nazi unable to properly convey how stupid he finds it that the wording is asking whether 'traps' are gay but meaning refers to whether being attracted to 'traps' is gay.    I mean, I guess there's a precedent for using a noun to refer to an activity involving said noun, but I still think it's weird, maybe because a 'trap' is not an activity, it's a person.    Moving past that pedantry, . I wanna try to get this straight . . . according to the logic of 'traps' being gay, if I have sex with a trans-man who looks like a man, that attraction is totally straight?    This question kinda just gets more ridiculous the more I know about it."

Never bothered me at all, and it didn't work for other reasons though. Not long at all.   Sorry if my language was bad or offensive."
"I listened carefully to every word and you didn't address the question. You took issue with the terminology and criticised it as a slur. This did not address the question. You then spoke for ages about every conceivable dimension pertaining to the relationship created by a successful seduction. You chose not to acknowledge the deception and played the victim card whilst recounting how you had deceived cis het males and were lucky to suffer no violent repercussions for your lack of transparency. You are selfish and self involved. The closest you came to expanding my mind was when you explained why you identified as Queer. Although, you didn't explicitly state this at any point it was possible to infer that the answer COULD BE:  *No, because they're Queer.*  If I am wrong in this inference, or I have somehow offended you, or your cohort of similarly deluded defenders I refuse to apologise as you had plenty of time and my full attention to make a positive impression. This was all smoke and mirrors, without a firm logical foundation to what became a semantically woolly argument that ignored its subject. Your Reality Distortion Field must not have been functioning correctly, because despite your high production values, which made the video tolerable to endure, I was still aware by the end of your pathetic attempts at gaslighting."

"Even the LGB community has a huge problem separating genitals and birth sex out of their prejudices.  I've argued the point more times than I can count that I am attracted to women, any and all women no matter what their genitals are or what their birth sex is.  If they look like a woman talk like a woman and act like a woman than they are a woman to me.  But I've argued in vain with most lesbians and gay men that we should love people for who they are and not what is between their legs.  Sadly the people most open to this line of reasoning are another much maligned group, bisexuals.  Many lesbians have prejudices against bisexuals and transgenders alike and many of them will even attack self identified lesbians for not having the same prejudices against bisexual and transgender women that they do.  Genitals dominate the mind of most people to an unhealthy degree and social constructs impact the LGBT community almost as much as the straight community.  When even the Lesbian and Gay communities have this lack of understanding of the trans community what hope do we have for the straight community?"

"5:11 What Dankula did wouldn't be criminal in America. His video was sophomoric shit posting and I'm not a fan of his content, but at the end of the day what he did was trivial. Malicious Communications is a nebulously defined criminal charge in the U.K."
"But yeah the problem is that ppl feel that 'being gay' would be the end of the world so much that they'd do any wicked violence to 'save' themselves from it, like, ppl generally know if they like dudes."
"I like how you actually go into answering the questions for their own sake and realize that this is not incompatible with ethics. If you want to fix something you gotta understand how it works first,else you're just saying 'because I say so' and making it all look to be an emotional argument when there ARE in fact good intellectual reasons for ethics But I mean you can get turned on by a picture or even a drawing of a person of your preferredd gender(s) and that doesn't make you screensexual or paper-sexual.

"I'm so glad Natalie had an instructional video on this topic just lying around"

"I said trap because in anime when it is revealed that the female looking character is a male they don't say 'I am trans and I prefer female pronouns' No they say 'I'm a boy I just like to dress like a girl' Like Dangonrompa for example, they have a male shota character who dresses like a female but the reason he did is because he always looked like a girl so he just said fuck it and dressed like one. He said he was a male not a woman, he even wanted to become more masculine before he was killed out of jealousy my mondo"

"Count Dankula‚Äôs conviction was pretty controversial and I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt jump to shit on Richard Spencer at the time lol."
"I agree with most of this, though in my opinion, to be straight/heterosexual is to only be attracted to the opposite SEX, bisexuals are attracted to both sexes, and gay/homosexual is to only be attracted to the same sex.  These are sexual orientations, not gender identity/gender expression preferences. If you're a cis man attracted to a pre-op trans woman's body, in my opinion, that makes them at least bisexual, as they're of the same sex."
"I consider myself a straight male who's a bit effeminate(as in my own personal ideology I believe balancing masculinity and femininity is very important in leading a healthy life) but that's besides the point, well kinda. I've always thought it was fine to be attracted, date and have sex with transwomen and that the man doing so is still straight. I've always been of the mind that these women are indeed female and have always been female regardless of the sex they were born. As they've always felt like they were female. But my friends who claim to be progressive would never budge on the issue which i never understood why. When I told them I'd be okay dating and being with a transwoman they'd question whether i was gay or not and always use the talking points of 'well theyre not REALLY a woman, so thatd still make you gay.' Which just confounded and honestly hurt me a bit. It was just so backwards to me, even if i brought up the scenario of them having the surgery. They still found it 'gay'. But after seeing this i just wanna say thank you Contra for this very informative video!!! I'm no longer scared of ignorant remarks from my friends about this subject. I know what's right but have been afraid of what others thought but no longer!"
"Honestly I love the 'fellas is it gay...' meme because at this point it's turned into making fun of guys who are overly sensitive about their masculinity. Like, is it gay to eat strawberries?

"Cis-Het male here. All this talk about traps being transphophobic makes me uncomfortable because it makes me guilty. At the end of the day I'm a shitty meme loving asshole and I don't want to give up traps. To me it just doesn't mean the same things it means to other people. I can't get over this. I want to appologize, but it's probably meaningless when I also know I'm not going to change what I'm sorry about.   On a somewhat related level, I would love to be able to talk to someone and find out just how much of a shitty person I am.

"That isn't the question. No-one saying 'are traps gay' as a meme is talking about the sexual nature of having sex with trans people. The question is 'is being attracted to an anime character who looks like a girl but has a dick, gay?'. Very few people are calling IRL trans people gay, and the ones that are are misusing the term. Traps can only be 2D. There are already plenty of terms for crossdressers or whatever the real life equivalent is"

Sorry about the misconception. But yea, thanks for the video. Really sucks and there‚Äôs barely any reason to hurt them."
"Contrapoints over here taking count dankula out of context. You just included the memes and totally misrepresented his point-the reason that he said that having sex with a woman is gay is to dissolve any stigma of someone being gay for having sex with a trap. You included none of his clips defending the trans community."
"Calling dankula a hate crime convict is extremely misleading"
"For anyone asking: Are 'Traps' (not real people but anime characters) crossdressers or trans women?  Both. They're both, and that's part of the problem. They also include gender non-conforming people (Astolfo, probably) and basically it's a culture set around shaming people for being attracted to someone who presents as feminine or has feminine traits but also has a penis.  Penises, as covered, are not the be all end all of sexual attraction. Furthermore, I'd like to talk about the anime dick. Well, or what would be there is censorship didn't get it first.  You don't have to like the reality of something to be attracted to the anime art.  Look, Bridget doesn't have a smell or taste, just animation poses as yo-yos of death are used to walk the dog into the nearest hospital, and you can find porn of Bridget hot on a aesthetic level and it doesn't mean you'd like the same if Bridget was not anime but a real person. If you're worried about that, there is real person porn out there for you to make sure, but if your worry stems from the idea that being at all perceived as gay is a negative thing? Then gosh, this video should be right up your alley, why are you reading comments?  I say this, because as a gay otaku, I have read some stuff that's really hot in manga form but not in real life, let alone in real person porn. Kink discourse time: people are very flexible when it comes to fiction, for example: just cause I've jerked it to straight porn doesn't mean I'm not a raging homosexual. I've jerked it to ws, but actually doing it? No way.  Also, please consider that sexuality and romance are not necessarily tied together. You don't need to want to have sex with someone to date them, nor do you need to want to date someone to want to have sex with them. Being gay, is, therefore, perhaps not just about sex with men. Are you more worried about what other people will say if you touch a dick one time? Or are you worried about being romantically attracted to an anime character because that is kinda concerning. But it is still frustrating that straight men see being gay as negative, let alone that they ignore bisexuality entirely. Being 'gay' is not just homosexuality, but often homoromantic behaviors as well, and on top of that it also includes a lot of stereotypes that not all actual gay men fit into, most of them being feminine attributed behaviors. So, maybe your attraction to anime men who dress like girls is gay, and your attraction to anime trans women isn't really gay, but what does that matter?  Why is being perceived as gay so, so, so bad? Or bisexual, which is more likely (and not trans exclusionary).  [Bisexual here being attraction to someone because of the gender characteristics they display, while Pansexual being attraction to people without taking gender characteristics into account.]"

"I see Astolfo and Count Dankula, I'm happy :)"
"Haven't watched the whole video yet but, I have never heard someone say that a trap was a trans. What we mean is ANYONE who dresses like the opposite gender, DOES NOT ACTUALLY IDENTIFY AS THAT GENDER but, still slightly passes as the opposite gender. That is why we call many anime characters traps. Many characters look super sexy in the anime but, we then realize they are actual males. Not trans. Not female. Male.    The only real-life example of a trap that I have seen is the tons of guys I have seen that look like sexy women to me but, I then find out they actually are biologically male and identify as a male. Those guys are traps to me by my definition.   So, I must ask. By my definition of a trap. Someone who actually does not identify as the opposite gender. Is not trans. A biological male who simply looks like a really hot woman without trying:    Are traps gay?   Is it still offensive to say the word trap?"
"I like vagoos"
"I fully disagree with your statement that you should not comment on certain issue just because of your race. Your opinion is no less important because of your race."
"But it is gay to date a trans woman. I'm a woman, and trans women are women. Which makes it pretty gay."
"'And you want to know what he said after?' aww perfectly good opportunity for a words obstructed by cum gag. Too bad"
"Have to disagree a bit... A beautiful woman with a dick doesn't make it a feminine, or female, dick -- she's just a beautiful woman with male genitalia. I think rationalizing the dick as a feminine quality might be a mental workaround to avoid the discomfort trans people sometimes feel about their junk."
"I think you're selling yourself a bit short -- you're not just seductive; you're funny, expressive and interesting.  You tick off a lot of boxes. You aren't a starfish in any aspect of life, bedroom or otherwise. I can see why you are able to flip lifetime straight men."
"Love your stuff. Just want to say one quick thing -- a guy saying a trans woman shouldn't expect cis males to date them unless they're into that sort of thing is talking about dick. He's not talking about your personality or whether or not you're from Cinci, he's saying that straight men shouldn't be shamed for not being down with sucking dick. And they shouldn't be shamed for that, we all have our preferences. A lot of guys aren't making a character judgement about you, it's just about what you have in the pants.   A biological female doesn't have a dick. I think a lot of guys would be much more amenable to the idea of being with a trans woman if she was post-surgery."

"24:40 Men like to draw dicks and buildings and rockets are in the shape of those. Brilliant counter-argument. Now I wanna dickfight a naked woman in a bed when I realised I may occasionally draw dicks, because that's a subconscious craving for dick. Really?"
"dudes that bitch about tgirls watch more tgirl porn than i do and we all know it. fuck those guys."
"Point made at around 39:50 is one of the things I admire about women. Men are scary. The idea of giving up the sort of control needed in a sexual situation scares me. The fact that women have to deal with our agressive domineering demeanor, not only in a sexual context but in normal society, takes a lot courage, something I imagine would scare the shit out of me. The simple feat of leaving the house would probably leave me with panic disorder. This is my first contrapoints video and I loved it. I look forward to more."

"this video should be duplicated and used to replace....a solid 2/3 of trans activism on the net. maybe more. it is mind boggling to compare how effective and helpful this is to further the cause and understanding of these issues to the 'outside world' compared to so much other rhetoric that inadvertently turns many off and drives them away despite its intentions"
"Did u get 'Lenora' from Poe? If so I love it. Also you look great. Fuck haters"
"‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help but be a little wounded by the fact that straight men are so obsessed with proving that they‚Äôre not like us.‚Äù   Isn‚Äôt this what happens when people (in this case: straight men) seek too much validation from external sources?  It‚Äôs placing more concern on ‚Äúsaving face‚Äù than actually acting with compassion and integrity.  In my opinion, the only thing those men are proving is that (unlike you) they don‚Äôt have the courage or confidence to be themselves. I doubt that‚Äòs any consolation for trans and queer people in our society...especially when they‚Äôre forced to make sacrifices every day just to be themselves. But life is short, and having the courage to live it on YOUR terms IS a gift in itself, and I figure it can‚Äôt hurt to point that out."

"Years ago I remember watching a really interesting video of a lecture about why men view trans and futa porn. I wish I could find it again becusse my memory is a little dodgy. As far as I recall the gist of it was that in studies done on heterosexual presenting men in positions where they are looking for sex such as bars, nightclubs etc when their eye movements are tracked something interesting shows up. The parts of the body men look at the most are the faces, breasts and asses of women and the groins of other men. The hypothesis of the lecturer was that males are instinctively interested in other mens penises as a way to gauge the level of competition. This is why men are so obsessed with dick measuring. But that has meant that dicks are actually closely associated with sexual excitement in heterosexual males as they spend a lot of time looking at them and thinking about them, all be it subconsciously, whenever they are thinking about sex. So for many hetero men dicks are arousing, even if masculine features aren't. Also when the four areas their subconscious is looking to analyze in a possible sexual encounter, feminine face, boobs, ass and dick, all show up on the same individual their brains give a little thrill of excitement that can heighten their arousal even more.  I have no idea if this was ever well accepted, if the evidence presented still holds up or has been superseded by further research or anything. But as someone who was born male and is mostly attracted to femininity but also loves dicks it did make sense to me."
"Also, gurrl you got some beautiful cheeks. I'm confused and scared, though that's some good make up.  Do what makes you happy :)"
"OY DON'T YOU HATE ON ANIME, DAFUQ IS WRONG WITCHU."
"That was phenomenal.  Thank you, sincerely, for making this video."
"The surgery drop is one of the best shot post moments in the whole video"
"If its penis on penis, its gay. If its penis on vagina, its not gay. Dating a post op trans woman isnt gay but pre op is definitely gay"
"I love the picture of Astolfo in the background because he is like... the anti-trap. Canonically male, does not deny this, and simply acts as an extremely feminine man. It's really not a trap because everyone involved should know this. But, knowing how people are, and scrolling through pages of tumblr blogs that call him a trap, I feel like it comes full circle. I don't even know what I'm babbling about anymore. Great video, Natalie, you are one of my favourite youtubers."
"This was a big waste of time. Anyone who believes cutting off your penis and 'making' a vagina out of the remains will make you a woman... there's no talking people out of this delusion. I feel bad for the women who don't understand they are being mocked by men doing these things. I'm not trying to be hurtful, but seriously how did we get to the point where we have to have these conversations?"
"So the answer is no then? great."
"I want to issue a couple of statements before I make my legitimate comment. You prefaced this video by acknowledging it was a controversial topic nestled within an already controversial topic and honestly, I'm glad you decided to make this. Your lighting is on point as well as the visuals and effects of the video. The presentation itself was informative and funny. Very entertaining.  I appreciate you went into the nuances of the topic rather than simplifying things. Your ability to differentiate context and perspective on key points was helpful in clearing some of my hangups.  That said, I've been sort of struggling for a long time with how I think and feel on this topic given my understanding. I've had plenty of conversations with various friends on this subject and have expressed frustrations at not having someone who is trans AND nuanced on the topic the way you were in this video. So I was only willing to adopt a 'progressive' position up to the point that exceeded my understanding, but beyond that I'd either remain neutral or be (cordially) disagreeable. Admittedly, having generally been on the progressive side of things, I was uncomfortable with pushing conversations too far in fear of being written off as transphobic rather than have my particular hangups acknowledged or set aside for now (it's unlikely to change someone's mind in one exchange). So I've refrained from opting into larger conversations and stuck mostly to private ones.  I'm glad I watched this. The points are well made while shifting perspectives between a more traditional understanding, a more progressive understanding, and then the sort of overlooked 'crux.' e.g. orientation being described as biology based (traditional), identity based (progressive), and perception based (the crux). That was super helpful in restructuring the way I've been approaching this topic the past year. The 'political' dichotomy of this topic in the public atmosphere made me feel isolated or 'in the middle' so to speak. This video wasn't really a silver bullet to all layers of the larger topic, but it definitely opened up avenues for me to think better on.   As a straight cis male, I really appreciate this video a lot. Quality content. Thank you."
"I just started watching your show, thank you for enlightenment. Thought provoking videos."
"A Scottish hate crime convict ? He was convicted of causing gross offense. That is neither here nor there the 'are traps gay' meme never included trans people it was about males in drag who were intending to trap some one. The question was not if the ' trap' was gay it was if you were gay for falling for it. Did  your intentions define you or do your actions define you. That is the reason this debate raged for so long. I guess you felt the need to project on something you did not understand. Bread tubes heavy hitter huh . Wow"
"3:40 so at this point I know you have no clue what you are talking about and this goes on for 40 more minutes ?"
"3:24 WRONG it does not include transwomen"
"2:20 It appears at this point you have only taken the surface layer into account. I am interested to find out if you actually get to the meaning or not."

"Wittgenstein is my fav philosopher as well. i hope those arent real candles your gonna light your head on fire"
"I was kind of wondering wether I could agree with your assesments. Now as a straight man I obviously don't know anything from the perspective of transexuals, but I just wasn't too sure. But then you came to how sexuality isn't black and white and I finally understand the whole point and can completely agree. I am so annoyed at people that desperately try to put everything into neat little boxes. Life is messy, love is messier and if anyone says shit like 'I am 100% straight' he is either lying or doesn't know what he is talking about. In my experience."
"Also Natalie why don't you tell trans folks to be upfront about being trans ."
"graphic displays of anime? What degeneracy!"
"On the other hand as a straight white conservative it was enlightening but doesn't change my mind if it involves 2 dicks no matter how female one looks it's still gay. On the other hand I'm willing to admit your make up is way better then my ex's lol üòÅ"
"Transvestites are not 'women' sheehs, when did this nonsense start. Just because you feel lkie something does not mean are it."
"I think transgenders really have an obligation to inform people as soon as they realize a man is interested in them. While the trans panic defense is horrific. Tricking a man into having sex with you is borderline rape. i like to think I would be able to tell in the bar but if I got as far as pulling their pants down before realizing i would need several years of therapy to be able to date again."
"So... I can be attracted to someone my friends would call 'a dude' without actually being gay. I fell filthy already. I like it!"
"'are traps gay?' sounds like you wanna fuck a trap but would hate to be mistreated for it by bad people. so how about you fuck whoever you'd like and who'd like to fuck you and stop being the kind of bad person who would mistreat people for doing that. and sorry for being redundant here -- i'm sure the video goes over this."

"Quite nearly died with the 'legendary Pokemon' keep this up!"
"I once saw a meme about how, after a shower, women use separate towels for feet, hands, face etc, while men just take care to not use the same side of a towel for both face and ass. What a strange thing to worry about, I thought, they took a proper shower, after all, didn't they?.. Well, now I know, somehow. Thanks, I hate it."
"'Scottish hate crime convict' yeah okay, I lost almost all respect for this channel but still very much amused!"
"That's largely unimportant. There is great diversity in the forms of degenerate, but it's still degeneracy."
"Bitch I am a trap"
"I love you Natalie, keep up the good work."
"Btw, you do understand that there is not enough propaganda in the world to get men to go along with truly treating traps as women, in a functional sense, right?  That's never going to happen.  You should really settle with the white standard of not murdering, and I guess work on black people or whatever (good luck with that, btw)."
"I think looking at the stills for the videos on this channel clears up the matter pretty well."
"Does trap is gay  NO (Sorry)"
"I adore your jokes"
"It's literally only a matter of time that I put up a framed portrait of Astolfo next to the other people I look up to."
"This was a video that I figured was going to piss me off, but it actually changed my mind instead of just making me enraged. It actually made me feel like maybe, just maybe, people in my generation aren't actually trying to destroy everything that I orientate my relationship to the world by because they hate me for factors outside my control (sexual orientation, skin color, gender) & that the real issues of what is taking place in society right now are far beyond complicated.  Anyway, I'll keep watching. I liked and subbed."
"Touching the rainbow makes you gay. Even leprechauns know that."
"For a video focusing on the word 'trap' there wasn't much talk about crossdressers, the other people that most think of when hearing the word, or the context of the words creation or use in a context other than towards a trans woman. All I could really glean from this 45 minute video was 'Don't be a dick to trans women, and trans women are women' which are good points for the wrong discussion. But a quick point you made towards the end was a pretty good one 'Don't call a human a trap' which I agree with. I believe the definition that should be settled on is 'A character from a manga, anime or any piece of fiction that appears and expresses themselves as the opposite gender, but identifies as their biological gender'. Sorry for the paragraph long comment no one will see on this 5 month old video, if anyone does see this than I hope they have a nice and relaxing day."
"This video is just too good"
"Is it me or does it seem more 'Gay' to worry about people thinking you're Gay just because you're attracted to Transwomen or men that cross dress? In fact, to me it seems even less masculine and more pathetic than anything else. (That statement may be a bit biased seeing as I identify as Bisexual) If you're afraid of what other people will think about you, how are you gonna be happy in life? People need to realize that the only person that has any real value in their opinion is themselves, if you can be happy with yourself then nothing can stop you."
"Jokes on you contra, I don't want a relationship with anyone woman OR man hahahahahahahaaaa!  *one single tear falls down my cheek*"

"As a normie, with 4 kids. I was always put off by anyone who dressed up too much. Tons of make up, short skirts, tits out etc. Where yea it was exciting to look at, I percieved it as mental weakness.  When looking for a partner I was always aiming at children and a life long partnership. So trans women, pass or not, were never on the menu.  My partner refused to get married as she didnt believe in the vows. We just had a deal that we will stay together till the youngest is 18,  then have a review.  Oddly enough, as we got older we both switched sides of this argument.  My point being that I think the issues highlighted in the vid are all about sex. Just the physical side of sex. Whats left out ia that sex for men is quite often the only chance they get to be vulnerable with a women in a way that is mutual enough to be secure. Its also acceptance from women. Which socially its only the most chad of men get out in the open. Normally women hide their interest.  Undisclosed trans women violate that part of sex that you have missed."
"Natalie is so beautiful. Her entire aesthetic is just amazing."
"I'm so straight I only fuck guys because girls like dicks and that's gay."
"I love your videos but I always get halfway through and have an existential crisis because I don't get why these kinds of questions even need answers"
"Jesus Christ, I feel really bad now. I used to be one of those people who joked about traps being gay. I feel shitty now that I realized I may have been attacking trans women."
"I consider myself a pretty woke guy. I watch Hbomb and Philosophy Tube, listen to Chapo and other lefty pods, and shitpost with the best of them but I am always finding myself dumbstruck with how indirectly insensitive or ignorant I am sometimes when someone discusses something that is an everyday experience for them in certain realms that don't affect me directly. I legitimately have trans friends whom I associate with (albeit from afar, we aren't like best friends or anything but we run in similar circles and are friendly toward each other), I have no problem waving the trans flag and marching for trans rights, but when you said something to the effect of 'There are bars that I don't go into because I don't know if the staff would side with me if I were physically assaulted for no reason other than existing' I was legitimately taken aback. I suppose it's because I never truly put myself in a trans person's shoes in a way that I can really associate with my own life. Of course I understand (as much as a CIS white guy raised in a lower middle class household with two loving parents can understand) oppression and persecution for simply being the person who you are, but I suppose it never really hit home for me until now.  On one hand I feel educated, but on the other I feel bad for a simple aside being the thing that makes me feel like I truly empathize with a group that I have always considered myself an ally and supporter of. I guess better late than never."
"Radical propaganda my dude. Yeah I'm not buying it. Most men that are attracted to transsexual women have been desensitized and heavily conditioned by porn from a young age. Porn is just one of many weapons used to destroy the family structure in western countries. You act like if a man is turned on by a transsexual women and doesn't get on his knees and suck her off right then and there he's sexually repressed or a bigot. Being turned on doesn't equal attraction and doesn't mean you have to fuck what ever turned you on. So in a sense it is a trap because there is an agenda to push this shit on straight men and confuse them, whether that be through porn, propaganda in the media like this, or gender studies in academia. And lets not forget the push to give hormone blockers to young children(effectively neutering them). This kind of shit is being pushed in the entire western world, and why? Is it because the elites in media care about tranny rights lol. You and your like are being propped up by the powers that be and the alt-right (whatever you want to call it, collective consciousness of the woke western man,etc) are being silenced. You are being used ContraPoints as a sword to strike down western man. And I, I am their shield."
"The reasoning that none of the 5 senses can detect chromosomes makes sense. Up until now I have really wanted to believe trans women are women but didn't have enough evidence. This video is real evidence. If I see a woman it's a woman. This all makes sense now."
"I like how the title of the video itself was a trap in and of itself. This video barely talks about crossdressing anime men at all. It mostly covers real life trans women.  That being said, the points you made in the video were really good, and you really got me to think more about sexuality and gender. Good video overall"

These videos have had such a big impact on me, it cemented by stance as a lefty and made me finally cast off the toxic influences that have been trying to suck me in my entire life as an introverted cis white guy.  I'm finally comfortable with what I believe and my life views.  I also am so grateful to get a perspective on trans people and their issues that has made me truly care and empathize despite unfortunately not knowing anyone directly going through it.  Now, rewatching all these videos, I have gained a new perspective on my own experience.  While not a gay or trans issue I have fallen for a woman that is older and perhaps not seen as 'conventionally attractive' by the rest of society and I admit I've been afraid and second guessing because of what other people might think.  This video and the statement to be brave about the women you love has given me the courage to not care about what other people might think and pursue my true feelings.  Thank you so much for all you do.  Cheers!"

"Informative and funny...regardless of whether you agree or disagree with the video, it was well researched and presented - YouTube always needs more quality, quirky content.  One question though: for the supporters that feel the need to advertise their sexuality and/or gender as a qualifier in the comments, is that necessary? Not trying to come off as rude, it just seems wholly unnecessary to clarify your posts as a 'cis-het guy' or 'straight male' or 'cis woman' 'trans PoC advo' etc. and say 'but I loved this video'...it just seems very much virtue signaling - at least to my eyes. Who cares? Voicing support in the comments should feel like support, regardless of whom it comes from."
"ContraPoint, this was a great video. Before did not know what 'Are Traps Gay' was. But this video was so enlightening to me and how the term 'traps' is use as a slur by cisgender men against tran  women. Plus how this very term  can lead to violence against many trans women who have intimate encounters with straight men. I truly feel so sorry to what happen to these women now. This has started to make me be more sympathetic to trans people, particularly black trans women.Hope more people watch more of your videos I know I will.  Keep on entertaining and informing the masses, sweetie."

"So, is being inconsistently attracted to men isn't gay? I am fine with just being mostly straight. Like just occasionally, a burly, or muscular man impresses me with his attractiveness. But only like 1-2% of the time. And this is the kind of comment that makes people not use their real picture or name on the internet."
"So 'white middle class trans women don't get killed' eh? Have you checked the trans suicide rate lately? Suicide is another way that trans people 'get killed.' Life becomes so unbearable that it becomes easier just to die. Here's a terrific report on the rates of suicide attempts among trans people and all its causes by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS). http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf Among racial factors, multi-racial (54%) and Native American (56%) trans people had a higher rate of suicide attempts than the sample of trans people as a whole [Black (45%), Hispanic (44%) Asian (39%), White (38%)]. The strongest factors are: homelessness (70%) mental illness (65%) physical or sexual violence (65-78%); harassment or violence at school, work or in health care setting (64-78%); physical or sexual violence by police officers (60-70%); family rejection (57%), low income (54%), HIV + or disabilities (50-65%). BTW, trans men (46%) are more likely to attempt suicide than trans women (42%). How's that for 'wow, who'd a thunk?' Moreover, the overall rate of suicide attempts by trans people is 41% compared to 10-20% for lesbian, gay and bisexual persons, and 4.6% for US population as a whole. The most important finding: 'Overall, the most striking finding of our analysis was the exceptionally high prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts reported by NTDS respondents across all demographics and experiences.'"
"Ok. I know how this is going to sound. But I really did need this explained to me. And now I get it. I'm a lesbian and I'm attracted to trans women because they're women. And men being attracted to trans women isn't gay because they're women. I know it's stupid of me but I really couldn't figure it out until I watched this video. Thank you, Natalie. You're changing people."
"I understand what you are trying to do,but I think you are going about it in the wrong way. Your definition of straight is so vague that it really means nothing (i understand why). Two straight men engaging in sexual activity  are still straight? How exactly? (You sure as hell didn't explain that in the video). You are reducing straightness to an identity that doesn't even need to be grounded in reality, even though your own experiences said otherwise(again I understand why). Now I am not going to tell people how to identify but I am sure as hell wouldn't really consider those two hypothetical 'straight men' Straight. If the care about it is none of my business. Ps. Don't really care for trans, and never fapled to one either. Tl;dr your definitions mean nothing and I am going to treat them like nothing. Go Deconstruct something else."
"‚ÄúIf trans women didn‚Äôt want to get murdered, then they shouldn‚Äôt trick men.‚Äù I have an idea: Making transgender women wear a special tag in public, so people know they‚Äôre trans. While we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs have ‚ÄúJUDE‚Äù or stars for Jewish people and pink triangles for gay people... That‚Äôs totally sane..."

"I just became a fan you explain things very well thankyou"
"Your veiws on straight men are kind of sexist girly. Also gets creepy when you try to convince straight men to 'give it a try, you're missing out.' It wasn't 'expirementing is not gay.' Some moments were 'hey your a simple minded, purely sex driven, raging animalistic fuck bot straight male right? Hey fuck trans women.'  Also I do really hope you disclosed to the straight guy you were trans before you gave oral sex. You know, more than your feelings matter right? Probably thought his didn't matter because 'he is a big stupid male and looks like he enjoyed it. Just don't let him know.' If so you know you didn't tell him because you knew he was probably not into it. Which means you know you lied by omission. I really hope that is not the case because that would be 100% *WAY* more worse than James Charles."
"Trans women are women. If you're not attracted to skinny women, or fat women, or women with big boobs, or women with small boobs...the list goes on for about as long as Journey to the West...so what? We all like what we like. Trans women are women, regardless of what you like. I'm a cis white woman soooo not my lane. I am bisexual. And given that trans women are ...you know...WOMEN...being with a trans woman isn't 'gay'...unless you're also a woman. :)    And hey, just a suggestion...you don't have to be shitty. Life is a lot easier when you're not, if you can be brave enough to be vulnerable at first. Later? You'll get to the Land of Few Fucks Given. Come...join us."

"If you werent sexually abused ill become a patron"
"Love the video, and i am in general agreement. That being said, i do think its fair for a guy to not be with a trans woman because of how he is seen. By that i don't mean its a good thing or even a fair thing in our society. But a dude can receive a pretty shitty cultural backlash from dating a trans woman. A guy might be in a situation, or job environment (especially in the US) where it would become hard for him to coexist with his coworkers because of it.   While it is definitely harder being a trans woman, i don't think its fair to say that just because a Straight man is attracted to a trans woman, he should act on it because if he doesn't (based on how he wants to be perceived) he is a coward."

"I wasn't even aware people referred to humans as traps. I've only ever used the term or heard it used to refer to characters in anime. That said, it's pretty revolting that trans panic is a legitimate defense or even a mitigating factor in a murder, like it's acceptable to be so psychologically damaged by this revelation that you'd be driven out of a rational state of mind. If you kill someone for having a penis when you assumed they didn't, you're a murderer and you should rot in a cage. End of story."
"You brought up points I never thought about."
"Excellent discussion. I learned a lot. :)"
"So I‚Äôve just come back after witnessing people use this video as a flawless response.  Someone on imgur posted a picture of some genderbent anime characters with the trans pride flag in the background.  The top response was itsatrap.gif  The top response to the was a link to this video.  It was so satisfying to see this video with lots of upvotes"
"Is that Schubert's Piano Trio no 2 (D 929) that one hears from 39:11 onward?"
"7:39 ''Men are often willing to side with these killers''. I appreciate the video (as someone who wasn't even that sure what traps were) but that surely can't be an accurate statement. I'm sure a loud minority of men will publicy say something in their defence, the very large majority of men would be disgusted by someone killing a person over such a thing. I just can't imagine American men being so far behind our time or so morally unhinged. Maybe I'm reading to much into the word ''often'', but ''Some men are willing to side [...]'' sounds a lot more realistic."
"My sexual attraction is black and white based on identity and mind. I decided to be with my wife before ever even seeing a picture of her, based solely on the mind and goals we had. Ideally I'd date a superintelligent AI with no gender or physical form.  Trans women are awesome because no pregnancy risk or periods though, but otherwise I don't care cis or trans."
"I think this video presents a really good argument for why trans women are valid, and why trans women shouldn't be called a trap. You shouldn't call anyone a trap. But it has nothing to do with traps in regards to anime.  A majority of characters aren't trans, they aren't claiming to be female. A majority are male/cis characters that are just feminine in appearance, and it 'tricks' male characters think they're talking to a women. The end conclusion is the same though. It's not gay, because they aren't identifying as gay with a consistent attraction to men and a majority of the time the 'trap' isn't wanting a relationship/isn't gay themselves. No one is trying to 'trap' them. If anything it could help reinforce the idea that men can be feminine and clothes/hair cuts and appearance shouldn't be limited to a specific gender. Obviously I'm using a wide brush and I'm sure there are anime the go against my point, but from the majority I've seen this is my conclusion."

"You forgot about Blaire White..."
"Forget where I saw this, but read that liking trans women is pretty normal for hetero males and liking female bodybuilders is actually gay. I can see why this statement is true. If anybody can shed some light on this, please do."
"Huh, well I'm a cis-queer girl and I had never heard the meme in your title, I  was curious, and having seen a couple of your videos I knew you'd be educational and walk that line of edgy humour/respect for people.  I'm really impressed with how you covered the topic and how you made your feelings one of the points.  Such a hard thing to talk about but you do it with such grace and humour, acknowledging that these things can be really scary."
"Okay, I'm enjoying the actual content of your videos, but nearly every one of your lighting choices fucks with my eyes."
"A trap is still male and not trans and knows that they are male. Ferris from Re:Zero is a trap. He is male, and knows it. He merely dresses like a female because he wants to. If he were to seduce a man while dressed as a woman he'd be pretty gay. The male being seduced, if he's unaware that Ferris is male wouldn't be considered gay because he doesn't know Ferris is male. After knowing he's male and the attraction is still there it would be considered gay as they are both still currently male and identify as male."

"I'm a straight white male and I haven't the slightest clue about what it must be like to face as much adversity as anyone in the LGBTQ+ community but goddamn, all of the homophobia and transphobia that I see all around me in my personal life makes my blood boil.  Thank you for everything you do, Natalie.  You not only empower people in your community, but help people like me become better allies and push people on the fence to the right side.  I cannot express how important your presence is online and how much you are appreciated and never, ever, EVER forget that!!!!!"
"I'm just a weeb. I would never call an actual person a trap. But like if I see a loli in a anime and find out they have a dick...then that loli is a trap. If there are assholes using that word as a slur to actual people then those a holes are shit. I hate how memes get coopeted by extremist and just take the fun out of everything. But hey, this was a great video. I don't agree with everything in it, not even half of it really. But I do agree people should be respected regardless of there life choices so long as those life choices harms non one."
"God, I love what Natalie is doing. Why doesn't she have more subs?"
"I feel like, for me at least, the main takeaway from this video is that the concept of 'straightness' is really just a vague social construct that you really shouldn't fixate on. Don't think about labels too much, just go for what you're into."

"Anime and Memes were the whole reason I watched this video so I'm very happy to have been able to laugh as much as I did."
"I feel like the odd man out. Dicks are un-attractive to me. I don't think being attracted to trans is gay but also I am attractive to vaginas. Dicks are pretty ugly.

"I was completely behind this, until you got political about the issue and then called Count Dankula 'A Hate-crime Convict'. The man is probably doing more for trans acceptance than you'll ever admit and the fact he was convicted for the crimes against him is more of a travesty of our criminal system and a foreshadowing of our governing style. I could go on but talking politics is exactly the reason why I left this comment. You had good points overall, but leave the politics out of it. If you have a problem with the side who's infringing on the rights of the LGBT; pigeon holing people into 'left' or 'right' and then making an enemy of them is only distancing those people and makes it harder for us to educate them. (and is a little cringey imo)  Save the politics for the voting booth. Much love and keep doing what you're doing o7"

"I never understood the way people could think that something could be so offensive that it couldn't be discussed. Nothing would ever get better if that were possible."
"Can I just say as a gay man, I went on a really awesome date with a trans man a few years back, he was COOL as FUCK and burly, manly, the whole nine yards. I was really into him. But when we started making out and messing around, I realized that he was pre op and was...all up on his vagina. At all points before this I was attracted to him. But the minute I knew a vagina was involved I went limp. I dunno. It's sexual orientation, not gender orientation. I'll admit it's a minute difference - but all I know is that I was fully open and ready to date a pre op trans man before and now I know that I can't. While I will always respect anyone's right to claim their gender identity, I'll admit my shit bias that I can't truly actualize that acceptance, through my penis, until the operation is done."

"i learnt alot in this video, thank you"
"I almost just discovered your channel and I really love it ! But (ofc there is one) despite all the video kinda being about the 'To Date Trans Women' subject (that is very important of course) you almost completly avoid that 'Traps' is really much more used for crossdressed japanese anime characters. In fact I almost never heard/saw it used for anything else ^^' . But if we gotta link this to real life to me someone that could be way more related to crossdressing than Trans people.   Just an opinion, but that being said I repeat : Your channel is awesome, so are you and your characters!  Lot of love from the land of good cheese, wine and champagne <3"
"Count Dankula is a cool dude. The alt-right support he got after he was arrested and convicted for a hate crime kind of made him well-known as they tried to turn him into a symbol. He's actually pretty left and has some cool videos. Unfortunately, Alex Jones gave him a shout out and now his fan base is 50% assholes.   People hear he was convicted of a 'hate crime' and immediately view him as a scumbag. For those who don't know, the 'hate crime' he committed was uploading a video with his dog raising its paw into a sort of doggy swastika whenever he said 'gas the jews.' It's so obviously a joke, but some draconian Scottish law was broken and some politicians wanted a bit of good press, so he was arrested, put on trial, and convicted. Really, the worst part about it is how only the alt-right, anti-PC culture voiced support for him. Once they support something, it becomes taboo for us leftists to support it. And that sucks because Count Dankula is a cool dude.    Was it in bad taste? Hell yes. But did that video bring harm to a single Jewish person? No."
"People generally say women are the ones with more fluid sexuality, more open to same-sex experimentation etc. But between all the trans porn, the gangbangs, the miring of beefcakes and the fetishisation of femboys, straight men really give everyone a run for their money. It's just that there's a sense of being unable to express it, so it gets fermented in a crockpot of aggression and frustration, and whoops there's no airlock, the pressure's building and boom, now there's kimchi all over the kitchen (except 'Kim Chi' were the name of a transexual stripper and now she's the latest on the list of 'trans women murdered this year because men can't handle their feelings')."
"this is way to fucking long"
"As a chef, I just have to say that I got a real kick out of your whole mouth-feel skit. Using all the terms I was taught in my concepts of taste and flavors class and having them describe different types of tastes and mouth feels involving oral was just amazing.

"Bisexuality is very stigmatized for men. I think that‚Äôs why so many ‚Äústraight‚Äù men date drag queens and men."
"I‚Äôm a bisexual who typically attracted to cisgender men but I have to say I‚Äôm more open to the idea of being with a transgender woman then a transgender man. I have been accused of both transphobia and fetishizing a minority. I do think it‚Äôs valid for people to prefer cisgender over transgender and vice versa. Not everyone out there is pansexual."
"How often do white transgender women get murdered or experience violence regardless of class and income?"
"I tried to have this conversation (not about the meme specifically, but trans women as women) with a lot of centrist/right wing people back in my liberal days, and I never really got anywhere.  I think that part of it was simply failing to understand where their ignorance on this topic was coming from.  But it probably didn't help that instead of 'meeting them where they're at', I was much more inclined to repeat twitter-sjw talking points.  Sometimes effective for a driveby dunking, but not very useful for actually changing minds.  I love Natalie's approach to these subjects.  Not just woke and well-informed, but presented in a way that can appeal to even the edgiest of edgelords on their own terms. That's what's needed if we want to get through to most people.  Like it or not, being correct simply isn't good enough on its own.  And a lot of the hand-wringing moralizing that's commonly seen around topics like this is simply obnoxious and repugnant to people who aren't already on board.  It totally sucks, and it's not fair at all, but there's not much do about it other than work with it."
"I love bingeing on these videos."
"15:06 I believe that trans women are women, BUT I also realize the importance of acknowledging that trans women are (in most cases) women with penises. That‚Äôs a fact that cannot be overlooked in this conversation. Straight men are allowed to prefer partners with no penises, if thats what they choose, then there‚Äôs no problem with that no matter what underlying transphobia may exist beneath that decision."

"I find some trans women attractive the same way I find some women attractive. However, a transwoman with a penis it would seem is a show stopper for me personally. I distinctly remember watching an interview with a stunning trans women in every way, I google her just out of curiosity. I literally just typed in her name and the first picture that came up was of said lady naked, with her shallong hanging in the wind. Immediately my confusion was cleared up, yes that's not for me. Post opp I am not so sure.  But I have always been curious about men who are sexually attracted to Trans women who have not transitioned, not a specific trans women but trans women in general. What is their sexuality because I would argue its not gay. Anyways apologies if any of my ignorant musings are offensive that certainly was not my intention. Great content, thank you."

"Genuine question for anyone in these comments who is arsed to answer, because i have no idea what to call myself rn:  My entire life i have been attracted to men (obviously this includes pre-op trans men).  I (a cis woman) am in a committed relationship with somebody who (for the purpose of technical discpurse i guess) identifies as trans female, and prefers they/them/she/her/pronouns although i was not aware of this until after we started dating. I love this person and am 100% committed to the relationship, despite initally percieving them as a male (they were presenting as male and using he/him when we met). I refer to them as my girlfriend, do her makeup and help pick out clothes. I dont know if i would be attracted to my partner if she was already presenting and living as female though, but i know i love them and am committed to this relationship as i already said. I‚Äôm very happy to have a female partner and the transition isnt an issue for me as all i want is for my partnet to be comfortable in her own skin and live as she truly is. I guess what im wondering is, what does this mean for my own sexuality? Does this make me bi/pansexual or heterosexual with exceptions? Honestly i dont care much about the label and im happy to live without one, but im curious to see what people in this corner of the internet might think what this means for me as i know i am not as educated as others. Like i said, i love my girlfriend and i only want her to feel actualised as a woman just as i am. I hope this dorsnt come accross as trans/pan phobic as i am just curious about how i might go about describing my situation"

As an aside, I can still use the General Akbar meme in non sexual situations right?

"This is actually a really good and well put together video, subscribed and notification bell turned on.  On a different note I've sometimes thought of making a few videos and writing scripts myself but I've always kind of feared the stigma that'd come with a pre-everything transgirl bumbling through talking about some nerdshit or something, but it's actually really reaffirming and inspiring to see somebody who's a trans YouTube creator, kinda makes me feel more positive and more certain that even if it'll be difficult, things I have to say won't necessarily be lost to the void because of who I am. Nah they'll be lost to the void because I suck and procrastinate too much to get anything done."

If you do a threesome with two men and a woman, or two women and a man, the two same genders, plus the different gender's relationship with the same genders as discussed before make for a total of 100+50+50=200% gay.

"Natalie - I so appreciate what you are doing. I have learned so much. Not just about the intersection of gender, sexuality, and politics but also about, well, 'checking ones own shit'.  Your ability to take apart an argument, using logic, intellect and humor (I have yet to watch an episode where I don't guffaw like some 14 year old, hormonally addled highschool boy (granted when I was a freshmen in highschool ('86) I was hanging out in the theater department, playing blues harp and sneaking out to see Rocky Horror at the Key theater in DC... yet I digress (80hdsquirelle)) but you tease apart (see what I did there?) some super complex concepts, and break them down in a way that the average citizen (god I hope so) can really understand them. You take things apart in such away that the process itself becomes important information! I love that you show your work! This past year I dealt with a fairly large reality shift, where in I had to take a very deep dive into parts of my identity that I believed to be 'authentic' turns out, not so much. So I was forced to dig into some of my own biases, and blind spots... in relation to who I think I am, how I am viewed by those around me, my values, my own intellectual blindspots... my own LIBERAL biases (the older I get, the MORE liberal I become... and less ideological) .... had to literally reframe my entire history.... I am saying this as a person that is deeply introspective, that enjoys taking time to ' mind wander' and dig into my own cognition.... with all that being said. This year fucking sucked. Your videos helped. Your honesty, your bravery.... and in moments early on when you were being real about your struggles, being more raw than brave. I laughed, I cried! So thank you Natalie Wynn. You're an amazing woman!"
"Ok so I agree with the majority of what you said but I think you referenced Marcus Meechan very poorly. He's not a convict. He did not commit a hate crime. He made joke video of his at the time gf's (soon to be wife now) dog with the context that Nazis aren't cute and that all he did was make an adjustment to the 'shake' command. If that's a crime then his God given right to free speech is being infringed upon. He did not deserve to have his life torn apart in front him and his s/o via a public arrest and fine of ¬£800 by the gov't over a joke where context was clearly given. To call him a convict when he hasn't even truly been given a conviction of the crime, only been demanded to pay a fine. Even after they have destroyed most of his personal and professional life. I have no will towards you. I just strongly felt that the use of the word convict for what really is an innocent man is grossly incorrect.  Peace be with you."
"na bro not being attracted to traps is gay becoulse that means that you are not attracted to feminine signifiers and that sounds gay to me"
"The things you speak about at 9:50 is so spot on. I have been in debates with people calling me some transphobe because I wanted to know more about the trans people that get murdered are. I feel this is another western priviliege, like those talking about 'sex work' are always privilieged middle class people. What you talk about there, intersectionality is real, but if you look at class, many things will be debunked and in the end it is ALL about class."
"'Are traps gay?' They have their own answer in the question: 'Why don't gays like traps?'"
"If it has a penis, it's gay. EZ"
"I think that if gender is a widely ranging construct involving genetics, physical characteristics, behaviour, dress, and other unnameable aspects, then so is sexuality. If a guy is attracted specifically to mate-to-female transgendered individuals with penises, then maybe they're a little bit gay. Just like if a guy likes having carrots shoved up their butt, it's a little gay.   And if they aren't okay with the way that makes them feel, it's their problem."
"I‚Äôm a trans girl and I wanna be called a trap"
"Nice video discussing the subject and relevant background. My 2 cents are that any crimes committed against transsexuals are still crimes and should be given the full due diligence that they deserve. Sex between two consenting adults should be treated the same regardless of they're sexual identity and respected in public space. For special cases where the transsexual identity of a person is found out abruptly it should be dealt with privately and without violent provocation from anyone. It's the responsibility of the two consenting parties to deal with the matter with civility and society at large to promote such behavior.   The term trap is how some men view transsexual women as a trap that threatens their sexual identity or provides a means for sexual deviancy. It can be used in a humorous and harmless or desirable context but if used to threaten individuals then the individuals who did threaten someone should be held accountable. My personal view is that traps aren't gay as the allure is still the female characteristics that characters possess with the added deviancy of mixed in male characteristics that allows for some men to experience additional or submissive sexual satisfaction. From a purely sexual point of view, it's all about the sexual preference of the individual. Men who hurt people should be dealt with according to the laws, and the laws should not legitimize the trap argument.   I think the problem isn't the men who don't want to have a relationship with transsexual women but society at large to accept men who want to have a relationship with women regardless of their transsexual identity."
"while i do get the argumentation, my only question i have is: is the term traps directly even used in transgender related issues? the example of trapping heterosexuals sounds rather indrectly used in a different way than most people use the term trap.  the only place i see using the term trap is just anime community or related communities, where traps refer to characters appearing from their look and behavior of the other gender than they actually are. only see the term used for'real life people' are crossdressing cosplayer which is clearly arefererence to those characters and not really some sort of insult or accusing of trapping heterosexuals."

"During puberty and til my early 30's my hormones were imbalanced producing much more testosterone than I what was considered 'normal' and I was '1of the guys' when it came to humor, sex, track n field, enjoyment or dislike of various media formats, ect. However, I was a girly girl when it came to clothes, hair n make-up, ect. I had almost no ti++!es, i was almost anorexic looking bc of how thin i was, and no hips. Plus i could grow more of a beard than my mtf neighbor (she mever took hormones). In fact, her body and face had softer, more feminine look than me.  No man would ever think that he's gay for fu‚Ç¨%!n6 me and I've seen several mtf look & act more feminine than me. So if you're gay eFFng a mtf than you'd have to be gay for eFFng me and other women like me.   The only reason I'm even mentioning mtf is bc this is the basis of the topic. Irl, i'd say (or write) my gf, her, she, whatever. All women have things that make them unique.  Only reason I told neighbor friend that chic was mtf is bc I knew my neighbor was being a dick and he wasn't encouraging his friend bc he wanted his friend happy and didn't care about chic's past. He was doing it so later he could tease his friend"
"I lived in a 4fam and the chic in the house next to me is mtf. The guy that lived below me had a friend over that was attracted to her and so my downstairs neighbor tried to convince his friend to hit on her. I told him neighbor fucking with him bc she is mtf. He didn't believe me at first. Then realized I'm a fag hag and prob wldnt joke that way.  One day 2 guys drove by and yelled 'faggot' she said what they came back around and yelled it again. She reached in pulled keys out car and threw them then beat his ass his friend tried to jump in so her mom came out and foughtt other dude. Guys in car got arrested and the mom yelled 'ha. You got yo ass beat by a faggot and a bitch'"

"'Gentlemen of the Academy, what are traps? *And be they gay?'*  My friends have come to the conclusion that traps are exclusively cis men who, to varying levels of passability, dress up as women for fun; they also conclude that therefore, if a trap is interested in sexual relations with a man, they are indeed gay. However, it must also be noted that they conclude the term is sort of redundant because generally a crossdresser will make it apparent how they identify if they're aiming to have sexual relations and thus are not tricking or trapping anyone; lastly, as an additional note, the gentlemen and noblewomen of mine Academy lastly conclude that trap is a term which is used in this context purely out of convenience to replace longer more formal terms as used elsewhere in this comment, and that thusly any soul whom does use it to refer to thou who was once a lad yet is now a lady shalt be dealt quite the punishment...

"What sucks as a cis male, is that any time I speak with a trans woman with the intent to 'pursue' her (based on her femininity and my being attracted to it), there's always this awkward period where she assumes I'm 'chasing' (trying to get with her because 'straight men only want to fuck a trans girl, not date her').  I mean, I get why there's an inherent defensive stance there, but it's damn-near impossible to get over and that second-guessing has killed relationships in the past.  :("
"About a month and a half ago, I realized I was a trans lesbian. I knew I felt wrong in a male body at least since I was a kid but never told my parents. I'm not out to my family or anybody else offline yet. It first hit me when I was 11, looking through a human anatomy book I had from early childhood (a comprehensive one, not some kiddie shit). I had a particular focus on the reproductive section. After going through unwanted erections as an adolescent, I knew something was wrong: I should have had a vagina downstairs. The dysphoria has manifested itself in shaving/Nairing EVERYTHING and even secretly wearing my mom's shoes. As far as shoes go, it helps that my mom and I are the same size; many of the people on her side of my family have big feet.* Noticing girls develop, dating girls, watching my female cousins and half-sister grow up, walking by the women's clothing and shoe sections at Wally World, it all makes me feel cheated that I was assigned the shitty sex at birth instead of the good one. And I hate what testosterone did to my body as well. I look in the mirror and see a curvy woman instead of some male husk. I'd rather have a nice set of hooters, wide hips, fat redistributed in the right places, and a hoo-ha. The dysphoria especially came rushing harder and harder following a scooter accident where I broke my wrist, chipped a couple teeth, and cut my chin. The gash needed stitches to heal, which forced me to grow a goatee for a few days. I HATED it! FUCK FACIAL HAIR, FUCK TESTOSTERONE, AND FUCK HAVING A MALE HUSK FOR A BODY!  I had a physical last month and everything turned out fine. I now want to schedule another appointment to consult with my doctor about HRT but don't know how to break it to her. I don't even know how to break it to the fam. I also have Asperger's syndrome which makes things more interesting. I already have long hair and have been tucking for about a month now, but I currently dress very butch. I want to hold off on wardrobe upgrades until I start titty skittles and laser hair removal. And even the wardrobe stuff won't be all at once. Right now, phase 1 is to start hormones and laser treatments. Phase 2, legal, tax, and financial stuff (name & sex marker change, updating my ID, Social Security card, voter registration, banking info, Smithsonian membership, etc.). I want to start that immediately after beginning HRT. Phase 3, wardrobe and social transitioning. I won't replace all my clothes at once, but over time I'll present more and more femme. Phase 4, bottom surgery. That won't be until after a few years of hormones.  *For reference, my own foot in socks is 275 mm long by 105 mm wide, giving me a Mondopoint shoe size of 275/105. To hell with Imperial shoe sizes!"

"male logos dominant penis / female eros submissive vagina  So the eight of these being interchangeable with each other seems likely enough in the vast amalgamations of people that exist especially given democracy providing for various virtue vice combinations like Plato describes but is there not a correlation at the bottom of this? Some divine split of duality forming a timeless image of craftsman and receptacle? That which has passed beyond labels like gay and straight and into the realm of the prevailing myths encoded in the genes and surfacing as the memory of a species and the memory of life itself?   life sun being shiva / death moon becoming kali Even cross sections between these eight of these and the first eight are reasonable enough to draw such as life-female giving a great mother or death-female giving a femme fatale these are archetypes sure but what is the most prior to these and how do they relate to us? What is the 'first principle' of these dualities? If it is something like the self and gender would have nothing to do with it insofar as it is ultimately neutral I can't imagine it would be much of anything noticeable at all.    Deep down there just seems to be this feeling I have that everything on one side of the / has more to do with each other and everything on right has more to do with each other and I can't tell if that's subjective perceptive bias or perhaps preconscious bias or if it's some deep collective unconscious essentiality."

I've watch shemale porn for over 10 years and over time and over multiple encounters with trans girls, I began liking and appreciate the novelity of a penis attached to a very feminine body. When I'm with a trans girl, being intimate with her and her cock is no different that me fetishizing her buttucks or breast. It's no different that me being with a cis-girl and fetishizing her big butt or big lips or whatever man. Like come on.

"You are sadly right about the amount of transphobia, but it IS plain insanity to go with a guy who doesnt know you are trans. Venus Extravaganza clearly described this and it was tragic to realise that she would do this to herself....to put herself in such a dangerous position. It isnt right to con somebody like that, and while of course it is absolutely the most immoral thing of all to murder someone , it doesnt stop lying about your gender also being wrong, although to a far lesser extent. Just as women SHOULD BE able to walk down a dark alley naked at night, we know that its a very bad idea so we dont do it. ...so trans SWs need to be honest about being trans. Being honest to yourself about being at risk is not forgiving or condoning horrendous violent attacks...Its just taking care of yourself...Plus lying is just not good. It gives fuel to the fire for one thing.  As Tyrion Lannister said '‚ÄúNever forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.‚Äù"
"As a genderfluid pansexual otaku, I can understand why trans women find it offensive however 'trap' in the anime world ALMOST NEVER refers to a trans character. It generally refers to an androgynous male or female, that often goes against gender stereotypes and occasionally shown crossdressing. Trap being used to refer to trans people in anime and media is very rare and usually the character identifies as cis. So your trans argument is kinda irrelevant for the original definition of a trap."
"*YES*"
"Ugh, stop giving me so much reason to comment on this video you ass! Is the term 'shemale' srsly considered offensive in the trans community? As a furfag, that makes me lol! 'Shemale' is just a term for one of our 7 genders! (they may have added a few more since the last time I checked). But in the furry fandom, we have the standard male and female, along with shemale (boobs and dick), cuntboy (vagina but no boobs), hermaphrodite (boobs, dick, vagina), 'male herm' (dick and vagina, but no boobs), and neuter (well, at least they can give blowjobs)!"
"While I completely sympathize with this sort of thing, is this really what the term 'trap' means? I thought it was a sexual fetish for transvestite (emphasis on transvestite, not transsexual) males who are extremely convincing. I think I heard this fetish is often involved in manga and anime.  I'm probably going to get hatred from cliche guilty straight white guy for even wondering about this, assuming anyone even sees this comment.  Also, Admiral Ackbar is sexy!"
"I really like how you was respectful on this and I agree that attraction is based on perception, but your argument completely derailed on the point about heterosexuality being gay, because the sexual act itself is different to attraction. Most men would never think 'I wish this hot woman would peg me', even on the highest level of horniness(for lack of a better word in my vocabulary) the same way you said you have no interest in penetrating other people. Even though you leftist people urge to deny it, sex is all about reproduction, and anal sex has no purpose in this, so naturally, men don't wish to do it, they want the vagina, and only consider it in a boundary breaking fascination way."

"24:20 I love (love) the idea of an incel being that aggressive: Someone who already has the odds against them to not get laid, and defining themselves by name, that they sympathize with people who have the same sorts of problems, making some kind of critical statement about a woman's features... Great job incels. Maybe now do something more proactive to boost your self-worth? Like, not referring to yourself as an incel. Because it truly sucks to feel that alone. It's not a social-issue like homophobia or racism though. Not even close."
"Trap is also slang for where people sell illegal drugs from. For instance, someone looking to pick up a sweet piece of weed or a crack rock the size of the lightbulb in your kid sister's Easy Bake Set...would be going to the trap; or the spot, for any old-timers whose vocabulary's fallen off.   So, maybe all those white men who've been fingering sensitivity as their fathers fingered sensitivity and their fathers fingered sensitivity... They're all just saying trap as slang because they wanna get 'tricked' into fucking a lady-boy before they kill the next TED speaker for a crack rock, and they only wish they had the rabbit-holes to go down the rabbit hole that is your blessedly confusing existence?   I don't know. I'm really into making fun of white people lately. It's okay: I'm part white. I don't smoke rocks with TED speakers. But that doesn't make me not white. The three other types of ethnicity handle that just fine. Those, and my utter reluctance to start smoking crack, or give a TED talk, or eat live animals for money."

"I can understand why some men, who truly believe they are pulling a cis woman, would feel deceived when finding they have pulled a trans woman. This obviously does not justify any form of physical violence or even harassment.   To rephrase the topic, as a gay 22 year old, I like to date other guys who are a little more ‚Äúcamp‚Äù for lack of a better word. I can honestly say that if I pulled someone I thought was just a camp boy and then got into bed to find it was really a slightly male looking girl, I would be furious.  Now there are two causes for this. Either it could be a total mistake and the boy girl thing was never mentioned and the girl just thought I was straight or it was clear from conversation that I was gay, that makes it deceit.   From this you can see why men may feel lied to. In my case above it would be reasonable for the girl to think I‚Äôm just straight, as statistically speaking that‚Äôs the greatest probability. However a trans woman, I don‚Äôt think, should inherently believe that the person talking to her would be ok with sleeping with a trans person. I think that would count as deceitful behaviour.   Let‚Äôs be frank, being trans is a deal breaker for many, just like a man being gay is a deal breaker for most women. If you knowingly withhold that information you will end up pissing the person your with off. But obviously no one should be harmed for doing so."

"So I have an admission as a bit of a shitlord myself, that until very recently I didn't even really connect the term 'trap' with trans women. I'm a bit on the younger side, early 20s, not so young to be a child or not sexual interested when the 'are traps gay' question took the internet by storm, but definitely young enough to not have a real understanding of the historical connotations of the term. To me 'trap' was always a term reserved for an effeminate man, who identified as man, but could be sexually desired due to their femininity (basically synonymous with twink), or cross dressing male identifying men who did it for fun, usually because they thought it was funny or it made them feel pretty. I've always assumed that this doesn't apply to trans women because there is no confusion there (unless you are a belligerent CHUD, but I don't think their confusion is anything new), they look female, they act female, they identify as female, they ARE female, there is no trap. I can see now, based on your critique, that saying 'traps are gay' can be incredibly insulting to a trans woman, but I've been operating with a different definition of trap this whole time. I've always been attracted to androgynous figures, so to me the question was more 'is being sexually attracted to twinks that dress up to look prettier, but don't identify as female, gay?' to which the answer was 'yes, and I'm ok with that, I like cute men'. I also like women that can pass for boys that still want to be identified as women. Or those that don't really identify as one or the other. So yeah, I feel like I should apologize for the use of the term 'trap', but at the same time, the more I learn about it, the less I think I have been using it in the same way as the trans community or the anti-trans community, and I think that might be true for a lot of the shitposting memelords on the internet, though that part might just be me projecting. Either way, I guess I can try to just use the term 'cross-dresser' instead, but I feel like there needs to be some term also that we can agree on that refers to visually appear one gender, but hasn't yet expressed a gender identity. I dunno, always seemed presumptuous to me to assume based purely on visual signaling (and yeah, trap ain't it, since 'woman' assumes they are female, and 'trap' assumes they are male identifying, I guess just go with woman until told otherwise if they visually display woman?). Sorry if this is rambling mostly me just wrangling with the idea that we need better terms, honestly I tend to just call people 'person' or gender neutrals anyway, though probably need to work on my local dialect tendency to use 'dude' as a gender neutral....."

"From a fan of anime: I've heard of the origin of the word referring to the conceptual design and intent of the creators to 'trap' or surprise viewers. It's a medium that pushes boundaries, which upsets some people. From an average plot that may be accused of this, there are men mistaken as women, women mistaken as men, crossdressers, and actually trans people.   Great work, I just wanted to emphasize that anime is worth watching for the representation of these kinds of characters---who much like real people have unique identities and reasons for being. This is something that shouldn't be overshadowed by how straight men feel about them."

"I'm going to be Devil's advocate here a little and say that if a trans-woman allows things to go far enough with a man that pants come off, she getting offended that she gets rejected afterwards is totally unwarranted, cause it was her own damn fault for not telling the truth upfront. That being said, that's obviously no justification for murder, given that...almost NOTHING justifies murder (and I say almost just in case of some kind of Punisher scenario where your entire family gets murdered by the same person or group of people..then you're totally morally entitled to kill that person/those people, even if the law still doesn't allow it)!!! Ok, to be really crass....I as a straight guy can be attracted to a trans-woman, but if she has...no vagina, I probably won't go through with it to the end. I'm just not that into but stuff or jerking off another penisthat isn;t mine. That doesn't make me transphobic, I reckon."

I doubt anyone will read this, and my intention is not necessarily wanting anyone to even know this random info. I just have a million thoughts running through my head after watching this and figured it would be a good place to vent lol.  Anyways.. I've generally described myself as bi. But learning more about the terminology and what not i guess I would describe myself as pansexual. Even when I was a teenager and was 90% only  attracted to women at the time, I never had a 'type'.  Short, tall. Fat skinny, any race etc.. I found myself attracted to all types of women yet still remained picky. I distinctly remember the first time I had a noticable attraction to a guy.  I was so surprised. I'd never at all thought I was in anyway gay. Despite growing up in a strict religious family I had decided at a young age that i would never let peoples opinions affect who I am and who I want to be.   I'm now in my late 20s and mostly dated women. I'm insanely obsessed with women to the point I seriously feel like I love pussy more than anybody lol. I have also gone on dates and slept with  different guys. I had one short lived relationship with a guy but never anything very serious. 90% of the time any thoughts about future relationships or sex, I'm thinking about women.    The main reason I brought all this up is because it's so interesting to me how people react when I try to explain who I am. Of course I'm not surprised how the few family members or hetero friends reacted.  They just kept asking, 'so are you gay!?' I feel like the best response is. 'Depends on the day' lol. Theyll then try to explain how it's not gay to acknowledge that someone of the same sex is attractive. I refrain from going into the sexual interactions I've had with men and just kinda give up on the whole conversation.   What really surprised me though was how every single gay guy I've dated reacted. They were shockingly the only ones who used the phrase, 'it's just phase' or told me I'm just confused... this actually really bothered me. I was so excited to spend time with someone who wasnt obsessed with being straight and thought I could finally have real conversations with someone about sexuality.    I had plenty of people acuse me of not coming out, not knowing what I am, or claiming the way I am is because I'm afraid of others opinions or how they will react. But that's wrong. I know what I am. I am very confident and comfortable being me. I'm not at all embarrassed about any of it and will never allow anything or anyone to effect the type of relationship I wish to have have someone. I never had to 'come out' but it's not like most people who know me, know that I've fucked dudes lol. I dont need everyone to know everything about me. I feel like it's something I only want to share with certain people. Especially someone I might be dating. But also with everyone reading the comments on this video I guess Haha"

"I've long been of the opinion that consuming what may by more close-minded individuals be considered 'degenerate art' should make one more tolerant of foreign preferences. Once one has delved into the depths of intimate desires and pleasures people enjoy for some time, quibbles about sexual preference more and more begin to feel like the quaint semantical hairsplitting that they ultimately are."

"So... you raised some very good points, however... there are two major issues I have with your video in it's current state.  One is a more production issue... Your lighting is more than a little distracting.  But the bigger issue is that... (gonna be frank here)... You kind of babbled. A lot, repeating the same points over and over."

"Thank you so much for making this video. <3"
"To be fair I think the first part is not okay. From my understanding and most people I would talk too, traps are not trans. there is no connection, or suppose to be no connection.   Traps are boy who consider themself as boy, but would dress like girl and act like one but they will always consider themself as boy. They don't think they are transgender or want to be transexual. Also, they would trick other people to believe they are female then make fun of the fact that they got you. Or other people would assume they are girl but they are not, Then they are angry about that fact. All sort of twist that can be add to this.   BUT the case might be different down in the USA (I'm from Canada) so I'm might be in the wrong here    anyway so because of this, this video does make a lot of sense it that way  at least for me.   By the way, love the production! (video editing, make up, decor, etc)"

"I'm a cis who follows you because you educate and make good arguments with intellectual integrity.  However this time I felt a bit disappointed that there was no reference to 'are traps deceitful'. No recommendation to be honest early enough on a date. So okay, it's probably better to first get acquainted as complete human beings before jumping into personal details.  But isn't it a stretch to wait until the partner 'reaches down'...? Obviously referring to cases where it's date, conversational, gradual (not a creepy sudden move and not some random creep on the street). In those dates, I don't feel that shocking the partner would educate him. Probably just cause him to feel disrespected and lied to. Needless to say, non of it justifies violence. But it's not education either, is it?"

"I will say for certain that I am sorry for assuming that the trap was strictly a word used for describing a crossdressing guy and not a disrespectful term for transwomen. I am a bisexual guy that has always been attracted to feminine and submissive guys and assumed that a trap was that type of guy dialed to 11. So I have been involved with hurting transwomen when I would often argue that traps are indeed gay and it is ok to be gay. I am deeply ashamed that I hurt so many folks with my ignorance, I will now pull my head from my ass and show you beautiful women the respect you deserve by keeping my mouth shut on the subject. I will also show you the respect you deserve by more publicly supporting you all, stand with you, and raise hell when folks say that you are not women.  Signed, an idiot that has been educated."

If you wanted to show 'white masculine men' the error in the word 'trap' maybe you shouldn't put them all in the same bubble... It just shows that you think of all males as terrible people even people who have never done anything wrong to a lgbt member. Giving them a immediate negative view of trans. Especially for people who don't have much exp with lgbt.  Imagine you never knew about a group of people who you know nothing about and the first thing they say to you when you finally meet them is that they act extreamly condesending towards you and call you a bunch of shit that means that you hate them.

"11:20, i disagree. since the debate goes on, it normalizes the image of transexuals, since it is an anomaly to most people, for good reasons. if anything the idea of 'trap' would be preventing murder since humor is built around the idea instead of aggression.

I know its not on the same level as the divisiveness and harm people feel when racial and sexual slurs like 'trap' are used but its at least in the same ballpark, so its a bit hypocritical for you to make statements like that.

"Trans women are not women. They‚Äôre trans women. And the similar is same for trans men. Just like racially or ethnically mixed ppl are....mixed, and not just one. However we as a society will often assign someone to be considered just one, regardless if they look the part or not, and also regardless if the person in question does not think of themselves/identity that way.  Must add just for fun tho, there are no ‚Äúraces‚Äù of humans. Purely an invention of white supremacists. But I digress...  Doesn‚Äôt matter what sex you identify as, because biologically you remain the same. This can be proven upon an autopsy of trans people. So what‚Äôs wrong with an updated sex classification system to account for trans people specifically? Why is this not a viable option? Trans ppl themselves if honest, will always admit they are indeed different from biologically born M & F. Due to life and experiences and biological differences."

I doubt you'll ever read this (or anyone for that matter), but I'm sorry for all the hardships you or any other of the LGBTQ community have had to go through.  And I'm also sorry I've made more than a few jokes in terrible taste at their expense.  You shouldn't have to feel as if you're wrong in who you are.  What you and other consenting adults do in your homes is no one else's business and you shouldn't have that be your entire identity.  You shouldn't be judged on just because you like something different from what I like.  Echo chambers aren't good for anyone.  So to all of you who have to deal with bigotry, sexism, racism, and any and everyone else whom I forgot, please know that (in the words of bennett the sage in his video girl ai review) You're ok.  You are ok.  You're not a freak, you're not worthless, and you're not hopeless.  You're much stronger than you think you and.  And nothing you ever feel can ever stop you from being happy.

"Love the nuance and basically everything. What is strange about the ‚Äòbut biology‚Äô ‚Äòbut chromosomes‚Äô arguments is that Catholicism at least, holds we are not determined by biology, since we have free will to choose God and good.

I don‚Äôt know enough about the female soul in a male body rhetoric to say anything but as a Catholic, I do think even purely within the faith it makes no sense to emphasise biology like this."

To be completely fair I did have one woman driver who refused to speak to me and rated me one star after I mentioned I was going to a Pride Festival. But hey, that's life. I worry about my trans sisters and brothers of color and how different the situations could have ended up for them. Solidarity, we all gotta look out for one another. Peace & love. -R"
"I'm a trans man and I've been on 4chan for years. I beg you, my fellow trans folk, do not shut down the 'discussion' surrounding the question posed in the title of this video. Not everyone is a philosopher, not everyone is willing to engage with feminist theory, not everyone has the attention span to read even two pages of text which are the bare minimum to 'explain' gender. But even the dumbest of dumb-dumbs can, in time, begin to see the glimpses of the constructedness of sexual orientation when they ponder over 'are traps gay'. The 'debates' over definitions of 'gayness' and masculinity, which take on very crude forms, are occasionally a sign of someone's struggle to accept their sexual preferences.  The term 'trap' is bad, as beautifully presented by Natalie - that's true. I would argue that 'futanari' is not. The latter refers to fictional characters that don't exist in real life: a person who was born with a penis and testicles that somehow produce estrogen. Futanaris have a 'female body' from birth - small frame, feminine smell, no body hair, breasts, and so on - and a penis. Intersex people exist, sure, but futanaris aren't intersex. They live in a fictional world where they are always, without any problem, socialized as girls and always act in feminine, gender-conforming ways. Always. All of them.  If you dislike 'chasers' and similar fetishists - that's ok, fully understandable. But we cannot make them disappear, we can only antagonize them and make them unwilling to listen to our concerns. There has been a shift from calling characters 'traps' to 'otokonoko' (Áî∑„ÅÆÂ®ò) which is good and should be supported. The latter means 'a boy that looks like a girl' but it's meant in a positive sense, and implies no deception. These characters are not transsexual. I repeat, they are not transsexual. Sometimes not even cross-dressing. They are fictional characters which have no real-life correspondent. Their sexuality honestly does not have to make sense.  The term 'shemale' however, which exists on porn sites with actual human actors, is horrifyingly bad as it refers to real people. At 'best' - to actors presented in the video. At worst - to most queer people.  Equating traps, otokonoko or futanari with trans women is bad on a lot of levels, and one of them is that it's just factually wrong. The first three don't exist, but some people can't tell reality from fiction. Trans people are also doing themselves a disservice by buying into this identification. Japan is, sadly, the wrong place to look for representations of LGBT people. Their culture has more than two genders (male and female), but I'm not sure if any westerners would actually want to performatively enact those alternatives in real life."

"As someone who considers themselves very much in the middle ground of most political arguments and while I don't agree with some of your points but I do see where you're coming from.  My introduction to the word 'Trap' was around art as I participate in the online art community was that of mostly just a descriptive tag and being honest it is kinda the 'aesthetic' that I feel I kinda fall into. Most of the others in my community fall into the same views I do in their view of the word 'trap' and we don't really see the whole 'transphobic' side of it as we view it as more referring to someone who doesn't consider themselves a woman but looks 'the part'.  I, and most people in the community I participate in, hold that 'context is everything' but we will try not to use words that anyone we're talking to feel uncomfortable about. That being said, your video is hilarious and I loved it."

He isn't racist and doesn't hate hewish people, he just hates unjust cunts who try and take away our freedoms like free speech online. He makes his point with comdy and by you missrepresenting what he's about you kinda proved his point.

"as a person dating a trans man, this is really important to me. i mean, i do identify as pan, so my sexual identity isnt exactly what im worried about, but the whole 'i didnt know you were into THAT kind of thing' is seriously the worst feeling ever. not because i feel invalidated, but because i feel hes been invalidated, and thats really just shitty."
"13:38 the painting there I recreated (as close as I could) for an art project at school with oil paint after cropping out the sides & top half of his body to focus on just a man standing on a rock.

"If 'are traps gay' is offensive to trans people then I guess I should get to sue every time i hear someone make a blind joke. Unfortunately for me, i have a sense of humour.  Also I find your assertion that count dankula is a simple 'hate crime convict' is quite ignorant, his situation isn't as simple as 'oh he's a rasist' because it is not  And I really really disapprove of the idea that one person is 'allowed' to talk about issues. 'I'm not a victim so I'm not allowed to talk about this' or 'I'm not a victim so i need to very carefully pick my words so that I don't come across as though I were claiming victimhood'. Issues are important and need to be discussed. But people are getting so caught up in the psychological of what words they are and aren't allowed to say, and who is and isn't allowed to feel what emotions that were diverting away from the suffering of some transgender people and more towards which races and which genders and which sexualities are allowed to claim that they are suffering. It sounds less like debating an raising awareness for true issues, and more like cute word games where you hold every word someone says against them. You said 'trap'? Well that's the equivalent of saying 'you should die'. If your claim that trans women are women because men are attracted to women doesn't make much sense because you spent ages explaining how trans women keep getting killed and assaulted. Again there are issues, but it sound a little you're addressing little things.. Like really little things... Like 'I don't like thwt word... That's basically a hate crime. If you use that word, which you've only ever associated 2ith fictional Japanese drawings of boys who were not transgendered and whom were gay, is one I've decided we all don't like and you're not allowed to do it then it means you think you're superior and hate trans women'  I think the gay community it right.how do I mean? I mean they spent their lives trying to get gay marriage legalised, not trying to get people to stop using the word 'gay' because it hurt their feelings. They took what could be considered an insult and wore it proudly to the point that it's not even really an insult anymore most people who use the insult 'you're gay' are doing it ironically. But this video makes it sound like trans people are just too weak and fragile to handle a word which, ws far as I've always known, 2as cloned to refer to a fictional Japanese style drawing of a non transgendered boy who looked like a girl, and who may or may not have been gay."

"If I ever have a trans girlfriend, the only thing I have to say to those who have a problem with it is 'If I wanted your opinion, I would give it to you.'."
"Id say traps are around 25-30% Gay Ya cant have sex with them if your 100% straight but if your around 70-75% bisexual then its free game   But if you start touchin or interacting with the dick then it jumps 60% gay and thats a no go for most straght men but if your 40% straght than its fine And if their dong goes in your but and not in yours in theirs than its 100% gay  Also in my mind trans women and traps are not even related in this context in referring to the more anime version of trap were in it is a man he identifies as a boy but he acts looks and sounds like a girl for whatever reason  Trans women do not fit this definition  that i use the word for So i wouldnt use it to reference one not ever"
"Right about 19:00 is super important. That right there is why it is inherently transphobic to make a blanket statement of ‚Äú I wouldn‚Äôt want to be with a trans person‚Äù. It is absolutely not transphobic to not want to be with a specific trans person for nearly any reason, because if you‚Äôre not attracted to someone, you‚Äôre just not attracted, and nobody can fault you for that. But if you wouldn‚Äôt know someone was trans without being told, then what makes you suddenly change your mind about being attracted to them?"
"9:55 why does this sound like a double standard. You're a white trans and not a black trans so you shouldn't speak on the issues of black men murdering them on the streets for their unfounded fear of their masculinity being harmed.  You're trans not a white male so shouldn't you not have the authority to speak on the issue of white males? I'm I understanding you correctly?   Apart from that here's my take on trans (and yes I'm doing this despite not being trans, suck it). It's gay until it's post-op, then it's cis. Does that matter? no. Oh, since  everybody is bringing up their political ideology, I'm old school communist and anarchist and I'm still don't really get why these social issues matter, like you said calling people traps isn't getting people killed in the streets."
"Can somebody post the link for the Jasmine Masters video referenced at timestamp 21:37?  I'm not familiar with the vid and I'm kinda intrigued."
"'Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding.'    So true, and it's why dialog is so important. If we approach conversations like there is a honest misunderstanding or disagreement, then we have a better chance of clearing it up. And, in order to do that I think we have to start from the place of, 'they believe this for a reason... let me talk to them to try and understand it.' In my experience when you talk to people the nuance of their position is often more relevant than the strawman you built of them lead you to think.   It seems to me like people too often skip the understanding step and go strait to the arguing step. Just to be clear, I also mean to say, thinking you understand what someone is saying, but not making sure you've go it right, is still skipping the understanding step. Not allowing them to clarify is skipping the step. Not accepting their clarification and instead replacing it with your characterization of them is also skipping the step.    To avoid skipping the step, try restating what you think their position is (preferably in a non-condescending or derogatory way) and asking them honestly if you are understood their position correctly - before you move on. There may still be disagreement, but at least you'll have a honest starting point to work from."
"Male sexuality is inherently hierarchical,  Cis straight dom males are all bigots in the bedroom. They should be invited into oppression experiences in order save the rest of us, its just pragmatic.

"Okay, I think I've figured it out! Clearly there's a massive global conspiracy involving every female on the planet, who are currently trying to seduce as many heterosexual men as possible, so that they can all simultaneously undergo a gender transformation at some predetermined time in the future, thereby rendering every man on the planet retroactively gay.  <OVERT SARCASM ENDS HERE>  For real, I never really understood the titular question. Like, 'I'm a heterosexual man, but there was this one time that I was attracted to a trans woman, so now I have no choice but to consider myself homosexual'? It seems crazy that masculinity can be seen as so fragile that a single instance of perceived non-heterosexuality can invalidate a lifetime of experience to the contrary."
"Bruuuh. So idfk how i got here but that was the scariest intro I've ever seen"
"Wow... I'm sorry there are so many fucked up bigots out there. I really don't get why people give a shit, something is visually appealing because, well it's visually appealing... so i think your attractive, why? Because you have all the traits that i am attracted to... the traits of a women. I guess that means i'm attracted to female traits and not male traits.  Hmmm.. i guess that makes me..... Gay??? In what universe does that make sense?   But at the end of the day the whole argument seems kinda stupid... you are attracted to whatever you're attracted to, just don't force yourself on someone who isn't attracted back, after that who the #$%^ cares!    And on that note,  I don't think anyone is trying to stifle free speech as long as the words used aren't being used as  in a cruel callous and hurtful way. Words are just words, until they are used as weapons. AND... last point... I don't think the spirit of the protection of free speech was about protecting the ability to make fun of people, It's about protecting your right to dissent."
"All of Natalie's videos are quality videos, but this one in particular struck a chord with me (and, judging by the comments, with many other cis het white men too). I haven't given much consideration to the question 'What if I decide to date a trans women?' until now, mostly because I rarely meet trans people. Yet if I were to meet a woman I liked, she liked me, and she later revealed she has XY chromosomes and male genitalia...   I haven't had much experience dating women, period. A lot of my struggle comes from fears of asking people out, coming on too strongly (or not enough), finding out they're already in a relationship, finding out they don't want a relationship, not having the time to spend with each other, potential mental health issues or emotional baggage that I/she would have to deal with, conflicting social relationships ('Prove to me you're the right man for my daughter' - her father), conflicting personalities, finding out they're not really sexually attracted to me, finding out they still have feelings for someone else---   I imagine if we're on the bed together, making out, the last few dates go well, we have similar interests and goals in life, and as everything feels right, when the pants come off and there's no penetrable hole to be found.............why the fuck would I bail out then? If the feel of a vagina is all that's required for ideal sex, wouldn't a fleshlight be enough? (And real vaginas can't vibrate)  There is so, *so* much fucking more to worry about when it comes to partners. Homosexual definitions with the complexity of legal code should not be among them."

"Personally, as a passable crossdresser rather confident I don't feel a need to change my body, only caring about the clothes, and thus don't qualify as trans, I enjoy the term trap when applied to myself. I do certainly understand the anger that gets directed at the term, especially when directed at people who aren't looking feminine with any desire to fool people, but rather to appear as their true self, but I do also hope that the term trap sticks around without the hostility."

"Preempt: This is a long babbling comment of me expressing my opinions of this video. From what Ive seen with online discussions, its quite common to see someone who really does agree with in general, but disagrees with you on small points as on _the other side_, I encourage the maybe one other person who reads this to read this  comment as from the perspective of someone who does not dislike trans people, generally thinks of themselves as somewhat socially left, and agrees with the viewpoint that offense without reason is unnecessary and crude. (Because I do babble, particularly on controversial subjects in an attempt to try to be specific enough that Im not misunderstood or seen as having a hostile attitude, I want to point out I say I dont dislike, not because I have a lower opinion of trans people than  any other group based on age, sex, race, but because I feel I dont like or dislike anyone based on those criteria as they should be considered neutral)."

"My criticisms/thoughts about this video:"
""
"-At the beginning, the part before the main video starts, she talks about the (and I agree by the way),  _poor_ (to say the least) justification of killing someone over being _trapped_, but neglects to address what I think is a common and arguably valid opinion that people should be upfront about it. Simply saying it doesn't happen very often, I feel, sidesteps it and seems to fail to attempt to understand _the other side_ and what opinions they have that may hold legitimacy. While of course I want to be clear in saying these are not equivalent issues, im simply stating that I feel one was dismissed somewhat thoughtlessly."
""
"Im not hard in this belief myself, as when you look deeper into the line of reasoning its easy to ask, why? Why should they tell you. Im not sure, and I can think of many points either way. Im still undecided on whether or not its a justified feeling."
""
"-Im fairly uncomfortable with the idea of criticizing any _masculinity_ particularly race based masculinity. I think its entirely too easy to end up stereotyping people, trapping them in boxes they dont deserve to be in. Just as a btw here, no, I am not a while male, I just dont like stereotyping in general, and even if I were a white male I dont think that should make the stating of that opinion invalid"

I'm not trans but I played a game called Second Life so I know that feeling where YOU are trying to build YOUR body in a way so that YOU feel comfortable having sex, and then everyone else makes it their problem because of pride, politics or competition. Most trans people I knew were pretty quiet and creative. They are not out there trying to cause problems with people, there is no reason they should be getting killed or ostracized. Although seeing that one at GameStop with the pink tennis shoes did make me cringe a little, just like when I see loud black women lose it in WalMart."

"I think the real points would have to start from what is a woman and what is a man. You're basically forcing your new understanding of women as defacto for us that merge both metaphysical and the physical concepts together into what we have now, a unified concept, a woman and respectively a man.  I'm not sure at what point it became questionable whether those two realms actually intersect but I am very much interested on what grounds that question was formulated. There is a lack of sincerity in your approach (your = transgender) when in fact you're opposed to the old term on principle and just can't wait to jump on the new boat. Argumentation comes after the decision of jumping was made. Which is why, your whole prerogative is, even if a possibility, simply bullshit."

"I also find it highly amusing that your entire argument is that the word 'trap' has deeper connotations that are highly offensive and as such should not be used, but then you go on to use the word 'trigger' multiple times.  Do you know what the word 'trigger' actually means? If you genuinely believe the things you're speaking, you should stop using this word. You are not 'triggered' when you hear the word trap. No trans person, unless they suffer from PTSD related to being identified as a 'trap', is triggered when they hear the word 'trap'.  If you find this comment ridiculous or easy to ignore, then you've seen your own video through the eyes of the people who disagree with it."

Thus, you can‚Äôt be a fully straight male if you‚Äôre fucking a woman with male genitalia.  Sex: male or female; cannot be change Gender: man or woman, a preferred pronoun; can be changed  Sexual preference is a spectrum, those ‚Äústraight men‚Äù that you‚Äôve been with are bi-curious.   You are NOT born gay, straight, lesbian, etc. Its all a preference, many are curious and those preferences may change"

"I think the problem with 'traps' is that they're a caricature in the context they first appeared (anime), and not necessarily the same thing as the actual people who are trans. Typically the 'trap' (for example a male who looks female), has no intention of being female, and their feminine traits are either some facet of their personality, or some huge misunderstanding. This generally isn't to represent any serious trans/cross-dressing character, but rather exists purely for the purpose of some eventual reveal which is intended to be comedic and silly and probably to embarrass the protagonist. I think in that context the slur is fitting because the intent in these cases IS to be deceptive and dishonest, but it's going to be misused on what I would imagine would be the vast majority of real trans/cross-dressing people.   tl;dr - people can't separate cartoons from reality and think real people are cheeky anime characters out to embarrass them."
"I honestly wish i would have seen this video about 2 years ago when i started doing scenes with trans girls. After doing it for a few years now, i realize that trans performers in porn are *sometimes* kind of forced by proxy to fuck us cis girls with their dicks, and that it‚Äôs a struggle. I personally identify more with *wearing* a cock and taking on the masculine role when I‚Äôm with any woman, and it even makes me kind of uncomfortable to be fucked (or attempted to be fucked) with a trans cock, because oftentimes because of hormones and any other possible issue, it just doesn‚Äôt...work! And it kind of bothers me that THAT is the fetishization OF the female cock, that for this scene, she MUST fuck me with her cock, when I‚Äôm sure we would BOTH rather that i fuck her with MY cock (however plastic/silicone/rubber it might be). This is even from progressive studios just attempting to be more inclusive...which i DO appreciate, but i think it‚Äôs proof we have a long way to go still.  Obviously. üíú"

"I've always been under the impression that, originally, 'Are traps gay' was a retarded, cringy phrase used and abused by some 4chan trolls, only meant to shock and trigger, which is the raison d'√™tre of trolls.

"I went to school in Cincinnati, dated a women from Cincinnati, no lie I wish someone had said 'oh I didn't know you were into that sort of thing' cause she was, 3/10 as a person"
"As someone who identifies as a straight man I do disagree on a few points.  Like... first i guess i should say I'm not sure I count as straight under your definition there...  If someone has a vagina theres a potential for me to be attracted to them.  I'm not interested in penises...penisi...;peni?  I don't like my own, I don't like those of others, they just...meh.  They don't do it for me... theyre ugly to me and actually turn me off,  so what am I?  If i could be attracted to someone who has a Vagina but identifies as a man does that make me gay?  Bi?   I don't believe myself to be gay, but in my mind the male body, penis included, isn't interesting.  Tomboys however, women who identify as women but act more man-like...that IS attractive way way more than girly girls.  It's not for lack of trying either, ive got a hard time having a 3way with another guy in the room cuz another dick comes out and mine goes away on its own.  It's all very confusing...  I guess another point that I can't get past is the inability to give birth.  I really do want to have my own biological kids one day and its somewhat of a dealbreaker for me to have a longterm relationship with someone who can't.  I'd have no problem having fun, having sex, even if that vaj wasn't made at birth, been there done that, but we were just having a good time and not looking for something more permanent.   I couldn't see myself trying for more than just a few nights of fun, and fortunately she was only looking for that too so no feelings were hurt just good times for all.  Thus the conclusion i always came to in those kind of arguments was 'if you like penis, you're probably Bi. IF you ONLY like penis, youre definitely gay.  totally cool if you are, do your thing, but don't deny who you are'    I feel like I'll probably get crucified for this, and I do want people to at least know that I couldn't give a shit less what people do with their naughty bits as long as they arent hurting anyone (without a safeword ;) ) nor who they're doing it with because it doesn't have any bearing on my life."

I'm seeing this as satire and comedy and its great but I think you treat Count Dankula unfairly. I fully appreciate the irony of defending a shitposter from a shitposter on the basis of fairness but the man has been destroyed by unjust legislation that violated his basic human rights.

"This is not a comment about this specific video necessarily but about transgenderism in society in general:   I'm genuinely confused about some things mentioned in this and other contrapoints' videos, so if anyone cares to engage...   So let's say I concede that there are two aspects to which we refer to with masculine and feminine language - the biological, chromosomal, genital aspect, we're born with, to which we refer to as 'sex', and the behavioural, socially constructed (altho it's not solely socially constructed let's say it is for the sake of argument) and learned, performative aspect to which we refer to as 'gender'.   1) If gender is learned behaviour and a social construct and not an innate set of sex dependent characteristics, how come transgender people feel like there is one gender inherent to them at all? Wether or not in accordance to their sex, how's it not just a matter of choice, preference for a set of artificial norms? How can it be non biological, non spiritual and yet still inherent, part of one's self? How can a man realise he's a woman, before having adopted and embodied the 'womanhood performance'? Wouldn't that be a man with a preference for a feminine performance rather than a 'woman in a man's body'? It seems to me both contradictory essentialist and non essentialist.   2) To statements like 'a trans woman is a real woman' couldn't we say that that's you referring to your preference for a feminine gender role but maybe is of no relevance to others? If people seem to care more about sex, about genetic information, rather than the socially constructed gender, shouldn't they be in their right to refer to you in reference to your sex? Let's say a person is deeply unpatriotic and feels rather like they're a 'citizen of the world'. They don't like to think of themselves as defined by the place where they happen to be born, maybe they don't even like it for some reason and they'd prefer to think of themselves as being part of an undivided humanity. Citizen of the world they are... to themselves! Couldn't I, who don't care about such things, still refer to the person as Portuguese, let's say, since what I really care about is where they were born, what language they speak, who collects their taxes, etc? And who are they to tell me that I must not conceive of them in such lens? Let's say you culturally identify with the set of aesthetics, behaviours, mannerisms, values, all of those stereotypical social constructs we associate with, let's say, Chinese culture. Am I under a moral obligation of caring more about how you feel about that matter than about how I, and most people, conceive of nationality, culture, etc? Must I think of you and refer to you as if you were a Chinese person altho that's only true in a set of parameters I don't have to care about (your self identification with the social constructs associated with a given nationality, in this case). This is not supposed to be Ad Absurdum! I'm just trying to illustrate an example of an identity trait that can be conceived as a set of social constructs, but that not everyone thinks of it that way and, it seems to me, has no reason to be forced to think of that way.   3) Since 'man' and 'woman' meant 'people with prostate' and 'people who menstruate' for a lot longer than it meant 'people who identify with X set of geographical, temporal and cultural dependent social constructs often associated with, but not necessarily tied to, having either a prostate or menstruating', why the insistence on referring to gender with those words ('man' and 'woman') and referring to sex with 'people with prostate/penis' and 'people who menstruate/with vagina'?? Can't 'man' and 'woman' keep their meaning in relation to sex and those of you who care about gender, as it being detached from sex, chose terms to refer it? Wouldn't it be much easier for everyone if we could stop debating wether people with penis can be women, when the problem is evidently that people on both sides are using 'women' to refer to different things (one being sex, the other being gender)?? Why do you insist on calling a person who identifies with a certain set of socially constructed traits a man or a woman if you don't believe these traits are inherent to the sex?? Why use the same word to refer to two things you specifically want to separate??   I don't know if this is clear at all, it's probably badly structured and badly written, but if you pulled through, any thoughts??"

"I'm here too to challenge my incorrect worldviews. I never would have discriminated against or bullied a trans person but I also never considered in what ways they might be hurt, so this video educated me on that.  I do have some disagreements though. One argument is that if e.g. a man is attracted to a trans woman because of her appearance, it doesn't matter what her chromosomes are because the man cannot sense the chromosomes anyway, so they can make a normal man-and-woman couple because sexuality and attraction is in our minds, so the chromosomes don't matter.  I disagree because it's not just in our minds - evolution designed humans to be interested in other humans who are able to create babies with them. The process of attraction in our brains is there because of reproduction, it is a consequence of the need to reproduce. It is nature's way of convincing creatures to mate. So in a way, a male-to-female trans person is 'tricking' biology and 'fooling' the mans' brain into thinking that the man will get a partner which is able to make and bring up babies with him.  I quoted trick and fool because I don't want to make it sound like trans people are intentionally doing something bad.  Related to the main question: I don't think that dating a trans woman makes a man gay because the man is still attracted to women, and is dating the trans woman because he wants a woman. But I think there's more to it than just 'is it gay', for the reasons I explained - it's about finding a partner to reproduce with.  Now in the modern world we do have adoption and donations of sperm and eggs, so anyone can have children. Based on this, one might argue that the need for reproduction is satisfied, chromosomes don't matter and a trans woman can do everything that a women can do, including having babies with men.  The argument to that is that natural reproduction can still be a preference just like appearance or personality - a man can see value in having a baby with a woman where she is impregnated naturally and gives natural birth.  But these days lots of women are infertile and men still date them and are willing to use donated sperm/eggs and implant them to get a baby - men who at the same time would not do this with a trans woman. So are those men bigoted? Are they wrong for not wanting to be with a trans woman just because she is trans? The only difference at this point really are the chromosomes, everything else is there. Looks, behavior, femininity, reproduction.  I was having a hard time thinking about this because there are many good arguments and it's such a sensitive topic so I didn't want to let myself think one way just because 'it feels wrong' without arguments. And honestly, I don't have a good argument against the last point. I don't know if I would say 'trans women are women' because the chromosomes are still different - but also everything that really matters is there and does make a trans woman a woman. I would conclude and leave with the idea that trans women are effectively women - they can look, behave and bring up babies like women - but they are not women biologically. They do have different chromosomes and cannot give birth to a baby naturally. I suppose with that I also think that women who cannot be naturally impregnated and cannot give natural birth - are ever so slightly less of a woman. This applies to men too.  One could argue that what defines a 'man' or 'woman' is their role in society and not their biology, and if all the social roles can be satisfied then that person is a male/female. But I don't think that it's determined only by society and how others perceive the person. Sure, we could live in a world where biology doesn't matter and everyone only cares about sex and personality - but in the real physical world, there does exist a distinct characteristic of biological women, which we could ignore saying 'it doesn't matter because it's replaceable' - it's still there. That's how nature works; we may have replaced the role of nature in human civilization, but it's still there and shouldn't be forgotten.  There's more, it's debatable whether being trans is a result of a mental illness which carries other side effects - so being trans in itself isn't bad, but it may come with other effects on the person which could be harmful to relationships or dangerous for raising children.  But I already wrote too much. Hopefully I get some responses so I can better shape my ideas about all this."
"Before this, I was in denial that 'trap' implied deception, so much so that the thought never crossed my mind. I thought that the anime community was better than that. I didn't know how it came about; the best theory was that it was a mispelling that caught on. But I refused to believe it came about from a place of transphobia."
"This, is Western Civilization, the classiness you find in museums, the music, art, powdered wigs, extolled virtues, reformation (and ever reforming views of the nature of man).

This is the kind I watched that caused quiet reverence in all who listened and viewed their works. Not the sleazy, dismissive, navel gazing, untalented shit lords taking credit for Individuals they‚Äôre not even related to, who use code to transmit hate crimes through tainting the art found in memes and using them strictly as a utility.

That conviction was on a video that was obviously a joke turning his girlfriend's dog into 'the least cute thing I can think of'.  Both sides take stuff out of context but on the left it almost seems exclusively in order to make someone look like a hatefull and awful person. We don't need this."
"Thank you for answering the question that had troubled me for years. I am NOT transphobic for not being attracted to transwomen. I guess my sexuality is quite specific and narrow that if it's not a vagina (biological female vagina from birth,) then won't do anything to me. Never watched a porn involving transwomen. I guess that alone says much about my sexuality."

"OK. Imma watch the rest of this BUT.. for someone who s so interested in nuances and context... to say that Count Dankula commited a hatecime ... geee.. you're basically throwing your rationality down the crapper with that statement.. you should apologize."
"Yes traps are gay. It's a man dressed as woman with a dick. It's as simple as that. Count dankula does not promote hate speech. The fact that you feel that way means you are part of the problem. I hope you can accept who you are and find peace with that. I do."
"This is why I think gay/straight is no longer useful. Something like 'gynophile' and 'androphile' would be more meaningful."

"It‚Äôs time for a Hegelian dialectical discussion.  I agree with you and with Shapiro. Actually your video got suggested after a count dankula video, so thank the almighty algorithm to throw your video in the same bucket.  So one side(SJW) views sex as just the action that is performed for ones or for someone‚Äôs pleasure. While on the opposing side (Conservatives) sex is viewed as the biological role in a reproductive Kontext. So both sides are partially wrong and right.   Let me explain.  Those organs that we can use for reproductive purposes also can be used in many messed up ways for pleasure. So the entire debate is futile. So a gay man can have children with a lesbian woman as long both are fertile. Equally goes for a fertile trans(initially mail) and a fertile trans(initially female). Sadly cloning is illegal otherwise I would not even bother interacting with anyone.   Because finally, in the end, all that matters is being a good dad/mom. Doesn‚Äôt fucking mater if you are Cis, Fluid or some other variation of Fetishes, because that‚Äôs all they are. Just Fetishes. And if your fetish is getting you killed than at least do some preventative precautions and maybe state that you have that Fetish / identify(pretend) as a woman. Just to avoid any unwanted surprises for both parties.  I‚Äôm open for discussion."

"It's ridiculous how hard it's been for me to get a properly explained transperson's perspective on this, but my recommended's section is now having an existential crisis trying to figure out if I'm left or right. What about open? Can I be in that category? I don't care about the opinion so much as I can get a proper explanation for it, but apparently I can't have that. I don't think anyone who don't already have that opinion buys into the argument of the feminine penis, but I also don't care: that's between you and the person in the bedroom - and I shouldn't have to be convinced it's (not) gay for me to treat you with decency."
"On the origins of the term traps I first encountered the term in 1992 at school when downloading porn on BBS services.  The porn pictures used to load from the top down on slow modems... so if the pic had the [trap] title tag it meant the women had a large man hood. Because it would take 20-30 seconds to load down to that part of the photo it was a warning.  The star wars reference was part of the culture."

"If a man is going to assault or kill a woman over her being trans, he is no man that belongs in our world to begin with. Violence and murder are immature, amorale, and should never be sympathized with. If a man is willing to assault or kill someone over being trans, he is clearly willing to do that to anyone else, too. He belongs in prison forever, or to take the death penalty."
"It is the absolutely craziest shit to see people‚Äôs whos mind actually CHANGED in the comments. It usually feels like it‚Äôs completely pointless to try to change people‚Äôs opinions, so this kind of thing gives me a lot of hope"
"I find your video essays to be very thorough and informative and I strongly respect your willingness to dig deep into touchy subjects and really explore various arguments and lines of thought. That said, I would also like to thank you in particular for making this video, I genuinely learned more than a few things that I likely would not have come across on my own as a cis man or even thought to look up."
"If a guy is into a trans woman, no. If a guy is into a biologically male crossdresser, yes, they're bi. I've even seen a few anime/manga where their sex is revealed almost as soon as you meet them, so anyone who's interested obviously wouldn't be misgendering the crossdresser/be trapped (right?).  If a guy is using erotica of a crossdresser, no, unless he's imagining sex with them (which is how most males use erotica, I hear). Arousal and desire for partnered sexual activity are two different things, no matter how commonly they're felt together."

"I was enjoying this already in a half-brained, otherwise-occupied sort of way, but when Lady Foppington showed up and the Schubert piano trio theme came on, I made an audible weird noise and had to pause the video so that I can watch it sometime when I can really enjoy it fully. I don't think I've ever done that for a Youtube video before.   I think I would love anything ContraPoints did anyway (so clever! so talented! so outrageously good-looking!), but Zo√´ Blade puts it over the top every time with her absolutely magnificent sense of timing."
">Middle-class white transwomen don't get murdered, they don't have a say on this topic  Russia? Chechnya? Pretty much most of the ex-USSR?

I don't really mind, it is your opinion, but flatly denying white victims of transphobia is kind of racist."

"What if a person is specifically attracted or let's say is preferably more attracted to a femine looking transgender with the male genitals? If you prefer that over a regular woman isn't that kind of halfway gay even though you would never make out with a man? I don't imply that anyone feeling that way should be ashamed, I'm just saying.  Enjoyed your video btw"
"I used to consider myself a trap as a positive term for crossdresser, cus how I saw it in anime the characters always consider themselves male with rare exception. I told someone online I was a trap then he said no ur not trans... I didn't say I was. Before that I had never heard of trap being used towards trans girls"
"Hey, may God bless you and keep you. This was fucking amazing.  If you're reading this and you're a straight person wondering about trans people, hello I hope you're doing well. If you've 'accidentally' slept with a trans person (not mocking you, just saying that the idea you may have had is that it was by accident), it's ok. You're not suddenly a big fat homo. You're not automatically going to hell. You're not any less male or female for that. You're doing ok. You're still you. If you're Christian like me, ask God for forgiveness for having sex outside of marriage, and don't put the blame on the trans person, because while sex outside of marraige isn't the best thing in the world, they aren't the only ones at 'fault' here.  You are fine. And the trans people that speckle the world are fine too. I hope you have a good semi-relaxed day tomorrow."
"Kissing a straight woman is actually more gay than kissing a straight guy if you are a guy, and here's why. That woman has probably kissed many guys, and might have even sucked a dick or two. By kissing her, you are absorbing that energy from her mouth. Same if you eat her pussy (this must be avoided at all costs) since maybe dicks have actually been in there--gay dicks, in fact, if you apply the logic that everyone who's kissed her is gay. Meanwhile, if you kiss or blow a straight guy, you are getting tons of girl energy, even pussy energy, magnifying your straightness. Again, gay girl energy in fact, because if she kissed a straight guy than she kissed a girl (again, bonus straight points for you from sucking your male friend's dick.)"

"About a year and a half ago a gender-fluid (I know that's not the same as trans) teenager was killed in my state as a result of 'trans panic'. And you might guess that the victim was a person of color--you'd be right. A great injustice is that there was prolonged argument over if it was a hate crime. I know that violence over gender identity wasn't the main point of your video, but anyway, I wanted to say thank you for bringing it to people's attention who might not be aware how disturbingly often it occurs. I guess that as a cis-het man I have some separation from these issues, but I think that too many people like me use that separation to not care... or side with those who harm others in the worst case. It should be up to everyone to protect the most vulnerable, and not to blame them if they become victims of hate."
"Thank you for this video. Thank you for explaining this. I, unfortunately, ended up offending a now former friend of mine by asking this question, and I hadn‚Äôt understood why, despite coming from a very liberal background. I fucked up pretty bad.

"these are pretty good arguments, and I can definitely follow along, but near the end, sucking a dude's dick is pretty gay. Sure, nothing wrong with it, sure, it's okay, but I don't care what anyone says, there's no convincing me that sucking the dick of a person who identifies as a man in any context (besides having a gun held to your head) is NOT gay. Does that make the man who identifies as straight gay? I'm not entirely sure myself, maybe not since you make a damn good argument. But make no mistake, what theoretical man did was hella gay."
"Thought I'd point something out that might interest you...  In Babylon 5, a central character transitions from being purely alien (minbari) to being a hybrid of human and minbari via... space magic... though it was apparently a time consuming and dangerous process. The character, Delenn, was played by a woman and always remained a woman throughout...  BUT originally, the show's creator wanted to include a trans positive message by having Delenn start out as a man. Either by hiring a different actor for the first season or using makeup and voice editing to deepen the actress's voice...  But of course, being the 90s... the network slammed the brakes on that idea.  Which is a shame because even without the overt transness there... Delenn still goes through a lot of trans like struggles... like adjusting to having hair... dealing with people being more attracted to her now... dealing with her home society seeing her as lesser now..  Hell, there was entire episode dedicated to her metaphorical minbari family interrogating her very personhood under the pretense of it being for her benefit.  But best of all, that is only one aspect of her character... throughout the show we see her be awesome in combat when she needs to be, incredibly compassionate,  and more than willing to put everything she values on the line to do the right thing... very often at the cost of her very influential political career. Yet she still ends up doing amazing things and leaves an incredible legacy...  basically helping to found a space UN (but more effective) ...  And reading her story as if the trans element were still there anyway... just makes it more awesome."

"Traps aren't transexuals in anime, they are just femmenine looking men.  When you draw a woman there are anatomical differences that are unavoidable. What happens in anime is that the author will draw a woman and write the character as a man (or viceversa). All of the above does not include sexual Orientation or identity of the character. So if you are a straight male and you like a 'trap' that doesn't make you gay or straight, that makes you someone who liked a drawing. Taking things to real life from fiction that's what's wrong either if it's to get offended or to like something (or someone). This meme is just irony, stop getting offended by everything and focus on real problems, like global warming or something..."

Only if you knew beforehand, if you thought it was a girl then no you are not gay.  But I like traps and am a happily married man. I don't consider myself gay.  [Edit] No, trans women are not biological women. Get over it. Given time and a better understanding of neurology, we will have definitive evidence of a mutation in the brain causing this (illness? If you get mad over that term, get over that too)."

Because you can't handle being normal, it's sad, I pity you. Being Gay is a choice, btw, everything is a social construct after all, and so is being gay.

"Love your videos so far. You're costumes are also really cool. Also hi I'm bi and can confirm that traps are not gay because they are girls because they itentify as girls it's not gay. Also even if it was gay then more for me."

"Male and female have sociological weight. If someone interacts with me as if they were female, they are female. All females are imperfect attempts at the perfect form of 'femaleness.' What is 'female' is simply that which, in its existence, or enactment of its will, attempts to replicate said perfect form, whether naturally or synthetically. Therefore, trans women are ultimately just as valid as cis women. Traps are only gay if the attraction to said traps is, in its existence, an attempted replication of what you consider the perfect form of 'gayness.' Forms are subjectively formed as a synthesis of individual and collective views on what constitutes something. If a transwoman can be seen, in their very existence, as an attempt at the replication of the synthesis of what you envision a female is and how you might potentially interact with that vision inside of society, then they are female."

"It's gay if it feels gay. It's a socially constructed, evolving phenomenon. There is no objective reality to it. Homosexuality is not Gay; Gay is Gay.   I think people on both sides are being too complicated with this."
"sucking a female penis is pretty gay if youre a girl though"
"Was rewatching this, and I guess I was pretty tired, 'cos I suddenly woke up three hours later after weird dreams (including that one weird Scandinavian guy you've mentioned in old videos) and with no memory of having fallen asleep. So, I guess when people comment that you have a soothing voice - you should DEFINITELY take those comments seriously! /awkward laughter"
"I realized a long time ago that I'm too into women to be so hypocritical as to pretend to be disgusted by trans-women. I'm pretty sure anime traps are still gay though, because the way I see it, a penis is inherently masculine. Maybe liking penises by itself is not inherently gay enough to actually be called gay, but it's on the spectrum there somewhere. Maybe liking a female penis  is only 1/6 or 2/6 as gay as liking a straight man's penis. Maybe there's a gayness spectrum for actions too. Maybe being gay isn't black or white.  Maybe you have to cross the right shade of gay, I mean gray, for something to be called gay."
"This is my new fav channel"
"Girls, science is on your side. If trans women look and act like 'biological' women. I will go on a date with them. My male brain is conditioned to the female body, voice and movement there is noting more to it than that."
"I can't listen to the damn credits song and this upsets me."
"The two big points about this subject are: 1. Whether you accept that trans women are women or not. 2. Whether you think there's something wrong with being gay or not. All else is details and distractions, like Contra's heavy metal style eye shadow... ( <3 )"
"Why would you give a shit what trans people think is offensive? I'm not joking about shot to you I'm joking to my friends. If you're offended mind your own goddamn business"
"Yes?"
"Hi Natalie. I always seem to learn so much from your videos. I enjoyed this video and it has opened my eyes to how problematic the term 'trap' is. I never made the connection to straight men feeling deceived by their partner and threatening physical harm.  I feel like you glossed over the fact that some men simply aren't attracted to penis, feminine or not. You mentioned it once and moved on, but I feel like that viewpoint deserves at least a little more recognition since it's really just a matter of personal preference. As long as they aren't causing harm, people should be able to freely express what they like and don't like.  Do you feel that trans porn contributes to the dehumanization and stigma that trans women are hyper sexual? There seems to be a groundswell of conservatives that believe that just because a trans woman goes into the women's bathroom that a full-fledged orgy is going to break out.  Forgive me if this is an ignorant question, but what is the etiquette for telling a potential romantic partner that you are trans? I realize that it's probably openly stated on Tinder, but what about an organic conversation at a bar or party that starts to get flirtatious? Again, sorry for my ignorance, I was raised very conservative and am working to open my mind and understand others' view points.  On another note, I'm really looking forward to purchasing your 'How to Tuck Your Penis' instructional book. Jordan Peterson is the perfect choice for a forward. Will he have a 12 step guide in it?"
"I love you!!!"
"I'd like to frame the argument that a straight man's anxiety  when dealing with an attraction to a trans woman could be viewed from the position of privilege.  A straight, cis man (especially white) has a pretty comfortable position of privilege. Even if he is an LGBTQ ally, his less evolved fellow cishet men still consider him 'one of them.'  But, if he has a relationship with a trans woman, he's opening himself up to a loss of privilege, where he will now be 'perceived' as 'gay' by others, and this threatens a loss of the privileged position.   Fear of losing one's privilege is a powerful and insidious motivator, consciously acknowledged or otherwise.  I Don't pose this thought to at all suggest that he should be pitied, or that he should feel that is an adequate excuse to act like a weak piece of shit. The threat to his privilege is a pale, pathetic threat compared to the tangible fear of violence, and active hatred trans people experience."
"I love how well thought out and phrased your arguments are! This is the video I'll be pointing people towards if anything of the sort ever comes up in conversation."
"My migraine was killing me and I had been watching all of ur videos for the past Idk how many hours and it‚Äôs been soothing!

"'You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country, just to get a cunt' Actually laughed out loud alone in my room under my blanket at night at that."
"Honestly, wasn't ready for this video. Nowhere else is someone so open about all this stuff. This video actually answered a lot of questions I didn't know where nagging in the back of my head, so thanks for that! I never watched drag shows or the like because I thought it was 'too much', so I also kind of never truly tried to understand it. You have made me more tolerant and understanding, even though I thought I was before. Great video!"
"So spot on.  As a transwoman (my preferred name is Natalia Pilar Stellabotte) I get all sorts of comments (a lot of them not very nice) when I go back home to my hometown in Pennsylvania, where the attitude toward the LGBT+ community is not often friendly (think of the South in the 1950s), and when I do shopping in Towson and Hunt Valley I get looks.  I just laugh to myself and keep going.  I started my transition about six months ago, so I'm not really passable not that that is the goal.  But if I can appear to be half the woman you have become I would consider that a success.  If I could finish this comment with three words they'd be:  Halleujah and amen!!!!!"

"Nothing wrong with punching a dude."
"honestly after thinking about it for a while i just realized that i probably would date a trans woman and that i don't mind the dick, i'm just not into buttholes (on anybody) , so i learned something about myself even if it means that in practice it doesn't really change much.   for what it's worth i was already inclined to say that sexuality is a weird vague cloud of oftentimes conflicting desires and not a binary or even a spectrum and that (for most people) labels are just a convenience and shouldn't be used as dogma. i think for a lot of people thinking critically about themselves seems like some kinda 'guilt' thing or whatever the hell, but you do a really good job of taking these things and putting them into words that don't assume people are already thinking about themselves less in terms of concrete dogmatic labels.   like earlier i was watching a riley j. dennis video about discriminatory preferences, and i think that she's coming at people who do think of themselves being capital-s Straight with reasoning that only really makes sense to somebody who's already thought a lot about who they're attracted to. i think that's why she got so much pushback as compared to this video (although most of that is transphobic dickheads). that, and i think she conflates dating 'preferences' with criteria for attraction. i'm attracted to people on a first impression all the time that i would never date for a variety of reasons. not necessarily genitals, but maybe somebody has really terrible family members that are a huge part of their life or lives a lifestyle that's incompatible with yours. there are things that people don't like without disliking, and i think that it doesn't make you a bad person to be looking for someone with (or without) a particular trait.   you can't really control who you're attracted to or (in many cases) who you could healthily date. some people are turned off by penises, but as long as they're not saying that penises should be outlawed i think that's alright. sexuality is a weird and complicated thing, and holding people's preferences against them or arguing that those preferences are reflective of some ulterior motive seems a lot like the weird dumb logic some incels employ. some women are only into tall guys and some straight men ain't into dick, but there's no shortage of people out there who would be attracted to you so, i dunno, you take what you can get. i don't think telling people that their preferences are discriminatory and therefore wrong is going to change anybody's mind, but talking to people and getting them to look a little harder at their identity might help.   anyway, good video. i think a lot of people do subconsciously let these kinds of dumb internet trolling opinions influence them more than they care to admit, and it's nice to see someone rationally talking people out of them. lord knows the internet has made it a hell of a lot easier to fall into the trap of 'these people are describing things that are similar to my experiences, therefore their opinions about feminism *must* be true!' so it's good to have some more voices out there."
"I really hate all the mental gymnastics that have to be felt to make trans okay.  Manliness shouldn‚Äôt be weighed by level of ‚Äúgayness‚Äù(says the bi person).  In high school I used to say to men interested in me was that I liked really manly men.  And that I thought the manliest thing was a man loving another man. It definitely stirred the pot. Just sharing a story‚Äî  I agree with your idea of manliness.  I love the feminine dick <3 !  Sorrrrryyyyyyyyy‚Äî‚ÄîI‚Äôm fetishizing you. I would love to date a trans woman."

"I stumbled upon this video by complete accident, and I have to say, I was glad I was curious and bored enough to actually sit through all 45 minutes. I seldom comment on YouTube, but I felt like saying something on a topic that means so much to me. As a teen trans girl myself who identifies as a lesbian, I feel like shit pretty much 24/7 on the fact that I have a boy body rather than a girl body, which throws me into a loop of intrusive thoughts along the lines of 'u cant date other lesbians if u got a dick' and 'u cant be a girl if u dont got the boobs hon', which makes me feel bad, then continues the thoughts and so on and so forth until my low attention span focuses on something else. But this video really made me feel better. It made me remember that no matter what body I inhabit, whether it be the body of a stinky boy or the body of an ancient eldritch mass beyond mortal comprehension, I AM a girl, and no men who don't even properly wash their own asses are going to tell me otherwise.  Thanks for the video, it really made my night. Immediately followed!"

"The worry about straight men, such as myself, being worried about this whole debate, is it throws deep questions that we have to ask ourselves. Most guys don‚Äôt want to explore that deeply into their own psyche to even question where the line is drawn. It‚Äôs much easier to go ‚ÄúPuSsY gOoD, dIcK BaD‚Äù and stop there. If a straight guy is attracted to these women, such as yourself, it also throws the social perception of their manhood into question. Most guys that think ‚ÄúP = good, D = bad‚Äù will make fun of their friend for dating a transexual, calling them gay etc. It comes down to men‚Äôs insecurities about their masculinity.   Btw, It‚Äôs Always Sunny poked at the subject a bit, which provokes the question into most guys that watch it. Where is the line drawn that most of society is okay with, when dating a super attractive transexual? ^^^^^ Hopefully no accidental offense, this is a tricky subject that every guy should think about for themselves, as the above rule is causing a lot of stigma around the subject, which when dealt with on a personal level, would counteract the stigma.   Thanks for reading, have a great day!"

"I had a conversation about this topic with a friend some time ago. We were discussing if a trans woman (or man, but we were talking about women) should let the other person know that they are trans before having sex with them. My friend was more of the no opinion, it didn't matter. And I was more of the yes opinion, if I was dating a trans I would like to know before.   But what stroke me in that discussion was how uninformed I was about the subject. I had this thoughts and feelings but I didn't really have any clear ideas to support them, as I knew so little about trans people and their experiencies. Is the sex organ so important? Isn't that what people who equal biology=identity argue? So this video, as usual with this channel, helped me a lot. I realise that I don't know any trans people in real life and that my opinions are mostly base on 'common sense', so mostly perjudice. So thank you for helping me understand a little bit better :)"
"I remembering combatting 2 delusional motherfuckers on facebook who were saying shit like 'I fuckin love traps, they're the best *heart emojis or whatever the fuck', and while I can see that they were trying to be 'loving' and 'supportive', I couldn't help but correct them with ''traps' is a slur, and its harmful to transwomen'. Then I got bombarded with 'why don't you go comment on actual transphobic posts, I'm getting offended by you getting offended because I'm just trying to spread love not hate'. I have the screenshots, but I don't remember exactly what they said, but that was the jist of it. And the other one was like 'no don't give up, let's debate', and I'm like 'this isn't an opinion you can debate on, it's a fact. Just because you don't get offended by something doesn't mean someone else wont.' This isn't a word that they could reclaim (like they were telling me), because neither of them were trans, they were both cisgender fucks."

"I'm going to complicate things further while not actually complicating anything at all.   Often in anime (and I've seen A LOT of anime) a 'trap' (which I will now be calling a 'feminine man' where it applies) is a cisgender male who merely appears hyper-feminine, or semi-feminine. The characters usually do not identify as female at all, but their appearance is used as a major focus point of their character. So you have a scenario where a masculine male character finds himself attracted to a feminine man, and is very conflicted about this. Even when it's explained to him that the feminine man identifies as male, he still finds him attractive.    So, in a lot of these cases, the confused male character is at odds with himself about his identity. It isn't gay in that he's a heterosexual man finding a feminine person attractive. It IS; however, gay in that if a relationship is pursued (which of course it never is, these characters are played largely for comedy), the characters are two people that identify as men. Of course, this is coming from someone on the queer spectrum, so my stance is on the 'woke' side of things. Two people identifying as men being into one another, to me, is gay, regardless of biology.   I just thought this was interesting to note, because the majority of cases where we see this question asked is where the feminine man in question does not identify as female. So by woke standards, it's gay, but surface level, it isn't."

"The most alarming yet most resonant statement throughout the first 10 minutes of this video is during 7:30 to 8:15. A man has been programmed to deeply fear the possibility of being a homosexual that in distress has murdered what he deemed as evidence of his 'sinful' 'misdeed' hoping that if said evidence were to disappear by his hands that he would be cleansed and forgiven by society. This esteemed viewers is why toxic masculinity is an issue.

"Im attracted to women. I cant, however, in a million years, be attracted to a vagina. It's horrifying to me. A mess. It's not really a mess, that's just my perspective...    It's not a fetish. I'm not attracted to 100% traditionally male nor female. Men are what I go for, but I only really care about what is between the legs. I very very rarely see a man on the street and am attracted. When I'm on tinder, men very very rarely get the right swipe, and women often do. But its really kinda messed up, because I know I'm not attracted to their vagina. My dream is a woman with a dick, and it's not a fetish. It doesn't like, especially turn me on. It's a fetish in the same way normal hetero men are attracted to cis women. I feel gross for it, because I know most trans women are not about being desired for their penis, and I don't wanna be a creep. But I'm not really attracted to men nor women in their entirety. I'm without sexual orientation basically. It fucking sucks."
"If I could in any world ever, pass as female, I would be stoked."

"Someone help me out with something. I'd appreciate it if you didnt harass me, call me bigot, transphobic, etc. I'm just genuinely curious about something that will make me a better friend. I have lots of gay Male friends, we go to the gay club together, some are drag queens. I dont dislike any LGBTpeople. So dont go there please. One of my friends is now  trans, we're going to name this person Sally. I knew him as a teenager, he was gay for most of that time. Or should it be she? Should I say she when I'm referring to when Sally was a man? Sometimes I catch myself slipping and call Sally by her birth name when talking to other friends. It's hard to make that switch mentally when I've known Sally for 14 year. The whole transition was a surprise. I am a close friend and Sally never told me she was a woman until the nigjt she wore a dress and wig when we went out. Am I a terrible friend for having these slip ups? Should I never bring up anything from our pasts that Sally would associate with the days of being Male? Like if I want to say 'remember that time we did this, weren't those the good days?' Should I avoid that completely? Should I omit the parts of the story that would remind Sally of being a gay Male? Are there any tips on being a better friend? Like one time we both had to go to the restroom in public. I didnt think anything of Sally being in there. But 2 girls loudly spoke out about a man being in there. I didn't immediately think 'there is no man in here just me and sally.' I thought 'they're talking about steve.' Because Sally was Steve for 14 years and for less than a year has been Sally. I must be a horrible person because I still have trouble seeing Sally as a woman. I try my best to be respectful, I support Sally. I'm just not totally used to it. I have accidentally said steve instead of Sally in front of other friends and they'll give me mean looks and say in a harsh way 'you mean Sally right?' Or I'll accidentally say 'he' and get harsh reactions too. One friend called me transphobic. One friend said 'why can't you understand that Sally has never been a he?' But she was. I've known Sally longer than any of them. I was there in Sally's life when typical teen boy things were happening in Sally's life. One time we were at a baby shower. We played a game where the teams were guys versus girls. The girls had to have pink towels, the boys blue. I accidentally handed Sally a blue one in front of everyone. I couldn't apologize enough. I felt awful even though Sally didnt seem to mind much, even stood up for me when someone else called me out on it, embarrassing me more. Which I didnt care. I deserved to be embarrassed. .How do you train your brain to stop thinking how it has for so long and be the best friend you can be?"
"I'm just so happy now, I'm loving your existence, I'm loving the experience of watching you,  I'm glad you happened."
"20:18 Yep, you sum up pretty much the whole underlying point right there.  The answer to the question 'Are traps gay?' is: 'Who cares?' (as you rightly point out), but that's not the real question - which is: 'why are some people so obsessed with pigeon-holing the sexuality of others?'  To my mind, discussions of this type by self-proclaimed alpha-uber-straight guys reveals an oddly pervy psyche. The only reason I'd spend time thinking about what someone else gets up to in bed is because I'm attracted to them - what's their excuse?"

"Ah yes, the question that is older than time itself."
"Can I ask you all a question? I have orgasims by my clitoris. This is the only way to have an orgasim for the female. It is also I guess a cramp, too? If you get the penis removed and reconstructive surgery done, can you have an orgasim? Fuck sorry. With a penis you can still have release and a orgasim. With a clit you can have an orgasim. Again...sorry. Could anyone answer me? Also, women do not have orgasims when fucking penis to vagina, unless the penis is rubbing the clit. So everything your seeing or have heard is a lie.

"Christoher Hitchens had 2 dude on dude relationships in collage and you are telling me hes straight? Crazy."
"I never knew people actually use word trap for transwomen. I always thought the word was strictly referring to overly feminine anime characters that turn out to be male."
"I wish we could just do away with labels. Is this 'gay?' Is this 'straight?' Can't we just be attracted to who we're attracted to? Fuck who we like without retribution? I don't really identify as anything, although I've been TOLD that I'm a 'cis male' and possibly a 'straight cis male', but I don't like those labels and restrictions because they don't actually do me justice. Let me put it this way: the closest I've come to labeling my sexuality throughout my life would be 'straight', but I have definitely had sex with other men. 'Gay men', 'straight men', 'bi-sexual men.' But i have mostly been with 'straight' and 'bisexual' women. Throughout all of this, it has never really occurred to me to 'change' either my sexuality, or the label of it. I like to think I'm still ME no matter what, and that the labels don't accurately depict how I live my life. And that's my real point here- these labels, and what's supposedly 'socially acceptable' concerning sexuality in our society seem to do more harm than good. Have you ever kissed a guy? Have you admitted you're attracted to a trans woman? A trans man? 'You're gay, dude!' And that in a 'negative' way. This toxic masculinity (forgive me for using THAT label, but perhaps this one is appropriate) that says you have to insult and attack somebody for something they've done, experimentation, or the perception of homosexuality, transgender, etc. I know I'm not articulating this well. I'm trying, lol. I just know that I've definitely been attacked for admitting things like performing oral sex on another guy. Being in a relationship with a Trans woman. Seeing a man or trans woman and I say 'wow, they're beautiful' and, again, they say 'ahhh, dude; you're gay!' So for people who have these insecurities and fight like hell to establish their 'manhood', their 'straight manhood' and 'purity ', it seems like a label such as 'gay' is an easy way to stir the pot and cause conflict. They feel threatened by it. I dont really care what people call me, but these angry 'straight' dudes sure seem to take it DEATHLY SERIOUS. Does anyone else understand what I'm trying to say? I'd appreciate some help laying this out. Thank you!  35:22 definitely touches on what I'm talking about."

"You know, the thing is with the entire 'Traps' or trans sort of stuff, I don't mind it. I was raised Methodist, taught Christian values, but still, love is love. My friends say they don't 'hate' trans people, but jump at jokes to make fun or degrade them as humans. I don't mind them, and if I found out someone I liked was trans, I'd be fucking fine with it. I really don't give a fuck. Love is love, simple as that. I feel bad for those who DON'T understand that. Besides, if anything, Christians should be accepting of all, as god created everything, so who is to say that he didn't create someone who is different in any way? Anyway, love your work Contra, and glad you are turning more young white men to the left. I made the transition to the left differently, mostly through study of history, but you are a good direct way of doing it. It took me a while to get to this point, and by god I am glad I have. Keep it up! Also, a little edit, as I watch further in. I honestly didn't think any offense in the word 'shemale', but I guess now I do. I mean, I have looked at PLENTY of porn. What else am I gonna do on a fucking farm in the middle of nowhere Maryland? I figured it was just another sort of 'porn tag', but I guess I can see how it can be a bit discriminatory to call them 'She-males', honestly, gotten a good education from a video I sort of just wanted to dip into and dip out. You honestly impress me with the way you are presenting this to others. I have plenty of friends who are not as friendly with LGBTQ+ people,  and even though they are my friends, they disgust me when they do it. I should send them this video, and will try, but they are dismissive of this sort of stuff. Also, I agree totally that the 'chromosomes' argument is just flawed as fuck. When you look at someone, you don't think 'Huh, she has two XX chromosomes, time to mate!', you see her features, you get interested, adn there you go. So the chromosome argument is another failed attempt by the right to use 'science' to back their false claims."

"I don't know why, but your comment about my really specific demographic being a safe place for trans folks to start dating made me super happy. I'm non-binary pan/lesbian. I dunno. I guess it makes me happy because I personally have a strong desire to protect and provide for my loved ones. I guess I like the idea that someone would feel safe with me, even if I haven't met them. I also like the idea of living up to those expectations.  Call it a knight in shining armor/mama bear complex.  It's kinda horrible actually, since it's only because trans folks are treated so horribly that I'm considered safe. I am cis passing (my finances depends on presenting as cis, so I cross-dress as my biological sex). I get that that gives me more privilege than a trans woman who has been invalidated and is scared of getting murdered and therefore has to be judicious about her partners.  I shouldn't feel so honored, but it's nice to know that I could be able to lift someone up, and love them enough to feel good about themselves, and that these folks are honoring me with their trust that I will live up to that expectation. I want to do that for them."
"First: Great video, good job describing it for both sides! :) buuuut: A lot of hetero guys are really into vaginas and the female bodies, also a lot of guys are into girls that don't act feminine, so ehh... It's not as simple and probably has a lot to do with preference and whatever you like in bed. it doesn't have anything to do with tolerance or transphobia, not at all. (Speaking for me, it's probably different for every guy?) I respect you as the human being you are, race/gender/whatever doesn't really matter to me, but I'll never be attracted to a body with a penis. This is not disrespectful and I'm a really open guy, I hope this comes across in the right way. If I would be attracted by you, I'd assume you wouldn't have a penis and would be turned off whenever I found out. I'd respectfully tell you that I'm sorry and thought you had a 100% female body, and I'm not interested in taking things further. What are your thoughts on that, how else would you want me to tell you I'm not interested anymore?"
"18:27 I feel you girl"
"I'm watching this video in good faith, and I will be making points below as I watch it. 10:06 - Why not? A person who has knowledge of an issue can talk about it, regardless of their race, background, gender or sexuality. A white 1% woman is free to talk about the life of black lower class males, as long as she understands the subject. Knowledge isn't tied to identity.  11:10 - Hardly any murder is caused because of a word. Words simply convey abstract notions or concepts or objects. So the word 'trap' is simply conveying the concept of a transwoman or cross-dresser that makes men believe she is a biological female (and here I'm not making a judgement call, just saying what the word means). Even if there is a crime where the criminal used that word,  the word did not cause the murder. It's a similar situation to the whole fat acceptance debate: fat woman are on constant struggle to find a correct term to call themselves so it doesn't hurt their self-esteem, in a never ending attempt to find a positive word for 'fat', but every time they come up with a new word, that word starts to describe the concept of being 'fat' and the negative aspect is carried over.  Black people did the same thing, going on with 'negro', 'black', 'black person', 'person of color', 'colored people', 'african-american' and so on. Regardless of the word you use, it doesn't matter as long as the idea behind it stays the same.  11:20 - While I do agree that calling someone individually a 'trap' isn't polite (as there is a considerate difference between memeing on the internet and talking with ordinary individuals), there is a huge gap between conveying the same feeling and justifying an act. Men do feel 'trapped' when they, non-wiser, fall for a transwomen. It's a fact. A reality. You can't rewire men to feel different. They expected X and found Y. This doesn't mean its the fault of the CD or TW (going to use that for crossdresser and transwoman(en) from now on for brevity), not that they think that, nor that they want to act on it, but simply that this is what they felt. Just like a person can be offended by the word 'trap' and there is nothing we can do to make them un-offended by it, there is nothing we can do to make people not disappointed with not getting what they were expecting. That said, you don't need to justify being offended - this is a feeling, something that comes naturally, just like men feel 'trapped' by CD and TW, CD and TW feel offended by the word 'trap'. Neither needs justification, it simply is. However, simply being offended doesn't justify other things - 'you shouldn't say X because people are offended' isn't that good of an argument, simply put, just like 'you shouldn't cross dress because men feel bad when they find out you're not a girl' isn't a very convincing argument. 15:41 - Heterossexual men being attracted to TW doesn't qualify TW as being females. Making an example: if a heterossexual male is attracted to a very realistic sex doll, does that make the doll into a female human? Should we give the doll a Social Security card? Should the doll vote? Or using the beginning of the video, many men are attracted to drawings of females, those that make the drawings into actual human females? The answer is no. To clarify, I'm not comparing TW to sex dolls nor hentai, again, these are just extreme examples to show how this logic is flawed. All of these examples are objects that mimic female characteristics to which heterossexual males are attracted to. Since they mimic those characteristics, the hormonal, electrical and chemical responses are similar, if not the same, of those that a human female would cause in a man, but that is an issue of the perception of the observer and not of the nature of the object in question. If I'm looking at a red car and you put green lens over my eyes, I will see a green car, but that doesn't make the car green. Whether or not TW are woman is a question of objectivity of the material body, and not of the perceived reality (after all, regardless of the observer, reality is, at the end of the day, objective and true, even if we cannot perceive said truth).  16:13 - Correcting my own point above, at the moment I understood you were arguing about whether or not TW were females, and not about the sexuality of the man. Its my mistake, still I decided to leave it there for future reference, if needed, since that also is a common argue on that topic (TW look like women, act like women, therefore they are women).   16:30 - That is correct. The question of the sexuality is on the observer, if the supposed straight man is enticed by the aspect of a female, even if those are, in truth, only being mimicked, there is no question about his sexuality. Since sexuality is tied to observation, its the perceived reality that takes precedence over the factual truth. So, indeed, heterosexual men attracted to TW are, as expected by the start of the sentence, not gay. 17:34 - Basically refer to the argument I made on 15:41. The perceived reality doesn't change the factual reality. Whether or not a hole is a vagina isn't up to the hole, its not about feelings or chemical reactions, but about the nature of the object we are talking about. That doesn't mean we can't use the same term to describe both things, even if they are different, simply due to the basic similarities, but that would still be using the same word to describe two different things. 19:42 - That was a good line of reasoning until you jumped from 'you feel conflicted' to 'you hate TW'. There is a lack of connection here, feeling bad about yourself doesn't directly translate to mistreating others. And I don't meant it can't, but that you're missing a few steps here on how one thing turns into the other. 27:49 - Same argument of 15:41: unless you first prove that a TW is female, you can't argue that a TW's penis is a female's penis.  31:32 - Changes on the quality of the object doesn't change the object itself unless it is detrimental. You can paint your red car green, but it isn't going to become a green motorcycle just because a different color.  32:40 - You're parting from the premise that they are straight and reaching the conclusion that whatever they do is straight. The logic is backwards. If a man is attracted to something that doesn't have feminine traits, they are gay. Sure, there is some considerable grey area, since some masculine traits in woman can be considered perks for a lot of men, but there is a turning point where too many masculine traits make that person to be perceived as a male and not female. On that note, you can have homosexual or bisexual men who are aren't attracted to extreme masculinity, but will fall for something closer to the middle term, yet still feminine.  33:24 - Rather it is simply a misuse of sexuality as a measure of feminine/masculine traits. Being attracted to men is a feminine trait, and due to biological and psychological reasons gays tend to be a bit more feminine on average, so the term gay becomes an umbrella term for feminine traits on men. It isn't a talk about sexuality, but a talk about traits. Being bottom is a feminine act, since, well, men are supposed to be the ones doing the banging, that what their penis is for. So, a guy taking it from his Strap-on-wearing GF is taking a feminine role and so is called 'gay', even if they are straight. This is a thing because men are highly competitive among themselves, as we are highly dependent on our hierarchical position in society, and so it isn't so absurd to expect that men will even compete about being a man, where those who are 'less man' are losing, in other words, those who have more feminine traits or lesser masculine to feminine traits ratio are losing in some sense to other males. Of course, most men are self aware of this to an extent, which is why jokes like Dankula's aren't uncommon. In fact, the whole debate that spawned this video is part of this joke: the men asking whether or not traps are gay are straight men attracted to traps.  35:47 - Just as explained above."

You simply are physically unfit for a phalanx. Plus, their society was utterly misogynyst. And how can you talk about what a 'real man' is, what nerve"
"No, homosexual sex isn't defined as 'sex between two people of the same gender' it is defined as 'sex between people of the same sex'. Ergo, yes, having sex with a'trap' is homosexual. And that's ok. This obsession with identity is new, and not really useful. Instead of weirdly defining yourself by your sexuality, how about just fucking who you like and living your life whatever way you want."
"6:41 Going back on that, what the trans woman did was completely wrong. Its only fair for trans people in general to disclose before any form of sexual action has taken place. And to say straight men avoid trans female because they are insecure about being called gay makes no sense because gay men and lesbian female do the same thing. So are they also insecure about being called 'Straight'?   Id be very pissed off too if i found out that i kissed someone who is biologically a male because i find gay sex disgusting and uncomfortable (not that I mind it, i don't hate gay men or gay sex, I just prefer not to be involved) so its only fair for a trans woman to disclose before hand."

"Hello, first of all i want to excuse for my bad english. I want to introduce myself as a person who likes Shapiro/Peterson way of thinking and I'm here to understand the other point of view. It's sad that a funny definition of transgender people (trap) is actually linked to murders and aggressions, without this information was actually hard to understand what the problem was. I said funny because is an unexpected twist in a story, that sort of thing. When i was in university there was a test: a set of femminine asses and to win you should guess if that was a girl or a transgender: it was not easy to guess. So to be actracted from femminine traits in a man or whatever (no offense) is normal for an heterosexual man. But I can relate to the 'trap' thing: a lot of the people in the world are not ready to discover when things goeas to sex that the girl has The D. I have a good friend of mine who is gay, i've even was his guest at his home (6 gay men + me), sleeped in the same room, etc. But when i see 2 man kissing i have an automatic 'shiver' down my spine (nothing if 2 men engage in sex in porn, I just don't like it). I don't think is possibile to control some unconscious impulses, I understand it's not fair but i think society needs a gradual way to get used to sexual things. I really think that the persons who hate gay/trans people are.. secret gays who hate themselves. I really enjoyed your stile in this video keep the good content (Y)"
"I'm a cishet man and I was always a big defender of trans rights online and on campus. But before I started watching this channel I had one dark hypocritical secret, I was always unsure of whether I could date a trans woman because of the penis. It weighed me down and I felt like a secret transphobe.  After watching this channel I now know confidently that trans women are absolutely real women and I would have no problem being in a romantic/sexual relationship with a trans woman. Thank you for enlightening me."

I didn't get how that could work, so hearing your take was very helpful!"
"E sobre o termo trap,varia sentido no tempo em que n√£o se podia falar abertamente sobre um personagem ser gay ou trans,mas nos tempos de hoje ele est√° caindo em desuso por n√£o corresponder a realidade. Como o fato de a maioria desses personagens nunca fazer de fato uma 'armadilha' uma vez que nunca fazem quest√£o de esconder o seu g√™nero,bastando perguntar para ele. O que √© interessante que no in√≠cio o g√™nero yaoi era um feitiche feminino,mas evoluiu ao ponto de hoje no Jap√£o ficar bem popular para o grande p√∫blico e atrais bissexuais como eu ou um amigo homem trans tamb√©m,no final a difen√ßa de um bara para um yaoi √©:Gostar de homens musculosos ou gostar de homens delicados. O que nos leva para essa infinidade de tipos de homens e de mulheres que a pouco tempo atr√°s n√£o era conhecida e est√£o saindo das sombras e pegando o seu lugar ao sol de onde nunca deveriam ter sa√≠do."

H√° um pouco disso nos outros grupos de orienta√ß√µes como nos homossexuais e com os bss√©xuais e no meio da identidade de g√™nero,como as mulheres e homens trans e aqueles que s√£o os dois,mas nada comparada com que acontece com os heterossexuais,principalmente com os homens heterossexuais,que est√° gerando esses incels que s√£o incapazes de ter rela√ß√µes sexuais por verem a outra pessoa como coisa e n√£o como um ser humano de vontade pr√≥pria e de vida pr√≥pria,e precisa reduzir essa pessoa a coisa porque n√£o tem coragem de viver em um mundo que ele √© apenas mais um,falho e que precisa de ajuda. S√≥ digo isso:A putaria h√° de salvar o mundo,quando todo mundo entender quais s√£o seus desejos e aceitar a rejei√ß√£o e partir para outra sem √≥dio no cora√ß√£o ou preocupado com que os outros v√£o pensar e dando valor a cada pessoa que se relacionou,seja amorosamente,seja uma rapidinha,seja de uma masturba√ß√£o de uma atua√ß√£o de um porn√¥ ou desenhada em um quadrinho de hentai,yaoi hentai,futa e ad infinitum na sexualidade humana."

"God! everyone has homosexual tendencies. who gives a shit. anybody who says they're fully gay or straight is lying, probably to themselves more than anyone. being attracted to trans people just means you are actually aware of your attraction to both masculinity and femininity. I'm gay and i can still admit that if i were to meet a cool, sexy woman who was down to fuck, no strings attached, i'd do it. same thing as if it were a trans woman or a trans man. it isn't about genitals, its about how you connect and whether or not you have the same goals. if a person really just wants to have a biological child and a traditional lifestyle, don't expect them to be attracted to trans or gay people as anything other than a fetish. it isn't about what you find sexy in the long run. its about the future you want. I'm gay because i am more sexually attracted to men than women, but ultimately, i'm really gay because i see my future with another man and no children."

"Dear ContraPoint, there is another thing about transgender community. Some of transgender people use their sexual identity as an excuse for everything. It arose to grotesque propotions here, in Poland (maybe because Poland is fairly homophobic [catholic one would say...] country). Its like SOME transgender people forcing declared 'traditionalists' to love them... It gives opposite results of course.  Let me recall the character of english teacher from my university. He calles himself 'the chief anti-man of Poland'. So even though he is real shit english teacher (i had some lessons with him), he responds to criticism by calling others homophobic. Of course im aware that he is exposed to a lot of hate just by the mere fact of being like he is in country like Poland - 'which is not used to it', so his lessons might be affected by doze of stress... Nonetheless lessons with him were just wasting of time. And university has no guts to kick him out.  So i would like to only emphasise that the story has 'two ends' (there is such an idiom in polish; guess you know what i mean). Of course the biggest problem is unreasonable hate to other human being - whoever he is; so nothing can justify violence against anyone. But i believe that this problem isnt related to 'you are so intolerant bastard' issue. Transgender people started creating communities which recently started to radicalise (and i think its tendency; like right-winged kiddos recently got ultra-neo-nazi).  Anyway, cheers from Poland :)."

I ask because that is a barrier to me if i can't provide my partner with physical satisfaction (and anal is something that does nothing for me), so while that's a technical question (and the day that we can grow a clitotis and link it up to the brain will be an amazing step forward) i think I'd always be worrying that i was being inadequate as a partner as a result."

I especially loved your points at the end about being a 'real' man and the toxicity of that for men and those around them. If I lived near you I would definitely date you, and proudly! Sadly, I am sure I do not. Also, I am afraid I may be more a type 3 (chaser) than a type 2, although I'm not sure, Plus, I'm starting more to identify as an overcompensating asexual these days... :-)  Anyway, thank you. Thank you very much. Beautiful video, beautiful woman. And very fun makeup and costuming!  PS searched on duckduckgo just now: fourth result. Also fourth on google using a different browser that has none of my search history or logins. Also, FWIW, found the link to the video on a porn torrent site on an 'are traps gay?' thread.

The reality is, you're still a man pretending to be a woman, just like Elizabeth Warren is really a white Caucasian  woman pretending to be a native American.  Why do so many gender-confused people DEMAND that I refer to them as anything other than what they really are?  Bruce Jenner will always be a man, as will you, but I must admit that unlike Bruce, you could have easily fooled me if I met you on the street.  Bruce just looks embarrassingly ridiculous."

"It's also worth noting that this touches on the often pretty troubling influence of Japanese animated porn. I'm not trying to bash Japan as a country on the whole, anime generally is brilliant and god knows Western porn isn't all sunshine and rainbows, but this is one of many examples of how hentai (the term for pornographic anime) perpetuates some _really_ fucked up ideas. What's more, because it's animated, things are often more 'deep' and complex, if that's the word, than badly-acted porn, as well as including things that would be impossible/illegal to portray with real people (she mentions futanari, which for those that don't know, as generally female-presenting characters that are full hermaphrodites with both a penis and vagina.)  To name a few other fucked up things in hentai you have; -Pedophilia - This one is famous, but it's honestly to the point that the majority of female characters (and a fair few male ones) at least look underage, when they aren't explicitly stated to be in high or even elementary school.  -Incest - Links to the above, if it was incest between consenting adults, I wouldn't be bothered, but the dynamic is often older brother/step-brother/father/step-father and significantly younger underage girl. Or sometimes 'sexy' mother figures. -Mind break/control - Trope where female characters literally lose their free will, often to the point of becoming permanent catatonic sex dolls. This is sexy for some reason. Also can feature extreme body modification e.g. cutting women's legs off and dramatically expanding their breasts and buttocks. And death. Lots of female characters dying at the end. -Rape and other sexual assault - Situations where female characters give informed and willing consent are a minority - almost always the female character is saying 'no' all the way and is coerced somehow, this can range from blackmail to not wanting to make a scene in public. This goes beyond sex itself and into unhealthy and often criminal behavior - like stalking and kidnapping.    And this is on top of the depiction of women being just generally being awful - with female characters rarely deviating much from narrow, sexually appealing stereotypes e.g. the 'ice queen' who is really just desperate for sex, the innocent wide-eyed schoolgirl, the powerless patent/pupil/underlying. Sure, you get these in Western porn as well, but whereas Western porn generally doesn't have much focus on characters, hentai consists of whole episodes strung into series. It's one thing to have a porn star dressed in a schoolgirl costume, it's another to watch whole episodes where a female character is gradually coerced into becoming a sex slave to an authority figure and the audience is supposed to identify with the one doing the coercing.   I was exposed to all this by the time I was 12 BTW. It was only after I'd grown a bit that I appreciated how deplorable the stuff in hentai was. I think the only reason this isn't talked about more is that the mainstream is mostly ignorant to it and that people on the left don't like bashing non-Western cultures (cultural relativism for the win!)."
"Look I want to give you the benefit of a doubt and see what you have to say, but bluntly referring to Dankula as a 'Scottish Hate Crime Convict' completely ignores the controversy surrounding his conviction. You can have whatever personal feeling about his sense of humor or how he carries himself on the internet, but simply calling him a committer of hate crimes without delving into the context of what happened is just going to turn a lot of people off and make them stop watching the video 5 minutes in. I can tell that isn't what you want and that you want to try talking to the other side on this, but this isn't helping you. You should have just left it at guys like Richard Spencer who most people won't really sympathize with."

"A 'trap' may be attractive to a straight man all the way until you get to the penis. If you as a man are attracted to a penis you are gay (or bisexual). There's no such thing as a female penis. A feminine penis may be good enough for a straight leaning bisexual person, but not to a completely straight one. Hearing you talk about it reminds me of those christian bisexuals who thinks being gay is a choice for everyone just because it is it to them."
"Ya know, as a person who enjoys anime, and who considers himself someone trying to be a good ally, I never really thought of the word 'trap' in relation to transwomen.   It was always, in my circles, used specifically to relate to a male identifying individual presenting as a woman. However, I understand why it may offend transwomen.  Aka: thanks for this video."

"All I have to say is that I agree with everything in this video. ----- NOTE everything below this line is written with very limited knowledge on the subject. I always try to be truthful in what I say. If I made a mistake or said something that is offensive, please let me know and I will do my best to understand the topic in more detail. ----  I actually learned a lot from this video that I can now add to my understanding of the topic. I still don't understand it all, but I was never really one to worry about gender topics all that much. I just picture people as people. Everyone is different, everyone unique. Everyone has the potential to be a star or to be a steaming turd. It's our choices that shape us, and our choices can also shape others.  I was raised by my mom, who is an absolutely amazing person, and spent most of my life around women, so I've had the privilege of getting to know a LOT of different kinds of people. From straight men and women to trans women and men, I've got friends of all types of crazy. I may be a straight man myself, and I know what kind of things turn me on and what things don't, but, as a human being, I would be ashamed of myself if I made someone else feel bad about who they are. If you're a straight man, and you find someone attractive, compliment them. If you get to know them and you both feel attracted to each other, don't be afraid to say it, just don't be inappropriate about it or rude. Society is so stuck on weather or not someone is a woman, or if something is gay or whatever, that people are missing out on opportunities that life could be throwing their way!  I'm sometimes mistaken for a woman because of the way I act online, and you know what? I don't mind at all. Why? Because I know who I am, and If anyone has a problem with that, then they can suck it! And if someone is being a stupid bigot, I'll outright tell them to their face! On another note.I've never liked the term 'trap' being used to describe trans women or even men who dress in drag. The only group I would use the term for is those who go out of their way to purposefully trick and humiliate people for being attracted to them when dressing up as a woman. I find that kind of act despicable and absolutely deserving of a good punch in the gut. So, you keep at it ContraPoints! Spread the information and disperse the misinformation!

"My issue is that everyone thinks it's gay when referring to me because I can never afford hormones :( I'm the same I always have been.

"I don't think traps are gay at all.  In fact, if I read the people I've trapped properly, it's frightening. They scream, panic, pull at the bars and keep asking 'why are you doing this????!!!!!'.  To which I reply 'why did you trespass on me property?' Then they start panic shouting something about being the post man, or amazon delivery. I never pay attention.  0_o"
"I was personally always of the assumption (clearly incorrect) that 'traps' were straight men dressed as women for some plot contrivance (Like Princess Princess). Thus 'traps' aren't gay because the men looking like women won't be interested in the men who are intrigued by the feminine appearance. No one is gay in that scenario. I'm not straight for finding female crosplayers/crossdressers hot when they're dressed as a man. Seems like the same logic follows."
"Don't create new slurs. Use the word differently. I've never really seen anybody use 'trap' to refer to transgenders, the word is for feminine anime characters."
"But is Lenora gay(I mean a la woman into women) because (call me!)"
"Very interesting video, and it definitely solidified a lot for me, but I can't agree with the notion of a 'female penis'. Your explanation clarifies how a woman can have a penis, and I'd agree that she'd still be a woman. But I don't think that explains why that penis is now 'female'. A penis is a male reproductive organ, full stop. It is inherently that, whether it's attached to a woman or not. Your 'context' argument is also not sound. A penis is considered 'a male reproductive organ'' even when it isn't attached to a body at all, so you don't really need to be changing its nomenclature based on the 'context' it's in.   Also, it being smaller and more 'soft in terms of mouthfeel' or whatever doesn't really change anything. I guy with a small penis isn't more feminine either."

"its funny that this feeling when you were transitioning 'uh so he sees im a woman' is something that as I cis woman i totally relate - its like ok, we know what it is to be a man, but we dont know what it is to be a woman - and its like guessing through some man's eyes"
"This question has always sent my head into spirals of confusion but the more I think about it you are right. In the current cultural/linguistic framework that we're in it really is just easier to think of straight trans relationships as just straight relationships, especially after the topics from your previous episodes. I have worried in the past about dating a trans women without knowing as I do find penises incredibly unattractive despite having one myself. The worry doesn't actually concern the genitalia but rather turning down the hypothetical person who has gone so far as to wanting to 'do stuff' with me (for context, I'm severely physically disabled and have yet to date anyone at 23 years old so I imagine I'd feel horrendously guilty for upsetting someone who liked me that much). That said I know that this is a highly improbable and therefore mostly irrational/imaginary worry given that I really don't like the thought of not knowing a person well before having sex with them. The more I think about it it really is the 'changing process' that my brain gets stuck on when thinking about this, even when considering the hypothetical perfection of a 'passable' trans women, operation and all (god that felt horrible to say, it really is objectifying language isn't it?). I can't help but imagine it happening to myself which I find to be a very unappealing thought that I then can't move past. I feel the same way about things like makeup and uncomfortable looking clothes so there's definitely something about a kind of reverse projection going on there. I did manage to get over being weirded out by certain kinks that I like, although that was by reinforcing the idea that in their context it's fictional so I can't exactly use that reasoning for the other things. Anyway, it's something to think about."
"I love your laugh omg."
"Just curious, in her vid contra said that partners of trans women shouldn't expect said woman to use their penis in a male way. She was referring specifically to men wanting to be penetrated. So, trans women out there: what happens with bi or gay women? Do you use it in a male way? This comes from honest curiosity as I am a pan cis woman, and I'm sorry if this comes off as at all offensive."

"It's too bad that a lot of people just can't go with the flow when it comes to their sexuality. Sex, in all its shapes, and forms, is just sex.  Don't make it such a, limiting, self identifier."
"as a straight guy, some transwomen are pretty. i want kids though, so its a dealbreaker for relationships."
"My view of traps is more like the Japanese definition: a feminine (crossdressing) man that appears like a woman, used mostly, but not exclusively, in the context of anime, manga and related media or while shitposting. I'm not even going to go into the trans debate, since I wouldn't  consider them traps, as they, like 'dickgirls/futanari', are a different category of people. My opinion is that liking traps is not gay, if you're being attracted to the femininity, or if you don't yourself consider it gay."

Drag in anime, on average boys in dresses, at best princess. If an anime drag princess is gay, it's just that character. And this is a straight guy with L+ friends/connections."
"I need help but those who lurk in this comment section. I sometimes call myself bisexual, but I'm not sure I am, and I do not want to call myself so if I'm not. I am attracted to women, but I don't really have any sexual boundaries when it comes to men or penises, etc. However, unless it's put infront of me, I'm not usually going to go for it. So, that leaves me questioning, am I bisexual? Bicurious? Just comfortable with my heterosexuality?"

I wish I could have taken some time to think about it some more then and tried to take the perspective of someone not me.  I'm sorry."

"Traps didn't start as a reference to trans people nor crossdressing. Instead it started out referring to feminine guys or androgyny. Similar to looking at the back of the head of a guy with long hair and mistaking him for a girl. Traps don't identify as female nor do they they enjoy being mistaken for one. Any use of the term 'trap' in reference to being trans is incorrect."

"It depends on how you define a 'woman'.    If you define a woman purely physically then no a trans woman isn't a 'woman' because biology is biology, but if you want to make a case about someone's mind well that can be debated forever because nobody can prove that a trans woman doesn't truly feel like a woman."
"Trans women aren't traps to begin with. You're starting from a false premis. Traps are crossdressers (men who dress as women and DO NOT IDENTIFY AS WOMEN) who TRICK men into liking them"
"After I transitioned socially the guys in my DnD group had like a 40 minute heated argument over whether 'traps are gay' with one guy coming to the conclusion that trans women should only be allowed to transition if they become sex slaves for incels. So uh I don't play dnd with them anymore"

"its not even about 'are trans gay?' its mostly about 'are being gay bad?' and 'what is being gay?'. If you like abs, deek, hair everywhere, strong muscles, strong chin - that probbly gay, or is it? What is women have most of this? Or what if guy dont have most if this? What if guy have femine body,face,voice and only man thing is deek. In % that 'ideal trap' gona be more women than most of actual womens.

"15:45 - 16:04 pretty much sums up how I feel about people that try to bring up philosophy in a scientific discussion. I study natural sciences and have had conversations with people from the humanities department that end up in this mix of subjects. In one case we talked about human nature and this person brought up this philosopher that basically said that there is no such thing as human nature and we really don't know what that even would be. This completely bewildered me because when you have the context of evolution, our species development and that of our predecessors and their know behavior, then add historical context of all sorts of cultures and beyond that, add the know behaviors and evolutionary history of other animals whether it's other mammals or social animals, etc.You get pretty distinct patterns in behavior which we can conclude are that species 'nature'.   I'm not gonna get into details cuz that's not the point I'm making. I tried to explain my case as much as I could in that conversation and the lady just said that her point was just a philosophy so at least she didn't buy into it completely. But, i have interacted with others that do so and Natalie's bit really resonated with me in those situations."
"Ah, lost literally all goodwill when you insulted Dankula for being convicted of something that he should never even have been charged with, only reason anything happened there is because overzealous SJW's attacked him.

"TL;DW: Kinda"
"I really vibed with most of this but I thought it was unfortunate that you didn‚Äôt comment at all on pre-transition trans women or trans women who don‚Äôt feel the need to medically transition at all. Because the reality is that most trans people can‚Äôt afford to transition‚Äîwhether financially or because it‚Äôs just not safe for them to. Maybe you could address this in another video? I don‚Äôt know.

"Excellent explanation to a rather idiotic question (poor Ackbar). I think people who pose this question are simply in denial about being gay or bisexual, because if they really were 100% straight they wouldn't need to ask if they were otherwise. I've never asked myself if anything was gay, but I'm a woman, so I guess it's a man thing? I hope in the future people will become more pansexual. I'm not quite there yet myself, but I firmly believe that would solve a lot of issues."

"Ypu disgusting tranny thing"
"I think what this really comes down to is a conflation of heterosexuality with gynephilia. Men are 'attracted' on a surface level, that is gynephilia: attraction to femininity, not women. Straight men are attracted to not just femininity, but women as well: heterosexuality. So it makes complete sense for a man to be attracted by the femininity of a trans-person but turned off by the revelation of their genitalia."
"I always thought that men who date and have sex with trans women were straight.  And for women who date and have sex trans men also straight."
"Let me start his off by saying that your videos are consistently entertaining and though I disagree with you on a lot of things, I appreciate your peculiar brand of humor and the fact that your arguments are well thought out. Though I agree with you that attraction to trans women is at least more straight than gay (or maybe bisexual but ultimately it doesn't matter, attraction is a personal matter), I don't agree that that automatically means that trans women are women. Straight men who are attracted to trans women are attracted to the outer markers of femininity, because as you mentioned we can't sense chromosomes, so we rely on external characteristics. However this is where the idea of 'traps' comes in. The fact is there IS deception involved, because what is 'advertised' runs counter to biological reality. Now there's nothing wrong with that as long as you're upfront about it, because that take its from the realm of deception to the realm of simple role-playing (I don't mean that as way to belittle your identity, I believe all identities are role-playing to some extent). You could of course come back with the assertion that gender is fluid and people can decide which gender they belong to, but I think that kind of reasoning is dishonest for a number of reasons: 1- if gender is a matter of choice, why not race? Can a white man paint his skin black and call himself African-American? If not, why not? Why is gender selectively malleable but race is not? Especially considering the fact that gender is much more profoundly delineated genetically than race (where the genetic differences are exponentially more shallow). This argument can be taken to further extremes, such as people deciding they are of a different species than human, or that they are inanimate objects, etc... 2- If anyone can be a man/woman, then those words lose all meaning. A category that can include literally anyone is not useful in the least. Man/woman are useful categories we base off of objective biological reality, whereas basing gender off of how someone 'feels' or 'like to act' is not just unhelpful, it can be downright damaging. Let me explain: if being a man or a woman is determined by the way you dress, how deep your voice is or your mannerisms instead of your natural biology, that severely limits people of either gender in the ways they feel comfortable expressing themselves. I propose instead that we retain the useful basis of biology to define man vs woman and that we simply open our minds to new ideas of what a man or woman can/should be. A man who likes to wear dresses is no less of a man, a woman who likes to weight lift is no less of a woman, etc. Let people act in whatever way makes them happy (as long as they don't hurt anyone) without undermining scientific truth. As for whether it's gay or not, if it is it doesn't matter (and we didn't even mention the case of the 'trap' being with a woman) because contrary to gender, sexuality IS fluid and is ABSOLUTELY a matter of personal preference (though perhaps not personal choice, I don't think we can choose who we are attracted to, otherwise love wouldn't hurt so much). I'll be perfectly honest, the only way I personally could be attracted to a trans woman is if the illusion is somehow absolutely perfect, because I simply am not attracted to maleness, but that has nothing to do with fears of being called gay or stigmatized (though I'm sure that would happen, I simply don't care), it's simply natural instinct. There's a reason heterosexuality is normative, it's because it's biologically imperative. The ability of a man and woman to recognize and desire each other is literally a matter of life and death for the species, so let's not belittle men's longing for biologically female partners."

"if we are being honest you answered the question 'are people attracted to trap gay?' not 'are trap gay?'. I mean you did mention you like dick , and probably that a lot of trap like them too, so are they gay for it? it depend on wether the person who is being asked the question consider a trap as a female or male."

I know this it makes no sense there are incels all pent up with such attractive Trans women wanting male companion ship . Simply ridiculous . I mean come on your not gay if you want to be with a frmale frame and it happens to be Trans . Your just not . Incels are chaining themselves with own shackles ya ask me ."

"You are a wonderful and educational entertainer. This was highly informative and I'm happy to have watched it! Until now I never once thought to connect anime traps with real life people. To me it was always just a description for convincing animated cross dressers, and how can that be offensive if fictional characters don't have feelings?

"I'm inclined to agree with everything but the first point about Count Dankula. He's a comedian.  Yes, he makes offensive jokes that a lot of people would find repulsive, but he's still just a comedian. He doesn't mean any harm by it. I agree that sometimes he goes too far but that's really the point of his edgy style of comedy. His 'are traps gay' video isn't a serious discussion because that isn't what comedians do, anybody looking for an informed discussion should obviously look elsewhere.   Like here."
"Hi, I'd have a question regarding the topic: the video has a 45min discussion on 'Are traps gay' but I don't think I heard it defining homosexuality. It took me a while to understand that you define it by being attracted to a person of the same cultural gender, not biological sex, which contradicts any dictionary definition I found or e.g. the definition given by Science Daily (source below). Shouldn't the video define the this term since it deviates from the established definition and has potential to undermine large segments of the video, especially the last part?  Especially from this perspective, the feminine penis conversation seems a bit absurd. Personally, I'd define sex as a purely biological feature based on the organs the person has since this is a rather simple definition which is extremely useful e.g. in medical science and by far most people fall to man or woman categories. Using this definition, feminine features are those social and psychological features that correlate with woman sex and male those that correlate with man sex. Thus, gender can be defined as whether a person exhibits more feminine or masculine features (i.e. what correlates with that biological sex) Does this definition seem ok? If not, could you comment how and what corrections would need to be made? :)  Following the previous definitions, however, penis seems by definition to be always more or less masculine since it correlates with the biological male sex 100%. Of course, some individual features can be more feminine (such as smoother surface) but overall it still seems masculine. Similarly as some pre-teen children can exhibit very adult like behavior but that doesn't make them adults as a whole. Again, feel free to disagree but I'd sincerely like to know more specifically which point we disagree on and talk about the subject :)  https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/homosexuality.htm"

"Fantastic video, great points. Trans women should never be deminished to people who are there to embarress fragile straight men, especially non-white trans women. However I can understand people using the words trap and futanari in a way to describe certain sexual fantasies involving people that could pass as both men and women. Calling actual crossdressers or a certain fantasy a trap is fine in my book, but as soon as it is used in reference to a trans women, it is offensive and it should be called out. Also I know that as a cis woman my opinions on trans women will probably be shunned and ignored but I think that as long as your opinions are well argumented and not bigoted, you should feel free to share those opinions with the public and other people. EDIT, Not to mention that wether or not something is gay depends on who you ask I'd say no but I'm a bi so that doesn't help"

"First off, I'm going to stop using the term 'trap' because I am convinced it encourages fragile cis men to be violent towards trans people.  For reference, there's this male singer from awhile ago who used to dress as a woman on stage occasionally and he looked REALLY cute so people in the comments would be like 'oh she's so cute' and people would respond like 'guess again!' It was all fun and lighthearted and honestly knowing the real meaning of the term 'trap' brought my day down. I guess my main issue is I kept forgetting that people are that fragile about being considered gay because I don't associate with people that act that way. It's not a concious avoidance, it's just that people with fragile egos usually have a lot of things wrong with their personality and being homophobic usually goes hand in hand with a lot of fucked up things. I guess I just literally do not understand people that want to be that goddamn strict with gender.   PS anyone else notice 'trap' is never used for ftm trans people??? Just mtf??? Is fragile sexuality just a guy thing? Legit curious."

"Contra Points,  This is an excellent, informative video that deserves to be viewed by more people. You clearly communicate excellent points in a way that a large number of misinformed people can easily understand.  However, your statement regarding an inseparable connection between violence expressed towards transgender women and African Americans is faulty.  The notion that African American transgender women are the only ones facing sexual abuse implies African Americans exclusively enact acts of sexual violence. That is treating the African American community as an isolated subset of American culture with actions other groups of people do not partake in.  I do not have access to any statistics, facts, or other knowledge regarding the differences between any ethnicities with regards to the assault of transgender peoples. However, confining any actions or characteristics exclusively within any ethnicity is an example of social racism, regardless of said actions‚Äô relative prevalence within an ethnic community.  While I am certain you did not wish to state that African Americans are the only ones experiencing these acts of violence, your lack of acknowledgement regarding its occurrence amongst other people groups communicates an entirely different message.  I hope that this comment is not interpreted by anyone as an attack on your video as a whole. I also hope that it does not cast any skepticism regarding the validity of any other point you have made in this video. Additionally, I hope that it does not label you as a racist within the minds of anyone reading this. Finally, I wish to commend you for recognizing your position as a white person with regards to a highly sensitive topic such as race and choosing not to explore it any further."

"'Traps are gay' for this one reason, (Cis gay male here) you are fundamentally having sex with a man, and you are 'trapping' someone in something they do not want. Not everyone is gay/lesbian/bisexual/whatever you want to say. Its wrong to do and kinda fucked up. For some this is being attracted to men, which isnt an easy thing to handle. I have a lot of allies that are cool with gay/lesbians/trans but are naturally turned off/weirded out by men touching them. Im working on that stuff, but for some its a natural response.   Its about communication from two separate parties. The unnatural hatred and fear is wrong, but if you have a penis and are a beautiful woman, you should probably tell your partner/playdate. Its about being on the same page, not pushing the priority one way or another. Biological turnoffs are real and it should be open discussion to all parties.   Sauce: Counselor an friends with a lot of changed (now ally) homophobic men, women, and trans-women."
"traps are kinda gay"
"I'll be honest, I still don't really see how it's a harmful slur when used specifically NOT towards trans women, but towards feminine cross-dressing cis-identifying dudes - a lot of whom embrace the term. I have trans friends who identify with the word and are fine with being called that, but I still won't call them that myself (let alone trans people as a whole) - the same way I won't call a black friend the n-word, even if they tell me 'do it man I don't care'. it's just... not something I'll do."
"But I don't really see how it would be nearly comparable to use it for a cis dude who likes cross-dressing (ESPECIALLY if they identify with the term) because I don't really see how it has the same baggage - they identify as male, thus there's no female identity to serve as a 'trap'. There are tons of 4chan-dwelling cis guys who are into cross-dressing and see it as a compliment."
"You can say 'well, if you use it in that context, then everyone will also use it on trans people'... but I think generally it's just better to make people understand why it's shitty to use on trans people. I personally even forgot there WERE people on 4chan's /b/ who used that word to describe Bailey Jay because I stopped using that place in 2007 and stuck to other boards where the word was almost exclusively used for cis male-identifying cross-dressers.  I'm not trying to logic-own you, just sharing my thoughts. I do agree with most of your points which is why I don't have much to say about the rest."
"Regardless of the fact I don't agree with several of your views or political opinions, I fully agree with your view of sexuality and the whole shitshow revolving around the trap question. This video was executed very well whilst being concise and it provided a valuable perspective on the matter. I've always believed that you should stick to what you believe in, not a construct of the opinions of those around you for fear of ridicule. I am attracted to trans women such as yourself and I believe that those who share that attraction, but are ashamed or confused as I was some years ago would benefit greatly from this video."

"I love this video and how wonderfully you engaged the topic. I also appreciated you took the time to cover the emotional and physical spectrum of the question and I applaud you for hijacking the conversation.  I'm a simple man and when I'm told something is offensive to someone, I am willing to shift my words or tone to address the person's needs. It is not my place to decide what is or isn't yours, though that is far too simple and possibly binary in of itself, but I'm not that smart. I just want others to never experience the rejection, loneliness, anger, and manipulation that I have at the hands of people (men and women alike). Where some take out their anger out on others, I'm doing my best to be (probably awkwardly) considerate, polite, and kind, though I have failed many times and am frustrated that I will never get it right.  Sorry for making this about me, so let me further indulge you with one more selfish statement: thank you for educating me and helping me grow to be a more knowledgeable, tolerate person. Please forgive me and if not, thank you for this video regardless. You don't owe me a damn thing.  I look forward to watching your previous and future content, as a new subscriber.

I was just plain ignorant about what a bad history and connotation that word has. Thank you for providing information in one of the most entertaining, intelligent, compassionate, and real ways I could imagine."

"Yeah, I'm 20 minutes in. That's all I can take. Never heard the word trap before. Honestly I don't care. The only thing I'm gay for is you singing and playing the piano. Didn't get any of that so I'm out. The sets look nice though. I bet they took a lot of work. Still I prefer music over this color orgasm. Sing for me, penis girl!"
"Hate crime convict? I'm sure your fan base doesn't care but to me you lose any kind of credibility if you go down the hate speech isn't free speech path. Though come to think of it, the first video I saw of you was also something hate speech related. I think the left is against free speech or something. Could you please not go full SJW? Actually way more important, could you play piano and sing again? It's a lot of work writing a song and recording it and you seem to play and sing better than me anyway."
"What if I‚Äôm just not into it.  I think this video makes a lot of decent points but I don‚Äôt like how it seems to imply that not being into ‚Äúfeminine penises‚Äù means you‚Äôre somehow not a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù who is comfortable in their sexuality.  And furthermore I don‚Äôt think that citing porn statistics is in any way a good indicator of what people are comfortable with in a real sexual encounter."

"@ContraPoints I've been through hell lately, and you've been the ferry woman. That's a compliment. Right now I'm just desperate to voice my absolute support for you as a person, so, here goes: I, myself, am in the gender 'dysphoria' situation in a way in which hormonal and physical transition would actually make things worse for me. You can imagine how I may have been affected watching your videos from 'then' up until 'now'. After seeing just a few minutes of your XOXO speech from last year, I just wanted to reach out and clarify that I fully support you in your transition and in your doing what is best for you, just as I must do what is best for myself. You're literally one of two people outside my private life that I've actually been directly able to identify with, so I just want to be sure that any comment or statement I ever make never comes across to you as offensive or derisive. I used to try to claim and own the term 'trap' as a way of dealing with my situation but, out of sheer respect for you as an individual, I've decided to dial that back. I understand the genuine terror of living in a world where people will straight up maim and murder you because your mere existence unintentionally subverts their visceral expectations. I have also suffered psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of a cis woman who saw me as nothing more than a walking fetish and, in particular, you've actually played a large role in helping me get over that. I hope you've never had to endure anything like that, and I hope you never will. If you take anything from this weird, borderline parasocial rambling, just know that the way you embrace and present your self has helped me find a better self of my own. Thanks."

"This was both interesting and entertaining! I've never dated a trans person but I'll admit I was crushing on a trans guy for a while. Now granted I'm ace so I'm not interested in sleeping with anyone but knowing all of this helps to appreciate and support this guy friend. Thanks Contrapoints! You are awesome!"
"Oh, uh, warning, this is a sob post and I'm looking for some help. There's a lot to unpack here, and if you're just scrolling through the comments, this will be a waste of your time. No need to read further.  I think I subconsciously came here looking for my own answers about my own sexuality, and being that I am from the Bible Beltest South that ever Bible Belted, I have no real way to explore it without also destroying most of my social and family life. I was confused about why I felt disappointed at the end of the video, being that I advocate that traps are indeed not gay (for personal reasons) -- and I didn't understand how hurtful even that could be and I'm sorry -- but I thought about it and came to the aforementioned conclusion. But now, also thinking back on the video, my sexuality seems... offensive? Especially offensive to the people I am most attracted to. I have dated both women and men, and I have an attraction to both femininity and, frankly, penis. The man I dated was about as feminine as a Southern Homosexual Man is 'socially acceptable' to be. More so in private. I loved this about him. He was cute and sweet and did these little cute things he didn't know he was doing that I loved like how when he was happy he walked like he was going to break out into skipping... anyway. He moved to Oregon. He's married now. This is sad, back to the point. I feel like I'm attracted to both of these things, and by direct association, I'm attracted to the embodiment of these things. Not that I fetishize male genitalia on a female, my attraction goes deeper than that. Something I didn't mention was the man and the women I've dated have all had similar personalities, and I need to be romantically attracted to a partner to even become... to stand tall. But there was some thing about this video that made me feel like I shouldn't be? Or I'm not welcomed to be? Or it's offensive that I would be? It could also be a lot of things I've repressed and I'm reading into it poorly, but... I guess, should I be attracted to trans-women? I'm afraid to come off as the people Nat described in the video, the people who simply fetishize the part of a trans-women I only just realized they would be the least comfortable about. I didn't even think about that. I don't know why, but I feel more excluded and repressed than ever and I can only think to say that I'm sorry for the way I've thought about Trans-Women in the past."
"5:12 Are you serious? What a shitty way to portray someone. The fact that he was convicted of those things at all was ridiculous, but she's using that perversion of their legal system to further defame someone who did nothing that was actually harmful, I'm sure because he's in opposition to some political view of hers. If that is so, then take issue with him on those grounds, rather than just calling him a hate crime convict to people who may not know the story. He never should've been convicted of anything, though I'm sure she doesn't care about that, though, because it's easy to make him look bad by just calling him a 'convict', who's committed a 'hate-crime'. That was really underhanded. Sincerely, not even a fan of Count Dankula.  P.S. I know fans of ContraPoints will want to defend her against any kind of criticism, and will want to chalk me up as a butthurt Count Dankula fan, and assume my political stances and start creating strawmen arguments from those assumptions, but it's a scary fucking world where people can get sent to prison for something as trivial as what happened with him. And then, to make a remark like she just did is a way of capitalizing on the fact that he was convicted, whether it was right or wrong, I'm sure because he has opposing political ideas. Ugly, ugly, ugly."

"I discovered ContraPoints just now from rewatching an old Lindsey episode on Marxism in Transformers. This is the first video I watched, because as a Cisgendered bisexual crossdresser with no gender dysphoria of his genitals, and no desire for tits, but a strong desire to have a feminine enough face and body shape to 'pass', it appealed to me. 'A sample of the difficulty all queer people face' Reminds me of being in high school and dating a black girl (I'm white) It really opened my eyes to the fact that Racism is still a huge problem. Also,at about the 38 minute mark after to my casual ears very well put together and defined logical arguments, she resorts to a no true scotsman fallacy about 'Real Men', as a non traditionally masculine bi-male identifies as a man, this sort of thing is a pet peeve for me, wherever it's used, for whatever context, but that's really just my own baggage. I'm definitely going to check out more content from this channel. I'm really lucky that all the people in my life that matter, don't care. But since for the most part they don't understand, I'm coming to realise that I have no one to really talk about this stuff with, and apparently saying it in a youtube comment, even if no one really reads it, is cathartic. The things you learn."
"Also I really not enjoy you leveling minor stuff like working on nipples WITH pegging WITH sucking a dick. That's not how it is. For you maybe and I don't judge, but flattening out this is just lame. I dislike more people who are so homophobic that they can't enjoy their own bodies tho. My dislike is on point here - you generlise way too much."
"I‚Äôve only been a subscriber for a short time, but I wanted to say that your videos should be considered a public service. You rationally discuss perspectives using real-world experiences to elucidate & extract meaning. You unabashedly engage subject matter that makes other commenters seem squeamish & disingenuous. Without a filter you still maintain a sensitivity to tactfulness. We need so many more of you in philosophy. I learn a lot every time I watch. Thank you."
"Really only that on Dankula? 'Hatecrime convict'? More like joke-crime, disliked! I was never on a ship with this meme. But trying to control language again? I mean this isn't how it will work out. Trying to shove this into law for example - you will get another all round protest. In order for more normal people to respect trans people - you need to raise awarness. And for some people it just might not work. I know quite a few guys who are intelectual monsters, but they just won't like trans people, they will tolerate gays or lesbians without thinking, but a trans is a no. I'm wondering myself, how do we merge trans people into society without making people angry about it. I also don't like leveling the same way Shapiro and JP. One is opportinistic bastard rising on nationalism and other is not."

"This was a very entertaining video but I have to raise issue with the core conceit, which is that people are calling trans women traps. You correctly point out the origin of the term as a meme about androgynous or cross dressing anime boys, but go on as if it became a slur used against trans women when that isn't the case as far as I'm aware. The term is still only used to refer to androgynous or cross dressing anime boys, generally only when it comes to pornography, and perhaps more importantly only by fans of the genre. Perhaps there's some alt right mouthpieces misappropriating the term just because of the overwrought 'are traps gay' joke, but outside of that context, I don't see any of them calling trans women traps for a pretty obvious reason. It's missing the point to call the term a hateful slur when it contains an irrevocable connotation of attraction. No actual bigot will use the term for that very reason, because to do so would undermine their heterosexuality. They will just say faggot, and they do, at length.  Now I will fully agree that jacking off to anime boys who look like girls is a far cry from having a nuanced understanding of and sympathy for trans people and doesn't preclude bigotry or even hate for them,  but I think a reasonable argument can be made that they are not the people who want to send 'those sissy faggots' to the gulag for extermination. I'm not trans, so I can't say what is or isn't hurtful or what does or does not get said to you in hate when you're trans, but I just can't imagine being called a trap as an expression of disgust any more than I could imagine being called a sexually powerful womanizer in an injurious manner. Sure it's possible to dig a negative implication out of that, but it would be a lot of effort to find the insult. If there are examples of people doing exactly that however, I'd be fascinated to see them though, stupider things happen all the time."

"I think this video, like many of the arguments for why the word trap is offensive, is a bit off the mark. I'm not going to say having it be used as a slur against trans women is acceptable, but I am going to question your belief that the majority of people use it in that way. From my experience and from what I have seen the word trap is not used in the context of trans women. It's used by nerds and losers when jokingly talking about a commonly used character archetype in anime. Now you may want to say 'What difference does it make? Traps in anime are clearly trans.', but hold on. This is where I think a lot of people arguing against the use of the word trap are mistaken. Not all traps in anime are trans. I'm not saying none of them can be considered trans, but not all of them are. There are some traps that are guys, that identify as guys, but look feminine and get mistaken for girls. The term trap was never intended to refer to trans women and was certainly never intended as a slur. A lot of people use the term without even having trans people in mind, just cute anime boys. I feel like this entire argument is a bit off because it's lumping anime loving dorks in with transphobic bigots, and claiming they're one in the same. Not everyone who uses the word trap is trying to offend trans people, not everyone who uses the word trap is a straight male who's scared of losing their masculinity and not every use of the word trap is inherently offensive and bigoted."

"Anime nerd here. Honestly, I wasn't even aware that the concept of traps was applied to actual transexuals. I've only ever encountered it in the context of the specific type of anime character, which is to say a male character specifically designed to appear - and usually behave - as an attractive/cute female. (Without even needing to be a crossdresser.) As such I've never really considered it a slur, given that such characters are in fact intended to trick the viewer to a degree.  Having seen this video, I do however recognize that the term should not be used for real trans people. Or real people at all, frankly."
"I wish you drank that wine in your videos. The glass never seems to change its volume."

"Damn Im proud of how civil and understanding the comment section is in this video. Great stuff btw Natalie"
"I assume the whole phenomenon of 'trap' is in the assumption that the guys is supposed to stick his dick in anything that has remotely feminine features he finds attractive.  I guess they can't process anything beyond that.  The contradiction of being attracted to feminine features and something they are conditioned to see as 'bad' causes their ability to process feelings to crash.  Boys really need to be taught ways to process feelings and emotions to prevent extreme behavior from nuanced situations later in life."

"When I started working at Sephora, I started to understand some truth to what you said about how the fear of seeming gay really holds straight people back. Im a gay dude who never even went to the mall before I had this job, and slowly I grew confidence in this new self-expression. That's ultimately all makeup is. Over time, I got to experience how certain products made me feel, and my comfort level expanded over time. It took years before I tried a red lip, and when I still felt masculine and confident in it, I think that was very validating. Hey, I can wear a red lip and still feel confident in myself and my masculinity. Why was I so wary before?"
"ok so this video is great but it does have a problem with at least how your talking about men as a whole and a collective. yes shitposting about this is pretty popular and can be offensive to people but these incidents of attacks while are a big problem, they are the extreme minority of men. you know this because you've had experiences with guys that you spoke of in this video. and with shitposting, again only the extreme minority are doing it out of ill will. most people who laugh and make that are people who know and are self aware on how dumb the posts are. thats why it's called shitposting. i like the video and the channel i just wanted to point something out you all probably know already"
"you litrial think count denkula deserved to be in prision just becuse hes dog made the sige hile salut thats it yo has gone to long"
"Why does this have to be so complicated? Men have never been attracted to 'women' persay. They are attracted to feminine traits. That's why gays dress feminine. That's why women dress feminine. That's why transwomen dress feminine, simple, really."
"11:37  No, we don't want to offend people because we think we're 'superior', we want to use words/phrases that offend people specifically because they think we should limit our freedom based on what offends them personally.  I would never seek to limit a trans persons ability to express themselves however they want just because how they express themselves might personally offend me.   Anything worth saying will offend somebody, something simply being offensive is not a reason by itself not to do something. I support no appeal to censorship (be that by the Government or private citizens) based solely on how offensive someone finds something.   You absolutely have the right to be offended, you also have the right to offend. You do not have the right to not be offended. Offence is not given, it's taken.  Before anyone replies, consider that if you think my speech should be limited because of your subjective offence that it works both ways and I guarantee you wont like the same standard applied to you.

"Sigh.The only difference between a trans woman and a cis one is that the trans one doesn't bleed like a stuck pig all over the place complaining about her insides turning into ground meat one week per month (sure, she WILL bleed like a stuck pig for about a month when she has her SRS, which WILL feel like her insides turned into ground meat until she recovers, but that'll hopefully be a one-time thing she'll go through just to keep the tradition of vagina owners everywhere)."
"Mental illness is strong with this one."
"The feminine penis, why is no one talking about the feminine penis?"
"Wow Contrapoints you really have it wrong, maybe some guys are how you describe but the majority are good men, don't tell guys how to 'look after there women' and if they want to date trans women good on them and for the jack off comment these same guys most likely jack off to women as well. Don't take the moral high ground as you are not a women and try to be a bit more respectful, have¬† nice day."
"Contrapoints is one of the greatest youtubers out there. Much love! Also shout out to the Astolfo picture"
"Shitposting your way to the high ground works for me.   I can't speak much for trans people as I am cis, but I hope you guys can get proper rights wherever you are.    Straight people, especially men, are so fragile. I'm so glad I am so far from straight my sexuality would be a swirly fun straw.    That was the most tasteful, posh description of oral sex I have ever had the pleasure of hearing."
"Are Incels Gay?"
"I don't really like the argument that 'if you are attracted to someone that identifies as a woman, you are straight'. What if you are attracted to a woman that looks NOTHING like a man and honestly identifies as a man? Would that make you gay? What does it even mean that someone identifies as a certain gender? Why can't I be a guy and identify as one and like typical 'womanly' stuff?   IMO, as much as I dislike my conclusion, the question if someone is gay or not should ultimately base on attraction to physical appearance. Like, as stupid as it sounds, I think that I could 100% acknowledge that a trans person is a woman (whatever that means) and yet think that if I would be attracted to her I'd be gay."
"1. You're really funny. I sometimes have to pause the video because I'm still laughing.  2. I can listen to you talk in Victorian Era speak all day. 3. You're reasonable with the points you make. You point out mainstream perceptions and comment on them in a way that is understandable. 4. I'm a gay cis man and I couldn't imagine feeling like I got 'tricked' or any kind of anger by being attracted to a trans man. I wouldn't have any kind of crisis about if that makes me 'straight' somehow."
"'Will there be transexuals in the ethnostate.... hopefully not'   Sometimes I think these people are just jokes and don't exist but every freaking time...  they do."
"Best Video on the issue, just adding one point as an anime fan , from what I have seen  the word trap is not generally used in anime for trans people more often than not it is used for describing crossdresser to male(gay/or otherwise) gaze which is judging an individual by looks , really all of  it comes down to as having not efficient vocabulary in English to describe it and have fun along the way while watching anime which while spilling out in real world is creating all sorts of problem , but in the end as you mentioned culprit is not terminology but the context and the inner psychology of the person using it ."

Thanks for your serious and sometimes humorous video; I'm enjoying it a lot!  Footnote: as a bi idiot myself I don't have to worry about this issue as much. I became interested in this issue from anime and the hit or miss girl ( *girl* )"
"Uh. As far as my understanding goes since I've ever first heard the term, trap has never had anything to do with trans anything.

"Hi! I loved your video I just discovered your channel yesterday by Supereyepatchwolf (another youtuber) and it hooked me inmediatly. It would be super cool if you can give me your opinion on trans people in sports competitions, I had a few discussion over this theme with some friends but we are very limited in knowledge about it. I personally practice HEMA (fencing) and as a intructor once said to me with a sword on you hand it doesn't matter your gender, it's all about the technique, and I think in that way, but sadly they're very few women fencers in my country so they can hardly get a good position on competences (with a few obvious exceptions). Maybe in the sport I practice is not that big a difference but others competitions can be  lot. So to sum it up what are your thoughts about this?"

"Happy about how you framed the term, as it, and its general usage, has always seemed like a western, toxic masculine reaction to the myriad of gender-bending, otokonoko, and trans/queer media in Japan, specifically in Anime and Manga. Now, that isn't to say that Japan doesn't have its own problem with 'Man in a dress' humor, or a myriad of other problematic issues within the aforementioned media. However, I've always found criticism of anime to edge towards cultural imperialism, issues that remind me of western cultural criticism on subjects like Muslim veiling. Everyone is well within their right to not like, not watch, or not financially support anime or Manga that they find problematic or untoward, but criticism should be framed solely from western consumption of Japanese media, as we really have no arguable right to impose our moral norms on Japan, especially given our history and global cultural power, especially given how much of an impact our imperialism had on the region post ww2. They're issues that need to be dealt with by people in Japan who are a part of that culture, not western audiences.  Sincerely, Person who realized they still have an anime avatar on YouTube half-way into writing this comment."
"You seem the kind of obsessed (former) academic who'd read every comment on all your videos, so here goes. I have to admit -- and I know that this is not really in right now -- I've never been attracted to men. Sure, sometimes I think Christopher Hemsworth looks like a hunky inverted triangle... but no sexual arousal. Nada.  So with this mindset, re: 'traps' I had a rather life-changing conversation a few years ago. A girlfriend asked me if I've ever been attracted to men. Nope. 'How about someone who transitioned and you couldn't tell?' I was about to say, Nope... -- and then I realized I was about to lie. Yeah, I'd find an attractive woman attractive. And that's really it, isn't it? That turned the whole 'trap' meme around for me. What it comes down to is that I'm not attracted to someone's genes, a point I'm glad you made in the video.  Basically, if I -- a sexually milquetoast, cis-male heterosexual exclusively into women (again, with apologies to contemporary trends, that's just how I am) -- find transgender women attractive, then there's really no 'trap' is there..."

I've been following since early in your YouTube career. Your video on Trump long before your transition. I've seen you each step as you've gone through it. I know being in the public with those things hs been hard. I can only imagine. But it has been SO IMPORTANT for helping me to humanize trans people and their transition.   Trans or not, you ARE a woman. You don't need me to validate it but YOU have made ME see that it's valid. Best of luck to you girl and I can't wait to see what the future brings for you!"

I had a 'phase', I know stupid word and its not accurate, but you know what I mean, where I hated myself and thought being a woman would help me, but instead I had to learn to see myself as I am and love me and today I¬¥m happy with myself, but back in the day I was regularly assaulted not even for dressing like a woman, but for wearing some eyeshadow and slim jeans ... that was it.  When I was walking around in a dress and Heels, I was srsly afraid of getting raped and murdered, so I stopped doing it.  Afterwards and even until now I feel a desire to date a trans or crossdresser, just to love them how I wanted to be loved and accepted back then.  also I¬¥m still sexually interested, but I¬¥m afraid my girlfriend wouldnt be happy about that ...   anyway, great video, and your face and styling makes it every pleasing to watch as well."

"1.) It's never gay for a man to be attracted to femininity, regardless of whether the effeminate individual is a natural-born woman, a transgender woman, or an effeminate male. 2.) If your sense of personal masculinity is so fragile that you flip your shit at the slightest hint of deviation from the norm, then maybe your manhood isn't worth holding onto. 3.) What turns you on, what turns you off, what you're not sure about doesn't really matter. The same goes for other people. None of that justifies being an asshole. 4.) If you don't understand it, then just accept that you don't understand it. The world doesn't care what you do or don't get. Grow up and learn to live in it as it is."

"Honestly, hearing detailed descriptions of sexual experiences by trans people is so enrichening. It's like seeing a science experiment to test the theory. It gives me a whole new perspective and appreciation for everything that is going on. Thank you for being here and doing everything that you do.  On that subject, there is a video on youtube where a young girl shows her vagina a short while after surgery. Title: _This is What a Vagina Looks Like on a Mtf Transgender Female After Gender Re-Assignment Surgery!_ I guess youtube allow this kind of nudity because it's so obviously educational and not sexual."
"[constructive criticism]  As someone who is bi, and has been with trans people before, there is something inherently homosexual about it, HOWEVER people's sexual preferences can be changed, and people regularly change their tastes in attraction. It is still important to discuss this matter, as for many it helps them to explore the less than heterosexual side of themselves, allowing for further acceptance of trans people into society.  The problem isn't masculinity inherently, but rather projected insecurity, I've personally witnessed hetro women getting worked up on the idea that I also screw dudes, we should aim to kill off all assholes with mannered reasonability, not straw-manning people like this^^^^. Masculinity is a great thing to be on the receiving end of, and to be, or simply to witness in its positive aspects, if you hate masculinity or femininity then it says more about your insecurities than the personality type, same could be said for hatred of gays.   ps. TELL THEM YOU HAVE A DICK OR VAG IF ITS NOT OBVIOUS! you should give your sex partner a pleasurable surprise, not a bewildered surprise. yes it sucks to get rejected, but if you are basing your identity and self-esteem on someone else wanting to fuck you or not...that's dumb... don't do that... stop it... shut up your dumb brain"

"when a straight male fucks another straight male, none of them is straight by definition... you literally can't fuck another dude if you aren't gay/bi. the only thing I learned from this video is that in fact traps are gay... <_< somehow gay guys who define as straight now define the term straight as a whole in this video. no one cares what some individual might think of as gay or not gay. or how some individual defines a 'real man' or a 'real women'. you were born with a penis? you are male. you were born with a vagina? you are female. nothing wrong about simple genetics.   same with the whole 'perceived as woman' stuff. sure you can accept the illusions you like. doesn't change the fact, you were born male and when someone 1k years from now will find your bones he will say: 'yeah that one was a MALE.'  also nothing about taking female hormones is >NATURAL<. you maybe don't have silicone in your boobs, but they wouldn't have formed naturally without taking hormones and you have to take them til you die if you want to preserve the >unnatural< state of your body.  even if we had the possibility to change the gender of a human 100% and after the change he/she would not need any medication or hormones. damn even if we put a full functioning vagina in a dude and he gets a healthy child. it would be STILL unnatural since the person had to do something to change the natural state into something else (which can't be natural anymore BY DEFINITION of the word...). see the flower in the woods which grew by itself? that's natural. see the flower in your garden put there by you? that's unnatural. the flower in the woods would be there if you have never saw it. the flower in your garden is only there because you decided to change the natural state of your garden and put it there. and I'm not saying unnatural is bad. a lot of stuff around and about us is unnatural. do what you want. just stop washing the brains of the kids. they really believe you... while you keep telling them reality is what they perceive as reality, which isn't true at all. everyone of us has his own shit about reality he/she doesn't like that much. there is no chance for change in a positive direction without acknowledging reality how it is, not how you want it to be. that's where religion lost. that's where this 'fight' will be lost too. you can't force your imagination into reality. no matter how hard you wish.  also how the fuck do I contribute to hateful behavior by calling traps traps? if someone kills a chick with a dick, it's not because they are called traps by some edgelords on the fucking internet. give traps another name and a week later you have THE SAME negative connection. well I guess traps are snares now, how does that change ANYTHING? do less people get killed when we start calling traps snares or anything else? if someone is >killing< someone this person has far greater problems than a word or even homophobia. I mean sure that's one of his major problems but not every homophobe is killing gay people... some homophobes are gay themselves O_o that's why the most fucked up of them fuck traps before killing them. they say they were tricked because that's how they can legitimate it TO THEMSELVES. but it's not the actual reason they did it... this people are fucked mentally beyond repair. they are NOT your average straight male. or even your average homophobic guy. I'm not gay but I'm a goth so I look gay to some. I know homophobia first hand without being a homo, just by looking for some as one. no one ever wanted to kill me. most of the time someone says some shit and if you don't react nothing ever happens. most of them shit in their pants when I turn around and say something like: 'well let's go outside and settle this shit like true jungle monkeys would.' most of them aren't even homophobic but just some weak-ass idiots who think they found a victim who doesn't fight back. the moment you show them you aren't a victim, they aren't interested in you anymore. welcome to our fucked up society. it doesn't help when you tell people, reality is what they want reality to be. it looks all well and nice from your perspective while real homophobes use the same kind of thinking just in the opposite direction..."

"Natalie, your video is awesome, as always. But I don't buy the whole feminine penis thing. Now, keeping in mind that sex and gender aren't the same thing, I would say that biologically speaking the penis should definately be viewed as the male genitalia for the sake of simplicity. It can be big, it can be small, it can be meaty, it can be soft and so on, but no matter which adjective you put infront of it, it is still the male genitalia. And I don't understand why that has to be a problem. I mean, does a trans-woman need to have a 'feminine penis'? Does it make her more of a woman? I would not say so. A vagina with a relatively large clitoris doesn't make the woman who possesses it more masculine, right? So why can't we just agree that the penis is the male genitalia, the vagina is the female genitalia and acknowledge that each individual's genitalia is different, without putting label A or B on it?  On the whole question of 'is it gay to fuck a trans-woman?': I think it helps alot to view people's sexual orientation less as black or white and more as a spectrum. Nobody is 100% straight, nobody is 100% homosexual and everybody is at least a little bi. Kinda frees people to just like what they like without having to strictly label themselves, unless they want to. I, for example, had a period of my life where I was really into videos of trans-woman penetrating natural women. Is that still purely heterosexual lust? Maybe not. Is that enough to stop identifying as a pretty straight man? I'd say no (my gf would say no too). Does it actually matter that much? I'd say no aswell."

"Im a cis woman, so i dont know how it feels to endure transphobia- but the 'trap' term still pisses me off all the same. As if a trans woman has somehow 'tricked' a man into dating her, it implies that their identity has some malicious intent towards them or something...when did masculinity become so fragile that somebody elses identity is a threat to them? The best similarity I can think of for cis women is that 'makeup is a trick to fool men', shouldnt attraction (ideally) be based on more than just physicality? If a man falls for a trans woman its because she's beautiful, kindhearted or possesses other traits that attract men to all kinds of different women and if they can't accept their identity beyond that they dont deserve to be loved back. Peace out <3"

"Question! My partner and I were discussing physical fights for money (such as UFC) and the role of sex within those fights. We disagreed over whether trans-females should be allowed to fight biological females specifically when the those biological females are not informed of the original sex of their opponent.  I think those fights should still take place, but only with informed consent. I base this opinion on bone structure and testosterone levels still present in higher quantities even with the administration of estrogen. There shouldn't be any advantages in training or intelligence except on an individual basis. However I feel that a biological male would have 'first mover advantage' as seen in games like go and chess. In chess many players would not compete in a tournament where they always started at an initial disadvantage or even a great potential for initial disadvantage. I believe this might discourage biological females from engaging within this field. My partner disagrees and believes it is a more equal playing field. They were a little disgruntled and said 'Well go ask ContraPoints. You would obviously believe her smh'. Which I dont think is necessarily true, albeit I cant quite see my partners point. SO. ContraPoints/ContraPoint commenters change my mind"

"After further reflection, there's one objection to this video-- it's still playing the BINARY game ... which is not the best position because...  1.) Gender is Orthogonal-- Gender is not linear within the human psyche. It splits off and connects -- reconnects with innumerable psychological, biological, and cultural aspects of being.   2.) Your argument fits too securely within the Social Engineers agenda to, 'Divide and Conquer'. Everything is either black or white, good or bad, ugly or pretty, male... or female. Therefore, binary boxes are easily contested and reacted to without much thought.  3.) You presumptuously ignored (and disrespected) all the self-identifying Trans Fems who are uncomfortable with either of the two boxes.... i.e. GenderQueer, trans feminine, Two Spirits, Gender-Fluid, Femboys, Demi-boy,  Pangender, Agender, trans feminine, androgynous Femmes, Shemales (... I know, but there are Europeans who feel empowered by the term.._), and people who identify as third, fourth, and beyond 'Females.'  4.) What about Intersexed people??  5.) And where in this over-simplified 'binary' waters do Crossdressers reside???   5.) But worst of all, your position ignores the History and important Archetypal dynamics of Transgender females. Trans people have played important roles in the evolution of consciousness and tribal culture. They were often the Shamans, Witch Doctors, and healers of tribal culture throughout many parts of the world.   6.) GOD... and the Angels were said to be of two genders. You don't want to piss THEM off do you ContaPoints by limiting the fact that they are BEYOND and MORE than these two Western, puny boxes do you?!?! (smile)  7.) But worst of all, your position supports ---albeit subtly-- that the goal of transitioning Transgender women is to be sexual objects. Successful transition must rest within these two 'Western' boxes.. and there their consciousness shall remain. Dream no bigger. Stop with if they are successful at appealing to men's Animas.   8.) Do Hermapodites get any respect in the modern world? They Certainly played IMPORTANT roles in the ancient / pre-modern consciousness that lurks in the background of our post-modern / metamodernism / Techno ... Feudal -Fascist psyches!   9.) And where would you put the important role that eunuchs played in the ancient world?? Many were eroticized in China as Fems.From Asia to India, to the Arab world and throughout the 'Middle East' ... where does your binary little boxes place them? (Remember, the only thing in the NEW Testament that Jesus is said to have spoken about homosexuality is when He referred to 'Eunuchs' saying:  '12For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.‚Äù   ~Matt 19:12  NOTE: The term 'Eunuch' now holds the classification of both Gay (Homosexuals) and Transgenders. {NOTE: Even though 'M2F' is no longer considered affirming, the fact remains that at some point in MOST Transwomen's lives, a 'Transition occurred ... so what do you do with 'Transgengers' who are 'Trans' but never opted for HRT nor surgery?  And if 'M2F' is no longer 'affirming,' exactly what does the prefix, 'Trans' mean???  DEF: 'Trans: To span ‚Äúacross,‚Äù ‚Äúbeyond,‚Äù ‚Äúthrough,‚Äù ‚Äúchanging thoroughly,‚Äù ‚Äútransverse,‚Äù in combination with elements of any origin... (Wiki-Dictionary.com) When logic goes, what remains of sanity? What good does denial do in the maturation of a person? 'Trans' -- exists!   I wish you'd explore more about WHY Transgender / Transsexuality / Hermaphrodites played such an important role in the human psyche? The Greeks and Romans didn't exist as a people until after the Egyptian 13th Dynasty. Much of what is given to them was plagiarized from the Egyptians and definitely in the creation of their  mythology / religion / spirituality.   [ 'Hermaphroditus was the god of hermaphrodites and of effeminates. He was numbered amongst the winged love-gods known as Erotes. Hermaphroditos was a son of Hermes and Aphrodite, the gods of male and female sexuality.']  Dad: Hermes (Roman name: Mercury) was a HUGE god and a derivative of Thoth. He was the herald and messenger of the gods, and the cleverest and most mischievous of all the Olympian gods. Hermes was also the ancient Greek god of trade, wealth, luck, fertility, animal husbandry, sleep, language, thieves, and travel. Remember... he symbolizes parts of our psyche... so why was he selected to be the father of Hermaphroditus?  Mom: 'Aphrodite was an Olympian goddess of love, beauty, pleasure and procreation. She was THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL GODDESSES in terms of appearance, but her personality was rather damaged because she is described as weak and frightened as well as ill-tempered and easily offended.'  ~ttps://www.greek-gods.org/olympian-gods/aphrodite.php  ALL THIS resides buried beneath layers of each of our psyches... still playing softly like an unattended radio muffled by the screechings of an overpowered Oedipal Complex and a superficial, unbalanced 'civilization intent on making us believe there is nothing beyond the 5 senses .... and binary boxes."

And the incredible fact that there is sass, direct insult, and yet no patrionising is just incredible! I don't think I've seen this before anywhere.

"I can't wait to read that foreword by Jordan Peterson"
"Labels are stupid, anyway. I'm bisexual, but I'm not 50/50 each way. I'm more inclined to date men, but that doesn't mean that I'm devoid of female attraction. I love being a woman, and embracing my 'femininity', but there are also things I like that are stereotypically masculine.   Humans, at their core, haven't changed over the millennia (including in aspects of gender, sexuality, and identity). All these labels - male, female, straight, gay, bi, etc. are extremely restricting, and humans are more complex than that. People are just people; everyone's different, and everyone's the same. At the end of the day, who cares about this stuff? If you find someone attractive, and you both like each other, go for it. If you don't, and they don't, don't go for it. It's as simple as that. Feeling insecure because of how society might label you is stupid. Murdering someone because of it is evil and cowardly....and pathetic."

Perhaps the problem is as soon as a man sees an interesting woman, they imagining banging that woman? And thus, when the woman reveals that she has a d, he felt betrayed-- but it is mainly betrayed by his own fantasy.   I am in a country that even less progressive, we prosecute or 'rehabilitate' aka torture LGBQTs. I'm trying to imagine me, as a mostly-straight female, trying to date a man but then find he has a v. I will be stunned and feel confusion. I don't know if I will continue the date or not. If it was not a serious relationship, I am likely to drop it.  In a 'straight mind', I kind of think maybe the solution would be saying 'I'm a trans' right when someone approaches but then I consider that solution to be transphobic. It is almost the same with asking a woman you know for a pic of her v, that is just rude."

Now as for me I've recently figured myself out as far as sexuality goes; I recently came out as bi. However in that time there was never a person I treated badly because I was unsure of my own sexuality.

"Can I just say that biological male and female aren't even about chromosomes? Sex in nature can be determined by things as direct as genes or as indirect as the temperature it was when the organism was developing. Sometimes it changes with age, like how it does with clownfish (they're all born male and become female). Because of this, any biologist will tell you it's not all about chromosomes or genes. Even then, there are cases where the Y chromosome doesn't activate the switch to build a male anatomy in the womb instead of a female one, creating an XY woman. People claiming 'basic biology' tend to only have a middle school level understanding of it in the first place. The transphobic 'reason' they claim isn't even completely correct. They're just hateful, close-minded idiots."

No vaginas suck, they are all great & should be loved & enjoyed by their owners & anyone said owners would graciously invite to enjoy with them in whichever activity is preferred. I personally have never had the pleasure of a vagina that was surgically assigned by a medical professional but I'm sure it would be just as wondrous a place to engage in the same activities as one that was assigned biologically. I guess what I'm trying to say is pussy is great & I don't think it would make any difference how you got it, if you want one get one & share it with whomever you please & hopefully they will please you in return ;^)>"

They fear telling them the truth  in case in hurt their feelings! Some straight men wont eat pussy.

"I gota tell you something.  I'm a middle age man from the south who has never even met a tran and know nothing whatsoever about any of this.  I'm actually here because I was trying to figure out what a trap even IS after I heard it somewhere.  I must confess that I've made ugly jokes about most LGBT people with friends (tho not to anyone's face if that helps you not hate me a little bit less).  Anyway, my point is, I probably know less about all this than anyone who has ever been on your channel.  I'm also almost nauseous when I think of even seeing another guy's DK.  But I say all this to tell you the following:  This video was incredibly informative and I think you do an absolutely amazing job in explaining all the things in your video.  Your honesty and obvious level of intelligence blew me away.  Furthermore, whether you were explaining all this sexuality stuff or politics in America, I think you have an incredible gift just for explaining things.  I honestly think I've grown in tolerance and I know I've grown in understanding these issues, so thanks for that.  Often times when the media puts a trans person on tv or other media, they are extremists and seem to almost hate stright people and put all kinds of crazy demands on us for how we should behave and what we can say and what words we must use and so on.  In contrast, you seem like a perfectly reasonable person, you don't have hate-filled rhetoric for those like me who don't understand your lifestyle or definitions and so on.  I honestly believe that if you were the national spokesperson for trans people then the rest of the country would almost have to change and be far more accepting.  Even if I wanted to argue with your lifestyle (I dont'- I say if it works for you and hurts no one else then its your choice) it would be very hard to do so.  I know this is an insanely long post but this video was so enlightening to me that I felt I had to try to explain the impact it had and make sure you know what a great job you are doing."

"Y'know every now and then I come back to this channel thinking 'Okay, today is the day I finally finish a ContraPoint video' but I always end up clicking off out of anger when you say something really stupid. Today it was:  'Men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement'  Who knows, maybe you really do make some great points somewhere in this behemoth of a video but I have a very hard time taking anyone who makes those kinds of blanket statements seriously. Oh well, see you in a few months I guess."
"Thanks for explaining this so thoroughly. I'm gay so I didn't have the hang ups about female dicks or anything. I never thought about a lot of the things you said in the way you proposed them.

"5:42 At the point of comment I have only seen to this marked time:  Maybe it's because I hang in academic circles and have a bunch of friends all over the spectrum but when we were having the ¬´Are Traps Gay?¬ª debate, the first thing we always established was what it wasn't. We never used it to mean transexual, transgender or even a transvestite. I mean these words exists why use the word ¬´trap¬ª for them?   We also worked under the impression that the origin of the word was in Otaku culture. Meaning our case of study were the traps in these stories. and their clearly not Transexual, almost never transgendered and not simply transvestite. Could this be due to Japanese just not understand what a trans person is? Sure. We were aware of that but the intent was irrelevant to our conversations.  We ended up agreeing that traps are gay men with a kink (or straight men with a kink in the rare story were the ¬´traped¬ª is a women).  So at least for the circles in which I run, I reject the premises you've established so far. That being said thanks for the historical context. Going to keep on watching now."

I'm going to say something you really don't like: you hide behind your 'womanhood' because you're too weak to face the world as a man. And that is the truth. You cry about toxic masculinity, yet these accusations when you once were a man were the prime reason you turned out to be the way you are now. You're literally denying who you are, as are all transsexuals. You still have XY chromosomes just like all other males do, while females have XX chromosomes. You are fighting against the very being you are. Of course it fucks you up mentally to deny your true self and hide behind something you aren't."

Plus it was a prank on his gf because she said that her pug was really cute and he wanted to make it look evil. The nazis would have killed him if he did that in germany 1936.Otherwise pretty good video"
"I view myself as a straight man, and I am secure in that view, and I have been 'trapped'. Once by an insecure friend who had been coy about exactly what junk she had been born with, telling different stories to explain her early transition, I have been with her again later, but it was not until several months after that first time that I got the full story (and then it made sense why she wanted to do anal and lie on her front). The other time I was 'trapped' was by a person who might have been a very convincing crossdressing man, but I'll refer to her as 'she' here, because she obviously worked hard to put on a feminine persona, she mostly just made it seem extremely impolite to say no at any point before I had helped her get herself off, then I excused myself and left, I like to believe I would have done the same if she hadn't pulled out a penis. I don't see how these things in any way make me less manly or less straight, but then again, I'm not the kind of person who will murder someone because they make me feel less manly, as said, I'm quite secure in my view of myself as a straight man."

"Natalie, I really want to thank you for your video. It really was necessary to explain everything you did and to create a sort of canon, if you will, for the definitions, perceptions and realities of the transwoman experience. The bit near the end concerning your first experiences as a transitioning woman and all the anxiety involved with your sexual partners was especially informative and relatable.   By creating such a video, I think you've not only achieved your goals about the argument 'Is It Gay' and the derogatory nature of the usage of 'Traps,' but you've also pulled together all the needed information associated with such topics in order to stop abuse and where men go wrong in their assumptions, offering solutions for such misconceptions.  It was a brave and necessary thing you did and I think anyone with questions can get nearly anything answered by taking the time to watch your video. You may have set down a Basic Comprehensive Knowledge Toolkit from which all people can easily understand the misconceived reality of being a transwoman, helping to reorder misinformed ideas of what it's like.   I know you did with me.  Have you had any thoughts for disseminating your video to an even wider audience under other titles? Something like 'All You Want to Know About the Transgendered,' or 'T-Misconceptions' or 'Why Straight Men Like Transwomen'? Or maybe just using all of them to appeal to the most people possible. I believe the more people who can see this video (as it is), the more people will understand the trans experience, resulting in fewer acts of prejudice, violence and death.  Regardless, thanks again. Safe journeys."
"I mean calling Count Dankula a 'gate crime convict' may be factually correct but a conviction was extremely one sided with comments from the judge like 'context does not matter' but its a whole not her topic....."
"You forgot one.... the issue of Trans women of color being murdered in the streets also has a lot to do with religion. (Christianity and Islam.) 'Christianity' as its taught in this country is post-Civil War theology that takes a mystical, allegorical book, and turns it into something literal. That alone is crazy-making. But 'Christianity' as its taught in this country (and much of the world)  essentially deifies whiteness.   Racism is a SYSTEM that not only denies goods and services at targeted groups, much of it's harm has traditionally been accomplished through shaming. Sexual shame is a huge and very traumatizing. Add CIA sponsored Rap / Hip Hop that primarily uses ignorant, disadvantaged, teenagers to teach values to an entire generation.. then you get this sociopathic behavior.   Racism is clearly a form of mental illness. 'Normal people don't torture... only tortured people torture.' And ... anti-social people, and people with Borderline Personalty Disorder, and ... yada, yada, yada...  Freud proved back in the 19th Century that Repression doesn't work. Terence McKennea and Joseph Campbell were fond of saying culture is a trap. To go beyond what Ken Wilber calls, the second stage of human development, we have to go beyond culture.   Dear friend, thank you for your integrity in taking on this issue... but we're ALL in the cross hairs. Have you watched it's really the 'Divide and Conquer tactics that have taught black, brown, and poor whites to hate themselves? The hardened, attached Ego of Narsissistic Americans with our small, malnourished ... materialized hearts,   'The only constant in the universe is change'. It can take a lifetime for most of us to know ourselves... but the social engineers tell whites they 'know' who and what a black person is simply by the pigmentation of their skin. It means living with a lifetime of projections. It means SEEING the Narcissistic insanity, the grandiose sociopathology of abusers every day of one's life. Have you ever watch Thom Hartmann's video (or read his book) called, 'The Crash of 2016'?   Bad book title...  but excellent research. In it he DOCUMENTS the policies and legislation created to curb what Republicans call, 'The Excess of Democracy.' EVERYONE who was in the streets during the 60s and 70s are in the cross hairs. Blacks, women, LGBTQ, students ... even unions... are all in the cross hairs and they desperately don't want us to talk or organize together. They want us to always see each other not as fellow human beings ... but as, 'the other'... and it's worked. Not because of brilliant tactics... but because there's been no organized opposition to it.  Instead we see the Dark Heroes ... the Anti-Heroes and the negative manifestations of the Magician ... all dying from over-doses of heroin, Fentanyl, meth, and most toxic of all, alcohol. You can't hurt your right arm and not feel the pain throughout your whole body."

"First of all I think it's okay but being offended because he's a trans and you think that being with him would make you gay is the stupidest thing there is nothing wrong with being, getting carried away by hate in these matters will not lead you to any part do not deserve to be killed, and use it as a joke but the name of trap does not think it is wrong but it is annoying when used in a derogatory way the masculinity of men should not be affected because he likes it or even, what is the masculinity? It is not something that can be touched alone is an ideal stupid society had that it would be cool to implant that to men when it is not really something silly, men can be men without having to do all the stupidity that means this context that you find had sex with a trans that matters or that you are cheated with that, I do not think it is reason to hurt him or anything for the meaning is a person who wants to be accepted as you and in any case, the ideology that makes you less man it's something stupid and I do not support it :) let them be is my solution I do not think that the term is badly used, if not that people do it that way."

"Ok, I have a few questions regarding transgender people, as I am very confused about pronouns and things like that. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not very good at sorting information in my head, I loose track of thinks, I forget things, I'm all over the place, let's say that I have a friend, let's call him Bill, and Bill one day comes up to me and tells me 'hey Teddy, I'm not a guy, I'm actually a girl, I am going to start transitioning soon, my new name is Rose' but, because I forget things all the time, and will have a very hard time getting used to referring to Bill as Rose, as I was introduced to her as Bill, would I be bigoted of I continued to refer to her as Bill? I respect her new pronouns, but for the sake of keeping everything simple in my mind, I just refer to her as how I was introduced to her? And second question, Is it ok to refer to two transgender people I serve frequently as 'you guys'? Because I'm very Midwestern and any number of people above one, boy or girl, are referred to as 'you guys'. Ill totally understand if I'm being very rude and that I need to change, but I need to know if there is anything that needs changing"

"This is the first Contra video I've watched and you've definately earned yourself a new subscriber. This was a very very good video. But I am also a fan of Dankula, and whilst I don't think I'm politically aligned with him I do agree with his stance on free speech. I'm not suprised that you don't like him but I was still suprised that you validated his conviction. 'My dog is a nazi' is dumb and edgy and I can see why some people are offended, but criminally damaging hatespeech?"

">hate crime convict named Count Dankula nice straw man  As someone who was around on 4chan 15 years ago, I still see it as anime shitposting about transvestites intentionally misleading onlookers (not transgender/transsexual people). But I don't use the word, or visit 'trap' threads, because its meaning has been changed over time.  EDIT because why would I bother watching the whole video before I comment: I do enjoy your take of checking your privilege more as staying in your lane.  EDIT again because I never watch the whole video before I post: why argue that trans women are the same as cis women? Because they're not. Trans men are not the same as cis men. Why not agree that there are more than two categories. Oh shit, I'm arguing for more than two genders. Am I an SJW now? Trans women clearly aren't cis men, and trans men aren't cis women, so clearly attraction to trans people isn't gay. Homo (from its original greek) means the same, therefore people arguing that sex with trans people is gay are saying they are the same as trans people. Checkmate atheists.   Not really another edit, but your foundation is a little uneven.  Another frigging EDIT: I want to read Dr Jordan B Peterson's foreword to _Tucking Your Penis_"

"I had a roommate who was a 'white middle class computer programmer transwoman.' Literally that exact demographic. Worked with computers. She would openly state she didn't want to hang out with trans individuals who didn't pass, made disparaging comments about homeless trans people, and took multiple trips to Disneyland throughout the year while complaining that she then didn't have money for electrolysis and got her dermatologist to give her special deals. And yes, she would soapbox about 'we're getting murdered' and completely disregard class privilege. It made me so pissed, I was working at a mental health clinic and knew trans clients who were homeless, couldn't afford transitioning services, while she was zooming around saying things like 'I made a new friend at my trans group, I was so relieved she passes like me, so we can hang out.' But I'm cis, I felt like I couldn't call her on her bullshit, I wasn't sure what I could and couldn't say... I just tried to help my clients. And I moved.

"Great video. I certainly learned something new. At the end of the day, and this is just my opinion. 'Trap' is just a word, it's the context in which it is used and the meaning we put behind it that either makes it a positive word or negative slur. If you wanna go down a rabbit hole of words seeing as the reason we have this debate is because of Japanese Anime/Manga characters... 'Otokonoko' which is the word used in Japanese written as 'Áî∑„ÅÆÂ®ò' meaning 'boy daughter'. Otokonoko also means boy but it's written as 'Áî∑„ÅÆÂ≠ê'. Point is that it's a little better than trap but still has that connotation if the character is actually trans, then they're not actually a girl. Everyone knows 'Futanari' but this is more a word used for hermaphrodite, the word for a trans character is often 'New Half „Éã„É•„Éº„Éè„Éº„Éï'. There's also the word 'Josou Â•≥Ë£Ö' which means female clothing and would probably be a more respectful term for a crossdresser than 'boy daughter'. However having said all that, these are still words that are seen as positive connotations for people and characters particularly in Anime/Manga. These characters are quite popular and have their fans, most of which are straight males and these terms are used quite often to refer to famous ones like Astolfo or Hideyoshi. Of course, Japan has its own issues with LGBT acceptance and though it has improved over the years this is something I'm not going to go into detail here. However, I don't think erasing words is really going to solve the issues either in the west or in Japan. What we need is more videos like this that talk about the issue in a calm and serious manner. I'm happy I found this video because videos like yours help the debate. It doesn't try to shit post the issue, and it doesn't try to disregard the feelings of people who are genuinely curious or may have insecurities. It doesn't try to berate and change people who prefer their women to be 'women' and it doesn't try to put shit onto transpeople who are uncomfortable with the trap meme.  I myself don't really care what others think of me or who they think I am. If I personally am attracted to you, that means you're womanly to me, no matter what genitals you were born with, because I'm attracted to the feminine form. I identify as straight and I know what I'm attracted to in a female. I don't need to be told by anyone, no matter what part of the political spectrum they fall on what I am."
"My wife introduced me to gour videos. We both love u."
"I think the problem is making the idea of sexuality black and white.  Straight being totally penis on vagina, gay being totally penis ‚Äúon‚Äù penis.  There is a grey area where anything can happen.   I‚Äôm a man who wouldn‚Äôt want to have a sexual encounter with anyone with a penis, but I would be open to having a sexual encounter with a post-op trans woman.  This doesn‚Äôt make me strictly straight or gay, cuz those words are dumb anyway.    Just bang people you want bye bye my argument was pointless"
"Thanks. I've been dating a non-binary person for over year and they have told me stuff like this and I honestly didn't get it.

"Hey Natalie! I have an idea for the topic of a new video. There‚Äôs this epidemic hitting the online trans community (although it‚Äôs mostly trans guys) called transmedicalism, also known as ‚Äútruscum‚Äù. Some of their horrible rhetoric includes gatekeeping the trans community, erasure of non-binary identities, and the call for ostracism of de-transitioned folks. For the most part I believe this community lives on Tumblr, but I‚Äôve definitely found some YouTube trans personalities flirting with the topic as well."
"You are missing crucial facts about reality. All behaviour, including female behaviour can be traced back to the desire to not get a Darwin award. They are what must be protected to ensure they future of the species provided there is at least _a_ male left, and drives their individual behaviour., like empathy for their children and family. A man is evolutionarily replaceable in comparison. One man, no matter how overworked, scarred, mutilated or damaged can make pregnant hundreds of thousands of women, at the same time. Of course it happens to be mainly the strong, adventurous, aggressive risk taking but lucky men, regardless of damage along the way, that were the ones that were not erased from the face of the earth. Any that were were were just society's excess. It's just life for unlucky men, and still is. One woman can only have one baby at a time, for a maximum in the order of a few tens, and so each woman is worth more alive and healthy, and has been since the dawn of time. She also acts, in every part of her behavior when available to be the one that has a right to any man's sustenance and protection. That why we treat men as disposable - homelessness, war, suicide, healthcare, not caring when 'weak' men are victims of domestic abuse. Women get a multiple billion ¬£\$ lobby and support establishment to protect their interests and make sure they are looked after from cradle to grave. And why some feminists hate transwomen 'piggybacking' on their ruthlessly fought for social privileges.  Now men too _might_ want to have a say in society too, beyond just hoping to be lucky enough to look after themselves... I don't know, its a controversial opinion. But, regardless of whether men care or not about their genes being killed off - commuting gene suicide - kind of like a one person genocide - something like what people feel like when being 'erased' - for some odd reason, society shows time and again that men are always the back of the queue for empathy, even when they are actually being erased, because society knows that since the dawn of time that they are in fact replaceable. Let's just keep playing the game at, why not? Bad thing never happen when we treat men as disposable right?  One further way for a man to get a Darwin award is to have a relationship with a woman that cannot have a child, if she hides from him that she cannot have a child. Sure, up to her, it's personal and her choice not to say. Equally, some men might not want to say that they cannot have kids, or hide that they are a drug addict, or pretend they are much more wealthy than they are, despite being totally broke and in massive debt. Up to them right? He's never laying an trap. Right? It's his business whoever he happens to be.  Sure, I'm with you, it's not a trap. Men have the right to withhold any information from who they are dating, regardless of what emotion it would cause if a woman were to find out the truth about him, or what that truth was. He is what is is, and if she's attracted to him that's all she needs to know.  By the way. I'd had sex with a transwoman. But it is NOT virtuous with withhold information a potential partner. You have a right to, but that DOES NOT make it not a trap, when crucial relationship information is being withheld. Of course everyone from gay men, effeminate men, to transwomen, or  bipolar women, or anything that can effect the success of passing on genes ARE NOT TRAPS. No-one is fundamentally 'A TRAP'. But everyone is equally capable of trapping someone about the evolutionary potential, or attraction otherwise that they can offer. I do consider it immoral not to be honest about things that are fundamental to a relationship. I have facts about me that if I were to withhold from a woman, she would be within her rights to say it's just as bad as rape if I were to have a sexual relationship and withhold. I don't get to say what information being withheld is 'not a trap'. And I would NEVER tell women that it's simply my right to withhold that information, regardless of what feeling that may manifest itself in in the woman - and say it's simply my right and her concerns are just 'sexist/abelist/misandrist'.  No-one is a trap, but people can lay traps. Don't be a manipulative trap and erase someone's feeling, about what they find or chose are their dating preferences.  I'd date a transwoman, but never an incompassionate, unsympathetic, manipulative one, to anyone's dating preferences or mine.  When traps happen, they are heterophobic."

However, there are many women who like or would like to peg their boyfriends, so I wonder if for you there's a distinction between your penis and a strap on. Would you still decline being the top as it were if it wasn't actually part of your body? Or is it more the role and the action?"
"As an openly pansexual man who tends to think of all aspects of human sexuality as falling on a multi-dimensional array of axes of degree, I frequently get confused by the details of terminology for those who do not fall into the born-biologically-a specific-sex-and-psychologically-match it categories. This has been made even more confusing in conversations with both transvestites (with no true identification with non-birth-biological gender) and actual transsexual men and women (and non- and/or third gender members of our species, who I am at a total loss as to the grammar for despite having lovers who have fallen into that/those categories). I had no idea 'trap' was considered derogatory, so thanks for this video. As for what 'is' 'straight' or 'gay', I think as a society we need to move away from these binary pigeonholing modes of thinking. It really makes more sense, especially as our culture evolves, to make a statement such as 'I prefer a sexual partner who looks and behaves more feminine than not, and that has a vagina' than to simply identify as a straight male or female, for example, in that given what I have observed in real life and seen in surveys, at least of half  self-identified 'straight' men, if not publically revealed to have done so, are perfectly fine with a feminine seeming sex partner that does not, in fact, possess a vagina. A substantial minority actually prefer a female-seeming partner with a penis instead of a vagina, for that matter, but continue to enjoy sex with biological females and to self-identify as heterosexual males. I believe some entirely new paradigm may be in order, at least regarding the classification of human sexuality. What do ya'll think?"

"I like Dankula and Contra"
"@ContraPoints what would you personally suggest to replace the current gender bender and gender swap terms that are used for a variety of japanese anime, manga, and a subsection of online short stories which vary from some which tell the story of a person who is trans and their lives as they decide what to do with it and how they present and all their experiences but also with stuff such as Ranma 1/2(a boy who's body magically transforms in a way that he looks like a woman), 1/2 Prince(where a girl plays a MMOVR game where she presents herself as a man), and  Boku Girl(where a man is turned into a woman by a god and as time progresses decides that he now feels like a girl and lives their life as a girl) what should the subsection where it's people who were cis men or women who for whatever reason have an idealized body that is the opposite from how they initially have viewed themselves?  Thank you for anyone who has opinions on this, it's something I think about a good amount as one of the first manga's I read was Ranma 1/2 and since then have read a lot of manga in the genre of the whole transformation thing and think it's probably best if it's seperate from the term for a genre that is dealing with a more real-world topic such as Houro Musuko which deals with the story of two children as they grow up and as they grow up both of them think they are trans and eventually one child decides that they are not but that they still love the other and says that it means that she is a lesbian. It was a great story but it isn't the same thing as the Ranma 1/2 type of story."

"I've been skimming the comments and there is an aspect to this argument I think many people have missed. What we have here is a case of Normies(in relation to Anime) using a word that they don't fully understand.  A 'Trap' as its defined within the Anime communities is not specifically a trans-person. These are not people who identify differently than their biology, they are not exploring their identity, they are not Trans.  Like many things, a 'trap' is on a sliding scale, but the necessary character component is the INTENTIONAL deception and the reveal. The protagonist must be deceived, and the Trap's biology must be revealed. How this facet is handled depends on the show, but the deception and the reveal is a necessary character component. Sometimes its a funny 'but I'm a boy!' Sometimes its a serious exploration of gender identity. Sometimes its dark.  In short, to make a (literary) Trap, you must:  1) Have a character INTENTIONALLY misrepresenting their gender in a way that appeals to the protagonist's sexuality. Typically, but not necessarily, the Trap's sexuality is also the Protagonist's. 2) This deception must be revealed. 3) The protagonist must state his view on it in relation to his sexuality.   A trans-person is not intentionally deceptive. A trans-person's motivations are fundamentally different than a Trap's. A Trap exists in a narrative solely so the protagonist(and thus, the artist) can comment on this facet of sexuality. However, like most words that enter common parlance, the nuances have been lost. The superficial aspects of the character have become the definition rather than a component of the definition. In most cases, the answer to 'is having sex with a trap gay?' is Yes, because typically the Trap is the same gender identity and sexuality as YOU.    TL;DR: Trans people aren't traps. Traps are gay. Normies ruin everything."
"How do you feel about traps in a so-called 'legitimate' fetish sense, where the female-presenting person specifically is understood by the 'trapped' to be a male, and the actual maleness of the trap is the fetish?  I understand why it is unacceptable to even imply that a trans woman is a trap, but I think that your response to it, which affirms the femininity of trans women, takes the point of this unacceptability in the wrong direction. It's not wrong to call a trans woman a trap because trap refers to trans women, it's wrong to call trans women traps because trap DOES NOT refer to trans women. The implication, as you said yourself, is that a trap identifies as male, and that calling a trans woman a male is transphobic (which it is). Well...what if the person identifies as male, and is cross-dressing for fetish reasons of feigning womanhood for the fantasy of 'turning' a straight man? It would be misgendering to call them female.  You don't even have to go on porn sites to find people who have a fetish for being tricked. Real life escorts often take juuust enough HRT to grow breasts and feminize themselves, but not enough to inhibit the function of their penis. While these people CAN be understood as being non-binary, the context, usage, and physiology of their penises is in fact masculine. Feminization and female presentation aren't enough, on their own, to make someone trans. Many gay men act in feminine ways and don't even use their penises in a masculine fashion, but are still considered male and identify themselves as male.  I'm not saying that it's important to protect these people's right to be filthy perverts over the right of trans people to not be made uncomfortable or attacked. But if the word 'trap' is a slur because it's used to misgender trans people...well, there are lots of words that do the same thing that we don't have a problem with because of legitimate use and identification elsewhere. I would be upset if people stopped calling me a 'man', even though calling a t-girl a 'man' would be offensive, harmful, and bigoted.  Personally, I feel that this is the root of the confusion around whether or not traps are gay - two conflicting and competing definitions. One is problematic and transphobic, but the other is not really discussed. In fact, the people I met who told me traps were gay tended to be bisexual men who used 'trapping' to explore their own male-focused sexuality in a safe way, and went on to have very gay experiences with male-presenting men who just happened to be a little bit twinky and effeminate because that's what they liked (and who doesn't love a nice twink?). It wouldn't be the first time oppressive attitudes about sex and sexuality interfered with the way men express homosexual attraction."
"That trap beat on 'the surgery' slide was meta as fuck."
"I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that you barely went over the differences between cross-dressers, transsexuals, and transvestism. The problem lies with the fact that so many people don't know the differences and put all of them under the same category. It makes it hard for men who just want to wear female clothing to live out their lives without people thinking they want to get HRT or cut their genitals off. Cross-dressers are a COMPLETELY different category from transsexuals or transvestites. Also a good chunk of this video felt like you lacked the knowledge of anime and otaku culture, since the most well-known traps currently are Felix Argyle and Astolfo (The pink haired anime character you had a framed portrait of for most of the video), both being just guys who just wear girls clothing because they enjoy doing it and nothing else. Most 'traps' in anime also being just guys with girls clothing: AKA cross-dressers. I also find it a bit odd and even hypocritical to be using such words like 'transvestite' when those can be considered derogatory too.   Either way, in regards to the word trap I think it would be fine to take back the word much like African-Americans took back the n-word. As a pansexual person, I personally use it in a positive context to define someone very attractively female despite myself knowing that they are, or once were, a man. There's no reason why words cannot gain a positive connotation even if they once had a negative one. Language evolves, and so can we."
"yes"
"You‚Äôre a genius. plz never stop this, miss contrapoints"
"You talk bad about cis white males reactions to trans. Then say most the crimes are from other races???"
"uhm excusez moi hetero man here and i worship and appreciate the vagina like the holy passage it is"
"Because of silly start I prematurely disliked the video, I thought it's gonna be Riley Dennis v2: rationalizing being offended at a meme (your description tho) thru pseudo-intelligent psychoanalysis. But I'm giving your videos a chance because I want to fight my biases and cognitive dissonance and you've already convinced me on few matters.  Immediately after that start you bring up murders of trans people which already sold me on the idea of not calling transwomen traps. However... this extreme contrast feels formulaic because you fuck around in the cold open and then you make one of the strongest arguments you ever made. In fear of people clicking off the video I'd cut to the chase and just start from 3:16."
"traps r gey lel"
"'Roll credits!' Me: panics and checks how much time is left in the video. You got me good!"
"You're a fucking goddess."
"If you don't like Contra that's pretty gay"
"I just found you from the Incels video and have been binge watching ever since - I rarely comment on youtube but I find your videos so incredibly eloquent and informative (and funny!). They go so deep into logic, psychology and sexuality - I learnt so much. But more importantly now I feel like I have a better language to express support for my transwomen friends if ever these kinds of topics come up, so THANKYOU."
"Hi Natalie, I love your videos. You are smart, creative, funny and very beautiful. Keep bringing amazing content our way please, Youtube is much more wholesome since you are in my feed."
"Idk why you are in my recommendations. But I like it. Subbed so quick."
"I'm so glad that you shouted out ThePedanticRomantic  and linked her video. She's one of my favorite youtubers in the Anime community right now, so I'm happy that you took notice of her."
"People are people and attractive is attractive. Does it really matter if it makes you gay or not. Who are you living for?"
"If youre attracted to a person that looks and acts like a woman, youre probably not gay. It doesnt really matter what they have between their legs."
"<3"
"Yeah a man liking a dick is gay not a complex concept mate, not that theres anything wrong with it but people who like traps just have to accept that they're gay."
"Fuck terfs."
"Second video I've ever watched of you and wow. It can be so hard to find the perfect arguments, meaning the ones that aren't overused and tired punchlines. And you're doing it constantly. Without actually indulging bigotry. This channel is a revelation."
"No matter what anyone says, you are indeed a woman. What conviced me was the male bashing and shame with no reason at all."
"0:10 as a gay girl, I'm so fucking attracted to you in this... costume? outfit? gown?"
"Calling the Scotsman with the nazi dog a 'hate crime convict' (or whatever) was kinda gay tbh, whatever you think of him personally (or don't, as in my case) that conviction was orwellian shit"
"God you're awesome! Loved this video. So thoughtful and entertaining."
"There was a survey, people answered their opinions, showing that out of people‚Äôs personal response, which may have been falsified, a majority of heterosexual cisgendered individuals stated they would not date someone who is transgender or queer in any way. A similar trend was reported by homosexual cisgendered individuals. Bisexual, pansexual, and queer individuals reported that a majority would date transgender individuals. Nearly all cisgendered individuals that reported they would date a transgender individual states they would date based on biological sex and not the gender of the person. Cisgendered straight males and lesbian females stated in the survey that they would date trans men. While cisgendered straight females and homosexual men stated in the survey that they would date trans women.  This is all self reported and may be inaccurate."
"You are very smart, and beautiful. Greetings from Greece...You are a better looking version of Anne Coulter : ) (meant as a compliment)"
"Contra, I love every single video you make. I always learn something new, you present information in a very clear, concise, and compelling way, the scripts are funny, informative, thought provoking.. and that make up.... love it. you are so honest, so open, I feel like the person I'm seeing is REAL, even if it's (presumably) scripted. I'm so glad you have chosen to make videos, the world needs more people like you <3"
"This is such a well done video, and you look beautiful."
"We are so fucking blessed to have this channel. It's not enough that Nat is intelligent, articulate and educated, she's also hysterically funny, entertaining and just totally, utterly lovely."
"Asks to have camera panned down. Does it herself."
"Cant you still get aids or something? yes yall do the hormones thing but u still r biologically a man serious question"
"have you also gotten curious and have taken Jordan Peterson's personality test 'understand myself' ContraPoints?  lets compare the percentile scores"
"Natalie is giving me Celine Dion realness in that choker. Excellent video"
"Please link where your mesh shirt is from! I love it!!"
"You are wonderful. You are a real woman. You are a gift to this, mostly stupid, world. Be safe, love."
"creature"
"Thank you for representing."
"You're bloody brilliant as usual"
"I find myself in a moral and ideological predicament. Me and you are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, or so I have come to believe. Yet, I can not bring myself to hate you. My peers, those who would ideologically sympathize with me, and would be politicians who vie for my vote would have me hate you, but I can not bring myself to do so.  Instead of hating you I found myself slowly sympathizing with you, questioning my convictions and questioning as to whether my vision is one of fantasy or one of a warped reality.  After deliberation, unironic meditation, and personal insight, I have come to a conclusion. As much as I should hate you, even want to hate you, I can't.  I have always taken a defensive stance when it comes to dealing with the left who have ventured too far into the space of the right. Waiting for those on the left to begin their attacks and their merciless attempts at strangling any rightwing opinion that dissents from their own.   Though I have always had the simple weakness of sympathizing with those that show empathy. Where you can strike, you feint. You show sympathy to those among us who are fallen and broken, showing that you understand their reasoning, or (unlike the others) you at least try.  Like I did, they have to journey through the pain to find what they behold to be true. Like an incel or your average internet nazi, they both make the journey.  You have explained to the best of your ability as to why and what their views are.  Many of them do not finish the journey to enlightenment, some fall off the trail, some become happy and try to forget about the journey, and some simply, sadly, kill themselves instead of continuing through the pain.  If there is ever a 'Day Of The Rope' scenario, I seriously do hope that you get away. If you do not survive I do hope that some people remember you, you are what the left should strive to be. The emotional desire to act is a fickle thing but, as of now, when I rule I hope to unite us all, you included. Continue to empathize and try to understand those among the right. If you do this, you can unite us instead of dividing us."
"Just came across ContraPoint on Snoozer SB Sunday and enjoyed, among many other things, a torrent of words well into the night.¬† I thought, I felt, I laughed, I cried, I . . . well, never mind that.¬† I think I'm in love . .¬†."
"Natalie, thank you for always going the extra mile to explain things in a way that helps everyone understand, and for always putting yourself out there by exposing your inner most private thoughts and feelings which can subject you to cruelty. What you do is so greatly appreciated."
"I watched all your videos and I'm glad to have found your channel. It's really good to hear well arguments from the left to contrast the arguments of the right and bring equilibrium in YouTube.   BTW I laughed my shit out when I heard female penis. It was so funny lol. Sorry for that.  I loved to have watched your evolution. Please keep going with your videos they are really entertaining and informative."
"ive never felt so happy for a video. not only was it absolutely on point throughout but it educated me on some shit i may have been ignorant about before."
"Contra I'm getting you like you but you and I both know that 5:12 is misleading as shit.  Also I dislike your critique of extreme masculinity at 35:47. Nobody would be like that if it wasn't socially advantageous or sexy to be that way."
"The real question most people mean when they ask 'are traps gay?' is 'do I have to feel shame for this boner?', and I feel like just like the first question the answer is 'It really boils down to all the convoluted world views you may or may not have.'"
"I can't like this video hard enough"
"If traps are gay does that make men who date ftm trans men straight? Interesting enough I'm a cis woman who finds many trans men attractive and I've never worried if it makes me a lesbian. It just reinforced that I have a preference for pretty men.  It's sad but not surprising that it's made so much more an issue for straight men."
"I'd never heard this term 'trap' before.    Great video.  I appreciate you calling out everyone, including liberal 'allies', and white women (and of course, transphobes and white dudebros).  And explaining a whole bunch of stuff."
"Its pretty ridiculous youre a materialist have a metaphysical conception of being a woman (which youre not)."
"You should talk to P. Andrew Torrez about incorporating as an LLC, both for medical benefits and tax breaks."
"This channel is so fucking cool."
"<3"
"This channel is my salvation from the conservative side of YouTube. Thank you for your rational arguments and helping me have a deeper understanding of gender."
"A similar topic that I struggle with is as a non binary person is I have people who express their attraction towards me but say theyre 100% straight/gay, even when I point out that half of people that meet me think Im female and the other people think I'm male. Of course I am not here to tell people what their sexuality is, but I have felt hurt by this insistence because it feels like an erasure of identity. I think human sexuality is very complicated and people get too hung up on identifying as being attracted to one particular gender when their subconconcious may if even occasionally suggest otherwise."
"Tbh i just gotta say this and hope it's not creepy but you lookin' like a snack honey"
"You might be the best YouTuber ever."
"I never considered post-op trans women as traps. I always figured it was more referring to pre-op cross dressers who are specifically targeting straight men. Like how there are gay men out there that try to seduce straight men.  I figured that was the trap because the lure was intentional and predatory in nature.  Not just 'oops turns out she was pre-op.'"
"You realize violence against Trans POC is commited by other POC. In fact blacks and Hispanics are statically more homophobic than whites, otherwise the Caribbean, The Middle East, Africa and Latin America wouldn't be so dangerous for homosexuals."
"Being someone who is Pansexual, it's very odd to see the 'gay' panic that some straight guys have"
"She looks like a trap to me"
"for the subject matter, this video is getting an overwhelmingly positive response. that's amazing, contrapoints has done it again"
"I won't suddenly say I don't identify with a lot of things Count Dankula, Skeptic, Blaire White etc have to say and that their videos don't also entertain but I'm glad I've found a leftie YouTubers who doesn't embarrass themselves in each video they make. You're killing it girl!"
"this is the highest quality video of all time, amazing"
"The un-trappenning."
"Thank you for another intelligent, compassionate and entertaining video, Natalie! A perfect summary of the questions that many people have, even if they feel embarrassed to admit they have them.  I did  want to share a debate I had been having with myself lately, as it relates to the questions in your video. I had been wondering, 'Is there a difference between a male butthole and a female butthole?' I am a (mostly) straight cis-man, but moderately open-minded when it comes to sex. I have been grappling with the issue in my head that eating out a female butthole (when clean, of course) was perfectly acceptable and hot as hell for me, but eating out a male butthole on the other hand, even when clean, made me feel a little queasy. Intellectually, my brain kept saying, 'What's the difference?', but on a primitive level it also kept saying, 'But there is a difference though, right?'  Now, this is obviously something I need to work on myself, I am not at all saying that there is a difference. But it goes to show I think how disconnected from facts and reality something like sexual attraction can truly be. It's a messy ball of chemicals and feelings that can warp the truth so much that you end up fundamentally believing that there is any meaningful difference between male and female buttholes.  Anyway, again, love you and your channel, hope you are doing well!"
"I'd like to hear your take on the Scottish hate crimes convict, because I only know what he told me about the subject."
"12:24 callin out the wine-mums"
"With a title like this how could i not click on it  And graphic displays of anime? Sign me up!  Edit: instructional videos! Comedy skits! This is pretty great but i was lied to about there being anime"
"i'm very pro TRAP.  WHOEVER, i'd never call a trans woman a trap. A trap for me has always being a cross-dresser or a very androgynous young male. If identify as a woman is not a trap in my book."
"In a weird way, it kind of pleases me to think that I'm not seeing any ridiculous and ignorant comments on this video because those kinds of people are too scared of clicking the video because they don't want to accidentally find you attractive and fall down the gay hole for eternity"
"You are a fucking QUEEN!!! Your video editing is absolutely delightful, I was laughing the entire time. Keep up the great work, and know that you are touching the hearts of queer babes everywhere!"
"As someone hardcore into the anime community, I find most of us don't consider actual trans characters (such as Lily Hoshikawa) traps, but rather characters like Astolfo are traps. Hideri Kanzaki is a gray area because he seems to indentify female but... It's not as explicitly... It's hard because he's fictional character and it's skewed by the creators who. The creators of Blend S are Not Woke lol"
"Riley Dennis and Anne Coulter's love child."
"Liked your video until you started peddling the phrase 'real men,' which is a highly sexist, homophobic term used to reinforce toxic masculinity and make sure that non-conforming men are singled out as 'less than.'  All men are equally real, and there is no progressive use of that phrase, same thing with 'little boys.'  You sound like Ben Shapiro shouting 'fa^^ot."
"Horse Cum"
"So I try to be the understanding, tolerant liberal but I'm actually pretty ignorant. Your channel has taught me a lot, and I appreciate that. Thanks for doing what you do"
"You're such a fucking hon Contra it's not even funny honey.  I'd pick Kuato from Total Recall any day over your crusty ass fuckhole bitch.  Muah"
"This video was in my recommendations and now I love her now XD"
"Oh my god. Shemale Shenanigans. Sounds like a band."
"Loved the video, one weird thing is that the painting at 13:37 is the same that's on the front cover of white nationalist Jared Taylor's book 'White Identity', which was shown in the documentary 'alt right, age of rage'. Does anyone know if this painting was created for this book, or if it is prior art?"
"1. YOU ARE A TRANS?! I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE! GUESS I'M A GAY NOW.  2. Nice points you bring out; namely, the motive of 'trans panic' is pride, but not fear. Seriously, if you get attracted by someone over the exterior which is really, and I'm saying this only as matter of fact and not of contempt, 'designed' to look like sex of your 'alignment,' then it's fucking normal, and if you feel like blaming someone for the fact that someone you get attracted to is a trans, then you should blame. and have only to blame, yourself for it.  3. The English association of female-looking-male to a trap is very interesting now that I think about it, and you make a good point why it may be harmful to nonchalantly use. Namely, it is not hard to imagine calling someone 'trap' would affect someone's subconsciousness to shift the 'blame.' The literal Japanese or Korean word describing such a person is... well... 'femboys' without much of the negative connotation associated with it. In some sense, the cultures of these Far Eastern countries revere feminine beauty (for example, look at the pop industry of these countries and see what sort of males form successful boy-bands). Of course, this is not to say that there is no homophobia in these countries, but it is far from the almost forced dichotomy of gender identity of the western culture.  4. Even then, is 'trap' as much of a slur as 'nigger? And this is my point: is it really a word that is being used, and has no other use than, to insult? I mean, shemale or tranny may be; but I find it hard to see 'trap' as being so insidious. As you point out earlier, to most people with a normal sense of morality, 'trap' is literally just a matter of meme, and they don't particularly try to associate real-world equivalents. The problem of this kind of argument that tries to establish moral hierarchy is exactly this: it just cannot be disassociated from 'all things must be scrubbed of any offense' attitude."
"Yo, question, at the risk of being even more of a weeaboo, what of the crossdressers who still ID as male, or genderqueer? Admittedly, Japan (and Asia, as someone who is Asian) both have very different views on sex and sexuality - and that isn't necessarily better or worse, given that feminism is such a huge issue in Korea and Japan."
"This is a fantastic video on sexuality and giving us a glimpse into the struggles of trans-women. I can understand why trans people take offense to the term trap, and I believe even amongst the people who use the phrase there's confusion over what it actually refers to.  I say this because I never saw 'trap' as referring to trans-women, but rather people who identified as male, but presented as female, usually with sexual intention. Youtubers like VRTrapman and ReesesSkater come to mind when I think of traps. I see it as a separate thing entirely from trans.  But the problem is I can't speak for other people who've used the term so idk if they see it the same way I do, or if they use it to refer to trans people."
"'fewer truffle notes'  You are so damn funny.  I love your videos."
"I understand your dislike of Count Dankula, however by portraying him as some sort of Nazi-like figure, you sink to the level of the far right who constantly portray people like you as communists"
"I found your channel about a week ago and it's already one of my new favorites. Your videos are so informative, entertaining, and beautifully shot! <3"
"Dear Youtube, why isn't Queen ContraPoints verified yet? Have you not experienced the mouthfeel as of late?"
"'sorry your vagina sucks?', Me 'literally or metaphorically?'"
"Fuck me this has me questioning everything now."
"Now I feel less guilty about wanting to bang contrapoints"
"I love your videos and I think there's few channels that produce such quality and entrainment as yours"
"Your hair looks great!!!!"
"Point 3:06 ... I'm sold ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
"Really good approach.  I appriacte this,but you should have used the ''THAT WAS PATHETIC'' from MK, it would have been SOOOOOOOOO good. Take notes next time missy !"
"that choker is ICONIC"
"All of us are at least half female. Everyone has at least one Y chromosome."
"one of the peaks of your lip is higher than the other"
"I've just realised that is video is essentially about the Kinsey Scale"
"Yeah I don't necessarily understand the whole trans/trap/drag queen community but I still hope they can live safe and happy lifes"
"If a straight cis man does not want to have a relationship with a trans woman because she has a penis, does that make him a transphobic?"
"You educate me so much in these topics. I'm so grateful to have found you."
"natalie i love you"
"Fuck you anime‚Äôs is great       I‚Äôm not actually pissed. But I do like anime   Love"
"I always assumed that this was just otaku shit-posting, never really found it funny but I'd like posts about it anyway, I'm ready for this video to prove me wrong (as well as enjoy how absolutely amazing ur aesthetics are)"
"I am sorry but ''feminine penis'' is an oxymoron to me. I like your videos, even when I don't agree with much of what is said."
"I blame the parents"
"she drinks white wine, invalid"
"i mean i just assume everything is gay unless told otherwise. that chair? gay. the ceiling? gay. my lesbian bro? gay"
"It is fantastic, having moments where you are pushed to reevaluate how you think, speak, relate, and recognize opportunity to evolve.  You make people better, and I personally cannot think of a better validation of worth.  Thank you for your work."
"I'm white and I'm sick right now, but nothing made me want to throw up more than that white guy saying 'the ethnostate'"
"contrapoints is sassy as f*ck, cool as f*ck and smart as f*ck. she owns youtube 2019 <3 x"
"i‚Äôm just watching this video for the thousandth time (as i do with all your videos) and i was wondering if you would ever make a video about TERFs and white feminists?"
"Daddy Dankula literally did nothing wrong."
"This is COMPLETELY off-topic, but as an artist, WHAT IS THAT LIGHTING AND HOW THE HELL DOES IT WORK?!"
"'It's centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle' You're definitely a woman in my books,  but that is the gayest shit I've ever heard lmao"
"The issue is the definition of the word 'gay.' In context, the word 'gay' is being used as shorthand for sexual deviation in general, or homoerotic-leaning sexual deviation in particular. In essense, when one asks, 'are traps gay?' one is asking if dating (or otherwise carnally interacting with) is a form of homoerotic-leaning sexual deivation. The answer to that question, according to the traditional male-purity code, is quite clearly 'yes'."
"I am gobsmacked that a video titled 'Are Traps Gay?' led to the most interesting and informative conversation on sex and sexuality I've ever seen. You are weaving dross of dogmatism into the gold of understanding. And that bejeweled brow on the Half-Queen make-up looks amazing. I love your make up."
"LOVE THE USE OF THAT POPE INNOCENT X PAINTING"
"I'm pretty sure that usually, trap refers to a guy who identifies as a guy but dresses like a girl. I personally consider traps and trans  two different terms because of this."
"‚ÄúI wish I was a guy‚Äù god dammit! üòÇ"
"10:00 I think it's wrongheaded and regressive to claim you cant talk about the experiences of transwomen of color because you are white. I think that statement contradicts an earlier point you made about meeting folks where they are at. Many white folks refuse to listen to people of color, and therefore you have an advantage over giving white folks the other side of the argument. Beyond that, it is also a tacit denial of the value of 2nd hand experience, which only serves the forces of reaction because it neatly fits into their narrative, mainly that the world revolves around their narrow point of view.  You don't need to be a different skin tone to understand the best interests of the working class. If it would make you more comfortable, I'd suggest extensive research on the narratives of transwomen of color, including conversations with that community, to be able to better comprehend the nuances of their stories. But under no circumstance does your social racial or economic status preclude you from understanding then relaying the struggles of these folks."
"Omg you are so amazing. I subbed and everything. Keep up the good work! This is so amazing."
"I love this. I feel like I've learned a lot about trans women and myself too"
"Natalie, I love you, but you really mis-represented Count Dankula.  He taught his girlfriends dog to do a Nazi salute as a joke, he didn‚Äôt beat up a Muslim kid or anything."
"Wow."
"Hello, I am new to the channel, and this happened to be the first video I saw.  I thought it was so informative on a topic I had never heard of despite being an anime fan.  Also god damn are you funny. I had to pause at least three times to stop laughing in order to hear the great info.  The mouthfeel part was killing me.  So I‚Äôve now learned not to use a word I didn‚Äôt know was a thing and I passed it on to my two nephews and suggested they check out the channel.  Anyway I‚Äôve watched almost all the vids now and so glad I did.  It has sent me down some ugly rabbit holes but I‚Äôm always of the opinion it‚Äôs better to be informed/educated about things even if it does make you feel icky. How else are we supposed to change things and make them better for everyone? Well just wanted to say I‚Äôm a fan and anyone talking shit about makeup is crazy, every look you pull is absolutely fantastic.  I thought for sure you must have had a professional makeup person to do it, making these videos must take forever just for that.  I was in from the second the video started with your spooky lady(sorry don‚Äôt know her name yet). Foppington I think is my favorite, but they are all amazing characters and you bounce them all off each other so well to prove your points.  Oh can‚Äôt leave out regular Natalie, love love love. There that about covers it.  Keep up the great work, thanks for making me feel better about living in this insane time in history with our lying fascist liar of a president. Oh and I‚Äôve been a huge jon waters fan and going to rocky(yes that is my real name) since high school a million years ago and any references to them in utube videos makes me happy, so keep that up too.  Thanks again, Rah!"
"It's not exactly something I can show people to convince them but I never thought it was gay to be attracted to trans people because I'm bisexual and when I find a trans woman attractive it's in the same way I find cis women attractive. Not at all like a guy, even feminine twinky cis men."
"so why are crossdresses not traps ?"
"This week on Out of Context quotes: 'I'm thinking of signing up for a vagina.' All jokes aside, knocked it out of the park, as usual."
"I'm a trans guy and I have nothing but respect for my trans sisters. Y'all seem to get so much more shit than we do (probably because straight cis men are so much more insecure about their identities than straight cis women) (or maybe because our society views femininity as inferior and thus anyone who would choose it over masculinity as inferior) and I'm glad you made this video to combat it. I love how blunt yet thorough this video is, because being delicate and vague about this topic frankly has gotten us nowhere. Straight people are so afraid to seriously consider the question 'Is it gay to date trans people?' (either for fear of offending people or for fear that the answer will undermine their masculinity) that they just avoid it altogether by not dating trans people! As a very single straight trans guy (and generally as a human with feelings), this bums me out. You won't know if you like it until you try! It's okay if you don't, and it's okay if you do, but just sitting there like a wimp and crying 'gay!' will never get you anywhere üòä."
"I use the term trap, but never in reference for individuals that are Transgender. But ones that identify as men but look feminine who often hate to be mistaken for a woman."
"Misinformed's video was better, and came out earlier, too."
"At 17:27 These Terfs sound like the epitome of the Garfunkel and Oates song 'Pregnant Women are Smug'. They probably are annoying when they're pregnant."
"ContraPoints I just want to really share how much your videos have meant to me, today's the first day I'm able to spend dressed as a woman for most of the time (still not quite having the courage to take this in front of anyone, what with still being solidly in the Literally Doctor Frankenfurter' phase). I had a teleconference for work and was actually able to feel a level of confidence that I'm not sure I've EVER felt. What you do really matters."
"11 : 05  'words are dangerous'. Sorry but no, meanings are dangerous. And when taken somewhat litterally, trap is kind of a dangerous meaning but really preventing its use will NEVER prevent any unstable unsecure violent man to feel that way and commit an horror"
"Are traps gay? the bisexual answer coming through,  If it's a crossdresser, a femboy, or a twink, it's really gay because they look like women but they consider themselves to be man and have masculine characteristics, making you gay.  If it's a transgendered person, they were originally a man with more female characteristics than other men, and when they transition they have more feminine characteristics than masculine ones, making them women and therefore not gay."
"Fuck me, a 44 minute video to say one word? The word, by the way, is yes.   _look at this dude_"
"I'm from CIScinnaty"
"Wait wait wait, if Contra couldn't show her chest on YouTube wouldn't that be an admittance by American society that she's female? By default men's chests are allowed in all forms of visual media. I rest my case."
"'Scottish hatecrime convict'  That's a distasteful, woefully inaccurate portrayal of count dankula.  I enjoy your videos and I don't think you're stupid or a bad person or anything of the sort, and best of luck with your transition etc, but that particular remark was it for me. Count Dankula isn't perfect but he's just a dude memeing, to cast him in this light (even as a joke a lot of people might not recognize as one) is a bit shitty, so I'm just gonna have to stop this there and finally hit unsubscribe I'm afraid."
"I think it's hot when a trap says I'm not a real woman I have a dick and I say I know and I'm okay with that now let me suck you're 9 inch dick"
"I agree with most of your points but you've probably lost vast majority of people who you were targeting this video at when you started talking about 'feminine penis'. I mean, do you really think insecure, probably homophobic, borderline anti-sjws are going to accept the concept of 'feminine penis'? If they were thrown off by that, then it invalidated, in their eyes, every solid point you've made prior to that."
"To be honest there are a lot of women who date exclusively heterosexual, from their perspective 'normal', men so for men there is an extra need to appear heterosexual no matter how you actually lean, even after you grow up from the childhood schoolyard years of 'eww you're gay lmao'. A bisexual man is way less desirable than a heterosexual man for many women and some even outright reject them. It's a pretty reasonable strategy to be a straight man who is secretly down for some dick if need be rather than a public bisexual man for most people."
"You said a man isnt gay if they are attracted to a trans women who has been on hormones for a while what about men attracted to a trans women who hasnt been on hormones, is he gay? Im trans but not on hormones rn and now im self conscious about the guy im seeing"

"Thank you so much for this. I really needed to hear this, especially the last part. As a cis white male, this is not something I have to think about in my day to day life, so I have a really pathetic understanding of what trans women (and men) have to go through. This is eye opening."

"Unrelated to the video, but I would love to hear your stance on ≈Ωi≈æek. It seems that you and him share the criticism of the left as being out of touch with the 'common people' and consequently causing more people to become infatuated with extremist right wing movements.   I would also like to know what you think of his 'Don't act, just think.' maxim, the idea that the left needs to prioritize its goals focusing on economic and ecological problems, and only after those have been solved dealing with the social ones.  Keep up the good work, you are very entertaining and insightful! :)"

"Your 'woman/man'hood is a sham, every act of self deception is an act of self harm, there's no shame in accepting who you are, your inability to complete the transition, and there's no shame in attempting to pass, as long as you understand that you nature is still built on that of your chromosomal foundation  By deluding yourself into thinking you've achieved the technologically impossible - you only further bolster the fragility of your ego, by tacking on more cognisantly untrue bullshit  The ideological position that trans people are in fact the gender they've 'transitioned' into, this is the biggest reason trans people commit suicide, because internally they've never accepted their true nature, but they know themselves not to fulfill the gender they identify as  This self internalized inconsistency, this inadequacy, this delusion within themselves drives them into a suffering they perceive as worse than death  you do far more harm than good by presenting this delusion"

"You say white trans women arent being murdered but one of the first example you give is a white trans woman who was murdered and stuffed under a mattress. When people talk about the statistics of black trans women being disproportionately murdered they vaguely tie it to racism but dont explain why. Who is murdering these women? Black men? White men? If most of these murders are being committed by black men what does that say about the vague claims that some kind of racism is responsible for the murders? This always bugs me."
"SMH, WRONG, fucking straw-man much being trans doesn't make you a trap, the question is not 'are trans gay?' its 'are traps gay', the answer being more nuanced than it first seems  TRAP: definition 1. a device or enclosure designed to catch and retain animals, typically by allowing entry but not exit or by catching hold of a part of the body. 'the squirrels ravaged the saplings, despite the baited traps' (this clearly cannot describe a human activity)  2.* a situation in which people lie in wait to make a surprise attack. 'we were fed false information by a double agent and walked straight into a trap' (this however adequately describes a human activity)  the second description is clearly the origin for the slang use of 'trap'  WHY? because you have to think about the word in terms of perspective: a trap in & of itself is something that requires an unsuspecting victim for its full effect a trap is something hidden, that cannot be identified until close inspection, without inspection or falling victim to it, the victim does not perceive a trap when sprung however the victim is now aware of the trap, they have two choices, allow themselves to be engulfed 'accepting the trap', or evade to the best of ones ability  in the real world a trans person is not actually the sex they present as, their chromosomes remain unchanged. those who 'pass' may allow someone to advance them under the pretense they are the sex they present as, this is what is referred to as 'the trap', when the mistaken seeker realizes their blunder, but continues to advance, they have accepted the biological GAYNESS of said trap  thus 'TRAPS ARE GAY'"

"After some mental digestion and, cognitive contemplation I see some ,relevant points to what ,your saying.  Killing people is just fucked up usually deals with,  sociopathic behavior.    I don't condone killing people human life is precious and loss of it is a tremendous tragedy.  Usually people who are transgender or a cross dresser have, had pretty dramatic loves being either physically , emotionally or sexually abused or bullied.   This creates a really confused behavior in their own personal and sexual identity. It's a shame that such things occur create unstable mind set according to sexual orientation and preference.    Trying to come from a psychological stanza doesn't change the fact that a person who is man takes a some hormones doesn't change fact that their still a man.  Transgender is created gender for confused people trying to truly discover who ,they really are, have internal war dealing with their own place in society.   If your perception is that a transwoman isn't gay then no amount of debating or argumentation is going to change that view but,to say biologically that a transwoman is a woman is woman biological is giving a false perception of reality."
"The first time I got asked 'are traps gay' I thought of the only trap definition I had in mind with the song Panda at the back of my head and concluded 'I dont know. I don't  listen to enough of them.' The person who asked me this laughed so hard he almost chocked."

"Always had the dilemma about dating a transgender woman, since I was kind of afraid of 'not performing' very well on the first night we spend together and putting this guilt on myself and also making my date feel bad. Now that you've mentioned that being anxious about your first time with a transgender woman (as a heterosexual man) is normal, i don't really feel this feeling anymore. Never really cared about sexuality or gender as long as I enjoyed the person, even though I feel pretty hetero in my sexual preferences. None of my friends would really care if I dated a transgender woman, as long as I'm happy, and I've been judged all my life from other people becouse I look different than the norm in my country, so I kind of learned not to give a shit about other people's opinion, so it wasn't even a masculinity or an ego. I guess it was just angst that I had, since during an intimate moment my brain fires up and most of the time I have no idea where the thoughts are gonna go and how they will reflect in the real world and the last thing Iwant to do is make someone feel bad becouse I overthinkshit. Anywho, love your videos, love the progress in your channel and the quality of your videos and sketches and I hope I see a lot more of them in the future ^^"
"Traps are defiantly NOT gay. It's fine every once in a while bending over a nice tight boy pussy, honestly it's beneficial for the soul. Hey you might even get a good reach around in the process."
"Thank you for the illuminating content. As a person who has a dot matrix type sexuality I had no idea idea about the stigma around the word trap. As you stated initially, I thought it revolved around the segue between anime, trans and the people that inhabited it. My first exposure was the girl Line Trap who eventually became Harley Quinn. I figured ‚Äútrap‚Äù was tongue and cheek and the people that enjoyed this intersection were in on the joke. Admittedly I do not pay attention to any of these alt right fuckfaces so I was not aware of the ‚Äúare traps gay‚Äù meme. I was just swimming in Tumblr the entire time where the word ‚Äútrap‚Äù seemed to be embraced by both girl and boy. Now I know the complete story thanks to you."

"19:00 Chromosomes aren't metaphysics. Genes play a heavy role in not only sexual orientation, but also the body odours we produce, which greatly influence who we're attracted to. No amount of surgery will prevent a transgendered woman from producing the scent typical of a biological male. At the very least your argument fails with regards to the sense of smell outright. The matter of sight and touch are likely also not favouring your position; it kind of condemns you to arguing a separation of secondary sex characteristics and genes. All in all, you're making biological arguments typical of a philosophy student."

"Didn't Venus repeatedly rape her clients by lying to them about her biological sex, thus depriving them of the ability to give informed consent? Why is 'trans-panic' ascribed to the psychotic break of a rape victim after their sexual self-identity has been shattered for their rapist's personal gain? I'm not saying Venus deserved to die, but how is at all okay to pretend a serial-rapist is an innocent victim? Is the way in which she perpetrated her rapes less hideous than 'real' rape? Is it not as bad because the victims were heterosexual men?"

"I often think about cismen (& this applies to ciswomen or any actually) that have criteria of what a man is are more aspiring to be something they quite obviously are not otherwise why pose the question as a goalpost(?). A man simply sees their behaviours as indicative of being a man because they are men which is why setting goalposts is unnecessary and damaging.  What I find troubling is the stark duality of the questions ‚Äúare/is [insert behaviour here] gay?‚Äù as if there are only 2 alternatives and shows an inherent bias against bisexuality. Why is it is bisexuality is not an option? How is it if someone is obviously straight in all perceptions of them selves and others suddenly completely the opposite due to one thing but the answer never offers up ‚ÄúBi‚Äù as an alternative. Not saying it‚Äôs a valid answer because it‚Äôs not a valid question.  I mean ‚ÄúTop‚Äù, ‚ÄúBottom‚Äù blah, what about the commonly excluded ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù.  Now that‚Äôs a ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù often over looked *winks*."

"Contrapoints, this is a great video and I support your quest to get a vagina, but as a lifetime lover of anal myself I would like to point out that there is no amount of eating well that prevents the poop scenario. Eventually, it happens. Unless you douche, which is very unhealthy, and that is the cold reality the queer community needs to confront sooner rather than later imo #ProtectGayColons"
"As a straight guy, I would have to really love someone who is trans to date them. I'm attracted to women, and it might make me less of a man but it matters to me if they are biologically female. I'm only going to do what I am comfortable doing, so even if it is baggage I don't really care.  Count Dankula's hate crime conviction was unjust and your portrayal of him is wrong."
"Fantastic video with a lot of original, nuanced, logical thought behind it. The part that kind of blindsided me was the big about men's relationship to their bodies...I (a straight cis man) recently had my nipples touched by a partner for the first time in my life and immediately recoiled because the stimulation felt wrong and weird, but I didn't know why it felt like that. I think it may have a lot to do with this internalized homophobia. Thanks Contra for helping me not only learn more about trans issues but also about issues of gender and sexuality at large."

"My personal argument is entirely about the survival of my genes and the species, the reason i wouldn't get with a trans woman IS the same reason i wouldn't get with a woman that for some reason can't have a child. There's 2 rules for me dating someone: 1. Can i have a child. 2. Can i fuck a pussy that was meant to be a pussy by natural growth? This is the thing tho, i can definitely imagine a situation where the second point goes away and stops mattering, because my survival instinct IS SO HUGE that i WILL eat literal shit and dirt for months to keep my genes alive, get the child solved, and we can talk."
"Jordan Peterson would inform me that the little dark demon in my brain telling me to invalidate your womanhood is the shadow within me that I must first accept and then reconcile with. It is the part of me that wants to exploit the weak points of others in order to validate my inferiority complex. It is not so much that you're transgender, but rather that I covet your accomplishments and crave a perspective where you are less than both me and your own self image to defend myself."
"I love your video Contra ^^ And you are a very attractiv ^^ <3"
"I tried to give this video a shot, but it was painful. Yes, it is homosexual to be attracted to a trans woman. Since the trans-woman's sex is male (gender is female). Sexuality, by its very name, has to do with sex and not gender, right? There is nothing wrong with being gay, aside from throwing out any possibility of having a family containing a masculine parent and a feminine parent which can be very beneficial to the child, considering the parents actually care and try. 'Trap' is always meant as a compliment, so I don't understand why people would be so sensitive to a word. There isn't a word in the world that offends cis-white-males to that degree, so it's hard for us to sympathize."

"Wow what a statement about Dankula..."
"You make good points - but never the less I feel you throw too a wide a net relative to the off hand talking point of 'are traps gay'.  You bring in violence against transexuals, how you feel about your gender etc - I struggle to see a direct link to the title.  Those things existed way before the are traps gay question arose."
"You said this very nicely and not in an incredibly smug way and the production value is awesome so kudos to that but I don't actually agree with most of it and some of it was actually pretty screwed up. For instance being straight isn't 'fragile' just because you can't stretch it to mean literally anything including fucking the same sex, yep that's not gay. If you want people to accept that there is nothing wrong with being you you have to accept there's nothing wrong with being them also. You are coming from an extremely specific worldview. I don't believe straight men are just animals and they just GOTTA sleep with someone even if they find out they are the same sex. Some of them might care but maybe they're pansexual, and that's okay. Some men and like myself, some straight women just aren't into it. I am attracted to the opposite gender AND sex. I'm sure you'd like to suggest I have some kind of internalized wrong think or hatred or something but the fact of the matter is I'm just not attracted to females on any level. Even if I'm initially attracted to a trans man, that doesn't mean I will magically stay attracted after I find out he has a vagina or a penis that was originally a vagina. And I'm not a demon because of that I just can't control what I'm attracted to. I'd still treat them like men and be respectful but I wouldn't be attracted anymore and that's how a lot of men feel. Also you kinda acted like every man that is 'trapped' knew what was happening. You are clearly unaware of the extreme lengths people have gone to to conceal that they are trans even during sex. That's definitely not all but cmon girl. You're on YouTube. Go look at your favorite trans channels they probably have a 'they didn't know I was trans' episode. I'd say this happens a lot more than you'd like to admit. Also not to be rude but something that happens to your body biologically will happen as a result of the natural biological processes of your body not through medical procedures. I respectfully disagree with this video but thanks for not being incredibly smug about everything. Also Shapiro is not losing sleep over your existence lol. He just wants us to remember basic science and basic biology and not pretend they don't exist. I doubt he seriously cares beyond that."
"If I'm a pre trans man that still likes wearing Claire's lip gloss and dresses does that make me a trap"
"As someone who lives in a small Town in the UK I can say that subjects like this NEVER come up with the locals. But as soon as I get online it's everywhere, and for a long time I've felt like it's such a pointless question to ask. Yes there are those that do it for shitposting luls, but people who seriously discuss this subject are generally not qualified to answer the question in the first place. People don't seem to want to talk about sexual identification, and just use the subject to ridicule people the don't fully understand. Some of my friends recently dropped that quote as a joke and I called them out on it saying 'No they aren't', as well feeling very uncomfortable about needing to even say it.  It doesn't matter if 'Are Traps Gay?', it's like you said in the video 'If it feels good, then do it.', which in the long run would make all of us a lot happier if we could all just get over our sexual hang-ups.  Loved the video Contra, the only thing I'm sorry about is how long it took me to getting around to watching it."

"This was very enlightening, soothing, and entertaining. I'm a guy who's attracted to transpeople and crossdressers. Throughout high school I identified as Bisexual up until my friend, who was also bi, pretty much gatekept/gatekeeped me and said I'm not just because I wouldn't fuck him. And that kind of turned me off of men for awhile because of the hypersexual that a lot have, including myself. So it made me look at myself and realize I'm not attracted to as many men and I am women. But I had always been attracted to trans, and explaining that to cis people isn't the easiest so now I just identify as Queer. How I explain that to people is by saying 'I'm not gay but I know I'm not straight'. I had been putting off watching this video for awhile because it deals with my own sexuality and I had struggled with it enough to where I'm comfortable now and for you to break down my whole thinking instilled in me by what others around me keep telling me, really changed my perception. I pretty much had a heterophobic fit when you said if you like transwomen then you're straight. It was funny, I was like 'No way I'm straight' lol then I remembered I'm not just attracted to trans lol. I'd like to add that I am attacted to the androgy of transpeople I guess. I think it's absolutely beautiful and a best of both worlds. I've always been a don't give a fuck kind of person and have grown to hate labels due to it grouping people and judging them instead of treating them like the individuals they are and that they are all different. Not on some special snowflake shit but that just because you're a gay man that doesn't mean you are hypersexual or are feminine. To be labeling is just another form of stereotyping. And that hurts everybody."
"There has been scientific research about this, and they've actually made the conclusion that MOST men are attracted to female-presenting people with penises (is this an okay catch-all for transvestites, transgender women, female presenting enbies, etc?) and it stems from that het men are biologically wired to get hornier when a penis is near a woman as to encourage us to fight a man for breeding rights over a woman. Turns out this also works when the penis is on the woman.  I also feel like this video misses that 'trap' stems from a genre of hentai where a gay man crossdresses, brings home a straight guy without telling them that they're a man, and whether they take off their crossdress or not differs from manga to manga. Make of that what you will."

"A great discussion as always. The only point I want to disagree with is calling Count Dankula a 'Scottish hatecrime convict'. The statement is totally true, but it definitely shouldn't be. Dankula's nazi joke wasn't funny, but it was undeniably a joke. The directly quote the judge who sentenced him 'context and intent are irrelevant'. That's kind of a terrifying concept to hear a judge in a developed country say.  I don't agree with Dankula's humour or what I've heard about his political views, but he definitely shouldn't have been convicted of a hate crime."

An egyption youtuber, atheist and a free speech advocate Sherif Gaber is in a terrible situation. He's been accused of blasphemy. The egyption government will not let him leave the country. He's living in constant fear. Any day the police can come for him. He's recently discovered a way of getting out - a foreign citizenship. The only way to adquiere one without leaving Egypt is to buy it. Since you have a fuge fan base, talking to them about it would really help him. I know that this is deffinitely not your style of videos, but he's in a desperate situation. Please. You talking about him would make a huge difference. If anyone is interested in his story you can find him by the name Sherif Gaber."
"I knew a queen in Toronto in the 70s and she would always say 'I'm more of a man than you will ever be and more of a woman than you will every have.'  I loved that."
"Both me and my boyfriend have a huge crush on you, you're so amazing!"
"I disagree - I do have the reaction when men tell me they're dating someone from Cincinnati. (Fantastic video, as always.)"
"I was at the lecture you gave at MICA yesterday and never heard about you or your channel before then, but after watching so many of your videos i have to say that you and your content are amazing! Your topics are so well thought out and informative, not to mention persuasive without being intense or vindictive. Your personal style is so much fun to take in while never devaluing the conversations you address. Keep doing what you're doing, because the world needs more of your respectful, well-informed, and stylish voice to be heard"
"That mouthfeel though"
"This video is amazing. I learned so much from it, and I love the way you integrate philosophy, fact, and your personal experiences so that they leaven each other and reinforce each other.  I also loved the thumbnail for this video. It ensures that the answer to the question 'are traps gay?' is an unambiguous 'NO!'"
"üíú"
"Relevant: https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/james-charles-fraud/14525/tldr-if-youre-too-fragile-to-handle-people-even-thinking-you-mightbe-gay-you-need-to-take-a-long-hard-look-at-yourself/14"
"I love you, Natalie"
"There's the huge issue I have with this immediately. First up, I'm posting this halfway through the video, and I have to apologise for this straight away, I do know that's bad form, but I think that even if you do address this point later, it should have been acknowledged immediately, and it is irritating to me. Sorry for the long intro which I am now making longer by apologising for the long info so I should apologise for my apology and... Yeah, I'm bad at getting to any kind of point. So Many characters identified as 'traps' identify as male, and are simply presenting in a very feminine way. There is a perception amongst a certain group that feminine presenting men 'should' be trans, and I think it's absolute bullshit. You're not less the gender you identify as just because you're presenting in a non-traditional way. Now, I'm not *at* *all* accusing contra herself of this atitude. My issue is that the video seems to assume 'traps' are indeed trans women, and that this reenforces the idea that 'feminine-presenting' = trans. Even if Contra herself knows that's rubbish. For, for example, men who want to cross-dress, thisis genuinely pretty annoying. And for people who just don't care about that, it's also an attitude which reenforces traditional gender roles. It reduces the range of what men and women can do without being forced into a 'trans' box that really doesn't fit them. And it reduces the range of what *trans* men and women can do without being told they're not 'proper' trans people. (I have been told multiple times when I wear jeans and a t-shirt that I am presenting in a way which is 'too masculine', and so I'm not acting like a proper trans person.) So yeah... just because someone presents as feminine, does not mean they are. I think this should be acknowledged pretty much straight away. EDIT: You do mention cross-dressers and feminine-presenting men later. Nevertheless, I stand by what I said - you took a group including many feminine men, and presented them as trans women. I do understand what you were tyrying to do, but I still object."
"For real I would buy any book you published"
"Another way of looking at it (that would have saved you 43 mins, IMO) would be first acknowledging that the question was loaded, to begin with, in that there's usually a negative connotation attached to the word 'gay' by those who would pose it thats rooted in our widespread, societal homophobic beliefs and attitudes towards gay people. If we were to operate from the assumption that gender was on a spectrum, and that it can vary from person to person depending on their preferred identity at any given time, then, yes and no, traps are and are not gay.... And in cases where they were, who cares? Love whoever the fu*k you want to without having to feel the constant need to justify it to society!! Also, the video was thoroughly entertaining, keep up the good work."
"Heh. The *wine pop* 'God dammit...' reminded me of Erik Salvia :p"
"how did you get biological breasts and how much does it cost?"
"'I may be a woman, ... but I am still more of a man than you.' (38:20) I know its the context that counts, but in a video that is almost entirely about preconcieved notions of gender and and expectation-conformity, that line is still really cringy. It feels like trying to undermine a preconcieved notion by using its logical structure against it, but the item used to undermine it is one that doesn't even exist in that framework. Its like using a string where an integer is asked for and looking at the programmer going 'See how your system isn't working?' It just feels like a forced joke that ends up being more or less meaningless even if it were to arrive at the intended recipient.  EDIT: It also just now only clicked with me (watching the outro with the line 'If being a man is so important to you, stand up for us) that the situation with these men is possibly far worse than I have to admit I generally realized. These men only care about how their behaviour looks for other men. However, they don't consider the opinions of trans women at all. So their mental box for trans women is 'NOT-MAN' (opinions) but also 'NOT-WOMAN' (physicality) so considering their binary point of view what does that leave? (This could lead to a mental disconnect and the violence of their actions, even if we leave out the brutal possibility as to the mental classification of 'NOT-HUMAN' that may occur as a result) EDIT2: (and of course the point I had the video paused at was directly followed by the 'ask for basic human decency line and my thoughts still being focused on the above, it was a gut-punch)"
"‚ÄúOr a lady‚Äù? üëÄüëÄüëÄ"
"lol is that a swisher?"
"Congratulations for your stylist magazine cover!"
"Love the video"
"So the main problem here is insecure sociopaths murdering people because their dick is confused? That reason is so real world mad that you couldn't make it up."
"Starting the video, first big thought: 'Those contacts are hella creepy.'"
"After all that, I just hope everyone out there finds the love they dream of finding with a partner who fully accepts and appreciates them for who they are."
"Wait... Are those eyelashes fake?"
"this might sound vapid in the context of the discussion going on...but your production quality is stunning. i'm in love with your content."
"Is the first headpiece made by  Darrell Thorne?"
"It's funny how sexuality is not dichotomous and people are tring to make it in that way. I have a friend he's only attract to women with penis and I have another friend he's only attract with women he knew very well. The first one, he's attract to women, period, so he's straight. The second one, he's attract to women, period, so he's straight BUT he's LGBT as well because he belongs to the demisexual and Ace community. My friends gets really confused about it (especially they're not involved in LGBT community) and I have to teach them about it."
"Its a trap    Im not gonna stop using the word trap Its just fun to say when your playing a online game and a dude is playing with a girl character or a girl playing on a guy character  So if i send a invt to a in game looking guy but i hear a girl i just say its a trap it just sounds fun"
"I find it really strange how there is a bunch of people who demand society accept them and their sexuality but refuse to accept the sexuality of other people. maybe some people just don't want to fuck trans women. there is nothing 'tolerant' about trans people or the trans movement its just a different flavor of bigotry who have their own way of life and want others to conform to it.  I personally do not care who or what someone finds sexually attractive and I don't care what kind of body modifications someone wants to do to themselves. but leave me and leave children out of it."
"That was conclusive. At least three times i had a comment in my head to add to your list of points but no. You came to that later. I was nodding my head more than i would have while listening to 'Nod your head' from Will Smith.  I was so self concious when i was younger. I always struggled how others percieve me and think about what they are thinking about me. It is terrifiying. Luckily I realized that I can validate myself and dont rely on others to do that for me. That was soooo soothing. I don't have any fucks to give anymore.  One should care more about what feels good. I see how people could get upset when they want pointless sex with a vagina and won't get some. But that is so superficial and boring after a while. Sex is so much better if you relate to your partner. If you want them to enjoy the act and not just get off."
"'...because men view femininity itself as enticement...' Though I do agree with you that there is danger for trans men/women from some disgusting men, not all men fit in the statment you made. For instnance, a gay man might not find feminity attractive at all and indeed cosequently some straight men wont find femininity to be an enticement. Men in the whole do not just view 'womanhood' as objets of sex. Of course a lot of men do but I think it is unfair to claim all do."
"This is an awesome video!  :)  You totally deconstructed gender and gender roles and sexual orientations and the definitions thereof while also pointing out the problematic aspects of using the word 'trap' at all in the first place, all in a very thoughtful, analytical, sometimes humourous way.  I really enjoyed this.  Have another subscriber.  :)"
"Calling Count Dankula 'hate crime convict' is misleading. If you say it like that someone would think that he assaulted someone because of their race or ethnicity. He actually only made a video of a dog watching Hitler speeches and lifting his paw. Video was intended for his girlfriend because it was her dog and he thought it would be funny. Equation that and a hate crime is ridiculous and diminishes value of the actual hate crimes. The fact that he got sentenced is appalling in my opinion."
"tw: images and voice clips of ben shapiro"
"Oh, and yeah dickgirls are the best."
"Count Dankula did nothing wrong. His dog on the other hand was clearly being shifty. Seriously though, he was hit with the book for a joke. It's a hate crime to teach your dog a trick? In the UK, unfortunately so."
"You are my role model. You can‚Äôt stop me."
"There really isn't another channel on youtube that I'm like 'yeah, I'll definitely watch these 45 minute videos repeatedly and still get something out of it every time' with.   Keep being fantastic, Natalie. You're doing great things."
"'... I could really end this video now...' Is only a fourth of the way through the video O.O"
"People should be free to define their own sexuality and not be condemned for it. In my own personal life, if I were to hypothetically ever pursue a relationship with a trans woman, the relationship would be on the LGBT spectrum, ie: not heterosexual.  But I'm not here to police or define other people's sexuality either. If a straight man has a relationship with a trans woman and he  sees it as straight, then have at it hoss, I'll respect it and won't call him gay, since that would make the couple feel uncomfortable."
"contra marry me no homo"
"ye"
"I just have to say that I love the Kenneth Anger vibe of your videos. You are his intellectual progeny."
"I believe trans women are mentally/socially women, but when you're talking about sexual relationships and physical intimacy, if 2 people are of the same biological sex, that is by definition a same sex relationship. If you are into trans women you are heterosexual with slight homosexual tendencies. You are heterosexual plus (not that there's anything wrong with that. all sexualities are beautiful)"

"Oh, you pop. You definitely pop <3  I hate to use the word woke unironically, but this channel is woke as fuck."
"As a self-identifying, straight, cis male, I used to always panic whenever I would get off on futanari or trans porn. I worried that it meant I was gay or bi or something other than straight. Now that I am in my late thirties, I am finally secure enough in myself to say, 'If I find a woman attractive and it turns out that she has a dick, I'm just going to go ahead and suck it. Like a real man.' Seriously though, I just found your videos, Contra, and they have opened my eyes to prejudices and ignorance that I never knew I had. I have lived most of my life in a smallish, rural, southern town and haven't had a lot of exposure to many trans people. Your vidoes, aside from being expertly produced, visually appealing and possessed of a biting wit that I enjoy, are super smart, but in a way that is accessible to someone like me, who has to use spell check to spell accessible correctly. On top of all that, you're gorgeous. You do good work. Keep that shit up."
"i really hope i'm not being rude in saying this, it's meant as a compliment, well more just stating my observation, but you kinda look like Katheryn Winnick, i mean like a younger(/hotter) one though"

"i hope thats a blunt"
"I have to say that you are absolutely beautiful. You are amazing and I side with everyone who accepts, respects, and loves themselves. If we‚Äôre ever in the same bar, I will protect you. I‚Äôll protect anyone who‚Äôs being targeted by ignorant and homophobic people"
"A demonstration of the level of hetero-denial we are dealing with:  RooshV has just claimed that liking the butts of cis-women is gay."
"I like your background music."
"Loving your work!  Also, I would openly date you so hard. <3"
"You should do a video on trans trenders and tucutes and other stuff of that nature."
"'It's not gay as long as she's been on HRT for a few years'? So it is gay if she isn't? How many years is 'a few'? What if she doesn't look like she's been on HRT for a few years? What if she was on HRT but had to stop? What if she just wasn't on it in the first place out of health concerns?  By not going with the 'sjw' response of trans women are women no matter what, you are setting qualifiers to be a 'real woman', and defining how you have to transition for you to really become a woman. That's really exclusionary to those who don't pass, who don't want to transition with hrt/surgeries and to nonbinary people."
"The ald-right kids are so fascinated by traps, futas and everything that has to do with the gay lifestyle is not surprising. Gays in the right-wing scene are strongly represented. I suppose it's this dance on the volcano feeling that attracts them. Tought guys who cuddle up with you after a hard fuck or perhaps break your skull."
"amazing video! would you ever do something on the topic of cis actors getting parts portraying trans women? i am cis and i know that my trans friends definitely do NOT like it, but i love how you really dive deep and i would totally like to hear an ep on it"

"i just like feminine anime boys and the guys-that-look-like-girls from 4chan, i dont hate trans women and i dont give a single fuck about what they do with their lives, i wish redditors could stop linking me this video everytime i use the spooky T-word, leave me alone!"
"40:24 'bisexual, trans and non-binary people are a safe group to date' I know this is taken out of a much larger context, but it does sometimes hurt to imagine you are a second class partner that is there as a training pad to bag a cis straight dude. As a bi person, I've often been treated as people's second best choice because of misconceptions about my sexuality, whether that be by straight guys or lesbians."
"During that latter portions of the video, I still kept shifting back to, 'But what about cross-presenting men?', as that's still the, eh, aesthetic I apply to 'trap' (or 'otoko-no-ko', or what have you), especially as doujin artists (or perhaps translators) most regularly frame such characters around 'he'. Then I have to remind myself that this angle had been addressed, that if someone identifies and especially presents as male in their living, then there is a relationship with a man and whatever that may entail. But I still wonder, especially for characters that are heavily coded as if they are trans, what does this mean for fiction when a male character is heavily presented feminine? Ultimately it doesn't matter, because of the acid-trip spectrum of sexuality, but even beyond persons' reactions to these characters, what does this say of fiction creators and their perceptions of expressions and what societal pressures have shaped such. And, what does this manifestation have to say about perpetuation of restrictive language and concepts? How does fetishization of finding one's partner is physiologically different than expected affect one's perception of real persons who present non-cis, even if the person with that fetish accepts the latter and recognizes the divide between one's own fantasies and the reality of these persons?  ...insert 'just thinking aloud, may delete later' here, I guess; this is kinda stream of consciousness that I hope isn't turned toward unfavorable rabbit holes."
"I don't want my girlfriend to have a bigger dick than me thankyou very much!"
"Really. Really. Why did you feel the need to talk shit about other YouTubers. They did nothing to you but make memes. Yet you call them hate full. For shame."
"count dankula... isn't he the one who 'will joke about anything' yet got butthurt when people made fun of tommy robinson for getting v8?"
"Like you I think the 'are traps gay?' question is prejudiced and stupid, but, also like you, I would like to understand this stupidity. But I think your chromosome argument might have covered over another - more difficult, but perhaps more insightful - discussion. Here's a thought/question: If you accept 'one is not born a woman' etc., then you must admit a psycho-social impact of society's treatment of (and prejudices concerning) each gender (i.e. also 'men'). This impact, over time, leaves an imprint on one's behavior and personality; and I would argue that part of the recognition of each gender-member involves the identification of that imprint (and possibly attraction to it). As pathetic as heterosexual(?) men's fear of being gay is, they might still have a point you did not address/counter: that by being attracted to a 'trans woman' whose social imprint - especially the formative years -  was still very much that of a straight man (assuming becoming 'trans' changes the social gaze. you tell me - does it?), they are displaying homosexual tendencies/susceptibilities. So the 'trap' consists in 'forcing' upon the unsuspecting 'straight man' the juxtaposition of a woman's appearance and a mostly masculine personality (this is the weakest part of the argument, I know, but still). The seduction game is not merely one of sense-perception, just as it isn't one of 'chromosomes'; and being susceptible to 'the seduction of a man' might be what's really troubling them. What do you think? I'd like to add that I really think what you do here is brilliant, and that I truly truly admire your scientific spirit. Yes, no sarcasm. Thank you."

"Dude, I absolutely love her channel. Her videos are very coherent and well executed."
"Another great lesson as always.  Thanks for the information, Natalie!"
"I'll take 'Things I wasn't expecting to watch today, much less actually be rather interested in' for 500 Alex.  Anyway, Bi Dude here (Though it doesn't mean much considering I'm still a virgin), this got linked on a reddit thread about the latest PayMoneyWubby video. I kept watching at first because... Damn the production quality is high.  Came out of this feeling a lot more educated.  I wouldn't say I fully understand everything now, but I'm a lot more knowledgeable on a subject I wouldn't exactly have gone out of my way to search about before."
"Hmmm, this was alot to swallow (pun not intended?). Put jokes aside, a very intriguing and educational video. Props"

"Women are weak. Therefore a man who have sex with woman is weak. That's pretty gay. Fucking a strong muscular guy though, that's tough. It's what a real man do. Just like my father taught me."
"As a trans person I gotta really say-You are awesome!  So clever and smart and very informed on your topics.  It's refreshing and awesome. I hope you get more traction in the Trans community cause I think we need someone like you! Sending all the Love. keep being great!"
"Did you imply count dankula deserved to be arrested?"
"Yes, No, a little? Doesn't really matter either way. So long as the relationship is between consenting adults then do what makes you happy."
"Great video! But I have to say the song at the credits was pretty darn awful. Or at least the production."
"But what if a woman sleeps with a trans woman.......?"
"Girl, love the intro outfit. Looking good! Those contacts look like they hurt though."

"you make me a better, more educated person with every video. thank you, contra!"
"I didn't really consider traps to be the same as trans women. If trans women are... women and traps are just outright boys that look like girls..? Wouldn't they be more comparable to drag queens or something? I definitely have seen the 'it's a trap' meme in response to men getting in bed with a tranny and not realizing it but... I still think you probably count as more of a dickgirl."

"IDK.  I do kinda take issue with the activists who say to me I am out of my lane on this topic.  Violence can and does effect all of us.  I was literally kidnapped with the intent to murder me from my own rich white neighborhood here in Houston, TX.  I am alive by luck.  A long violent terrifying police chase later I see hi laughing and smoking outside the car I am in.  He walked. Trans panic.  I was held another hour as the guy cops asked if my tits were real as I sobbed shaking in handcuffs. They left me on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere rural TX in the middle of the night.   It totally got me banned fro. Periscope.  Violated tos.  Yeah I lived streamed my kidnapping and beating during the police chase. All the Canadian therapists even felt sorry for me.  I am just saying.  Yeah you may not want to think you aren't in danger, but idk.   Once I got chased into a whole foods bathroom in the same neighborhood by a married cheating guy who I let her to handsy.  We have bars I'm grocery stores here it's a thing.  Anyway.  I think it's rude to say it's not my lane when yeah it's my fucking lane"
"More good stuff from Contrapoints. A reliable go to zone where centrist conservative quietist types can enjoy some left inflected content that is not mere shrieking hostility and soul deadening identity politics. A left leaning pundit with...merciful heavens...a sense of humour, a sense of proportion, a wide and nuanced array of senses, a sense of style, even a sense of common sense. Yeah, this stuff is good! Such is the deadly kiss of death ... an endorsement from an Action Flower ( clearly some species of centrist conservative quietist Jordan Peterson enthusiast). Hmm. Worrying eh? Guilt by association. Uncleaness. Impurity. The question must be asked 'Is Contrapoints a gateway drug to ugh yuck horror tolerance of dialogue and the exchange of ideas with Jordan Peterson, which is a gateway drug to civic nationalism, which is a gateway drug to eeeeuuurgh unspeakable thought crimes? It is all very troubling. Here is another thought: Milo Yannoupolis. Imagine the starting position of a God guts and guns made America great type. The sort of type who very readily reads the notion of 'family values' as an invitation to criminalise the condition of homosexuality. There are such types, albeit increasingly rare. What might the effect of Milo be upon such types? A gateway, perhaps? Someone who raises the question...' If a race mixing homosexual can be part of E Pluribus Unum patriotic pride then what ARE the proper limits to it? Who is NOT likely to be warmly welcomed at a Trump rally , or a church, or a veteran's rally if they will only desist from calling other citizens and patriots by demeaning and insulting names ending in ist or ism or phobia?

"Mad respect for the openness. Super brave. The female penis and male clitoris thing is definitely a mediocre attempt. It's all just a word game for you, which can't be taken seriously.

"By labeling certain words such as trap, tranny or shemale as inherently 'harmful' or 'toxic' or 'bad' or 'transphobic' or whatever, you're failing to understand the basic properties of language itself. Language changes, and can be changed over time, and related to that, words only have power over you if you give it to them. By saying 'this is a bad hateful word only used by bad people', you're not gonna erase that word from use, quite the contrary, you're only telling those bad (in this case, transphobic) people: 'Well, I guess those are the words we should use to demean trans women!'. By saying 'this word is inherently hurtful', you're just giving a weapon to everyone who's trying to hurt you. Instead, if you reclaim the word and encourage using it in non-slur, non-harmful contexts, over time, that word will stop being *perceived* as harmful in language and society, even if it was initially created to hurt people. Of course, you can't force anyone to use one word or another if they don't feel comfortable with it, you can only reclaim slurs for yourself, personally (looking at you, 'queer community'), but once you do... Well, let's put it this way. If I constantly describe myself as a tranny dyke, and then some punkass tries to offend me or mock me by calling me a 'f**king tranny' or something... Well I can just be like 'Yeah, no shit, what's your point?'."
"From the very beginning, I'm highly annoyed by the fact that the conversation is divided into 'trans women who find this horribly offensive' vs. 'stupid cis white male shitposters'. Like, you do realize that there a LOT of trans women out there who are anime fans themselves, who grew up in the weeb community, who find the whole meme funny, and even jokingly apply the term to themselves?"
"Short answer: traps are gay. You are a guy,  you like dick,  whether it's a guy with a dick,  a guy who had his dick cut off and now has a scar he calls a vagina or a guy who pretends he's a girl but has a dick,  all three make a guy.... *trumpets gay*. / discussion."
"Question. (looking for genuine responses) around the 20 min mark is where she talks about how being attracted to 'traps' isn't 'gay' because they identify as female. But If a drag queen (or un-transitioned person) identifies as a Female and a straight male isn't attracted to (him/her) Does that mean the Straight male is then considered 'gay', because he isn't attracted to someone who identifies as a female?"

"This video really helped me really re evaluate how I (as a cis lesbian) feel about sex with trans women. I always told myself that I recognised that trans women are indeed women and that being attracted to one doesn't make me any less gay, but then I would proceed by saying 'However it isn't trans phobic to not want to have sex with a penis'. But I've come to understand that I was wrong. By saying that I don't want to have sex with a woman with a feminine penis is not only abiding to the societal limitations of my sexuality but more importantly, is not genuinely recognising trans women as women. Above all I am attracted to the woman. I then put this into another context, I asked myself the question, 'Would I have sex with a man who had a vagina?'. The answer is no, because although I am attracted to vaginas, I would be having sex with a man, and therefore a man's vagina. I like vaginal sex, the same as a straight man likes anal, but the difference is the person."

"The question 'Are traps gay?' isn't a trans question.  A trap is a person who is born male and has male genitalia but looks convincingly like a female. So someone who is a trap, maybe crossdressing, cosplaying, gay and cross-dressing, transitioning to become female, or just a really feminine looking guy. But traps are not people who can't pass as being female, which can include transitioning people, people who cross-dress, cosplay, wear drag or look a bit effeminate. Traps have to 'pass' as the gender which doesn't correspond to their body, like how a spike pit isn't a trap until it is made to look like solid ground.  Most traps and trans people do not leave a mystery their position until sexual engagement unless it is made clear through environmental (meeting at a fetish meetup) or social cues most of the time. Since traps (and reverse-traps) are a fetish that not everyone would like to have as a surprise, so some form of disclosure is seen as courteous and often done discreetly with other people around (as a safety precaution).  Upon learning or discovering that your prospective sexual partner shares your genitalia, it is then for you to decide what 'gay' means to you. It is finally here that we reach the rich and fertile (or decidedly unfertile) ground for philosophical discussion. If you were trapped by a straight cis man (why did they even let it get to this point?) or a gay man, then is the attraction towards their feminine appearance enough? or does proceeding any further make you gay? If you were trapped by a straight(?) trans-female then is both their appearance and internal persuasion towards femininity enough? If you were trapped in the first place does it even matter if you are gay or one of the cornucopias of sexual orientations perpetually being fashioned by over-thinkers?  Ultimately what is gay and what is not gay isn't hard to figure out, the question you need to ask is are you happy with how society perceives your actions, how you see yourself, and how who's opinions you value perceive you (the last one includes any gods you hold to)."

"It's usually the entailment of a label that creates the mental infrastructure that encourages masculine males to make declarations that bolster their masculinity such as 'I'm exclusively attracted to females' whilst simultaneously ignoring the ramifications of such a declaration.  First, you haven't met all women, and second, you haven't met all men. It's a totally unqualified declaration married to a completely inadequate label.  If one identifies as straight then, consequentially, the onus is upon the individual making that declaration to maintain a consistency of results when it comes to subjects of arousal otherwise one will, in some way, be incapable of making such a declaration honestly in the future. <-- The honesty component creates the problem because once they find a male with feminine traits arousing then they have to be dishonest with themselves in the future when making such a declaration.  The above is a huge problem due to the phenomena of communication and the two core aspects of it.  Encoding and decoding.  The syntax and paradigms of non-verbal communication are necessarily complicated but in terms of making a display, female attributes create the paradigm of femininity and one need only encode such feminine paradigms into one's visage to necessarily communicate themselves as a female when viewed from a particular perspective.  'He's got long hair so I thought he was a girl.'  Many comedies involve the masculine male protagonist slapping the behind of a long haired male only for the other to turn around and undermine the expectations of the protagonist. What fun, he is now somehow gay, that's the joke. <-- The humour was in pointing out the inadequacy of the sexuality declaration and the ease of undermining it.  The above creates the problem for masculine males, by declaring an exclusive attraction to females they have ignored that which makes a female identifiable to them, the decoding of visual cues that indicate an individual is female are feminine paradigms configured in a particular syntax.   In this case the paradigms of the female are feminine traits and males can display any number of those paradigms in a syntactically correct manner to communicate themselves to others as female.   Here's the real kicker, there is no requirement for anybody to intentionally encode any paradigm into their appearance in any given order to attract anybody else of a particular disposition, they can merely happen to like the style and that is all.   Its very much the 'mistake of the beholder' when one is mistaken.  When an instance of exception arrives, some people, who have put all of their chips into the pot before the flop may attempt to sweep any exception under the rug... which, unfortunately, manifests in physical violence projected towards the other. It's socially unacceptable for those masculine individuals to be attracted to men, and whoops, they never were attracted to females but the female paradigm of femininity, which confronts them in the street as a male who is overwhelmingly feminine to the point of declaring themselves female.  What are you going to do now masculine male? Well, it's going to be violence, they aren't going to blame themselves for their poor definitions because they were taught them by an institution that didn't know any better, especially if it involves burning in hell for a short eternity.  Pride is a very masculine trait when it comes to bravado and nothing undermines that faster than wrecking up the logic underpinning it. That's where the label creates a problem, because attraction to a feminine trait is not equal to being attracted to a female.  Men can acquire a whole basket full of feminine traits, the initial and most accessible being long hair as mentioned previously. There are plenty of straight men with long hair who end up in fights with confounded men who thought they looked good from behind only to see a beard and because they subscribed themselves to the newsletter of exclusive heterosexuality they blame the other for acquiring the sorts of traits that would 'confuse them'. It's a very self-entitled view of the world which doesn't function and manifests that self entitlement as demands upon the other. 'Cut your hair faggot'... to wit the answer is 'So you won't get a hard on for me sailor'.  The only adequate answer to a subscriber of such a weak ideology is to dig the mine further under the foundation.  That self-entitlement makes certain men mad at 'the other' because their labels have narrow definitions which lack insight resulting in a strange and ultimately twisted thought process, by which the victim of their own mental infrastructure concludes; if they can eradicate the instance of exception then that will remedy their broken mind. Sort of a twisted logic that edicts 'I won't be gay if there aren't feminine men left'.  The answer to that of course is: There will always be feminine men so live with it."

So for someone to try to nitpick your point by saying 'well *_ACHSULLY_* human senses are more complex and nuanced than that' they'd _also_ have to admit that, if you can accept the above 3rd grade understanding of senses, you can also understand that sex and chromosomes are more complex and nuanced than your 3rd grade biology understanding.

"As someone who watched a to of anime back in the day, I want to point out that the question 'are traps gay' is equivalent to asking if crossdressers are gay-- it's not questioning the sexuality of the person who is attracted to the 'trap', but the sexuality of the 'trap' themselves. So it's still a very stupid, ignorant question, because not all crossdressers have the same sexuality, nor do all women, or all men, or all office workers, or any other grouping that isn't a sexuality. If ignorant menfolk are posing the question 'are traps gay' and really inquiring about what that makes THEM, the answer is verbally challenged."

"I feel like the type of person that would kill a trans in panic probably is not familiar or has no context of the meme that is 'trap'. Like you said no one has killed anyone over that word. People that use that word in humorous terms are completely different types. I for one think   'trap' has the potential to be extremely comical just like how shit and fart jokes are. its primal and genuine. It's a way of coping with otherwise extreme disgust and anger that i may feel. Yeah i know it's fucked up but what can you do when it's how people feel deep down. Sex and sexual orientation is not something people change as easily as some gender-fluid pan sexual tumblr snowflake. I'd encourage trans to simply state at some point before the sex their gender at birth. Even if it kills them inside to harken back to a time where they where referred to as the wrong pronouns, at least that would keep them safe from crazy assholes."

"i feel i should mention that i'm a trans girl but in the definition purely that i identify as a girl (i'm sort of bigender tbh, but let's keep things simple for now) and not having to do with lifestyle or looks or anything concrete like that, but i also consider myself a trap, as in i will try to achieve an appearance that is that of a girl, not that i want to trap people, i mean tricking people into thinking i'm a natural girl and totally should be left alone is a good thing though XD, but not by the way people sometimes see the word trap, but in being a trap it also means i don't need to look that way all the time, now i don't like wigs so i grew my hair out, so that is always long, but i don't always do it up or give it the full conditioner and brushing treatment, sometimes it looks nothing like a girls hair, i don't need to shave (so long as i don't look in the mirror at all) i can dress as a male in clothes that are quick and easy to put on and are efficient and functional, but then again tomboy girls exist so that's not even really a thing, but basically my point is, it's hard to be a girl, it's hard to be a trans girl even more so most often, and i don't want to be devalued as a girl or trans just because i don't want to dress or act or look a certain way because my default look my body goes back to still allows me to function and get things done, i'm sorry if i lost coherence, i was forced to listen to someone who would not accept 'hang on' so there's that, hope i'm understandable"

"There's no 'metaphysical' chromosome sensor we have. Okay, but with our five senses, and our instincts, the argument falls a bit flat, in my opinion.   Given that our senses are partially for the purpose of the continuance of the species, and we have continued due to sense perception for breeding based off of those instincts, then you don't have to see chromosomes. Unless someone goes all out and gets every surgery, some that would be so brutal I don't know if they exist (like hip widening surgery), it will be very rare, biologically speaking, that a man would be attracted to a trans-woman."

"I still don't fully get it. I can see why trap and shemale are shitty words and personally never use them anyway. But am I a transphobe for specifically *wanting* to seek out women with penises to masturbate to sometimes, apart from all women in general, and wanting a 'search term' to use on porn sites for that purpose, like 'futa', 'dickgirl' or whatever? I like all kinds of women, and men too for the record, but am I secretly a transphobe for having a different *kind* of attraction to women with dicks than women with vaginas? I don't see how I could convince myself to feel otherwise, someone help me figure this out."
"Speaking as a straight cis male, are there any trans people in these comments that might be able to tell me whether or not the film The Crying Game is considered offensive? I'll give some context, I co-run a YouTube film retrospective review show, and I was thinking it's about time we did a review of a movie on the subject of trans people. Films such as In the Year of 13 Moons and Tangerine come to the fore, but so does the Crying Game, however given it touches on the traps issue and to my mind doesn't treat it in a terribly sympathetic way. I mean, the trans character in question is practically apologising after she was punched in the face. But, on the other hand, perhaps the fact this issue is raised is interesting in itself, but I wanted a broader opinion from trans people in general."
"I recently discovered you. I enjoy your videos. I love that you are funny, theatrical, musical, intelligent, and articulate. I would  enjoy dating you and I'm a straight male.

"First of all, I love how you flip the tables and use the question 'Are traps gay?' against the people who usually joke about it, your brilliant explanation of male heterosexuality as a strict role versus the fluidity of sexuality itself is something that needs to be remarked. What i am concerned though, is the dilemma between the social part of sexuality and gender and individual identity. I think this is a topic that needs further discussion, and at least we have solved the biological sex part. I like a lot how you recognise the complexities of sexuality, and how paradoxically attraction and repression can play a big role on it. In some extent, it is true that how we present ourselves matters more to society than our identity when it comes to gender and attraction, because it is an integral part of culture, it is a performance that effectively shapes the self in its most intrinsic way. What i fear is still the shaming of nonconforming individuals whose expression clashes with their identity, specially with transgender individuals. I think their identities should be respected, and we have to appreciate to some extent how gender perception can be subjective, not just relative to culture. I think this is where my critique of Natalie is, because she makes it seem like gender roles are this inmovable thing, when another person can have different perceptions. Maybe this is how we can respect and UNDERSTAND the nonbinary identities, by recognision that this topic is subjective, and that maybe understanding all points of view is impossible. It is understanding that you cant understand everything (which is still understanding, not just pretending).  Apart from this question, everything else for me was flawless, because this topic is more of a toxic masculinity problem than a trans women problem. Props to you, Nat."

"Traps are gay only if they have bigger dick than you.   On serious note are traps gay is mostly just joke. And whole trap thing exists because most of men are not attracted to women that are not born female. Because you know in end of day they want to have kids.  But some are so good at transition that man cannot notice it is woman till its too late. Therefor warning its the trap.  Its compliment if you think about it.   Also you could be called ms perfect those that do not accept you and want to harm you will do it either way. Word 'trap' is not what makes someone want to kill you.  And in end of day it does not matter if traps are gay. So what if they are gay? Who cares to what someone is attracted?"

I'm usually in awe halfway through as you address every angle and argument and the second I think 'but what about...' you get to it. For me these vids are monumental as they make me feel like it's ok to have questions, be confused or to be challenged in my views on gender and sexuality. I don't want to label myself woke and call it a day. I need to understand as much as possible about touchy gender issues and how they effect others. You're a not-so-PC light in the tunnel to me.

"hahaha I hope you didn't hurt your throat with that last one XD I learned with my singing lessons that if you tense up your stomach before making awkward sounds you can make it sound as if you're going all the way while not hurting your vocal cords. Everyone should try that. Especially youtubers. Your voice is your money and so many of them injure their cords needlessly for a joke.  Okay, lesson one: take a big breath and try to hold it and then say or sing something. Now you know why you should take smaller breaths. Lesson two: take a small breath, tens up your stomach really hard and gently go: UUUUAAAGGGGHHHH. Sounds amazing, right? :) And it doesn't hurt your vocal cords at all. Lesson three: small breath, tense the stomach a little, pulling it in, sing something :) Ever thought you could sound like that? Well, you always did but just never knew it :) And don't forget to practice awkward sounds with friends to remind you how important the stomach is :)"

"I must say I expected a lot when I stopped by your channel. But you lost me gradually. The points you made based mostly on fantasy and masked with fancy and noble intentions. Unfortunately for both of us, I am extremely pragmatic and science based. While I applaud you for fully alter your physical and biological makeup to live the life you want, I will not allow my compassion for you blinded, or to let you fooling my intelligence. Science is fact. Straight men will not have love-sex with trans. Mind you, men do declare that if they had to f*ck a bucket to satisfy their urge they would. In this case, if a straight man f*cked a trans, it‚Äôs not true love, it‚Äôs just a f*ck. And there is no worse feeling than wanting something that one cannot have. That‚Äôs the downside of being a gay-trans. You can trap a straight man to have sex with you, but you never truly have his heart. That‚Äôs the scientific fact of biology. Best wishes, my lovely ‚Äúcontrapoins‚Äù."

"Finally getting more info on the mouth feel! You've been teasing that forever!"
"I came out as a transwoman to my mom almost 2 years ago. She's super understanding and loving, so there wasn't an issue of acceptance, but there were some really hard questions to answer immediately, having been in the closet so long. I'm now 27 so not forever but long enough to get some anxiety when i get asked for sure. I sent her Natalie's page as a good jumping off point. She said 'I'm gonna watch it again and take notes.' 'She's fucking hilarious!'    It's trans tested,  mother approved!"
"I‚Äôm a trans guy myself so I already knew this stuff but it‚Äôs nice to hear such a fresh take on the argument in terms of truly deconstructing it. I‚Äôm the kind of person who prefers discussions to arguments (which are different in their own ways due to connotation and some denotative meaning) and your videos feel like you‚Äôre having a discussion. You‚Äôre very soft spoken but you firm and you don‚Äôt yell but you make jokes that feel less like a jab at people and more like a jab at the concepts which I feel really keeps the whole thing feeling light hearted and fun. My sister actually sent me this video after talking a bunch on how much she likes you and my sister knows me well enough to know if I‚Äôd like something or not so I was down to watch it and I‚Äôm glad I did! It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve enjoyed this ‚Äúargument‚Äù sort of content due to my more passive nature now a days but this was nice. I honestly feel like you and I would probably get along and end up having a lot of weird and interesting discussions because to me it seems that we act very similarly when talking about topics like this. Anyway, great video! So happy my sister showed his to me and I can‚Äôt wait to watch more of you videos instead of doing homework lol"
"I don‚Äôt want to come out as rude but could you please cut your pipi off so I can fap to you Thank you Love, Communism"
"This was an excellent video that really opened my eyes to a lot of things I didn't quite understand about myself and the trans community. I love your content. Keep up the good work."
"Your content is amazing-- informative, with well structured rhetoric, and, best of all, really funny. A lot of people are probably cunts because they aren't receptive to this sort of thing, but I think it's the tits."
"14:10 - Wrong. Trans women may be women, but they are not female. The words female and male refer to biological sex. For trans women to be recognized as women it needs to be accepted that a male person can be a woman, by some definition of the word. Sex between two males is homosexual. The language in which one would say 'sex between a man and a woman is heterosexual' has it such that the words man and woman refer to biological sex, since that is how they have always been used, and thus do not apply to trans women or trans men, since in their case the words man and woman refer to some sociological conception of gender. The heterosexual men you're with are actually bisexual, but exclusively attracted to femininity. Sexual orientation is not about identity, but an observation of a person's behavior. A closeted homosexual, or bi person, is not actually straight, despite what they claim."
"'Is a man that fucks another man gay?' Tough question.  Better make a 40 min video about it."
"I'm 35 minutes in the video and I think you're no longer making any point of value so I'll skip finishing it and comment my thoughts.  First of all, a lot of good points and arguments, but a lot of fallacies as well.  And for some clarity, I don't identify as anything, and I am attracted to everything, so that you know this isn't coming from someone who's just prejudiced.  The first issue I have is that you're trying to deny the gayness of liking transsexuals, MTF or FTM. It shouldn't matter, one's preference in partner should not be scrutinized, neither should transsexuals be discriminated. Alas, we live in a world where that is not the case, so I understand the need to argument against it.  That being said, I believe that people attracted to people of the same sex as them are gay, but then which sex do transsexuals go into?  And to avoid making a whole essay of a youtube comment, I'll just list, in order of conclusion, a short version of my understanding.  Attracted to Pre or Post Op transsexuals, not knowing they are so - Not Gay. Attracted to Pre Op transsexuals, knowing they are so - Gay. Attracted to Post Op transsexuals, knowing they are so - Not Gay.  Sexuality is a complicated topic, sure, but lines have to be drawn for pragmatic purposes.   But to reiterate, being gay or not is neither good or bad, and it should not be judged, but since people LOVE to put labels on other people, this is my way of differentiating it.  So bottom line is, the 'real' gay part of this whole ordeal, are the chasers.  Last, but not least, I am not asserting that my opinion is the absolute truth, it is just that, my opinion, and I state it in hopes of sharing my personal views and experience will contribute to a more accurate general consensus as people become more and more aware of the finer details on this topic and hopefully come to accept transsexual women as I believe they should."

Two: your make up must have taken forever, especially with multiple characters, for lack of a better term.   Three: thank you for expressing the point: who give a fuck whom you love? Are you attracted to them? Then be with that person. It's really as simple as that.   I know human brains struggle to lable every thing, but maybe we should let it go and just enjoy who we are with for however long it lasts."
"so¬†there's something that's kinda troubling me and i don't know if this is the right place to address it, but Natalie mentions having that 'fetish' of wanting to be penetrated in a vagina... and have the same 'fetish'... the thing is I've always thought I was gay til this day, but is this dysphoria? i feel like the lines are blurred sometimes when it comes to such topics. usually i have no desire to have physical characteristics of the opposite sex."

"Why is he putting on a silly voice?"
"Short answer: traps are gay. You are a guy,  you like dick,  whether it's a guy with a dick,  a guy who had his dick cut off and now has a scar he calls a vagina or a guy who pretends he's a girl but has a dick,  all three make a guy.... *trumpets* gay. / discussion."
"I don't know what the youtube equivalent to a Pulitzer award is, but this must be in line for a nomination."
"While the word trap always seemed extremely harsh to me, I always believed the majority memes on the internet were always tongue in cheek actually making fun of transphobia and homophobia with the sort of crazy maths they would do to try to justify it being gay or not gay. But I guess I'd never thought about it that hard :("
"She‚Äôs the best of both worlds!... Smart and funny!"
"It is strange how much men seem to define themselves by who they are attracted to. I don't really think my female friends, born or born-to-be that way, do that. Thinking on it, it does seem my male friends do that. In the end, what a world we could have if people were sexually attracted to personality and intellect, and realized someone else's fun bits do not define you, no more than what you eat defines you."
"I feel like you even understand some of our struggles as cis women honestly <3 men get so hung up on the genitals of trans people, yet they can't even begin to know the first thing about cis genitals."
"guess im gay"
"First of I'd say that if trans people find the term trap offensive, then they should first reconsider their all too common stance on misleading men in romantic encounters regarding their sex (which is that it's morally OK, to which the general male response is, er no it's not). To mislead others intentionally through lies of omission is basically a trap in this context and you only need search youtube to find the long list of trans people advocating that it's OK for trans people to do this. You have to stop and wonder how language comes about and in this context, trap is used because it has been the experience of men and a continuing worry that they might be deliberately mislead (trapped) by other men. Had this never been an issue and men were honest about being men rather than duping other men, then the name trap wouldn't have come about. In addition to this I don't think straight men fail to understand why that might be offensive, they just don't care. Things like being reasonable and being empathetic about feelings are social traits which are *reciprocated* and if you don't give a shit that misleading people into circumstances they're uncomfortable in, then why would those people care about your feelings on the matter.  Secondly you've created a false dichotomy about the opinions of men and killers of trans people. Just because many men agree that if you don't want to be murdered then don't trick men (because, as you point out, trans murders are higher than average) so obviously just avoid that behaviour, if nothing else this is just practical advice. You've conflated this with defense of killers which is not the same thing at all, the first does not imply the second. You can perfectly well say to someone, don't trick men, it's dangerous, and not be someone who condones murdering due to this. I'd argue that the vast majority of men hold a position something along these lines, that killing is wrong in this context but never the less, don't go around provoking people. This section is unbelievable dishonest and does nothing to win over the straight men you're hoping to reach out to. Remember that it's certain violent and aggressive men that murder people, the overwhelming majority of men would never murder another human being, so the idea that men in general are guilty of making trans people afraid, that's also extremely misleading.  And finally the tricky problem of semantics and language. Language as we know is something that necessarily has to be socially negotiated between people and is at the very best fuzzy in it's nature, in fact classifications of categories of almost everything is fuzzy on some level but language is especially so. Generally speaking there doesn't seem to be any significant controversy around what it means to be homosexual, it's one of those words where the definition is literally built into the word itself from other component words, in this context it's are men sexually attracted to men or not. The controversy comes from the question of, are men who dress and act in a feminine manner (and optionally have gender reassignment surgery) really women or not. And the traditional answer to that throughout most of history is no. The closest approximation for a technical definition that fits the standard by which it has been used throughout human culture is that of chromosomes, XX vs XY, a woman is a human with an XX pair of chromosomes vs men with an XY, and actually the same for most other sexually diamorphic species. What we've seen recently is a push from various groups of people such as radical feminists and other assortments of SJWs to make a deliberate change to language by redefining what it should mean to be a male or female to basically mean, well its whatever you like it to be, and there's a general push back against this change in language, a rejection of the idea that humans with XY chromosomes are women.  OK So WHY? That's the big question, why use one set of language rather than another set of language and the general answer to that it's not completely clear how language is actually negotiated and formed but we do know it has something to do with convenience, accuracy and practicality. Helpful language spreads through common use and unhelpful language tends to die off, it's just like natural selection but for language. What people are generally conveying when they use the terms 'man' and 'woman' is the difference in primary or secondary sexual characteristics because that context is important and relevant in some manner, otherwise you'd just use a more neutral word like 'person'. it's typically relevant because most people are seeking sexual partners and most people have a strong and specific preference for sex, thus the distinction actually matters. And when it comes to sexual relationships the facts about trans people are pretty clear, most men would not date another man, even if they presented as a woman, or to put another way there's an overwhelming desire by people with XY chromosome to find an XX partner, and not just a preference but a biological imperative. Where there's demand (can I have sex with that person and produce a child) there's going to be language that facilitates that demand.  People aren't going to concede this, it would take social engineering on quite a substantial level to convince even just a majority that men can become women. And the most profoundly stupid thing about this is that even if you did do that, say you convinced 100% of everyone that men who are trans should be called women, then all that would happen is new words would spring up to mean 'person with XX' and 'person with XY' in order to fill the existing demand. And the very next thing we'd see is trans people campaigning to also be recognized by these new words because they're 'real women' and 'don't want to be denied' and all that rubbish. The bottom line is that if the distinction matters to people, then people will invent language to represent that distinction and they wont give it up."

Your views gave me lot of insights about how transgender individuals experience the given topics/issues, even though I'm a cis‚Ñ¢ girl haha. I actually used to be an anti-sjw, but your videos made actually listen to 'cringy' feminist and sjw standpoints and they make a whooole lot more sense now. Keep it up :)"
"Acceptance is not the goal, tolerance is. By tolerance I mean apathy - in the same sense that someone drinks water and I drink orange juice kind of apathy/tolerance. I don‚Äôt care that there is a difference. Acceptance requires holding steadfast into an either/or distinction that there is not a similarity  whereas tolerance respects differences passively as ‚Äòwith/and‚Äô.  Re: gay/manhood - I think Foucault put it best where he says that it‚Äôs merely preference rather than such a rigid category, he of course still found himself attracted to women and men, but men more often than women."

"Not every trap is trans. Not every trap is homosexual. Although, in public in real life probably they are either one or the other.  But basically a trap is just someone who looks the opposite sex and is probably a cross-dresser.  Is it gay? Yes, it's gay... but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Oh, and this is not an attack on trans people. You can feel that you are/see yourself/live your life as whatever gender you feel it's best for you, but that may not change how every other people see you.  Just like someone may think to him/herself that he/she is the most beautiful/coolest/smartest person in the world... this does not dictates how others see this person as.   It just shouldn't matter."

"i loved this video! my friend dena recommended your channel to me and i love it so much, youre such a great content creator. just as a suggestion, in your trigger warnings can you include warnings for flashing lights? even if its just transition slides (no pun intended) or the whole bit with the vhs tape? im not epileptic but flashing lights cause my migraines to flare and that causes some temporary vision issues so i typically dont watch things with flashing lights unless i adjust certain features i have installed on my phone to limit their impact on my eyes/head. people with epilepsy can have seizures from the flashing lights and it wouldnt be your fault if they did, i just think itd be a nice to include. üíö"
"It's amazing how much you internalize this stuff and how hard it is to grow out of it.   I'm a cis hetero man who always thought of myself as extremely left wing and progressive, but until watching this even I gave myself stupid arbitrary limits like 'i'll only watch porn with a trans woman with a penis if they are with a cis woman so that way it's not gay.' Who knows, I may never physically be into these things but you've inspired me to have the confidence to just openly like what I happen to like and I'm sure you've done the same for many others."
"THIS should be part of every person's sexual education."
"You have a gift for costumes."
"I personally believe the term ''trap'' refers to crossdressers and not trans women and I think the term ''are traps gay'' is only referring to a guy falling for a crossdresser and considering if he is gay or not. (at least that's how I feel in the matter)"
"Amazing, hysterical video! Youtube algorithm worked for once..thanks to hbomberguy"
"Is it transphobic to not have sex with someone based on their genitals? ‚ÄúIs it gay‚Äù bullshit aside, just approaching it as ‚Äúpenis-having‚Äù or ‚Äúvagina-having‚Äù people.  I‚Äôve gotten some mixed messages over this one."
"I do wanna mention that traps in anime are men and identify as such so they‚Äôre not trans women. That doesn‚Äôt make the people who call trans women traps any better though, in fact it just makes them more wrong."
"Even though this has little to do with this video, I just want to say that after watching this, I waded through a lot of your other content.  I thoroughly enjoyed every second.  You're one of the best creators I've seen in quite some time, and your videos really give me a sense of feeling at home because my friends introduced your channel to me.  I've been quite homesick lately, so binging all of your content was very therapeutic for me, so I just want to thank you for putting all the effort that you put into your videos.  You're fighting the good fight to educate everyone on the issues, and I believe in you!"

"I freaking love your video"
"I know this video wasn't made for me so I'm going to let the title slide. as a enby-transgirl however I would like you to address some of your deleted tweets. deleting them doesn't count as an apology I know that there isn't a guidebook to be a trans spokesperson of sorts but you realize this don't you? please examine some of the problematic enbyphobic tinged things you've said."
"You‚Äôre cool"
"A biological male having sex with a biological male is the definition of gay. Men who are ‚Äúperceived‚Äù as women because they put on a dress and makeup, are not adult human females. Human sexuality is homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality, not confusing, not a multicolored acid trip. Anything else is paraphilia or fetish.     There is no moment when you are not man. A penis is literally a male organ, male genitalia. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you take hormones that makes your penis smaller or flaccid, it produces sperm that is capable of getting adult human females pregnant. That is how the human species reproduces, sexually.     A vagina isn‚Äôt just a hole that men use for sex, it is self cleaning, self lubricating, facilitates BIRTH and doesn‚Äôt need to be dialated to stay open. Men who castrate themselves and get a surgical wound, that is not a vagina, they are not women. I think it‚Äôs interesting that you are flippant about how women view their bodies and vaginas but don‚Äôt see the irony in later saying that men don‚Äôt care that much about vaginas they just want a hole, kinda how you think of vaginas.     Since when is female skin and female smell a thing? Exfoliating and perfume doesn‚Äôt make you an adult human female. Vagina positive? Didn‚Äôt you have a video where you had a menstrual moon ritual where you wiped ‚Äúperiod blood‚Äù on your face? Because apparently that‚Äôs what women do on their periods?      This is a 40 minute exercise in doubling down on your own delusions."
"Being a straight cis guy, I refuse to allow the gatekeeping bullshit that tells me how I 'have to' act as a man. If you think being a 'proper man' means being a transphobe, or fearing strong women, well then fuck you.  Alright, I said my piece.   Everyone go listen to someone who knows more about LGBTQ+ issues than me.  Woof."
"As a teacher who'd probably get fired for trying to approach this topic in a public school setting - thank you.  As fucking impossible as it is to talk to people about this shit, it's so important - so thank you."
"I LOVE the sound of *cold hard logic and reasoning* in the morning. During my time here at GameLink I've seen a HUGE surge of trending trans porn as of the last 3 years, and I LIVE for this. Every time there is a new Aubrey Kate, or Chanel Santini film, people go fucking nuts, and I love it.  If you are a person who is into women, then it doesn't matter if you're into a cis woman or a trans woman. Spoiler alert: They're both women!  Thank you for normalizing this topic."
"writing long comments is too much work so basically  -im transitioning currently -very scared and unprepared -found this video while browsing shit -wow this video is good -broadened my horizons and made me think about things i never thought about before -made me feel more confident about myself as a person and not being seen as a stereotype  Thanks Contra!~"

"ContraPoints I dm you a lot on insta but u don't respond lol its ok I know you're busy but I wanted to say this; you have permission to cover any idea you'd like when it comes to the trans community; you've earned it; I'll continue liking every video you post til the end of time"
"What an offensive video, what‚Äôs wrong with Cincinnati women lol"
"My first ContraPoints video. I am subbed now. This video has made me see my own bias towards the trans community, so many good points for me to reflect on. Thank you!"
"I really appreciated the point about how 'Real Acceptance has to be built on real understanding'. I'm a gay man, and back when I was contemplating finally coming out to my parents I thought I basically had nothing to worry about. Never heard either say a homophobic thing, both were irreligious, both supported left-wing/progressive policies across the board, etc. But when I finally came out, my parents freaked the fuck out and there were a few days where I thought I was about to be disowned. The situation cooled eventually, but it's stuck in my mind how all the wokeness just vanished the second the concept of accepting gay people became personal."
"How dare you call me a straight man! I am Transcendent. You are a mere mortal enslaved by your feable notions of division that only serve to restrict one's true form. It is time to journey beyond the veil of deception tirelessly weaved and presented by the false prophets known as the senses. The realm of being permeates dimensions yet discovered, thus your lackluster attempt to contain the roaring fire inside me, through petty words, falls far short of even your own hubris. Perhaps our spirits will cross on the pathway to Elysium and I shall demonstrate to you Veritas."
"Natalie just gets hotter with every video."
"I don't think I've ever actually heard trap used to refer to a trans-woman before. I've used it jokingly before with friends (although, I don't think I'll be using it anymore), but I always heard it used to refer specifically to an androgynous or feminine, male-identified man."
"'Being a dick girl is kind of like being a legendary Pok√©mon' - ContraPoints, 2019   In all seriousness though this is so fantastic to see. I just found your channel a few days ago and I'm so happy that now I have a proper way to explain ideas that have been gnawing at my conscience whenever I'm around my more edgy-meme-inclined (well really I mean masculinely-toxic but I wanted to use more hyphens) friends.

"Firstly, I'm a right-wing bisexual guy. I adore you, Contra. I like Shapiro and love Peterson. But you, honey, own my heart.  Your 'a real man does X, Y, Z' at 38:00 was really something.  All the things you described, had to do with taking on burdens and responsibility--so it's good to know you and my boi Peterson have something in common.  When you said, '~I'm a woman,  but I'm more man than you,' what you were really saying is, I'm braver than you. You're too scared to take on difficult burdens, and you should be braver, especially because you're a man. Stand up straight with your shoulders back, son!  I'm with you here too. I believe courage is a masculine virtue, and men should aim for it. Although I think women should try to be brave too (even as brave as men--or braver sometimes!) but there is some intrinsic cosmic truth that makes it male. (That is not to say it's okay for women to be cowardly. Cowardice is a vice that should be avoided by EVERYONE.) You may have been cementing the gender binary without knowing it... It is intrinsic. Bravery is masculine‚Äîbut it's still for girls too.  (Another example: I think compassion/empathy is a female virtue, and one that we should all aim for as well. Is it perhaps that these virtues are simply easiest for the members of their own sex/gender to hone, or be gifted with by birth?)  I hope you'll think about two things...  1) Did you just add to toxic masculinity? Did you just assert that boys should be braver, boys shouldn't cry, boys should be in total control of their lives?  Most importantly, you said that men need only take on 1/100th of the burden queer people do for a small moment by being openly attracted to traps.  Is it really so small a moment? Is it possible the mocking, bullying and reputation could last a lifetime? And is it really only 1/100th the shit they'd go through compared to what we go through? Is it such a tiny burden that has made men so angry and humiliated that they believe the only way to avoid a lifetime of shame is to commit murder?  I think calling upon men to bravery is better than shaming them. But, try telling a man who's probably a member of a violent gang he should just admit to the people in his life he loves girls with penises. What would happen to him?  2) Are the people who shame men who like traps mostly men or women? In my experience, women never want to date a bisexual man because we've done gay things (e.g. gotten fucked by a dude and loved it) or because we have minor feminine attributes (e.g. we're damn brave, but we're flamboyant and sometimes have limp wrists).  I'm queer, so I've gotta be socially courageous. But I've been training my whole life. I don't think it would be fair of me to expect the same level of bravery in another who hasn't been practising as long as I have."

"Okay pls stop using 'Men' in such a generalizing way. I first recognized this when you said (paraphrasing) 'These Men dont know the difference between traps and transgender' about 4chan users, which makes me wonder when the last time was you visited a Trap thread or whatever on /b/ or /lgbt/, because there are literal wars fought over that.  I considered this to be a nitpick but you do this pretty consistently throughout the Video, sooo."

"I was aware there was some pushback for ‚Äútr*p‚Äù, but I never realized how big of an issue it was despite being in the LGBT community. I‚Äôll be honest, this video as well as others that you‚Äôve posted have been a large help over the years. Five years ago, I was on a dark path of ‚Äúlibertarian memeing‚Äù that was getting dangerously close to alt-right pathology, but content creators like you really helped me come to terms with actual issues instead of just writing them off. Additionally, coming to terms with the reality of issues helped me to realize a lot about myself. I used to be a straight, misogynistic, racist, transphobic dude, but now I‚Äôm Pan and not too terribly sure about the ‚Äúdude‚Äù part.  Tl;dr: thank you"

"The word doesn't make sense because I can't be trapped."
"The issue is most people think of crossdressers who pass as traps. Only ignorant people refer to transpeople as traps."
"I'm genuinely glad I saw this video"
"God, I'm so in love with you."
"Huh. It didn't really click with me at first but maybe you struck one of the root causes to (male) bi erasure without really intending to. At least from the straight side (the LGBT community can be just as bad sometimes.)  In this narrow, rigid, view on sexuality where your straight only as long as you adhere to a highly ritualized set of activities and any deviation from it makes you gay (implied: Forever) there isn't really any room for bisexuality. There is just 'Straight' and  'Everything Else' which is smacked down under the label 'Gay' and thus subjected to it's stereotypes. The view is completely binary. There are only two options (no Shr√∂dinger's Homo either). Which doesn't leave any room for someone who genuinely is attracted to both genders. Only for Straight men and guys who only like other men but might be fooling themselves."

"Okay...The argument that cis-men should view trans-women as...cis-women?...and, if they say they‚Äôre not, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre being transphobic‚Äù infuriates me.  Please introduce me to the bulldyke who‚Äôll be down for some trans-woman cock. Please. I don‚Äôt mean queer, non binary, I mean butch, Phys Ed-teaching, horse-training, veterinary-ing, lesbian woman who‚Äôs excited to suck dick.  BUT. Does that mean she‚Äôs a hateful cunt? NO! It means it‚Äôs not her thing. Just as bloody, period-spewing cis-pussy may not be someone else‚Äôs thing and they‚Äôd love some sweet pre or post-op ass.  Look, why can‚Äôt trans women be their own beautiful gender? I don‚Äôt get it."
"Now that everyone in the top comments have said what I wanted to say, let me just add that the 'getting fingered by the pope' joke is top notch and I burst out laughing. It's such a great remake to cis men and women telling me that I'm jealous that I don't have a vagina."

"Damn, this is by far one of the bests contents I saw in Youtube throughout my entire life"
"Good video but dismissing Count Dankula as a 'Scottish Hate Crime Convict' is pretty lame and disingenuous. If what he did is hate speech than you and pretty much anybody who makes videos taking a stance on controversial topics could call is hate speech. Hell if people like Richard Spencer ran society this video would probably be considered hate speech."
"Yes"
"Can't we just say it mean you're bisexual if you prefer trans women?"
"Great video but it didn't really answer the anime trope question. I think the issue is that these anime 'trap' characters aren't equivalent to real trans identifying people. They often present themselves as women but don't actually identify as female- so in that sense, the 'traps' themselves are gay, assuming they're into men. But as you said in the video, because of the feminine context, it's not gay for a man to be attracted to them. So while it depends on the character and context, from the characters I've seen, I can't reason myself out of thinking 'traps are gay, but being into traps doesn't make you gay.'"
"this is beautiful, necessary and so so good!"
"hi. bisexual man here. as someone who is attracted to both males and females, both types of attraction are slightly different. what makes a man 'hot' is not the same as what makes a woman 'hot'. transgender women are hot in a womanly way, _not_ a manly way. when i see a hot trans woman i think 'oh what a hot woman' not 'oh what a hot man'. sometimes i even find myself attracted to her as a woman _before_ she transitions. same with other transmen. they ain't sexy like a woman honey, they sexy like a man. i rest my case."
"i just need to say your makeup is always amazing wow"
"i love you. you have such positive energy my anxiety feels relieved just watching your vids. thank you for existing ily. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Wow, this was so entertaining. I honestly didn‚Äôt know about the meme and had misconceptions of what ‚Äútraps‚Äù were. I never they they were meant to belittle transsexuals.   I think that‚Äôs why Jordan Peterson is so scummy, because he doesn‚Äôt think using proper pronouns matter to the health of the individual. And that‚Äôs coming from a man who is a psychologist, so I definitely think that there‚Äôs some prejudice on his part."
"'I go dumpster diving for compliments', Omg same lol"
"I was under the impression ‚Äútrap‚Äù was referring to some kind of cross dressing fetish. Is it like she said AND a fetish or was I dead wrong?"
"i'm trans, and seeing all the comments here makes me so fucking happy i actually cried. there is so much positivity and love and respect for our community you don't understand how much this means thank you Contra and thank you everyone that listened."
"If the person you're attracted to looks like the opposite sex of you, then you're heterosexual. It's really that simple."
"i enjoy anime and sadness as you can see by my pfp fuck you"
"Fuck why is this channel so fucking amazing"
"I thought you meant traps, as in a 'trap house'."
"13:38 .........I got a boner....."
"I will never be in a situation we're I will be tricked into having sex with any woman. But I find it very hard to believe that no trans guy or women would try to hide the fact that they are trans so that they have have sex especially in today's society. I understand were you are coming from and this probably gives bigots a reason to hurt trans women/men but I wouldn't cross that out completely."
"White transgender privilege is real !!!!!"

"natalie for president. that is all."
"Hey, Contrapoints, I've watched almost all of the content of your channel and have recommended it to some of my peers that might find your arguments very interesting here at UNAM at Faculty of Music in Mexico City. The one that interested me the most was the one where you explain how to identify a fascist or how they secretly signal among them. Debunking Pewdiepie's channel as a videos essay on the phenomena of the massive amount of subscribers on his platform (which now I find sort of alarming), might have a possible beneficial¬†outcome for the left since most of the audience really doesn't understand, or might remain skeptical (including myself up until recently) why he would be or not a fascist. Because of your video, I kind of confirmed what I always found suspicious ever since the media called him out as a nazi (the symbols he uses all over his merch and how most of his videos have these 'dog whistles'  you've pointed out.  I've been meaning to start an essay on this subject but I feel like I might need some kind of references like academic papers on neo-fascist symbology or heraldic in the 21st century to back up this, just to not sound like a conspiracy theorist. Could you recommend some if there are any existent?"
"o...m...f...g... people actually don‚Äôt wash their ass because of their gaycism"
"I feel like I along with other white guys detest being compared to the guys who beat you up to prove they aren't gay, as much as you detest being called a trap."
"There are more than 5 senses. I realize that isnt a big deal or relevant to the point you were making, but in the context of biology it bothered me a little :p  The discussion of chromosomes and sex without discussing intersex people is also a little bothersome (basically, chromosomes already don't mean shit whether we have senses to detect them or not)... But thats an entirely different topic so that's not too big a deal either.  It's the inattention to trans-women who don't get HRT that bothers me most in the end. All points brought up in the video are valid, but a trans-woman is still a woman even without the feminine appearance; even without transitioning at all.  Understandably, someone who is attracted to women and their femininity would likely not be attracted to a masculine trans-woman. But a masculine trans-woman is still a woman in the same way a masculine cis-woman is still a woman."
"Traps are not gay cuz the dick makes it better if you disagree with me gonna end up on a stretcher."
"Lmao she has so many   'I need to pause this and write a comment'  moments in her videos. Lol like at 19:28 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ her sarcasm just tickles my soul."
"after going back and watching the video, some of my thoughts: just to preface, my friend sent me this video. These are my thoughts, mostly to gather my thoughts and respond to said friend. I'm not a philosopher, nor do i think about this much. That isn't to say that I'm a stranger. I'm not making you read my disgusting textwall, but if you do, please but go easy on the replies. Thanks. 16:48 after the lgbt community going on about spectrums, I would argue that a 'straight' man who is into trans women is on said spectrum and is not indeed straight. I'd claim it's neither, but definitely not a heterosexual thing. 17:07 inverted penis is still a penis, not a vagina. Google dilation. 17:38 Simply incorrect. There are obviously men who don't care, as there are obviously men who do care. I'm willing to go for a long pass here and say that most men do care. Perhaps not the PC/woke men who will see this comment, but that's a biased sample anyway. 19:40 Knowledge is powerful enough to skew perception. My partially color-blind friend pointed out to me that he didn't see red-on-black checkers on his shirt, just solid black, until someone pointed it out, and since that moment he saw the red checkers. In a similar way, a normal, straight man can immediately feel strong disgust if they learn something about a woman: if a man finds out his wife is an adulterer, trans, or so on. Physical appearance is not everything, as people would lead you to believe. If you look at a person, you don't just see skin and features, you see who that person is in your mind. another bit about the previous stamp, any repulsion to finding out someone is trans has little do to with valuing ones 'identity as a straight man,' it's a triggered emotion much like arousal, and much unlike political opinions and ideals. 20:30 No, but creation of life is. 21:45 'de-dragging' happens mentally as explained above. You become perceived as a man as soon as it's revealed. God bless the men who don't care much about it, but that's not nearly everyone. 22:12 still does not make you a real woman. Gynecomastia is neither feminine nor attractive, be it self-induced or not. 23:44 you still are a man, albeit an extremely feminized one. Call yourself a woman, have everyone else call you one, but there is no denying the difference between a cis woman and transwoman. 25:24 all porn is like that for everyone 25:30 what rights? to my knowledge you all have the same rights I do. Maybe it's because I live in a blue state. Maybe it's because people assume comfort is a right when it isn't. 25:36 I agree that many people see liking transwomen as a fetish. Must be annoying to deal with. It's also annoying to have a below average penis size when every penis in porn is above 7 inches. Unfortunately, I didn't make a choice to shrink my penis, and can't make the choice to make it longer. (don't take this comparison too seriously, I know they're leagues apart) 25:56 previously you stated, maybe in jest, that you made this video in part to educate people that may be too young to even have sex, the wayward, impressionable high-school boy googling 'are traps gay.' As it stands this video is the second result on google, good for you. To me and many others this seems less like liberation and more along the lines of indoctrination. 27:38 Your opinion, which i respect as an opinion, and disagree with. Penises are masculine, which is why, as i understand it, most transwomen are dysphoric about it. 30:29 this bit is just promiscuous and weird. reminds me of woman humor, good job, you pass. 32:44 if someone self-identifies as straight, that does not mean they are straight. Actions speak louder than words. Also, porn addiction messes mens' judgement up. 33:34 i agree that to be and act straight is to enact dominance over a woman. Submissive behavior is weak and thereby construed as gay. Half of all gay men are submissive, possibly more if you include switches, so of course submission is seen as gay. I'd be more apt to say that men would rather say that being submissive is 'bad,' but it's lumped in with being gay for this and that reason, 'gay' being a generally 'bad' thing to be for a large portion of history. Of course that's only how I see that nomenclature arising and is of course by no means absolute fact, nor how most people feel today. 33:47 i've never heard of this happening. If that is a thing, I can see why women hate men so much haha. 35:11 straight up wrong, a transwoman lived her life, up until transitioning, as a boy or man. That's something real, and not meme garb. 35:26 will respectfully disagree. 35:34 It matters because some people care about what their community looks like, and what world their children grow up in. Homosexuality should be challenged, I think. Not outright hatred or nonacceptance, but not blind acceptance either. Children are very impressionable, and deciding to come out as gay or trans at a young age is hard, and not always how they'll turn out. Homosexuality and transitioning should be well-thought out and challenged ideas. When i was in high school, I came out as trans, which i have since gotten over. There was no-one to tell me 'hey dude that's kinda gay' or whatever. I wasn't challenged, and didn't think about it too much in a negative or critical way. Of course this is all subjective and ultimately my fault, but this is my core reason behind why I think blind acceptance of anything is wrong. 36:05 at this point i'm tired of being talked to as this collective idea of 'man,' tired of subjective denial of traditional value, so I stopped watching. thanks for reading"

"Are Traps Gay? Short answer: No Long answer: No unless you have a skewed idea of Trans-women, cross-dressers and sexuality"
"Love ya but 45 mins... yikes."
"Im glad I watched this... because well, I've had a hard time understanding trans, and to be honest I've even somewhat agreed with ben shapiro's little statement... and the fact is, as someone who just totally identifies as cis, people like us just don't know whatsoever what its like. I of course would never go out of my way to treat someone who's trans any differently... but deep down inside theres always that side of me thats saying 'umm... yeah you're not a girl, but sure ok I'll call you a girl if that makes you happy'. And the other thing is that even when I was in college surrounded by people who were, I guess the best way to put it is idk sexually diverse? I never wanted to just go up to anyone that I knew was trans or anything because I always heard again and again that gay and trans people HATE being asked questions about their sexuality. And so... I was left to just figure it out for myself, and browse the web about it. But if you just scour the web to learn about all this stuff  you have to admit it gets crazy confusing... so many labels, so many arguments, so many ways to just say what they like or don't like to fuck, and the way they like to dress... its a bit overwhelming, and it really feels like you got to wade through some thick bullshit to get any kind of honest understanding.  But I'm glad you make these videos because you're more open to seeing the other pov and informing rather than just demanding people to just 'get me' and 'accept me or die'. And this video totally opened up my eyes to seeing trans a little better than I did before because you said a lot of stuff I never knew before... like I had no idea trans women could grow their own breasts and that their dick gets softer... lol. (sorry... I'm still immature enough to giggle at saying 'soft dick') but more to that... its really got me thinking... seems like all these hangups about gays and trans and so on seems to revolve around the same issues women have in general... that 'femininity' itself is whats being shit on... that I realize right now, even as a cis woman theres this part of me that even rejects my own femininity. Like, I like it when I dress up and wear makeup and act feminine sometimes, but somehow I feel idk... prouder? when I'm not. That I don't really feel like I'm taken seriously if I grow out my nails and do my makeup and smell nice, and dress nice... so... it kind of seems like its all the same underlying issue doesn't it? That being feminine whatsoever... even if you are a full chromosomal woman... is looked down on because it somehow means you're weak? And being weak is supposed to be bad? which of course both things are ridiculous... that a) being feminine doesn't at all mean you're weak... and b) having weaknesses is just human. but it kind of begs the question then... what is femininity anyways? is it the makeup? is it my hair? to be honest... I'm not quite sure. I think that would be a good video for you to make though. Also it would be nice to hear about trans men more. No one ever really talks about them... its always the trans women that get all the attention."
"What's wrong with Count Dankula?"
"I guess I just don't read comments enough or I'm on different parts pf the internet, but whenever I hear trap it has always been in a joking manor without any malicious intent, but yea I can see how it could be perceived as offensive by others. In general I have heard the word used to describe characters that will claim to be boys but cross dress not to transsexuals so I guess that's why it never stood out to me as potentially offensive. But I have never heard of futanari being used to refer to transsexuals or cross dressers or anything along those lines, but instead to hermaphrodites and again used more as slang and not as an insult so that talking point confuses me a little."
"16:50 got me. Up to there I was nodding and agreeing and seeing the world from other people's eyes. But damn."
"I'm so glad I found your channel. I'm sick and tired of the 'queer' society just screaming their heads off about things and not explaining things. I'm a polyamorous bisexual biological female.

I made a strait cis friend mad because I said that I feel like some trans people on the internet do it for attention, not because it's who and what they are."

"I'm from Brazil. A country in which the search of porn terms like 'shemale' are always on toplist and yet is the country ranked as the number one on transphobic crimes. In 2017 it was documented 100 deaths and it goes as far as brutalization of bodies and cruelty as the case of Dandara dos Santos (please don't google the name because unfortunately there are still brutal images used by radical transphobic groups). This video dwells on question that is deeply hidden in our national society, but the difference the 'question' (if there is one) is never put. I think we need this video translated and localized."
"Just imagine the panic that there WILL be when you have trans women indistinguishable from any other woman, because they are a woman. And you end up sleeping with her. You had a crush on her. You spent your whole life and had babies with her, your own babies are a trans girl's babies. A woman's babies. And you would be so pathetic to abandon them. Even when evolutionarily speaking. They're THE SAME FUCKING SHIT.  What is your MALFUNCTION?"

Not that you needed or asked for my opinion but :) )"
"Since you brought it up, can you make a video about bottom surgery? I'm under the impression that there is more to it than most people think. To name a few topics: dialators, hair, the rate of botched surgeries, loss of sensation, regret."
"You sure are pretty. But beyond that you make videos that are enjoyable to watch with salient points that are spot on."
"Okay but I think boys would like it if you had a vagina that *sucked*"
"Thank you so much for this video! I also do think that trans women are such a great narcisstic wound to some men, because to them, trans women reject being a man to become a woman. And what, to those misogynist douchebags, is greater than being a man, and what is worse than being a woman? Therefore, a trans women defies everything the male gender should stand for: not being a woman (because to those man, being a man is being everything a woman should be not; they are men because THEY ARE NOT WOMANLY AT ALL). And for this crime, denying being the pinnacle of the gender hierarchy, trans women have to be punished, because they dare to do what all toxic man can not: embrace femininity."
"Im that one dumbass who absolutely wrong to harm people for just existing and living their lives, but at the same time likes shit edgy jokes and was raised in a typical 3rd world 'YOU GOTTA FILL THE GENDER ROLES' society so watching these videos really makes me think and learn abt what i do and say. i know im still ignorant and that i've messed up in the past, but you really made me reflect about the subject and myself and see prejudices i didnt knew i had. So, thanks for aiding me with my own personal growth and into being  less of a shitty person."

If you're going to make incorrect assumptions like this as a foundation for your perception of people who disagree with you then you can't possibly hope to convince them otherwise.

"'Transvestite skullduggery' is my new favourite phrase, and I fully intend to sneak that into conversations in the future."
", I believe there is a solution to this. But going to take both concerned parties to kind of meet each other in the middle. If trans people would or could disclose their trans status within the first conversation or so, it would completely eliminate the possibility of the other party feeling as though they've been trapped or tricked. But on the other hand the person who's not trans needs to feel okay and safe being able to go 'woo never mind.' Like no one should be getting condemned for not wanting to date trans people and trans people shouldn't be getting condemned for being trans. That way disclosing your trans status wouldn't be dangerous, and saying you don't want to date trans people wouldn't be dangerous either. Now everyone can feel comfortable expressing themselves their wants their likes their needs."

"Before discussing whether to have a white ethnostate I would say that from a European perspective your level of public debate in the USA is about somewhere in the same level as in Nigeria or Paraguay, so how about building you country to be something greater than fly-infested 3rd world shithole. And this is no critique to you, ContraPoints, but to your followers that ask, whether traps are gay."
"Calling trans people 'traps' surely is offensive, but at least as far as I know that is not the common usage of that word. Traps usually refers to anime/manga characters. These are usually not regular transwomen though. Usually they naturally just appear to look extremely feminine or crossdress for some contrived reason. Often they refer to themselves with male pronouns, tell other characters that they are a man/boy or get annoyed when they are 'mistaken' for a girl. Sometimes things are left intentionally vague to mess with the viewer. So at least most 'traps' are physiologically male, have a male gender identity but look feminine or crossdress for external reasons. Since the gender progressive side usually advocates that gender identity defines people as a women or transwomen, traps are thus mostly male. Thus the question 'are traps gay?' can be translated to 'is attraction of an otherwise cis hetero male towards a cis male considered homosexual attraction, if the attraction is based on the percieved feminine appearance?'. It seems the Shapiro answer is 'yes' because the target of the attraction is biologically male, the semi woke answer is 'no' because the attraction is based on the feminine appearance, but the ultra woke answer is 'yes' again because the target of the attraction has a male gender identity."

"Men might take issue with dating trans women because trans women, as it stands now, can‚Äôt produce viable offspring. Some men, including myself, desire to bring children into this world. One may ask, ‚Äúwell by that logic would you be opposed to dating someone infertile?‚Äù I mean I suppose If I figured out down the road the woman I love is infertile, then I wouldn‚Äôt just leave her. However, the majority of cisgender women are fertile and can bare children and 0% of trans women can. Hence, I‚Äôm more inclined to opt for cis women. If I a cis woman knew she was infertile and knew I wanted to have kids and refrained from disclosing that to me. That would be deceptive. It would be deceptive in the inverse as well. So no, I don‚Äôt think men are bigots for not wanting to have long term relationships with trans women. I mean, what‚Äôs the alternative? Forced courtship? That‚Äôs literally some brave new world shit."

"I now live and die by the P O P  Edit: It's worth saying as well, a lot of the points and concepts in this video apply to any cis, straight relationship as well.   In even straight relationships, it's not your genetics, it's not necessarily even your body parts - It's just how you appear to the other person that makes them interested. Whether your partner is cis or trans really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. I'd argue the penis issue really is personal preference, but hell - you can't deny that you're attracted to someone - regardless of their toolset they have in their trousers."
"Is there any way I can persuade you to lower the volume of the audio censorship beep noise a few decibels? It is harsher than it perhaps need be, and sort of hurts the punch of the comedic punctuation it provides.

Outside of that brief gripe, I enjoyed this video tremendously. Great characters, costumes, makeup, and fantastic writing all coalesce to make for a wonderful, well-argued presentation.  My favorite part was the application of ritualized straightness dogma to convincingly argue that being straight is actually gay. It was clever!"

"Long time anime fan but also ongoing learner of as much sex, gender and gender identity information as possible, here (also cis).  *I really, sincerely appreciate this video!* I can definitely attest to having been very ignorant in this respect and being sucked into both consciously and unconsciously associating anime characters with the overused word 'trap'. My 'uneducated' conceptualisation of the word came from having grown up with these anime characters being portrayed as powerful and endearing in anime from the 1970's/80's/90's shows I watched prior to the rise in the use of the term 'trap'.   When this term did become popular and I began to see beloved characters being associated with the word, I was honestly very ignorant in placing my own contextual understanding of some of my most beloved, expectation challenging and powerful characters BEFORE the realities of what REAL trans people (not characters) experience, which I as a cis person, honestly feel that I can never claim to fully/truly understand.   So although I've never used the sentence 'traps are gay' and have also never made an assumption about these anime characters sexualities or associated them in any way with some kind of 'deviancy', I regrettably DID associate trans characters in anime with the term 'traps' as a descriptor resulting of my own laziness in relying on outward physical character presentation whilst failing to make efforts to understand the experiences of a living group of individuals who are the target of the term. I prioritised convenience and conformity by relying on this term as a simplified descriptor for the outward presentation and interactions of (imagined) trans characters in anime, which are largely 'fetishised' (again, something that is wrong).   Although my intentions in forming these associations were never malicious, they were EXCEPTIONALLY ignorant and selfish and I recognise that this can be just as detrimental. I've also begun to be far more critical of the portrayal of the anime characters who I have been a fan of as it seems the creators often fetishise them and again, I feel that this distorts the reality of being a trans person. I really hope to re-shape my understanding of trans people and their experiences rather than being content with my predominant experience of trans people being one that is imagined through characters and cartoons and this video is a great resource!   Sorry for having used the word 'trap' so much in my comment while trying to explain my perspective and if I said anything that is somehow offensive. I'm nowhere near as articulate and experienced on the issue ^__^' but I'm hoping that other anime fans who may downplay the significance of their use of the word 'trap' might be able to come to a more enlightened (but also anime focused) understanding by reading my perspective.   Anyhow, I'm very thankful for this video and will do my best to keep learning more to prevent my own ignorance from negatively affecting others. <3  *Much love!*"

"Re: 'being gay is good anyway,' this is how I've always felt about the 'are you born gay or do you become gay' discussion.  My answer was always: who cares?  Yes, as a scientific question, to learn about genetics and such, this is an interesting question.  But as a matter of social policy, it doesn't matter one whit.  The only reason it would matter is if we're also executing a value judgment on whether or not gay is 'good.'  It's not good, it's not bad, it just is.  So who cares whether people are born gay or become gay?  That's the wrong question.  The right question is: does it matter?  And the answer is: no."
"This video made me a TERF."
"'If Trans women don't want to be murdered, then they shouldn't truck men.'  How did we get to the point of justifying extrajudicial execution for any reason whatsoever.  It's almost like saying 'If POC don't want to be killed by the police, then they shouldn't commit crimes or resist arrest' like obviously it's wrong to commit a crime (which many times victims of police brutality are not doing) and maybe you think trans women are tricking men and that doing so is wrong (they're not and it's not but maybe you think that), if either of those justify a death penalty (the lattermost certainly doesn't) then a fair trial should determine that. Not a cop, and certainly not a raging straight man who feels invalidated."
"For one, it's both gay and not gay. Part of sexuality is perception, not just what the biology of somebody is. If you fell for a trans woman, it's not because you're attracted to a man, it's because you're attracted to what you see as being a woman. It's kinda like growing up having a crush on Chun Li or Lola Bunny. They aren't real, but the idea of them makes you attracted to them. Of course, having sex with a trans woman can be seen as gay, but you're doing it for a straight reason, if that makes sense. You may think having sex with one with a penis means you like the penis, but you can avoid it entirely as well. It's different if you're attracted to beards, adams apples, pecs, and such."

"26:43 I wonder if another ‚Äúhappy medium‚Äù can be found in a ‚Äúchaser‚Äù who is able to see their girlfriend as whole human being, and also a sexy person. Being most attracted to a kind of person doesn‚Äôt preclude also seeing them as a person. If they do that, they can negotiate the topping/bottoming/whatever like any other couple.   I had a pretty specific  ‚Äútype‚Äù and met a man of that type. It didn‚Äôt block my ability to see him as a person. We spent ten years of our lives together.   This might also be the best advice for those ‚Äúchasers‚Äù. Might as well date what they‚Äôre attracted to rather than date someone they are less attracted to in fear of fetishizing their partner.   (Also, just gotta mention that this whole video is another fantastic gem by Natalie.)"

"You look incredibly hot in this video. Now am I gay? /jk No, seriously you're really hot (God bless HRT) and on top of that smart, I've learned a lot from your videos. The problem I see is that it's hard for us to learn about these things without purposefully seeking information about this in the context of cultures that are just starting to accept that genitalia and gender aren't the same thing. So your work is wonderful but it's just paving the way for future generations to be more accepting of transgender people."

"Everything until the 'feminine penis' is flawless to me , but after that everything is a big WTF ???  Penises on transgender woman are like a remnant of their old body ,the male one, so of course sucking it is gay , because it's a male distinctive traits.  And now if a gay dude meet a transgender man , go in bed with him and *surprise* he have a vagina how is he supposed to react? (obviously not by killing the transgender man)  What if the gay dude wanted to be pounded ? How is that gonna work with a vagina?  Do masculine vagina also exist ? How is that even possible?   When you are a straight guy and you're about to have sex with a woman , i don't think you are expected to have no problem about sucking a dick... ( i don't say the video say that ,  but a lot of Transgender woman act like it was an incomprehensible reaction)    And this whole thing about : 'you're not gay if you not decide so'  WTF ? I know don't having the choice about what you are is a terrible thing , but it's the reality , if you fuck with man and you like that you're *GAY* (or bi)  AND... no problem , live your life , it's good.  I don't think this kind of situation will arranging itself if we pretend that our sexuality don't have anything to do with our behavior.   We all need to acknowledge who we are and make a choice , lying to ourselves isn't a good way i think.  And i am myself not at zero on the diverse sexuality spectrum.  Hope i wasn't a harsh douchebag , if anyone read this. And sorry for bad english."

I say this as someone who have been out active in the transgender community since 1994 and full time for the past 14 years.  Lastly who cares if it is gay or not.  It is only important if at all to the individuals who are intimately involved."

So why is it that the people who are so adamant that others take into consideration their thoughts and feelings are incapable of realizing that other people also have their own thoughts and feelings? It sucks that for the most part men or actually most people see you as a trans-woman and not as the woman you know yourself to be. That men have to be 'into that sort of thing' to date you because that must make you feel like a perversion, not a person. And no one deserves that.

"I am openly trans mtf and often am active on an online chat on reddit as a mod, and as you can guess I  do get this phrase shot at me. And I do often have to deal with people genuinely asking 'are traps gay'?  So, instead of getting annoyed or generally angry, i instead keep calm and first explain that trap is a term not for a trans person, but for an individual who identifies as a man, and dresses effeminate to the point of appearing female. The two are distinctly different, but became conflated due to association.   I also bring up a relatively small fetish, of which 'trap' has been attributed to. Its the fetishization of hyper feminity among individuals of the male sex. This includes both trans and non trans individuals. Now in truth, there are many fetishes surrounding this idea, futunari, sissy, femdom, etc, but explaining that a trap and a trans person arent the same, and that being either doesnt make one gay, often helps their understanding of the concept as a whole and makes the community a bit more positive (though it occasionally leads to discussion about fetishes, so yeah, that's fun.)."

And that it applies to Transgenders is just a silly notion that the SJW community of fucked up ignorant idiots came up with 3 years ago, after all, a mtf or ftm can't be considered a trap due to having the physique of the opposite gender albeit not biological, hence why it isn't a trap but rather a genetical dead end, which considering that gender dysphoria is a mental illness, could be considered a good thing, seeing as some mental illnesses are hereditary, such as Schizophrenia and many similar diagnoses such as Borderline.  To even claim that your opinion is to claim the truth is an easily falsifiable claim. I'm not saying that you are doing this out of ill will, but there are a lot nicer and respectable trans people out there, even here on YouTube. Now if you excuse me, I have an actual life that needs to be lived, and enough of my own problems to play Psychiatrist with a lunatic."
"And another thing...üòÅ If a trans-woman has her shit together to the point where I am attracted to her how does that make me gay? I would be reacting to visual cues (mostly) and her genitals are not on display. So obviously her face and body have a feminine aesthetic to them. As a straight male that is what I am supposed to react to. If I was the male in the bar situation I would not punch her (you don't hit girls) but rather I would compliment her on the quality of her craft. Is that the right word?"

I know that you are a trans woman, simple as that, but in the beginning of the video I though you were only in drag.

"The whole calling transsexuals traps is wrong since the anime archetype is not a person who has different gender than sex but (usually) a male character wearing dress and acting like woman but identifying as a homo- or bisexual male (there are also women clothed and acting as guys and many other variations but for the simplicity I will only write about the most popular traps). The trap is closer to drag queen or transvestite than anything. What's more even though the archetype is often used as a punch line of the joke 'guy like this girl but it's not a girl' in some animes in many other (especially recently since everyone got tired of it) they are also shown in a pretty positive light. The first positive LGBT character I saw in media was Haku from Naruto. He wasn't transsexual per se but he was extremely feminine (both in his appearance and demeanor). The protagonist (!) got flustered when he found out about that he was attracted to the man but not disgusted. The femininity of Haku didn't make him weak or evil (which sadly often happens on anime) but gave him strength and purity (in the best meaning of the word). Sadly he and his (I'm not sure if romantic or not) partner couldn't escape the good gay curse (they died tragically)   Nowadays the 'traps' are less trappy than in the past. They're more open about that who they are and other characters surrounding them are more accepting of them. For example Felix from Re:Zero is a very flirty man with very feminine appearance and clothing. The protagonist shrugs off his advances but more because he is just not interested and already in love with his heroine than because of his disgust   Sadly there is almost no transsexual and homosexual representation in anime and strangely erotic sport animes, cute (no homo) girls doing cute things and traps are usually the best we get but again, the trend is changing (Yuri on ice for example, the first truly gay anime)   So, going back to the question: are traps gay (or rather: is being attracted to the traps make one gay) the best answer I think gave Misinformed. Since one is still attracted to guys it's gay but less gay than being attracted to the more masculine man. This is what makes the difference. Traps are not transsexuals. They are still very much male but just like to show their girly side  Similarly in anime community traps are not transsexual but more transvetive (without the LGBT stigma). This is where the quote: 'penis makes it only better' comes from"

You never win against a joke because it‚Äôs a joke. It‚Äôs not even charged against any real group of people. It‚Äôs a joke about anime boys who look like girl and jokingly asking if they‚Äôre gay."

"'Traps' are absolutely gay. Men can have the same sense of preferences as a biological woman. There's no way to distinguish how a man's sense of gender differs from a woman's sense of gender without eventually appealing to biology. The social construct gender has always been an inadequate means of distinguishing real men from real women. No one, but trans people think a sense of gender has anything to do with being a man or woman. I sure as hell don't. Never have.        A so called 'M to F sex change' is cosmetic. It's a PC label that preys largely on a scientific ignorance of what a woman's sexual organ* is (A baby incubator, capable of exchanging homo gametic information). Also, genital phenotypes don't determine if you're male ore female. Only chromosomes do. Trans women are just biological men that challenge and expand what is commonly considered to be male behavioral and phenotypic norms. Gender is just an opinion. Biology is a fact.          -KP"

"'Of the 102 transgender murders between 2013 and 2017, 86 percent of the victims were black, Hispanic or Native American, 11 percent were white and 5 percent were unknown by the organization, according to a 2017 report.'  So most of the transgender women murdered each year are non-white?  Would it be incorrect to assume that most of the men who  have killed/will kill them are also non-white?  In addition, though I don't mean to sound uncaring, but 102 transgender people being murdered over 4 years is not that many.  Look into how many blacks are murdered/killed each year, especially cases in which both the offender and the victim are black; there are too many."

Like you wouldnt be offended if someone would say, you are just a gay man dressed as a woman, because its not your identity.  I mean, this is kinda how insults works. You cant really insult someone with things what matches with their identity.  And by the way, you nonstop throw shade at straight men, i know you at least half joking, and you probably not as meany as you show and i do laugh, because you are funny.  But if would be offended by something, all i would get is 'oh your fragile masculinity', and then you come with 'i have feelings too'.

"I don't want to be gay because I want to fertilize someone I love, and raise those children. I want the ideal straight relationship. I guess by your definitions I can fuck around all I want and not be gay, but I kinda like my perception of my own sexuality as it is, and I'd rather not screw it up by experimenting. And experiments in gay shit, even if it doesn't make me gay personally, aren't really worth anything to me.   Look, I like to cum, and I like to cuddle. But considering I can do one with myself and the other with my cat, I'd rather be more pragmatic with my sexuality. I'm not really promiscuous. The idea of sex outside of a relationship doesn't really appeal to me, and I don't really care about building romantic relationships that aren't going to go anywhere near where I want them to."
"Came here thinking it would be about shitposting. Was surprised by how well thought out and helpful this turned out. I really started having to think about what my own opinion and sexuality/ gender identity is. I have poked fun at my best friend's husband for his fetishizing of trans women, but deep down I did think that trans women are still male technically. I respected their choice to think of themselves as whatever gender they wanted but I thought of it as more wishful thinking or even self-deluded. ''  To be honest I'm not sure if my opinion has changed. I've thought I wished I could be a cute girl plenty of times in the past, and with the added complication of being nearly 7ft tall and 350lbs what most made me decide it wasn't for me is the fear of losing my penis. It is not really one I could say I'm proud of or anything, but I can't imagine ever being okay without it. You have convinced me on the point that a man being attracted to a trans woman does not make him gay.   As far as 'Trap' being gay, I've never associated the term traps with real people. I always reserved it for anime characters that for all intents and purposes in the context of the anime might as well be female, but the creator for typically comedic purposes decided to point out that they are actually a guy. Usually the character was not even attempting to look female and has to constantly remind others they are male.   I know the thought of anime using gender identity as a joke is probably offensive to you, but to be fair anime has a weird association with comedy and sex. They use vanilla perversion as and equivalent slapstick humor, incest and pedophilia are treated along the lines of dick and fart jokes, gay men are typically represented as frankenfurter style transvestites (kind of similar to clowns humor wise), the super buff body builder that seems to love public nudity (Light cringe humor on the level of 'Dad Jokes'), or the really effeminate thin tall male that comes across as belonging to one of the sides of the dark triad and typically at least a little rapey (this version isn't really comedy).   I'm pretty sure that traps are built upon anime satirizing itself. In the early days of anime it was commonly joked about that men were animated to look just as pretty as the women, something not very common to real life or the cartoons we had in the states. Some anime ran with this and made it a twist by having the most attractive character be male. This kept becoming more of a trope in anime over time. They stopped using distinctively male voices, and eventually even made the male MC point out that he finds them attractive and just wishes they were a girl (This is a heavier level of cringe humor like getting a boner in class and being called up to the black board).   I know that knowing sexuality and gender identity are used for comedy will not likely help you feel better about the whole thing but hopefully knowing the context is not always used for actual trans people and that it is a difference in cultural humor might help. In recent years there have been attempts by anime to take trans people more seriously imo more so than they do with homosexuality, pedophilia, incest, or other forms. Characters are given more backstory and being treated like regular people instead of straw-men or tropes."

Like, I remember one time I was wearing a scarf with a pin that says 'GAY' to let people know that I'm gay, I guess. Jeez aren't I weird. But then some philosophy guy decided to walk-up to me and philosophized as to why I am visibly gay. And I as a philosophy... person, said absolutely nothing in return, because what the hell am I supposed to say? that 'You're not a real philosopher, you're just using philosophy to justify your reactionary based lifestyle that I presume is super shitty.' but that's not philosophical, that's just common sense. lulz But I still believe philosophy is useful, it's just there are a lot of 'philosophers' who don't understand that they are humongous shit bags when they render topics such as homosexuality as being a product of 'bad faith' (That's what Sartre fucking did.) But that's a bad example, because people could assume that only philosophers in the past done shit like that. When I read philosophy forums online I would even see some random asshats thinking they're so dEEEEEEp for suggesting that sex workers are evil, heartless capitalist who only work for money and self interest and never for love. And I'm just making a real argument in return about how it's necessary to do what it takes to survive in a capitalist environment and in mid typing I'm like 'huh...

"I came to see someone take the are trap gay in a more serious..end up learning so must more. I never actually knew anyone that is trans. I have one point of life though I might be a trans-guy. (then I realized i'm just gender-fluid.), and my boyfriend which not sure his stand. He might just be into it as cross-dressing, or he might consider more as a trans-female. But otherwise then that. I never meet at trans, and I never for one. Though trap was directed at them. I always though they were towards drag-queens and cross-dressing guys.  I always thought it to be both yes and no. Even more sure if trans-women being drag into the mess. Some guys just cross-dress for fun, and/or like to look that way. Yet prefer women. Some guys are gay and like to go really feminine. Trans-women are well, women. Sometimes it isn't as to just go with surges, since I still of opinion it is still not the best. Hormones seem to do wonders though.   And just..'straight'. i always thought it was related to being attracted to oppeset gender in full. so man into femininity/a vee, or a woman into masculinity/a pen. Like...seriously, sucking a nipple. A man, did they glue their nipples on, or somewhat feminine to grow them in first place? Fuck no. So, if a girl going to suck ya nipple cause she think you might, or you do enjoy it. Isn't going to be gay. Funny thing to note. It seems by numbers that gay men, *gasp* surprisingly prefer masculinity men! Not by traps, or trans-women. So, only people that fall for a 'trap' would be a straight man. hmmmmmm. (excluding bi btw. They wouldn't be complaining in first place.)"

"See I always thought that trap described cute cross dressing anime boys like Felix (Re:Zero), and not transgender at all. Even though they dress as women, and often pass as women, whether willingly or like Nagisa (Assassination Classroom) comically less so, they adamantly identify as men, even if their sexuality is ambiguous (usually in the case of them being an uncertain harem addition). I also knew a guy who was a big fan of trap characters, although I'm not sure how seriously he liked them or what his orientation was, but he had a Felix T and everything, like that's not something you find without searching, so there's definitely an audience for trap characters in anime, and I think they're mostly men, although who can say XD While in some cases this may be used to comedic effect, and may not be destinctly defined as separate from transgender leading to derogatory views in some cases, I never considered trap to equal trans."

"nobody who uses the word trap unironically is to be taken serious, 'they' just didnt get the joke in the first place. in the tongue of my people, it's always been used in appreciation.   but on topic: as a gay with an understanding of biology, i feel like the core aspect of sexualiy, reproduction, is left out big time. and the purely hedonistic approach strikes me as counterproductive, to do the topic justice. (perhaps in a future video? this one was long enough)"

"Not only is this amazingly done but it captures a lot of my own fears as a recently out trans woman. And this is one of the few peices of media that not only entertained me but made me feel better about those fears and as a side note I'm not attracted to men at all but my fears about presentation still come up when thinking about dating other women.

"ContraPoints I love your videos and seriously wish the debate was between transwomen like you and as equally funny, creative and intelligent people who look the opposite line.   But my love a PENIS IS NEVER FEMALE!   Sorry, you can't argue this ever convincingly.   Hormonally altering your sperm count etc is just a medicated male penis.  Thing is, so what if a straight man has what is effectively a bi experience? Why does everything else have to be redefined for him?  In short, it doesn't!   If a gay man sleeps with a woman, he's had a straight experience. End of!"
"What I find so funny is that, to these people, sexual orientation is apparently a one-way street. Like, you've engaged in opposite-sex sexual behaviour your entire life but you engage in same-sex sexual behaviour once and that then makes you gay and you forever stay gay after that. But if a guy who has engaged in same-sex sexual behaviour his entire life then engaged in opposite-sex sexual behaviour once, none of these people would start referring to him as straight. They use completely different logic when talking about heterosexuality than when talking about homosexuality with no apparent reason why."
"You probably used it half-ironically but I do have to say I'm not a huge fan of that whole 'real man' BS. There are no behaviours, personality or physical traits that make someone a 'real man'. If you're a man, you're a man, if you're not, you're not and the way you act, look or dress has got nothing to do with it. So yeah, technically, those 'insecure little boys' are no more or less worthy of being called a man than any other man. (They are more worthy of being called insensitive idiots, though.)"

"I have a question, didnt finish yet but I dont want to forget to ask this: you argue that attraction towards a trans person is 'not gay' by asserting that the trans person in question is in fact a women, but isnt that arguing about attraction towards gender rather than biological sex? Me for example, I would say that trans women are women if they claim that as their gender, but what if I say that I view my sexual attraction in terms of biological sex, would that then be considered 'gay'? Another example, if I had creatures, with the only thing distinguishing them is sex chromosomes xx and xy, and an xy claims a female gender identity, and another xy is attracted to xy, would we not classify that as homosexual? I would like someone to help me understand"
"I personally don't consider trans women 'traps'. I feel like there has to be an element of intent to trick the other party. Transwomen aren't trying to trick people that they are women because they are women. Also I always thought that 'Are traps gay?' refers to traps themselves. (and in that case the answer would be sometimes). But men who 'fall' for traps aren't gay. I think it's kinda gay to be into dick, but if it's just part of some kind of kink (meaning it's important that the dick is on a woman and not a man), I wouldn't consider it gay."

"This was great, I liked this video, I thought it was super smart and funny but, you really should have been clear that Count Dankula being fined 800 bucks for doing a tasteless edgy joke, was dumb. Stuff like Count Dankula being fined for a edgy joke for this is the sort of thing that drives people, especially young people away from the left and towards the right in droves.  I know Contra did a tweet about this saying she doesn't think Dankula shouldn't have been fined and that this was a joke but, at most like 5% of the people who watched this video will see that tweet. Calling him a hate crime convict might lead to somewhat moderate people who who would otherwise be convinced by this video to shut it off before they could change there viewpoints to something better. It was a pretty big mistep in a really great video."

"While I genuinely really loved this video, I couldn't help but feel slightly betrayed as contra left enbie folks in the closet again. Specially after mentioning them at the end of the video. Sure, most people she directioned this to wouldn't be able to process that cog in the whole machinery, but just an aside would've been really reassuring. She mentions she had relations with NB people, so... They don't factor in all of this? Are their parts and ways of having sexual relations just 'masculine' or 'feminine'?   I know she asked to reach for enbie creators on the Pronouns video, and she is correct, she shouldn't speak over us... But I couldn't help but feel this video was also specially binarist, and even worse so without anything relates to 'and people can be in bed completely different than a woman and a man as well'. Would've been so simple to include us, you know?"

"Okay, this is a well-made video, with some good points that I agree with, like 'don't be a homophobe, it makes your sex life suffer' and 'don't subscribe to a fragile sense of masculinity' just to name two of the many that I agree with. Though I think that you focused on the 'trap = transwoman' definition of the argument to show people why the term 'trap' is offensive to some transwomen, which is good, you're trying to prove a point, okay. But the definition of trap normally doesn't actually mean that, or, it kinda does, it's definition is looser than portrayed in the video. Yes, a trap can mean a transwoman, but there are two other definitions, a more widely known definition is a man that has feminine features, but is fully a man, and identifies as one, looking to r/traps or any other place where 'self-defined traps' post pictures of themselves, that is the definition that they go by. But then there is another subgroup that is seen, transwomen who call themselves 'traps' and do the same as the gay(again, loose definition, because humanity always provides acceptions to anything you say about it) traps on the same forums. When I hear someone say 'Are traps gay?', I have to ask them 'What kind of Trap and what is the situation?', because if the situation is having sex with the first definition of trap that I provided, that would be gay, they don't have a feminine penis and are fully a man, but they have a feminine face and wide hips, still gay. But if it's with either of the transwomen definitions of a trap, I'd say 'it's not gay, but it's not straight either'. This brings me to the next point id have to slightly disagree with you on, that transwomen are completely the same to biological women in the minds of straight men, there's a difference, some male characteristics still pop out after transitioning and there is... the penis. I know you brought this up in the video, but, even though it's feminine doesn't make it completely straight to like it, nor does it make it gay to like it. I look to the Cambridge study(Found here: https://d-miller.github.io/assets/HsuEtAl2015.pdf) on men who are attracted to both transwomen and women. This study found that these men had the same level of arousal that straight men had when it came to women, but when it came to transwomen, completely straight men liked them a little, but not even half as much as biological women, while another group (called GAMP in the paper) liked biological women and transwomen as much as straight men liked only biological women. The gay group was the only group that was aroused by gay sex to a large degree. Now you might be saying, 'why are we even talking about this in the first place, why are we playing the is it gay game?',  well, playing it nowadays is more of a joke, no one really cares unless you're a diehard Christian who can't live until you've done it, like, the question that gets most asked is 'is it gay if you suck your homie off if you have socks on? you're not naked, so I think it's not gay.', like no one really does it anymore, idk, it might just be a  gen Z thing.  But also, asking who cares, it's straight guys, who don't want to get mislabeled as gay because they did an act that a homosexual man would enjoy, like how you wouldn't want to be mislabeled as a man because you were born biologically male.  There is another part of your video I don't really agree with, its the part where you sorta dehumanized the people that you disagree with, or think you disagree with. Like Count Dankula who you called 'a man convicted of a hate crime'. Yeah, he technically is, but he shouldn't have been convicted of that. I mean, the brunt of his joke that landed him that conviction is that Nazis are terrible, how is that a hate crime, unless it's a hate crime against Nazis? He also doesn't have anything against trans people, his whole opinion is that he just doesn't give a fuck. I can agree that Ben Shapiro's opinions on trans people are pretty backward though. Then you include Jordan Peterson in the mix? He's not against trans people at all, he doesn't hate them or anything, his whole situation wasn't against trans people, but it was against the government forcing the type of speech that you can say/have to say, and that that legislation is terrible for the rights of the people. How is that anti-trans?  TL;DR - I like a lot of what you say in this video, you've gained a sub, but, you could have addressed other parts of the question itself, and you really have dehumanized some people who don't oppose you.  Other than those things, great video, great production, and, damn, that make-up was on point! Sincerely from,                                                                                                                                                                                                   A Bisexual dude from Georgia."

"I mean, the crux of this story is actually that you're changing definitions and building your argument on that changed definition. You say that sexual attraction is attraction to the same/opposite/both _gender_, and this is just not true. You're attracted to the same/opposite/both SEX. If we're talking about physical, sexual attraction, you can't be attracted to a concept, you can't be attracted to how the neurons fire in someone's brain, you can't be attracted to an internal feeling someone else has about themselves. In this case, you are attracted to their body. You're attracted to a certain sex."
"This gave unique viewpoint to the whole issue. Thank you Contra. So much wisdom and understanding. With true heart.  My god. If everyone on the left would have such drive for understanding and TRUTH itself, world wouldn't be in this mess that it is. We wouldn't have given up power in society to worthless corporations and to egoistical greed, for we would have understood that power itself cannot be maintained just by happy thoughts and condemnation. For if our grip on power is weak, by us more wise and capable than your average peasant is, then those with less noble ideas and much less understanding and love to give _will_ take power for themselves.   If we seek wisdom and truth, then stupidity and feebleness must not be tolerated anymore. Real acceptance must be the ONLY goal, not some shallow theather that so many liberals these days want to perform. Truth herself must come above all. No more weakness to lies, deception or opportunism. Those MUST be beneath us, only to be scorned by us who see how worthless those values are to collective."

"Words have only the power that everyone gives them. 'Trap' has become one of the words that has come under fire in recent times.   I do not find the term 'trap' to be offensive and I use it freely if I feel it describes whomever I am referring to. (Usually effeminate men who enjoy wearing women's clothing, and not actual trans people) I will of course refrain from using it if I know it would be potentially offensive to my current company.  Overall, a word does nothing, its the people and ideas the are behind it that cause trouble, I just find it silly that a simple collection of letters can divide people."

"I must disagree with your description of attraction.  I, as a uni-sexual, prefer to describe it as a sex attraction, rather than a gender attraction. If I wanted to elaborate further, I would say I am attracted to female women. I have an automatic physiological response to an attractive female body that I do not have with any male body and this will occur regardless of the pronouns these people use. I am also attracted to women-in the sense of gender expression-but that comes secondarily and I can't even state what exactly makes a 'woman' anyway. What a 'woman' is and 'should be' has changed throughout time. I'm more likely to be attracted to an FTM who either hasn't transitioned or is in in his early stages and still appears quite feminine than I would be of an MTF in the same stage. I could find a female non-binary attractive, despite the fact that they don't identify as a woman.  Likewise, it is more likely that I would find a post-op (or post-however-long-the-hormones-take) MTF more attractive than an FTM in the same  stage. That said, if the woman I initially found attractive has a penis, my arousal will quickly dissipate. For me-and for other lesbians, I'm sure (straight men seem to love penis, as you state)-the penis is an antidote to arousal. Again, this is an automatic response.  This is probably not how bisexuals would describe their attraction though and perhaps it is here-in this difference of experience-where the confusion lies.  I refer to trans people with their preferred pronoun and fully accept them as women, but I cannot help the way my body reacts to visual stimuli. It's an interesting topic, I think.  With all that said, I do believe it is important to reduce the hatred towards trans-people. It is helpful, not only to trans people, but to cis women of all sexualities and to gay men. (Also, trans people are human beings. That argument isn't as enticing, unfortunately.)  It is my belief that a hatred of gay men comes not from their sex attraction, but from their perceived treachery to masculinity.  They don't adhere to the boxes society has allotted their gender. This is true regardless of how the gay man actually behaves because every gay man is 'effeminate' to the anti-LGBTx sort. As you stated, a man's sexuality is often conflated with his masculinity. Femininity is less than masculinity. It is weak and vulnerable. It is soft and it cries a lot. So, when a male becomes more feminine, in any way, he is becoming lesser and is worthy of hatred. We all have 'perceived femininity'-rather, 'perceived weakness'-in common. I hope this makes sense."

(yes I mean girly boys not trans girls though I'm completely and unashamedly attracted to trans girls when I'm attracted to them, haven't been trying to hide that)  but now I'm kind of thinking, these trinary labels for sexuality are, insufficient to fully describe my feelings of attraction, especially considering that no matter how many different categories of people I decide to claim to be attracted to, I'll never be attracted to EVERYbody who falls into that category, nor will I be garaunteed to not be attracted to people who are completely outside those categories."

"Honestly the majority of men who attack trans women are most likely insecure, as in their masculinity is very WEAK.   If you're going to be doing something sexual, both parties should be truthful to each other, the vast majority of straight men are not going to want to have sex with a trans women no matter how hot they look.  I had a debate with some of my friend's about 'if i suck my own dick to masturbate, am i gay?' initially 50% said yes 50% no. The party that said no basically said you're doing it for enjoyment but you're still attracted to women... however we all came to the same conclusion in the end that it's a 'gay' act but it doesn't make you psychologically gay. The men who explode from being 'trapped' basically cannot differentiate this difference, their psyche cannot rationalize what with had happened against their identity.   If the transwoman had the full body make over, speaking as a straight man i think,  in principle, i still wouldn't want to but if i was to have sex with a transwoman with the assumption she was a biological women i wouldn't say i was gay... because in the end i am still attracted to women... i might feel a bit disgusted with myself (not going to lie), because the thought of having sex with a man is something the majority of straight men cringe at."

"Doesn't this make a mess of the 'sex and gender are different things' angle though?  A transgender women's gender is woman. Their biological sex is (intersex cases aside) male. A homosexual relationship is one between two people of the same _sex_. So a transwomen and a cis man are in a homosexual relationship. Not that that's an issue, but if this is how we are doing the terms that's how it works out."
"Reverse traps are twice as gay."
"I guess one of the few things I disagree here is charging a term towards a group that used said term in a different way.  Not saying the points you used in the video are invalidated in any way, it should be reinforced if it is used by some to demean trans people (Though I personal don't quite believe in this word), but the 'issue' I have is how this can be used to blame or shame people (like me) who simply use the term trap when it comes to anime or irl boys that dress and look a lot like girls and not to attack or whatever transgender people.  I'm sure someone could say 'But it doesn't matter how you use it, to me it means something else', and to that I'd say, which is more in the right here then? The person who mostly see the term traps used to demean trans people, or the person who mostly see the term traps as to what I mentioned above? Is it something like the word Gay, that was usually used to refer to someone who was happy and now it's mostly used when referring to a homossexual man/woman? I do feel like this topic was purposefully taken away from the 'weeb'/hentai/anime context to which the meme itself was born, and a bit charged with the irl narrative of harassment against trans people (Which in itself is a serious topic) to make the pro-trans arguments seen here, if it was simply a video talking about transphobia I would support this 100%  All in all, I may not agree mostly agree with her views on stuff, either due to my own lack of knowledge on something or just because my views differ, but I'm glad people who felt like they needed a voice have someone like her on YouTube."

"Nice vid. I love that Skull headdress.   On a side note regarding the Philosphy section: the question of ‚Äúare trans women women?‚Äù Becomes a very interesting one when comparing the Gender binary and the 4 or 5 gender theory (the idea that trans women and trans men deserve their own gender categories to better reflect their childhood socialisation, impacts of puberty‚Äôs psychological development, psychological impact of transition etc.) and the complications when discussing sexuality when we are so used to discussing it in terms of a linear transition from hetero through pan/bi to homosexuality.   Of course, both the gender binary and the 4/5 gender theory can be criticised as transphobic, the 5 gender theory because it separates trans and cis women, and can be viewed as othering trans people. On the other hand, the gender binary can be criticised as transphobic as it lumps trans people into cisgendered categories, and given the population differences, can mean the unique elements of being a trans woman or trans man can be drowned out in the throng of voices.  Just to reiterate, this comment was supposed to be an interesting start to a train of thought, exploring ideas of two concepts of gender and the complexities of sexuality and how they interact, NOT to provide a means for transphobes to claim ‚Äútrans women aren‚Äôt the same as cis women according to 5 gender theory, so being attracted to them isn‚Äôt the same as being attracted to cis women‚Äù urgh."

"So, what word should be used to replace 'trap'?  While it is used for negative purposes, a lot of the guys who use the word 'trap' are using it to explore their own blossoming attraction to an mix of masculinity and femininity. And I think the community IS ultimately allowing guys to come to term with their preferences, so giving an alternate means of expression seems important. Saying trans instead doesn't envelop the sector that likes guys who just look feminine, or some of the beings that exist only in fiction. And if we expect people to stop using it (particularly on the internet where there are basically no consequences), I think it's important to present an alternative."
"Really great video, feel it would be really important for pretty much anyone to see who has issues figuring out what people mean when they talk about trans. But if I have a critique, its that the point you are arguing, traps, isn't really what you are talking about.   I really don't know how to word this correctly so maybe its due to me having too much knowledge or too little, but trap and trans aren't related or the same thing. A trap is like what you pointed out as drag or a crossdresser, someone who is a man and considers themselves a man, but likes to dress up or appear feminine, usually for sexual reasons (they get off on it). Like to dress up and act feminine, but as you pointed out, there is a point where it all 'comes off' and see that its actually just a guy...hence the trap name (you've been 'tricked', this is actually a guy). So the whole point of 'are traps gay?', when seen by my logic of a trap is a guy who thinks he is a guy presenting as a woman/something more feminine, is true, since the other partner would preferably know that the trap is a guy and likes them being a guy, who just presents themselves more feminine.   Where as someone who is trans...is someone who is trans. They were born one gender but consider themselves another, and so being refered to as being a trap, as in they are just 'pretending' to be the gender (like you pointed out) is wrong and insulting.  I guess the point you are mainly trying to argue is to not use the word trap when describing someone who is trans, which to that I agree since they arent at all related or the same thing, but having the trap phrase be the basis of the video, when what the video is actually more about is a deep dive into what trans specifically is and all the different variations of it, I think kind of hurts the message you're trying to get across.  ...or I could be completely wrong who knows."
"Very interesting video. I, myself never took this meme unironically. I thought all people did. I always thought question 'are traps gay' bascially faces a person who likes 'traps', with the fact, he/she is not entirely heteronotmative(as defined by majorly heteronormative society). Basically facing your 'a bit evoled' heteronormativity.   Cases with people killing guys turning female are quite sobering. Holy shit! Can anyone in their right mind claim he did 'not know' about 'adittional equiptment' and stuff? Defending this degenerated heteronormativity is really enraging and sad at a same time.   I'd love to live in a country where I'd have an option of finding a cute girl like that ... But to be sincere, I am not sure, I would ever be able to be in such a relationship with a long-term perspective in sight. I want a child of my own and with girls like this, this is not an option. ButI'm sure technology will eventually fix that too.   Sidenote: I wonder what will a technological ability to transfer mind of an adult into an in-vitro bred body of a child do in term of cultural norms and laws."

"I dont really agree with you that traps aren't gay.  However I do respect your personhood and think you are pretty good at making videos. I would consider myself center right and while I do not believe the world is black and white and think there are grey areas. I fundamentally think  there are things that can't stray far from human evolution as biological  evolution is too slow compared to cultural change. Being attracted to a male that can pass as a woman is still inherently homosexual (although I would argue less so than compared to regular homosexuality, but I don't really see this as a bad thing).   Also I just want to point out the number of victims of hate crime influenced murder against trans women and men were only a very small fraction of the total transgender population which is around 1.4 million people. 29 people being killed annually has almost no meaningful effect on datasets and affects a total of 0.00002071428% of the total american transgender population. So I would argue that is an extremely weak point.    When it comes to the philosophy  of this specific meme, I would argue that no matter how much you feminize a man or make a woman masculine; while there will definitely be differences from before and after the transitioning process. There will be biological differences that you cannot mask, such as natural testosterone production:  https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/2018/02/20/medicine-alone-does-not-completely-suppress-testosterone-levels-among-transgender-women/.  Now lets say theoretically we improve hormonal medicine to the point where we can bring down the natural testosterone production and increase estrogen to the point where the hormones are almost identical to that a of a natural born female. The reason this would still be considered homosexual is because of the affect testosterone has on the brains structure during intrauterine life of male embryos. This testosterone physically alters the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonad axis of male brains, which affects behavioral characteristics, toy preferences, verbality and extends into adulthood.    Now I would like to direct my rationale into the physical realm of transgender females; if we were to judge sexuality at it's purest and most honest form; we would move past the subjectevity when it comes emotional attraction/ judgement (I would also argue that you are selling yourself short in these areas as you seem to be an interesting person) and move onto what makes men sexually attracted to women on a biological level.   Males of all species are very simple when it comes to reproduction; when they see a female that exhibits attributes that signal the ability to propogate a lot of a healthy young that will perpetuate both genepools. This changes from species to species, but when it comes to the human species; we have very predictable beauty standard that can be applied to almost every culture on the planet. An attractive human female has these characteristics: symmetrical face highlighting, thinner eyebrows, rounded face (or rounded face corners), less pronounced forehead,  smaller nose, fuller cheeks, a lack of facial hair, etc.  This also includes body characteristics such as large enough breasts for enough milk production and a waist to hip ratio that signals no complications during birth.   No matter how many soy lattes a man drinks this will be wired into his brain as his ideal. There is a reason why hot girls have significantly more beta orbiters than  ugly girls.    Now comes to the conclusion of my argument for why sexual intercourse with a transgender woman is on the edge of homosexuality. At the end of the day as well as you and many other pass as females there will be the main distinction that you cannot provide us babies. Unfortunately there is no current way to merge our DNA into a new human being that will be next in line to continue our line of genetic successors. This is the ultimate thesis of masculinity and feminity; the ability to create union where there is havoc and make a new life.    Now when it comes down the statement to defend myself against the inevitable critics of my comment. Let me say that in the future if there was the magical technological ability; to transition a biological man into a biological woman. Then I wouldnt consider this a homosexual act and would 100% support this technology.    I do not wish any transgender men or women harm and I honestly would feel happy and fulfilled if the LGBTQ community would be able to thrive as they currently are."

"@ContraPoints : 'are traps gay' is a stupid boyish game. but by the same token you say words are meaningful by their use, then 'gay' is not something in itself. the problem is that your interpretation of the question is flawed since you don't share the paradigms (the worldview) of the players of the game. it's a case of incommensurability of the word use from one to the other worldview, in words of Thomas Kuhn. you cannot pretend that two (or infinite) paradigms held by different people are going to give you the same (conveniently, your) meaning for 'gay' or 'woman' or 'heterosexual man'. besides, that also assumes that for a 'spectrum' of genders you are still attached to a traditional woman/man dichotomy, where for the players of 'are traps gay' or simply for other people it could be the case (I don't mean that it would be a majority of people, but it could be the case) that they don't consider that cross-dressers and trans-women belong to either of these categories; they belong to a category of their own. and needless to say, the mere self-affirmation doesn't make you something. specially if you want society to consider you that something. it's a tricky game, this of social linguistics and there is no one valid answer to these questions. I like your video, though. you are a great communicator and artist, and your view on the matter is a valid and convincing political point, to some extent. in the end, everything is politics."

"It seems so strange to me. Like, this whole notion of 'of is it gay?' This is juvenile. Like, is your sense of self so fragile that just once hitting on a pretty trans woman, your entire identity unravels. What a weak sense of self. Women are beautiful and if you're attracted to femininity then it's likely you're attracted to trans women... and so what? What does it matter? If you're not interested because you prefer different plumbing, that's fine. But turn all fasci the moment your frail sense of self is outted as being not quite as 'pure' as you imagined, fuck you. All I'm saying here, is women are amazing and beautiful and varied and walking around with an extraordinarily flimsy understanding of manhood is really not healthy for you.  Gotta bring it back to 'Toxic Masculinity'. It's not only toxic for everyone else, but it's really toxic to men. It makes us shallow and unsophisticated. I'd like to live in a world, where people can be who they are without their existence apparently being some odd perceived 'gotcha' on my sexuality or identity. Which is the problem here. Men's sexuality, for some odd reason, has become part of their identity. But this has been the trend? Hasn't it? 'Straight White Men'... only a Conservative would be comfortable with that moniker... to strip your entire identity away to the most boring of descriptions... to take your experience as an individual and just trip it bare to the bare shell they want you to be. It's gross and because they see themselves this way, this is how they perceive the world: groups, shells, caricatures of their fear. They see other people are templates that deviate from their own. It's remarkably... collectivist...  I'm hoping for a day where we treat people as individuals rather than templates. But until then, gotta educate and stand up for what's right. Well done ContraPoints! :)"

"I think this is all very well reasoned and makes plenty of sense as far as furthering a baseline for people to be treated with empathy. But I don't think that it's necessarily the burden of people to do any more than be empathetic in their own lives when it comes to sexuality. If people find they are attracted to transgendered people they can do that on their own, try to exercise empathy whether they are attracted or not, and experience their life to the fullest.....that's fine. But I can't help but feel like you completely gloss over the non-violent outcome of being 'trapped'. You didn't educate me at all on whether it's bad form for a transgendered person to not disclose their genitals. 'Why should they?' is probably the question. Well...unless you believe that the world needs to eventually homogenize until the entire human population is sexually fluid,  I do think it's an unfair deception if your partner never realizes. I struggle to understand how that can't be. I also realize that my line of thinking must be some very aggressive hetero-normative worldview. It's just that, taken to the extreme, if people's identity becomes their lifestyle and their main hobby and everything they focus on and they also expect everyone around them to be so empathetic as to NOT be upset when they find a penis they weren't expecting....that is unreasonable. No one should have to have the kind of social training that it would take to subconsciously be permissive to whatever genitals they find during an encounter. And that circles me back to where I actually stand. Which is still that this video is very well reasoned and that I believe everybody should go out there fulfilling whatever appetites they have, loving whoever they want. I do think, though, that what ended up actually happening in this video is a subtle sort of plea for open minds on sucking feminine dick."

"When I was in Thailand, I learned of and saw some crossdressers pretending to be trans women, and sometimes they literally seductively lure straight tourists into a private place where their gang then proceeds to mug them. I think that THEY are worthy of 'trap.' Idk let me know what you think."
"a long one probably:  If I'm honest to myself, I came into this video expecting to hate it. I'm a straight 20 year old guy who frequents said anime-based imageboards and participates in the semi-joke 'are traps gay?'. I watched this video thinking I was in for an ill informed and poorly represented argument with a huge amount of unchecked bias, but there's very little to hate about this video. It consists of well informed points, well made and with the counter arguments explored, and with a healthy amount of humour too.  In regards to my response and whether I've been swayed, I'll say this: I'd never intend to legitimately refer to a trans person as a 'trap', but I will likely continue to engage in the joke, in reference to fictional characters or hypothetical circumstances but never in relation to a real person. As to the answer to the actual question, sexually I don't think I'm ever going to accept a trans person as a 'real' woman to the full degree, as I think this is probably one of those views that are so deeply ingrained that I'm going to be one of those embarrassing grandpas who uses slurs simply because it was a different time. I can't see myself ever having sex with a trans woman, penis or no penis, knowing that they are a trans person. I believe that this is a fact about my sexual identity that I can't change. That is not to say, however, that I won't endeavour to treat trans people properly and respectfully as equals, but my personal preferences forbid me from actually engaging sexually with a trans person. Perhaps in time this will change, but in the meantime I'd like to make it known that often logic can't dictate whether my dick's hard or not, and there's something intrinsic about the concept of sex with a trans person that makes my dick soften. I can only apologise if this is a problem, but it's not within my control. Maybe a few years of cultural deprogramming will change my sexual response to trans people.  I don't agree with your argument regarding the feminine penis, I personally believe it's another instance where the whole argument hinges on a set of things accepted to be 'true', but I think that arguing the point any further is pretty futile, and that the proper response to the question 'are traps gay?' should be 'who cares?'. If your dick tells you it's right, it's probably right in this case (unfortunately my dick tells me it's wrong but that's besides the point). For me, the whole 'is it gay' joke will remain a joke.  Regardless, thank you very much for this video, it was interesting to hear the perspective of someone from a different position to myself."

"Love it! Honestly, as a younger viewer I never even knew the term was a slur. I thought it was purely a meme applied to the anime crossdressers exclusively. You have opened so many doors for discussion, please continue doing these videos. For a future video, may I ask your thoughts on the intensity of sexuality as an experience. Like the kinsey scale, and the outlying sexualities of the scale."
"thank you"
"Ugh... Natalie's discussion about her transition gives me another reason to resent TERFs. How many transwomen are turned off by/scared of cis lesbians because of the hate? We have a small dating pool as it is, damn it! I'm just tired of all the infighting when all women (and men) should work together for equal rights and respect for human beings. But there is nothing truer than 'basic human decency IS too much to ask for on the internet.'"
"Idk if I'm a piece of shit because I don't want to fuck a unsugeried trans woman, because butt stuff makes me pee hole hurt.  But I do know the lighting in this vid ( like most vids) it fucking nice."
"I agree with your message though I guess, to me, there's a difference between 'trap' and a Transwoman,  The way I see it, a Trap is just a really cute/ girly boy who just dresses/ looks like a girl, yet does not identify as a trap.  And Trans being someone who defines themselves as a woman, has said mannerisms, dresses, acts, nearly indistinguishable as someone born with a Vag.  Also I absolutely hate the 'my body is a temple' mindset, like sure, why not make it a pleasure temple?"

I get that only so many are killed by hate crimes and will show up in the statistic but I don't see how that number is significant. If you balanced for population black people die nearly 3 times as often in hate crimes. Can someone explain why 29 is a significant number?"

"I'm very happy that I watched this video. I mostly saw 'traps' as an anime thing and had no idea there were individuals actually describing trans people as 'traps.' I had no idea this was a point of contention with...anyone!   Most of the time in an anime, a character who would be considered a 'trap' is just a boy that looks feminine. The characters usually don't present, identify, or are referred to as women in any sense, it's just the way the character is drawn that gives off a feminine appearance.   Some anime fans are still attracted to these characters even after finding out that the character is male, not female. Usually an anime trap is a cis man. Thus the question 'Are Traps Gay?' was born.  Trans women do not equal 'traps' in my mind because Trans women are women. I get why the word is definitely offensive to Trans Women though, it has a very negative connotation. I have to wonder though, is the Trans community picking this phrase up from the anime community and taking offense where none is meant? Or are people actually starting to label Trans individuals as 'traps?' Someone help me out here. I wanna be educated."
"francis bacon painting, nice"
"Genuinely as a bi cis male. I want to honestly understand this.  The point at 19:20. To me honestly the question of gay is non important. Like it shouldn't matter what you care about. So making the distinction of gay or not at his point seems weird. Again I'm a cis male who has always struggled with the issue of why classification matters so please explain to me why it matters to you. I promise I won't give a combative response.  Edit: Given continuing the video some of my thoughts were addressed. I'm know I'm terrible not finishing the video before I comment but I'm drunk so fugg off.  But I would still love to hear what the community has to say."
"The only concern I have is that I rarely (if ever) hear people referring to real people as traps. It‚Äôs just not something that happens outside of groups that are alt-right to begin with. To most people in the anime community, a trap is a fictional man who happens to look a lot like a woman and plays into that fact/is scripted in such a way as to actively try to trick the audience into thinking they‚Äôre a woman. They are not usually actually trans. Granted, there are instances where characters are scripted in this way and it‚Äôs implied they are trans/non-binary (Hideyoshi‚Äôs gender is just explained as ‚ÄúHideyoshi‚Äù), but this is definitely not the norm. Would you argue that the usage of trap in the context of anime is equally a slur that cannot be used?"

"42:42 You can only be a trap if you are trying to deceive others. If you are upfront with your transidentity nobody would call you a trap but just a transwoman, right?"
"I didn‚Äôt realize that trap included trans people. I thought it meant a cross dresser who was really convincing. I guess I never took the time to research, but from my real life and internet experience, I believed that cross dressers just dressed like the opposite sex but still identified as the other sex, for instance a male dressing as one would expect a female to, but still identifying as male. I thought cross dressing, and by extension being a trap, was more addressing an activity like cosplay than sexuality."

"I dont see why the answer to are traps gay even matters, isnt it perfectly acceptable to be gay these days? Some people might think its gay to date a transwomen as a hetero cis dude and others might not, everyone got their own opinion on transwomen and that should be okay. I personally wouldnt shame any dude for dating a transwoman but i also wouldnt date one myself, thats because for me the only real women are born and socialized as females but thats just my personal perspective on it, why would i force my views on others, you date who you wanna date and i date who i wanna date."

"I‚Äôve never called an actual trans women a trap or a real cross dresser but what about anime characters? I think it would still apply compared to other situations like this"
"Daddy Dankula did nothing wrong."
"This video was great, but I have a concern. I'm non-binary, I grew up on trap anime and never thought anything negative of it. Traps in anime are often the heroes, they're often worshiped for being traps and in the case of romance, the story often revolves around a heteronormative character on their journey to accept their attraction to that trap. There is gay panic, but it's the villain of the story, and is almost always defeated by the end of it. When I was more exposed to and educated on the real life usage of the word trap, it sent me into a shame spiral. As a queer, how could I love these stories that used their term in an such an empowering way when that term had caused so much suffering?  The one thing I want to point out is that there is a major difference between these stories and real life, and that is that a character that can be described as a 'trap' in anime typically would not be described as a transwoman. They often don't even identify as women, and are cis, or maybe genderqueer. The most famous trap of all, Bridget, is vehemently not a girl. He says so at every opportunity, and his motivation is to become more manly.   This isn't to discount the legitimate feelings of being triggered, the constant talk of sexual assault with the #metoo movement has been triggering the fuck out of me, so believe me, I get it. But just like how words like faggot can be taken from slur to pride, I think trap can have the same context as long as it's not referring to a transwoman. I'm not suggesting it be approved for polite conversation, and if someone is upset at the word I would not use it around them, but before getting offended, observe the context and ask is this really offensive, or am I just getting offended by it?"

"how is 'shemale' dehumanizing? shes are human. males are human. Its extra-descriptive because you have extra qualities. Seems like it solves the pronoun issue, tbh. Also, otc saline 0.9% has a pH of 5.5 (acidic). Also, saline is literally NaCl + H2O. Salt. Also, also: I know I want to reproduce. I want children. So the disclosure of one's ability to procreate (or chromosomes) is very important. Personally, I don't care who dates who. Who's gay and who's straight. But when it comes to finding a partner for myself, a family is a requirement. So 'Please check: __M __F' is quite important."

"I loved the video but the Count Dankula thing was a bit much. He made a joke about ruining his girlfriend's dog my making him a nazi, and posted the video on youtube. He stated it was a joke from the beginning, and by stating that the worst thing he could dpo to the dog was making him a nazi, he clearly stated he was against nazis. So no, it was not a hate crime to make that video, making jokes at the expense of nazis is not wrong, and what he was only convicted because the judge did not get the joke, which is fine, but to convict someone based on your taste for comedy is stupid, and if what he did was wrong then evey movie ever that has portrayed nazis or facism in any way should end with the whole fucking crew behind bars. I don't like the guy but he is not a fascist, nor was his video propaganda, and you should know that."

"comments seem relatively active so ill give this a punt.   first: the principle of the 'trap' may not exist in the essence of the subjects identity, but of the perceiver. As such, it is legitimate for a given person to ask the question 'are traps gay?' because in his own mind he perceived a female, thus creating a trap for himself."
"second: this is only half the conversation. the term 'trap' is also used with reference to crossdressers, or anything perceived as feminine. i have seen bodies completely devoid of any and all decoration being referred to as 'traps'. should crossdressers not also then have a say on this matter?   third: as usual aristotle holds the answers. was the intent gay? did you look at that sock poster and think 'thats a fucking hot guy', or did you think 'shes cute'? therein lies the answers to your sexual identity woes."
"Right after my brother found out he was going to be a father, we went camping together. Stayed up very late next to the campfire conversing quietly about our family having a new generation ('cause fuck knows I'm never having children), names, how life will change, etc. It was a good time until the dude camping next to us mistook our intimacy as homosexual and started shouting and shining a flashlight at us any time we moved. We assumed he was picking a fight and mostly ignored him. Found out the next morning that he had tried to get us kicked out of the campground.  Mostly I wanted to tell him off for being a shitbag (he hid from us the rest of our time there), but a small part of me felt sad for what it all implied about his life. Like, has he never spent time alone with someone who wasn't a sexual partner before? Has he never had any close men in his life? No siblings he has maintained relationships with into adulthood? That sounds so lonely.  Also, my brother and I are two stereotypical-looking white Midwestern men  and the whole thing kind of ruined that part of the trip. We wound up leaving two days before we had planned to. I can't imagine having to put up with shit like that on a regular basis."

I feel like the 4 channers who actually play around with the 'are traps gay' meme would agree with 90% of what you said here. Like everything there, the question is valued in part for its offensiveness, and layered in so much irony that it's a mistake to approach it head on, and you've nailed that. I'm all for criticizing the deliberate offensiveness, so long as you recognize (and you certainly do) that you're shouting into the void.  But I think you conflate two groups of people. The way they discuss 'the gay,' it's seems like most of the hardcore memers are mocking the ridiculousness of the social stigma, not actual homosexuality. Undoubtedly, there are some actual homophobes who join in the 'heterosexuality is gay' jokefest, but those people are the unwitting butt of the jokes -- bad, hurtful jokes that they are."

"Hey, this video is fantastic. I agree with the vast majority of what you say and I love the presentation. I also really appreciate the in-depth point of view that you provide. I want to know your opinion on a few other things as well. I would never want to call someone something that hurts them and I also never use terminology that refers to fictional characters to refer to real people because that seems a little dehumanizing regardless of whether it's about personality or sexuality or whatever. On that note, as an anime nerd I completely understand that a trans person would be offended at being called trap in the same way that I would understand someone getting offended at being called a 'tsundere' because it's a very one-dimentional description of a personality archetype that reduceses a person's entire personality to an over used trope for fictional characters, i.e. dehumanizing. My question is, in the same way that I would refer to a fictional character as tsundere is it ok to refer to an equally fictional character as a trap? after all you can't dehumanize a drawing, it's not human to begin with. As an extension, if the character refers to itself as a trap, is it ok for me to follow suit? And as a further extension if I meet a real person who specifically wants to be called a trap can I go along with that or do I tell them that their preferred terminology is offensive?"

"This is a great video!  One question: what about those who use the term to describe themselves? I've seen both trans women and cis male crossdressers call themselves traps, and they often get a lot of backlash for doing so, but I don't understand why.  The way I see it, if a crossdresser calls himself a trap, he clearly doesn't see the term as having to do with trans people, so I don't see how it's transphobic. Meanwhile, if a trans woman calls herself a trap, she either doesn't think of it as a slur, or is trying to reclaim it, which is a trans-positive thing to do.  So where's the problem?"

"I think you're misrepresenting 'TERF's views on vaginas by saying that they view vaginas as sacred passages. From my experience, they are more likely to argue that the vagina is a functional sexual organ that surgery can only approximate at the moment. What trans women receive with surgery is not a literal vagina but it is certainly okay for them to call it that in other non-technical contexts"
"love you contra!! ‚úå"
"I know I'm late to the party, but I hope that at least someone finds this comment so that I don't write all of these words for nothing (yes writing is that much of a chore).  I like your video as a whole but I have one objection to the first part of the video where you talk about men beating trans women for having a penis. I think that you have to at least consider the possibility of this scenario taking place (I will be using 4chan notation here because its appropriate): >a trans woman with a penis and a straight man walk into a bar >the man starts flirting with the trans woman thinking that she is an attractive 'normal' woman with a vagina because she appears to him as a 'normal' woman >of course, something might seem a bit manly about the trans woman but the man shruggs it off because the characteristics that appear attractive to him overpower all of her other characteristics >the man doesn't want to mention the said characteristics because it might seem rude >the trans woman doesn't want to mention that she has a penis because she might ruin the flirting >the flirting continues for about an hour and they both decide they want to have sex (I know, straight to the point, but some people are like that) >they get in a quiet room and they start undressing >the man sees that the trans woman has a penis and suddenly realises that she is not a 'normal' woman because if he knew this beforehand he would have stopped flirting with her then and there >the man gets angry at this because he is disgusted at the thought of having sex with a person with a penis and feels as if he has been lied to all along >the man starts beating the trans woman because of his anger >the rest doesn't matter  I am perfectly aware that the man is at fault here for beating the woman. The point I am trying to make here is that the trans woman should have taken into consideration that the man didn't know that she had a penis and that he might feel repulsed by that, because if the man feels repulsed by her penis there is no point in continuing the flirting. Consider this analogy: if I saw only profile photos of a woman with one breast, I would be attracted to her, but as soon as she turned around I would become repulsed because the lack of one of her breasts overpoweres her other attractive characteristics.  My message, therefore, to all trans women would be as follows: as soon as you enter, or realise that you have entered a flirting conversation with a man that might be straight, tell them that you have a penis because they might feel repulsed of the thought of having sex with a person with a penis. If your feelings matter, then the feelings of straight men matter.  As a sidenote, if anyone finds it necessary that I write this, I am a bisexual male that is curious about trans people. I do not feel sorry for anyone here and I'm not trying to be an advocate for straight men (even though I am technically), but I just wanted to point out that we should all take eachothers feelings into consideration. Please be nice and honest to eachother and have a nice day :)."
"This was fucking great, I am excited for whatever the next video will be Natalie"
"I have a bit of an issue with that last generalization. Just because you want to prove that you aren't gay does not make you homophobic. Personally, as a straight male, I defend my sexual status as to not take away my opportunity to gain a romantic relationship. A woman who finds out that a dude they like is gay is going to think, 'well, he isn't into girls, so I'll stop trying.' I think that would be a safe assumption. This works both ways, obviously. Now, I don't go skipping around, screaming at the top of my lungs, 'I'M NOT GAY, I'M NOT GAY!' I just correct people if they make a false assumption. Just like if someone were to say you have red hair, when instead you have black hair. You'll correct them. Make sense?"
"Your make-up is on point Nat"
"ah come on count dankulas grand kid"
"I really loved how you presented the topic. I was all the video waiting for the 'being gay is actually good' argument, and when it came, i could just say, yeah, she covered everything i could think of and more. Also, good description of the mouthfeel, as bisexual man i¬¥ve always wondered about that."
"I loved your video it was excellent. And I think men are just stupid and dont realize the amazingness of just acepting what you like and not making fun of others for it is amazing. I also hate all the diffrent labels as well. Like what does it matter if the person is a guy or a girl or has a dick or not. Just like who you like and dont care what others think. If it makes you happy it shouldnt matter."
"your work is again and again so impressive! one of your strongest vids."
"So I prefer brunettes to blondes and short girls to tall girls. Am I allowed to prefer she not have a cock or is that transphobic?"
"I'm bisexual (the every gender kind, the transphobia idea isn't actually what bisexual means) and to be honest I don't think any genitals are attractive. They're neutral at best, it's the person attached to them that make the junk sexy. Are those guys attracted to women or exclusively the frankly weird, wet, occasionally bloody caverns us cis women call vaginas?"
"Although you can call me shallow. I love a good vagina. Penis doesnt interest me because I see mine everyday. Vaginas make me excited.  A woman with a penis is fun until you find a penis :(. I don't know if a fake vagina is passable.  I also want my own child. Contra is a powerful seductress though."
"I've never seen one of your videos before, but I couldn't even make it all the way through this one before I was overwhelmed by the need to reach out and tell you how much I value you. I'm grateful you exist."

"Did... did Ben Shapiro really say that biology is the nature of pronouns, or I misheard? 'Cause if he really said that, as a linguistics nerd, I'm like : Hahaha no it's not, you silly man"
"this is an awesome vid and i really like how after you explained precisely how 'trap' is directly connected to murder and is as such a slur, you gave evidence for why you needed to keep going to actually explain whether 'traps' are gay... right then i looked at the timeline of the video and realized there was more than half the video left lol!!! btw, when you mentioned the 3 types of men that trans women can date and said type 3 are chasers and how they shouldn't date them, i have a question: can trans women be chasers of trans women in the same way, for the same reason? are they bad for trans women to date too? uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh no reason lol oh look at the time i gotta go look at some more egg_irl memes!"

"Okay so i just clicked on the video, wtf am i watching"
"So I have this theory that sex is so hard to discuss in part because we speak a language that has evolved in a hetero normative christian-based culture where sex is something to be ashamed of. I think that this is how you get terms like straight, gay and lesbian whose definitions are such crude oversimplifications of human sexuality that we have to trip over ourselves debating the semantics of those antiquated and inefficient words instead of actually discussing sexuality. I personally very much dislike 'heterosexual' and 'homosexual' because in order to use them to describe your sexual orientation, you have to first establish your gender and this is a) horribly inefficient communication and b)tying together two concepts that have by now been proven to be pretty independent. Furthermore, I think language shapes how we think, and having to use these expressions might lead us to believe that gender in a way dictates sexual orientation, which is incredibly limiting to how we view both our own sexuality as well as other people's.  Personally,  I would rather have us use terms like 'gynophillic' and 'androphyllic' when it comes to labeling sexual orientation. These are words that get straight to the point and don't require context to have a clear meaning.  I would also be very curious to see what effect a language without gendered pronouns would have on the gender relations of the culture that speaks it. If anyone knows of studies on the subject, please send them my way."
"People are reading The Culture of Critique"
"Although I do agree with most of your points after thinking through it, I gotta say things aren't as simple as trying to seek validity from other people. In fact, more times than not, the guys that I have met (me as well to some extent) that have this issue of trying to enforce their image, rarely care what others think of them and will basically tell those who try to change them 'that's just who I am, accept it or gtfo'.   No, the people that do tend to validate their own image, does it out of some form of personal reconfirmation. They have already decided who they are as a person, and enforces it by making some solid foundations in the guise of quirks and actions that they can use as a reference to identify themselves. To have them accept things that goes against their character, is basically an attack to their identity as a person, and that's what tends to awaken this aggressive defensiveness.  Not saying that it's fine for men to hurt or mistreat trans women, but I do want to state that this unacceptance or phobia to trans people isn't a simple matter that can just be dismissed as a case of weak personality. Cause well, a weak personality would be a insecure one, one that is open for changes, but a straight cis man whom has a white and black understanding of hetero- and homosexuality isn't someone who is flimsy with their personality, but rather very pronounced and persistent about it, even embracing the faults if it means to preserve and announce their identity as clear as possible.   For as damaging as transphobia can be, it wont change the fact that some people have had it engraved as a part of their identity. So to have them let go of the phobia, would be to have them act for other people, to have them change who they are for the sake of other people's validations. Not the other way around.  And well, seeing how it can be considered to be quite unethical to forcefully change someone's identity in favor of someone else, I gotta say that I can only agree to the point of respecting transsexuals as people, but to go the extra mile of having them 'see' the trans as if they were actually the gender they transitioned to, is a no go. It may be more courteous to refer someone by the sex they identify themselves as, but it wouldn't be quite moral to force someone to think of the trans as if they were cis, when they cannot bring themselves to think that way.  I believe we should just respect each other's opinions and let them think whatever they want. So long as no abuse is done, like openly slandering or beat downs, people should be able to have their faults and phobias without being treated as less for it."

"Why did this show up in my recommended videos?"
"Full disclosure - I'm a cis-gendered hetero male.  I found this fascinating though and it threw up some interesting points.  I agree intellectually that gender is not the same as sex but I have to admit that, thanks to my upbringing, even if I find a trans woman attractive, I have an instinctive distaste to the thought of sleeping with one.  I accept that the fault is in me here though.  On the other hand, I saw a fascinating show 'Drag King Richard III' a few years ago (highly recommended), which involved a women transitioning to a man.  Meanwhile, her->his lover was highly conflicted as, having felt she was a lesbian or many years, she now wondered if she was, in fact, straight. It seems to me that this issue cuts both ways, even if (sadly for the group I identify with) voilence is more likely from the 'macho' men."

"This is still baloney semantics.  Just like you, Contra, I also have a degree in philosophy.  You know as well as I that definitions are the corner stone of debate - either gametes determine sex or they do not.  In science, gametes DO define sex.  You are trying to redefine roles of reproduction into performing contemporary gender roles, which kills the word because humans are only ONE of trillions of species.  We need a word that defines the the bearers of that gametes that are fertilized, we have that word, its FEMALE, you aren't one, you will NEVER be one, and to even throw out that word that is NECESSARY to science, to appeal to your feelings, is complete bullshit - you know it, so do i."
"natalie, i loved this video!!!! its always a treat when you upload, you bring up such thoughtful points and your delivery is flawless. also i have a suggestion for a topic- are asexuals/aromantics LGBTQIA+?"
"I think the issue arises when people aren't upfront about being trans. Most heterosexual men don't want to have sex with someone who has a penis and it's important for them to know beforehand. Don't just assume he knows, tell him right off that whether there is a penis or a vagina below the belt. This is no justification for violence or murder though, if someone unexpectedly has a penis like 'The Crying Game' they should just walk out, no need to get so upset over it.  I would argue that straight men who like shemale porn are not entirely heterosexual. It's a spectrum, you might like men to some degree if you like a woman with a penis...there's nothing wrong with that. Why be ashamed? Just admit that you're at least a little bit bisexual..."
"I‚Äôve been binging your videos and so I‚Äôve had the thought of Ben Shapiro lurking in the depths of my mind. Because of it, I dreamt that he was my brother and awoke in a cold sweat. Thank you."

"I think it's unfair to label Count Dankula as a 'hate crime convict', he was fined for making an edgy joke about his pug doing a Nazi salute and responding to the phrase 'gas the jews' to annoy his girlfriend, that's hardly a hate crime, there were no victims except maybe a few hurt feelings."
"Look, if men didn't freak out about gay things. Then this wouldn't be an issue. It's different from being sexually interested in a girl, only to learn that they have a penis or used to be a male. It's your choice who you are romantically interested in. It's another story legit getting upset over it and for the people who do should be spayed or neutered because what ever gen is making you that stupid shouldn't be in the general population. I know it sounds harsh and is but I'm talking about the people willing to hurt someone just because of the state if they have a penis or not.  Which is still letting them live their life as they want which is better then what their victims have"
"Cool episode, but maybe you should have also asked are female traps straight? I mean I small breasted women, but I don't like dick, what does that mean?"
"Natalie your videos are such a treat. Being in the far left zone which REFUSES to engage in any difficult or leading questions in the slightest is something which ideologically tears me apart, so your uploads are a huge breath of fresh air. Also, can I apologize on behalf of all cis lesbians and say that TERFs are absolutely nuts and do not represent the majority of us. You're super attractive, intelligent, hilarious, and really put yourself out there more than most of anyone would be willing to do."
"She called Count Dancula a hate criminal...? Today most youtubers are basically shouting, 'Wth? He's in PRISON? IT WAS A JOKE! Everyone makes nazi jokes!' And here this person is, calling him a hate criminal... Meaning she thinks he SHOULD be in prison and she agrees with it... I can't watch this... 7 minutes in, and I'm done. I'm too disgusted to watch this. And the hypocricy... Contra claiming that she's a poo poo poster and a memer and edgy comedian herself... No... You're not... You're an SJW, PC comedian... 'Only safe humor' buzz off... Agreeing that this poor man should be in prison over a joke... Family Guy makes Nazi jokes. Comedians make Nazi jokes. Heck I've made nazi jokes. Same with a lot of other youtubers. So I guess we should all be in prison huh? Disgusting..."

"That is a very well thought out, and well articulated argument. Mine is much shorter. In about 10 years we will reach 8 billion people worldwide. Overpopulation is beginning to become a very big, very real problem. The reason that number is so big, and will only continue to get bigger, is because humankind's favorite activity is sex aka the kid-making-act. There is a small percentage of the population that does not wish to engage in the Kid-making-act but, rather, engage in a simulation of the kid-making-act with their own sex; we call that subsection of our species 'gay'. The fact that one has altered their physical circumstances in order to visually manipulate those around them for the purpose of engaging in a non-kid-making activity, under the guise of potential kid-making, would indeed make it a trap of sorts. A trap that does indeed appear to be of the gay variety. Thus, under these circumstances, traps would in fact be gay. In conclusion, traps are gay."
"Something that I was also thinking about presentation. In particular about presentation for women. To be a woman do you need to present in a certain way to be considered a woman? Like there are women who are cis women who are described as 'hard' looking (not soft feminine) and heterosexual. Does this mean that they are not women? Does being a woman mean that you have to present in a certain way? Just wondering?"

"who do you want to explain it to them? preferably someone who actually understands the question. And it's not about trans people, it has nothing to do with sexuality -- it's a question about authorial intent. Is a female character male by fiat, or must they have male qualities? To what extent is the author obligated to display what they indicate as true? You don't even talk about the core issue."
"Calling Count Dankula a hate crime convict when the entire world uses his case as an example of how social justice is going too far. That's... okay? Self-sabotaging your point in the first five minutes of the video?  I like some of your videos because they seem to be an attempt to reach out to people who think differently from you to explain your position, but a lot of the recent ones just seem like you pandering to your own audience."
"Why bring up white masculinity while addressing minority trans women being murdered? Pretty sure its not white dudes.  Not bashing your video , just trying to get my head around things. On unrelated topic how fucked up is it for transwomen who don't have a chance in hell of passing. I've seen transwomen that everyone knew were trans treated like any other pretty girl but trans women who didn't have feminine features/figure treated like fucking monsters."

"Isn't there another point to this, that traps don't need to be trans women? It's like some sort of roleplay that let's people play an effeminate character and veil their sex in the process. The term trap isn't invariably linked to transgender people, is what i'm trying to say, i guess."
"Absolutely wonderful. I would say this is the most detailed and well informed video on the subject. And I hope, as mentioned at the start, this can be the first serious exposure to the 'dilema' less informed people will have. Though I'm still left with a genuine question and I hope someone can help me understand it...  What happens if another trans person uses the term to refer to themselves or other trans people they know and are friends with, in a way of 'owning' the term for themselves? I've spoken with people who have a grudge against the term 'queer' because it has been used in the past to refer despicably to LGBT people. And as a bi person I feel kind of uncomfortable being called like that, even by others like me or allies, because I know the negative connotation of it. Yet a lot seem fine owning that term for ourselves. Could 'trap', around specific circles of transpeople be used without being considered a slur? Again, this question is born out of genuine curiosity and ignorance on the whole picture and I hope someone can help me understand it even more."

"Anime was a mistake"
"As an edgy meme lord, hear me out. When the joke started, the response was that 'traps are gay' and that was where it stayed for a long time. It's a lot different now (even tho the memes been dead for years js). As much as the joke is clearly still offensive. The conversation around the joke has opened up into a primitive but legitimate back and forth about gender, sexuality and the differences around gender and biology etc. Education has always peeked its way into edgy humour, just... slowly."

"So a penis is feminine if its on a feminine form? What about if its on a hyper masculine muscle form IE ancient Greece where small dicks were hyper masculine? Sure that may not be the view now but they view on wheather a penis is fem or not is just an opinion broadened to a social norm. What happens tommorow if small dicks become masculine again this concept goes out the window (hypothetical)  So the act of tucking your penis also makes it feminine? What happens if a tgirl with a small penis does not tuck it? Is it not feminine anymore? What happens with a tgirl with a big ole 8 inch cock tucks it? This point is around context but how can definition of it change so easily? Its tucked now its fem and when its not is masculine?  Also by attributing softeness and roughness as masculine and fem things dsnt this only prove they are absolute. If a penis can be fem by being soft dsnt that mean that sterotypical female 'softness' lies in something other than a social view. Same goes for a super rough clit. T qualify as masculine and fem they need to be soft and rough.  What happens in a situation if buck angel had an extremely small and soft clitoris and vagina?"
"you seem to categorize all straight males as insensitive or not caring about others point of veiw particularly about listening  my only problem is you categorizing a group of people  in all honesty that means you are no better than us just because there are less of you also you mention the term trap but kinda lead nowhere with that basically you say it offends many trans woman but forget context in that you forget the reason they were called traps is that they can very well be a mental trap especially if the person with you is 1 mentally unstable 2 emotionally unstable or 3 was part of a cult that particularly is against trans woman and men  if you still don't understand imagine that you are a trans woman and came across a well trans man wouldn't you feel a bit hurt  in fact it can feel worse if you were already good friends because they might believe you were only friends because one day you hoped to be together which can also feel bad for both of you since you might feel the pain of failure as well  another thing there are some health risks associated with being transgender due to excessive makeup and unusual hormone fluctuations most of which are cancer heart disease and occasionally dementia which is probably one reason there are not too many ((transgender humans idk what to call you without being offensive)) in the average population sorry but I wanted you to see not all straight men are careless purposely rude or lacking any intellect tell me if there is any way to fix this comment say... grammar and feel free to offer constructive criticism sorry if this still offended lot's of people because I wanted this to be rational and as you know if someone is offended it will prevent them from feeling great on occasions or getting the most out of this this took alot of time since I am a slow typer so as I said please offer constructive criticizm so I will be better in the future so  bye  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974289 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1253722/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16045991 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018511/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758950/ I am not 100% sure but it is likley ftm transgender males or females idk what to call them nicley are at a higher risk of cancer on the ovaries and female prostate due to unusual hormone balance foe their birth sex    before you say the articles were inconclusive keep in mind there are not enough transgender people of the same ethnicity to report on because they are both a minority and some seem to shy to participate even when the studies are ananomus and no im not racist but to eliminate variables the subgects have to be the same ethnicity/race since some have a higher risk of cancer than others  they due tend to have lower employment rate and higher suicide risk which is no good  also if you believe in any anti-medical/government conspiracy/s think whats their motive and are they doing more harm than good to themselves"

"I always thought that 'trap' referred to men in drag (usually with the intention of being deceptive), quite simply because I've never heard anybody use it outside   Also, the word 'trap' in and of itself is harmless, it's the context in which it is used that makes it good or bad. If it really is being used as a slur against MtF trans people, of course it is bad, nobody except transphobic assholes is defending it as a slur. However, if it is being used in the context of a man who identifies as a man who makes themselves appear feminine, I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  And just to disclose any identity biases or whatever, I'm a bisexual male who describes myself as a trap as I frequently crossdress."

"As a cis straight female, it saddens me to hear the hardships of people, whether they be trans or what have you. Or if they're of a different race of myself.  I still don't quite fully understand it, but from what you've described, it sounds like the trap meme had been used to mock trans people as well as been used by anti-trans folk, linking to some very terrible times in the trans world. That makes me mad.  Most people would view this as a stomp down on their precious memes, but what we have to understand is that humor is SUBJECTIVE and that we can't tell one joke to another without giving proper context.   Whoops, sorry for the long ass text, sincerely,    -A New Subcriber"

He has no track record of saying/doing hateful, bigoted things whatsoever that I know of.  And calling what he did a 'hate crime' was fucking ridiculous, and we all know it, which it was why it was a high profile case.  From what I can tell he does not seem to be that type of person at all, simply guilty of making an edgy joke that got taken seriously.  He even says IN that video, the whole reason he chose Nazis to joke about with the puppy is because Nazis are the LEAST cute and innocent thing there is, unlike a puppy.  I'm sorry but that really bugged me; it's the principle."

I've actually seen peoples perspectives shift when I've told them about my experience with a trans woman.  Though I generally present it in a comedic context, even using the slur 'tranny,'  I think the ends justify the means in that I move them from a initially very conservative position.  Keep up the good work Contra!"
"Really interesting video.  It's not the same thing, but I actually had a crush - and kinda still have a bit - on a tomboyish biological girl (we shared a hobby) that has just started the journey to become a trans man, and that sparked the want to understand more about these topics. I've been practicing to treat and think him as *him* and that's still surprisingly difficult. (For example, our circle of friends was having a bar night when some older lady told him he was a 'handsome young man' and somehow that made *me* confused as I was so accustomed to his old gender.)

"Just finished the video. I'm gonna be real with you for a moment. Liking traps makes you BISEXUAL. The whole question of 'are traps gay' is about dudes who specifically lust after girl dick. If a guy likes dick, they are NOT STRAIGHT! But it's on a girl, so that makes them half straight and therefore bisexual. It turns out that the simplest explanation is the best: Yes, traps are gay, but the dick makes it better. Hate to say it, but guys who date transgender women are almost always 'chasers.' I mean otherwise, they're gonna tap out and find a cis woman. Transgender peeps, crossdressers, transvestites, basically anybody ever called 'trap' (the term functions like LGBT in a way) is in the gender twilight zone. I know it's not PC to say it, but gender identity is not the end-all be-all for sexual attraction. It's called SEXual attraction for a reason... I can't put my dick in your gender identity. The whole appeal for guys is that traps are the best of both worlds, which is very bisexual no matter how you put it. Now again I'm gonna be un-PC... so content warning. No dude wants to fuck a fake vagina. Half the people in the world have a 'real' one so why settle for the made-in-Thailand knockoff? I'm sorry, but nobody can choose to change their own sexuality, no matter how 'problematic' it is in 2019.  That aside, I like the video and the way you handle the Trap Question. Great video as usual, ConTRAPoints."
"Wha about the Japanese term otonoko? Would that be considered offensive? Also what do you think about the fact that there are otonoko or as westerners mistakenly call it 'traps' in anime? Some of them are boys who are forced to crossdress. Others are biologically male who identify as female, others are biologically female who identify as male, and others are nonbinary of either gender. How do you think they are reptesented, has it become more positive as of late or more negative."
"Listen...if a biological *man* wants to ALTER himself physically to get as close to a biological woman as possible so as to *identify* as a woman that is totally fine.   But just like the earth is *NOT* flat so too is a transgender woman *NOT* a biological woman. Just because you want to believe you are a thing and change yourself to become close to the *likeness* of that thing doesn‚Äôt mean you *ARE* the thing in the purest sense of the embodiment of the thing you wish to be.   At the end of the day unless you have a WOMB (regardless of whether or not you use it or it works for its purpose) you are not a woman/female in the purest and simplest sense of the term.   There is literally no debating this basic point. Either you have it or you don‚Äôt. Either you were born with XY or XX it‚Äôs not that hard. This is the HIGH LAW of the universe and it will not bend simply because humans don‚Äôt like it.   There must be an EQUAL & OPPOSITE for everything in creation this is simply how the universe works and it is well beyond the confines of man and our simple minds on how all this shit works together in tandem with space and time and the billions of years of existence of this planet.  Now, if you‚Äôve changed your original body to be in the likeness of the opposite sex you should disclose that to partners you may have out of sheer courtesy and not anything else.   It‚Äôs the same as a person with HIV having sex and not disclosing KEY information that may change the mind of the potential partner‚Äôs choice.   You‚Äôve CHOSEN to change your body to fit how you see yourself and that‚Äôs fair and fine...but to take that same CHOICE away from someone else by not disclosing certain things is just as BAD as those you rail against for not accepting who you have CHOSEN to become.   I do think men and women alike KNOW who they are sleeping with but at the same time some trans women are really good at looking like a biological woman on the surface and it isn‚Äôt until clothes come off that the truth is revealed and then men ‚Äòfeel‚Äô tricked and commit these violent and deadly acts.   By no means am I excusing it but that is what happens and they use it to their defense to justify their own messed up issues with their sexuality and innocent people die. If you happen to be trans then be open about it the way you want society to be open to YOU and if you get the person you want great and if they pass because it‚Äôs not their thing that‚Äôs okay too."
"I disagree with whatever point you have. The answer is no, because of the feminine penis.  But trap is an anime term, and being attracted to anime cartoons is practically interspecies already. Plus they mean traps as a whole, and may be including twinky characters dressed as boys. Maybe they like women, but think vaginas are weird, or just like penises."

"I just have to vent for a bit. I don't really associate traps with trans women but with anime boys that look like women and still have a dick. that said, I never got the logical leap people say to make it gay. Like, IF you thought she was a woman, and you found it attractive.. then that straight attraction.  Yet people call me insane and gay for that thought , even though I don't really care if it's gay or not. If astolfo is a man, than astolfo is the cutest man I've seen so far and people can fuck off.   The only way I could ever see it be gay is if the trans woman looks and acts completely like a man, in which case you'd never be 'trapped' ,to begin with, OR if you're specifically attracted to the dick of one that still has a dick. But how many people are specifically attracted to only genitals?  People always go 'tits or ass' not.. 'Oh man she has a beautiful vagina'. Either way I can only argue it's a gay act asin biologically, but it's straight attraction and that's all that's relevant as our bodies don't give a shit. If only straight men and gay women are into this person.. how can it be gay?   Are people gonna argue being into a body builder manly man that acts manly with a vagina as a Man is straight?"

"'...Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula'  Thank you for showing your ignorance right off the bat. While it is technically true, the terminology 'hate crime convict' is clearly used in a derogatory way. This is cruel and unjust, especially because Count Dankula is rarely 'hateful.' The reason he was fined 800 dollars for a 'hate crime' was because he taught his girlfriend's dog to heil. Upon posting this on Twitter, he explained it by saying, 'My girlfriend is always going on about how cute her wee dog is, so I thought I'd turn it into the least cute thing I can think of... a Nazi.' Clearly, this is not a man who actively promotes Nazi ideologies."
"Trap can sometimes mean transsexual, but it usually doesn't. Like, the vast, vast majority of the time. It just refers to a male character, who may or may not dress in a feminine manner, who looks particularly feminine. Maybe 5% of the time is it referring to a person/character who actually identifies as female, but that's really the exception rather than the rule. So this entire video focusing on the word in that particular, rare context is a bit odd."
"On a somewhat related note, I don't think it's fair to say that using the word trap means you think of transwomen as 'traps', in the literal sense of the word trap. That may have been the origin and original meaning of the word, and it may seem like an obvious association to you, but like most other words that have grown to have multiple meanings the association between different meanings is usually not really thought of by the average person, except perhaps in a humorous sense. To say that 'this is what you're saying when you use that word' is just outright misrepresentation.   It's completely understandable that you might draw that association, or that be uncomfortable with the word for some other reason, there's nothing wrong with that. Asking someone not to use the word because it makes you uncomfortable is also totally understandable. But making the leap from there all the way to accusing them of saying something that really isn't what they're trying to communicate at all is kinda unchill- and very unproductive for the purpose of making them stop using the word, too. As you mention, persuading someone to change their ways requires meeting them partway. Suddenly calling someone a bigot for saying something that wasn't even really what they intended to say is nowhere near meeting them partway."

"Yeah, that definitely wasn't aimed directly at me. I hope I don't bother the hell out of you on the slimmest chance you read my three comments.  Fantastic video, and I already agreed with much of what you said (mainly about sexuality, which I feel I'm pretty comfortable with because meeehhh who cares, my fellow down there likes what he likes and doesn't like what he doesn't). I'm sad to say I don't have an open mind about trans folk though. Blame anything you want, but I don't have gender dysphoria, I don't understand it, can't after looking into it a fair amount, and have like fundamental issues with the idea of altering one's body. I've heard that hormone therapy/surgery is the 'treatment' for gender dysphoria, but I'm a simpleton. I just am like, accept your body. If you CAN'T... it bothers me. 'Cause I can't get it! The facts find my skull impenetrable. I want to say 'if you really can't help it, do what you must' but I don't really believe that. I believe that anyone born should accept what they were born with, warts and all unless it's something deadly or mentally dangerous. I'm ignorrant, and education on the subject has proven fruitless. I really don't know if I can ever change my opinion on that. I wouldn't call this 'phobia' or 'hate', I just don't agree with it or get it. Live, and hopefully live happily. You seem like a great on-script personality at least, and you're hilarious. More power to you. I hope that society eventually makes what the core '''problem''' of gender dysphoria is clear enough that it doesn't produce types like me who feel they will never understand it, and so are fundamentally uncomfortable with the idea.  Whatever this 'trap' issue is, sorry it got out of hand but like every good 4chan thing, the rest of the Internet eventually finds and ruins it. Well, you might say it was never good, especially with what you've said about the context of sexuality. Well really, I think at least on the chans, at least where crossdressing cartoon girlish boys are discussed, the real turn on there is something a little gay, and 4chan despite its reputation is STUPIDLY sexually liberated. I mean it's just a storm of kinks, attractions, and sexuality. It's the masked place people can say whatever they want on, and they do.  But when they do (when I do, on certain boards,) it's about fiction. These aren't opinions on real people or trans people, and while Anonymous can be definitely fucking deliberately offensive (to ANYONE), not really with this because it's all just fake stuff, and the deal is known.  Hope you read this for my perspective/my casual... sexism, maybe. Some ism"

"Generally speaking, in the 'are traps gay?' jokes and debates. it is assumed that the 'trap' isn't actually trans but a straight dude in drag. either because they just dress that way or are purposefully trying the mess with people. Granted, this is just based on me and my experiences with the dudes I hang out with.   P.S. And I know this has very little to do with the topic of the video, but it did happen a couple times, so on my soapbox I shall stand. I hate the idea of other peoples understanding of language and interpretations having more authority on what was meant than the interpretation of the person that said it. All language is and abstraction of thought and English, specifically, is a descriptive language; so meaning is determined by the way the word is used. I guess what i'm trying to say is: 'please don't assume you know what someone meant. because words are easily misunderstood and misconstrued.'"

Oddly enough, it was Colin Moriarty that brought me here (through a mention in a podcast).  He spoke well of your channel as a great example of well reasoned leftist ideals, which is something I seem to struggle to find.  Naturally, this title grabbed my attention lmao.  Given the current comment count, you'll probably never see this, but I just wanted to let you know that something resembling your target demographic (cis hetero male, not progressive in the 'far left of twitter' sense) found the video, listened, and learned."

"As a dude who is, by all accounts, straight, I think this video is awesome. I love the insight into the minds of the trans woman and I really understand that there are a huge amount of problems that trans people face.  Also, this video helped me feel okay with me totally wanting to bang the shit outta you, which I think is awesome."
"I liked the video but I don't think most guys using the word trap unironically are using it to reffer to 'dick girls', it's mostly use for gay men who look girly and could pass as a woman if dressed like one but still identify as men. Since it's a term with 'weeb' origins i'll give an example; 'draw a girl, call it a boy' that pretty much sums up the idea behind the 'are traps gay?' Meme where will knowingly feel attraction towards a pretty and femenine male character"
"7:15 You are wrong that 29 murders of trans people is disproportianately high. If trans people represent 0.6% according to the Williams institute in 2016, and there were 17250 murders in 2016, according to the FBI. If trans people were proportionately represented in murder stats there would be 0.006*17250 = 103.5 murders per year.  Meaning trans people are underrepresented in murder stats."
"I call myself a trap as self-defense (mostly so that if somebody else calls me one I can laugh it off with my friends) but after watching this I kinda want to stop using it- i think my cis guy friends think that because I say it about myself they can say it about other people"
"Thankyou for the super informative video, I was wondering what this phrase meant after I saw a few people say it."
"Damn, you explained this so well that I could feel the way I think about these things changing in my head. I look forward to these labels of Gay, Straight, Bi, pan etc just going out the window because they are a cage, you like who you like and any preconceived notions on how you should act In your chosen sexuality might fuck up any opportunities you may have.  This video is a mind trip."

"Feminine penis? Really? Ok then..."
"Halfway checkin is that this 'trap' term has apparently gone in places completely beyond my scope. In my view, a 'trap' is a crossdresser: and specifically, a boy or a girl or dresses in a way that makes them perceivable as the opposite sex. I just straight up don't use it for trans, I don't think, because when I'm looking for a trap character... yeah, I'm looking for a dude. In FACT, I've COMPLAINED about how some traps (see I keep using that word, though you termed it a slur, ehm... I apologize for this) are not MASCULINE enough so as to be 'CONVINCINGLY A TRAP'. Like wha??? I personally think that's at least a little bit gay, and this opinion of mine is FAR from unique (and to be clear I don't really care, just saying fffaacts? and I don't think of myself as gay; I've seen gay porn of course, it's the internet, I'm not into men-looking-men... if they're REAL manly, apparently). Like there are many threads I've been in where the opening post is 'draw a girl, say it's a boy' (as a complaint about a trap character) and there'll be replies going 'draw a girl, take off their clothes, it's obviously a boy' and people are like yeeaaahh because it's not a woman, because the appeal of a trap... the true appeal, is that it's a guy. Gay? /THE BIG SHRUG  I'm keeping on and hopefully will finish this before commenting again. I just feel like perhaps this video is not actually addressed to me, because clearly this term is not being used outside of my circles of 4chan (4chan is a big place) the way it's used IN my circles. I don't think of trans people as traps. Unless they're crossdressing, I guess? In the case of fiction, the characters tend to be homosexuals, not necessarily identifying as women."

"I was always under the impression that 'Traps' were strictly a manga/anime/hentai thing. A male character that was perceived as female, actively seeking out males that were seeking females, while still being male. Thus a trap. In the context of these stories, being predetermined(because they're already written) meant that these characters knew they were being 'Traps'. But IRL a trans woman isn't coming at prospective relationships/interactions this way. I was naive in thinking that people were smart enough to not bring that into real life."
"Contrapoints gives me the ammunition I need to make all my conservative white friends triggered when they're wrong thank you.   Great insights I love your videos :)"

"I love your style but have to hate on some points.  1st your view on count dankula is shit.  2nd everybody has bars they dont go into cuz they are  uncomfortable. Also to cut down on murders of trans legal Prostitution.  3rd fuck your offensive. Everyone is offended now about everything. You want people to stop using the word.... stop giving a shit or do like the queer word. Take it and make it yours.  4th i agree on view and pop. Lol  5th a point also is womens view on trans. The most hate of trans is from women to men.   6th sucking penis is gay but the point should be who cares if it is. The labeling shit is big now when back in the day it was more of  deconstruction of words. Like if your gay who cares.  7th own what you like? Shame on you for not dating trans? What one?  I subbed but got to down vote."

"I think this video just got better and better towards the end. The point that people (especially straight men) should just go ahead and like what they like, worry less and treat other human beings with basic respect (you know, don't murder them), could have summed up the entire video. Good job, nice video.  But I've also thought about this. I'm a bisexual (cis) woman. When I was a teenager, a straight boy asked me: 'Wouldn't a dickchick be like the best of both worlds?'. But in porn and in person, I've never been attracted to feminine persons with dicks. I think I even would prefer a trans guy over a trans woman, but I've never dated either, as far as I know. And I think the assumption that girls with dicks would be 'the best of both worlds' rests heavily on straight guys' fantasies: that tits are hot, but big dicks make everything more erotic somehow. Is the same assumption about dicks being the best thing ever that makes people assume that bi men are actually gay (but scared to come out) and that bi women are actually straight (just looking for attention).   Just some food for thought: why are people (especially straight men) so obsessed by penises? Is is somekind of autoeroticism?"

"So without you actually going there, you left it hanging - black men are far more violent than white men in a scenario where they feel their sexuality has been compromised. Is this what you couldn't say because you're not black?"
"Im into that sort of thing"
"I'm not long into the video, like the little big man brat I am (just around your 'I could end it here') point. I'm being very tip-toey about this video, since my core is that 'if it isn't meant to be offensive, offense taken shouldn't make the 'offender' guilty' and I'd say that holding up my delightful black race card that gives me wiggle room on 'offense' talk. I'm also one of the old hats who 'grew' the term of trap, and it was seemingly born completely outside of the frankly HORRIFYING fact of homicide toward trans women (no joke, those truth bombs nauseated me and really didn't sit well with my justice core--it's unbelievable shit). You acknowledge the term's origins so I imagine that'll be addressed again within the rest of this 30 minutes (I'm just so compelled to comment!) but like for real, the first 'traps' I remember from the land of the east were pretty much universally praised as characters people wanted to fuck or just liked (Bridget, Jun), and over time at least as a part of 4chan, for the most part the term is fetishistic, within or without pornography. It's all about fiction, mostly, and I don't know the first thing about its use OUTSIDE of 4chan so whenever I've heard 'it's offensive' I've been all 'dude, what the fuck, it's just what people jerk off too'. And on 4chan, the argument of 'is it gay'... it's certainly jokey, but 4chan isn't all straight white young twenty-something males I mean, evidence posting here. I feel like that question, and answering it positively or negatively, is just 'how comfortable with your sexuality are you' stuff, since AFAIK not all crossdressers are trans so, y'know, really the matter here is the Johnson. You're attracted to traps as a fetish, but you specifically seek out a cock-carrying 'female-looking' sex object (again this is fiction, I have no sight on the realm of 3D in regards to this and neither do most Anonymous posters on /a/ and such at least) which, I suppose, is 'gay'. And there are arguments about degrees and shit but none of it feels serious, because ultimately. Ultimately it's all talking about fetishes. Like... talking about whether you enjoy... feet or something. It's so unserious and detached from reality. For what it's worth, when I and others talk about fiction that more legitimately discusses trans and crossdressing matters, the term trap doesn't really tend to come up and I've had long discussions about both matters without fetishes coming up, or the term 'trap' coming up. Such as with the series Hourou Musuko which is... a mostly good manga series that completely shits the bed for the second half of it. I digress.  What this too-wordy comment that HA! like hell you're going to read (there are near 12,500 comments right now why would you bother) is trying to say before finishing the video is that I see your issue and due to being so non-invested in issues of reality I can't really connect with it because I know none of us nerds INTEND harm. What the rest of the world is doing with the term, I don't know. I operate in a small circle in the end and I know I won't stop using the term. I don't use it to refer to any real people for what it's worth because... to me it's a word for entirely drawn, not real characters. And a meme of a sort. I don't bring those into the real world, same as a lot of channers.  Back to the video (it's really well done so far, honest)"

I would not prefer to turn docile ones the wrong way, would you?  So...can i call characters that were actually designed to trap viewers by those japanese boiz? Despite not actually being trans? The part why calling someone a trap might be offensive i got, but why would calling something a trap be offensive? Should i respect them and their headcanon as official one too? In the end, we all are just trapped by labels. Straight, gay, trans,  left, bigots, gamer-gaters. Why think about nuanse, when you can just associate worst stereotypes with a label and not dwell on it too much? Honestly the only solution i see to this is just to stop using all of those labels. Then there would be no fucking lefties, no cis males, just people with different tastes that will not want to kill each other cause of bad associations with black pilled incells or Chris-chan. Or we can stop rushing through life ASAP and think a little, but it's actually way harder than taking words out of the language, lol."

This is coming from a trans woman, but do your research before you hit someone with libel (and before you say legally he was convicted that line of thinking implies you see Saudi-Arabian homosexuals as CRIMINALS rather than VICTIMS [CD being a victim of a warped justice system himself] so yes, it is slander, you can be a coward and claim it isn't but by doing so for the sake of logical consistency executing gays is just fine with you)."

If you want to view me as that, then I'm fully OK with it. The reason why I don't do it myself is just because I'm only attracted to female traits. So if I identify someone as female, and attractive, then yeah.   But wait, what about the penis? Well, I guess I just view it as a female penis. Yeah, it sounds really weird, I know. But that's how I feel. Can't really explain it, maybe because I haven't given it much thought."
"Fun fact: Offending you is the entire point. That is exactly why we call you traps. And the more you protest, the more fun it gets. Kinda like when you guys call everyone right of mao 'nazis'. The difference being that the word 'nazi' was used so widely to describe so many things that it doesn't really mean anything anymore, while the word 'trap' means either of 2 things."
"My two cents that people may or may not want as I am not gay or trans and I'm one of those who personally wouldn't date a trans man. If we're are talking cross dressers, in particular, it's not gay if you look at them and find them attractive as the gender you prefer. I mean, they are looking like hot females. It's all about perception like you say. If I sleep with a trans man somehow for example, even if I refuse to date him after because of my views, it wouldn't be gay since I only was attracted to him because he looked like a hot guy. And guys say women over think shit lol. And, lol l love how much you('jokingly') shit on philosophy since you studied it. Btw I wish you would talk about hypermasculinity in the black community in particular though. It's even worse than white men in someways because of hip hop culture unfortunately. Do you remember how everyone shat on Frank Ocean when he let out he was bi(but not Nicki Minaj of course)? It's such bullshit. Black men need to get over this(and to a lesser degree women). Another part of it is because, whether they are consistent or not, a lot of black people claim to be religious in some(often shallow) way so it's a big deal. It's somewhat underatandable since Christianity has been our main strength thoughout the years that they dealt with racism and slavery. It still annoys me that they can't be more lenient though. It's definitely not good for toxic masculinity."

I don't think you're being disingenuous, but this way of thinking seems to be leading to all the wrong, exaggerated conclusions.  As for 'THE' question, to me it has always been a joke. If somebody wants to hurt a trans person by using it as a slur, well, that's just them being an asshole, as it goes with offending people. It's not deeper than that, in my opinion."
"In my disillusionment with the LGBT+ movement (I'm queer, so that was a bit hard on me, and maybe I got bitter towards a lot of people as a result), I've developed some TERF tendencies. Since watching your videos, I've learned that I was going wrong and really misinformed. Thank you for helping me become a better person and be a better friend to my favourite enby person. You are amazing!  One thing I still struggle with, and I hope anyone in the comments might help me put it into context: Biologically, we have male and female reproductive organs, right? Not a rhetorical question. But I wonder, is that just us classifying stuff without taking into account gender? Should we not think of them as male and female reproductive organs? Or can they be male/female reproductive organs, but with feminine/masculine attributes, respectively? I'm not sure if I make sense here. I'm just confused as to what the right way to treat this subject is, and I don't want to retain mindsets that could hurt the trans people I encounter."

What he did was only illegal because he posted it online, where hate crimes require it to already be illegal act but done based on a protected characteristic. Its also pretty messed up you thing him teaching a dog to do a nazi salute means that his logic for traps being gay or not is flawed?"
"Count Dankula taught a dog to do a Nazi salute as a joke. You stated a fact without enough context and it was decieving. Also, trans women aren't women - they're trans women. What you identify as doesn't change reality. At the same time trans women aren't men either, so it isn't gay. There's nothing wrong with being a trans woman or being gay and I pretty much agree with you outside of what I just said."

"The term Trap isn't going anywhere  because it's the most convient term to describe the trope, and any alternative term would be condemned as transphobic as soon one person uses it to describe a trans person. Majority of anime fans who use it use it to describe male/females who dress as the opposite sex but don't identify as the opposite sex. Crossdresser isn't sufficient because many anime Traps like Totsuka from Oregairu aren't cross dressers just have a physique more similar to the opposite sex which causes the audience and other characters to perceive him as the opposite sex."

"As a socially progressive liberal, I'm more likely to lay awake and wonder 'why would someone think traps are gay?' because that question throughout the entirety of the video has been nonsense to me... They are a woman attracted to a man (don't bother debating their womanhood, it will go one ear out the other, thx). Wouldn't it be the guy who's ATTRACTED to them who these people would be calling gay? Or are they just calling all trans women who are attracted to men gay? Because that's most of them. I am so confused honestly  Edit: I got to the part where she says that yeah, they're saying the guys who are attracted to them are gay, but am still just as confused because apparently 'traps' are both the trans women, and the men who are attracted to them?"
"I have to say, I find it funny and sad that you've spent a lot of this video saying white trans women are not the demographic who get killed, after starting this section off by telling the story of a white trans woman who was murdered.

Yes, the probably most famous 'trap' and also the one featured in the video; Astolfo is someone who would basically go to taverns and pick up broads and have one night stands. Why taverns and broads? Google it I guess?  The only trans character that comes to mind that is popular is Luka Urushibara from Steins; Gate and Jun Watarase from Happiness! .  Hasuta from Nyaruko-san is about the only homosexual male as far as I remember that's in the more popular titles."

"I love this video in so many ways, not only for your bulletproof logic/explanation and charismatic/humorous delivery, and not only for all of the stimulating visual/chromatic harmony, but ESPECIALLY for your choice to briefly air my favorite Bach organ piece (the c minor Passacaglia/Fiugue at 43::30).   Not get overly emotional, but I'm quite moved ny your video, so I wanted to briefly say that - as a run-of-the-mill gay guy - I am so, SO grateful for the comradery and support that trans folks have shown me over the years. My closest friend in middle/high school was trans (somewhere in the process of M->F transformation at the time), and without his encouragement and 'leading by example', I never would've worked up the courage to come out to my family in high school, or to even simply accept myself. Life became so much more fun and straightforward after I came out and started being true to myself, and I owe a lot of my happiness to having been inspired by my friend's confidence and unapologetic outspokenness.   Looking back, it's so ironic (and reprehensible) that straight guys in school (and sometimes even now as adults) try to mock my friend as some sort of wimp/weakling/soyboy/whatever. The challenges a trans person has to deal with on any given day by simply just walking out the door would be enough to make an average straight dude crumble like Sunday school wafer into emotional disarray. And gay dudes fall somewhere in the middle in terms of difficulty level, I guess. Srsly tho, it takes balls to walk into a classroom or office of new people of unknown ideological backgrounds, and to still be confident enough to be open/honest about your identity.  The real weaklings are the people punching down, not the ones punching up (or simply not punching at all). Anyhow, srsly <3 your video. Take care! Left is best!"

"So, I love your posts because you don't fully buy the liberal bullshit even though, in theory, you have a stake at what they argue. But... do you really think trans-women are women? Like, can they 'fit' that cathegory at all? I mean... all cathegorization is incomplete: in the past we had hetero, and non-hetero. Then we had hetero and LGBT. Now there's hetero and LGBTQQIAAP+ (oh God!). I follow that theory that says human sexuality exists within a spectrum, and if you dive deep into it, you will find 7 billion cathegories for each of the 7 billion individuals on Earth because we are all different. The only reason cathegorization exists is because of our needs to be heard, respected and treated adequately whenever law and health are concerned. In that sense, I am in favor of keeping things short, and maintaining the hetero and LGBT cathegorization, where trans women fit as a T, and not as a female heterossexual. I think you are right to say that when a hetero sleeps with a trans, and continue to feel attracted by girls, he is definitively hetero. But wouldn't that also be true, if after a drunk night he felt like experimenting with his very masculine roommate, and then this would be their dirty little secret which they would never even mention again? He'd still be hetero! I mean, straight women have lesbian experiences all the time, even encouraged by their boyfriends, and they don't stop being hetero because of that. NOW, if a guy starts dating a (pre-surgery) trans women and they do whatever they feel like in the bedroom, he cannot be called a straight guy, can he? I am not sure if he is gay either, but now we are talking about those billions of nuances that exist within each cathegorization. The bottom line should always be: each individual is unique.... and if you fall in love with a martian, you could be a martian-sexual or it could just be that you fell in love with that specific martian. Who are we to judge?"
"So I guess I'm 'the other side' and I have a couple things:  I really don't care too much about your actual views on it you probably hold them for a reason but when reaching out and addressing 'the other side' I would recommend against hard assertions of political stuff, it is a very quick way to turn away those who might otherwise listen. Namely the Count Dankula thing I don't care or know about any of his other views but I was 90% of the way to just leaving when you referred to him as a 'scottish hate crime convict' when the reason he's in legal shit is due to him making a satirical video that can be boiled down to 'I don't like this dog I meme'd it into a nazi cause Nazis are bad.'   I might be alone on this but I don't think I am, the word trap to me has always referred solely to a crossdresser not trans as a whole so I've always just conclude yes a 'trap' is gay. So I'm not gonna lie the video kinda missed me on that bit cause I'm still going to just assume Trap = Dude crossdressing very well but it turns out I kinda agree on a lot of the other points you raise namely about the attraction to femininity over the attraction to chromosomes.  Lastly I feel sorry for your struggle 'cause I understand (better now) that you're trying to fight for a real issue with real problems but sadly you're trying to fight against fucking memes and 'nothing matters I'm Anon culture' which I don't think is really possible. At least to date I have never seen be successful cause while you're trying to play a sophisticated game of chess the opponents are on the other side of the room covered in butter playing twister and bop-it at the same time."
"Loved the video. Especially everything after 13:25. That section really helped me understand a lot about my sexuality. One thing that I'd like to ask anyone willing to respond (as I'd rather not go to a forum) is about the biology argument. I believe that sex and gender are two different things. Sex is based off the noun of the parts you were born with and gender is the adjective based characteristics of masculinity and femininity. Language most poignantly illustrates this. 'Libro' is male while 'Escuela' is female. Gendered words do not possess sex thus separating them as two different things.  Therefore, without accounting for dysphoria, are transgender people arguing that they be called the gender of their choice because they believe transitioning equates them to being the biological equivalent of a man/woman? Or is that not the argument at all and they simply want to be called the right pronoun and name of choice because they want to be comfortable and respected like any other human?  Moreover, is not the biggest language problem towards talk of transgender individuals is the conflation of homophones with sub categories? I had thought the mere argument by T people is that types of men and types of women exist. If I say 'oh yeah, she's a woman.' you could ask me what kind if you felt so inclined and I would say a trans woman. Much like if I said 'oh yeah, that's a fish.' and then I stated further it was a goldfish as opposed to a salmon. Is this offensive because it attempts to suggest an ugly reality that trans men/women aren't actually men/women because they aren't biologically and thus deserve a separate label? Or is knowing oneself as trans not offensive in and of itself because this label, while present, is insignificant?  Please school me, thanks!"

"Count Dankula is daddy <3. Hate crime convict... like the Dalai Lama is a hate crime convict (in China). Btw 'are traps gay' is a rather outdated controversy, the more pressing question of our time is: 'is lolicon cp?'"

"A vagina that sucks sounds pretty good to me!"
"No. 'Trans women' are NOT women. No amount of chemical/physical castration and cosmetic genital mutilation can change a biological, genetic male into a female (or vice versa). Being a woman is a biological, genetic fact. Womanhood is not a state of mind or an attitude.¬† Womanhood is not a social construct or a role one can pull off the peg. One is not a woman simply because you say so. Women do not have penises. Women are never born with penises. There is no evidence of a male/female brain so the whole 'trans' thing is either¬† psychopathological or cultural.¬† if men actively seek out 'trans' people for sexual activity, they are, in all likelihood, homosexual. Fair play to em and all consenting adults doing their thing.¬† Violence against anybody is wrong. Murder is wrong and rightly criminalised. Do trans persons posing as women entrap men into sexual activity? I don't know. It's never happened to me. That being said, the fact you want us to except that 2+2=5 and the lie that 'trans women are women'¬† tells us that trans culture is predicated on deception.¬† If you believe you are a 'woman' and that helps you function in society, then I applaud you making lemonade out of the lemons life has handed you. However, don't expect everybody else to play along in controvention of factual reality.¬† [cue the weaponisation of intersex whataboutery and the use of genetic oddities/malfunctions to claim that there are more than two functional sexes]."

"1. Transwomen dying because of homophobes: If the man is taking actions, like for example that black guy who was being bullied by his friends for flirting with the wrong girl - this is 100% his fault. For the other cases, now that depends entirely on you - what if a man lies to his teeth about his wealth, about not being married, about not having children, about not committing crimes and everything else because he technically believes, he wasn't wrong, he is poor etc. but knows that it would get a 'No' if he  admitted to it and would get a woman to sleep with him based on those lies. In your mind was he trapping her? If you think he is trapping her and don't want people to use the word 'trap', you are a hypocrite. If not, your argument of not using 'trap' stands, for now."
""
"2. It happens in the black and latino communities - the communities with the smallest amount of the anime fandom. Some highly religious. And as you said yourself, it hadn't caused any physical harm, for now. Even if it did though - coming from the 4chan background, the meme did way more for a positive image than to promote a negative image, you are more likely to not get harmed by someone who knows the meme than someone who doesn't. Because the types who know it tend to not be religious or have male friends who would make fun of them flirting with a transwoman. (if they even would be flirting in the first place, but that's another topic)"
""
"3. Feminine penis: This word also originated from 4chan - it is and always was overwhelmingly used in a positive way there. In fact, mostly it was and is used as argument against 'but it has a penis' just like you did in your video."
""
"4. This maybe difficult to hear and you might not like it, but the meme is overall a mind changer in a positive way."
""
"So before I come to the conclusion, let me weigh in to your argument that I wouldn't listen to you because you are a transwoman. You one of the few people on the other side that I want to hear arguments from. There is no way to form and grow an opinion without an good opposing viewpoint that challenges yourself. I'd dismiss progressive men (or as we like to call them: 'rapist american') way before I'd dismiss one of your talking points. Overall though you didn't convince me, the only argument that made me think is the disproportional amount of black and latina transwomen being killed. I don't think that is a community the 'traps are guy' - memers are part of though. I would really like a more detailed explanation here how banning the word 'trap' would stop a gang member from killing a transwoman because the masculinity in these kind of groups has (and this is the only place where I'll use this word) become toxic. In a group where you have to use violence to be part of it, violence won't be stopped by banning a meme that has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the rest of people."
""
"It is just a power play. A wish to use power to stop people from saying something not because it would help, no the transphobia would just return to the pre 2000 levels. It's because you can and it feels good to force others to act according to your wishes and be praised for your virtue - even though it will become worse for everyone."
"Are traps gay?  Traps have got homosexual inclinations which indicate, that the person is more homosexual than a pure heterosexual. Thus this shows that the question 'are traps gay' is a valid question. The answer? The trap is more gay as the person who is atracted to such is deceived into thinking that the trap is female. Female expression (in this case, a sexual) is a feminine virtue to which men are attracted to. The trap's femininity, to which the men are attracted to, is that which only heterosexuals can be attracted to, as long as the men are convinced by the looks of the trap to be that of a female.  There it is. I saved you from 44 minutes of drivel."

Thank you so much for being you, and putting out this kind of info, I will be referring to this video in the future when I come across other people who need some knowledge dropped on them.  I feel like I need to say this, but I cannot conceptualize being trans.  I've always kind of seen myself as sexually tone def.  I'm cool with it, I like what I like, and I am secure in that.  When I first came across trans people, I honestly could not think about it.  It wasn't gross or anything, I just could not conceptualize what it was all about.  I always just kind of thought of it as being sort of gay, born with the wrong parts, and left it at that.  I have grown over time, and this video just taught me a few details, but thank you for all of the work you put into education."

By the 'woman look' I mean the small body frame and body length, smaller waist to hip ratio, relatively larger hips, breasts, girly looking face. And there is a penis. What is your opinion on that (or maybe you have some info)? Are they in the M2F transition process? I don't think hormone therapy could explain this - you wouldn't be able to change your skeleton by taking hormones after certain age. Are they unique, like hermaphrodites? And why there are so many of such people in Thailand compared to many other places, like Europe or America?"

"A thing I think you missed is the amount of trans women (like me) who understand that trap is not a term meant to apply to trans people, at least not any more. It's a generalisation to say trans women are offended by the term. *SOME* trans women are offended by it, *SOME* aren't. My problem with this video is just that you treat trap as a term MEANT to apply to trans women, when that simply is not the case. It applies VERY SPECIFICALLY to men who dress as women for sex. Another thing is that you consistently imply that only straight men joke about traps being gay, which is absolutely false. That's my two cents."

"'Are Traps Gay?' You go on about people who date trans women and whether that's gay. That wasn't the question, question is whether or not the 'traps' are gay."
"A. 10/10 props for the Astolfo framed picture. B. So I'm in this strange position of entirely agreeing with this video's message and goal while also feeling it doesn't really address the whole issue. On the matters discussed, you're spot on as usual, but there's an element to the term 'Trap' and those that use it that isn't covered here.  When I, personally, use the word trap it has never been in addressing a trans woman (or Futanari, or cross-dressers, et al.). For me, Trap refers to male-identifying males who have strong secondary sex characteristics that reflect femininity. A biological boy who considers them self a boy that looks like a girl - and often in doing so also identifies with the label trap.  I'll be first to admit this is primarily a facet of the fetish/kink community - meaning it's a different sphere than trans women and their experiences being called a trap or otherwise bashed for 'deceiving' people. That said, I don't think it's appropriate to simply toss the term Trap into the slur bin because some people use it as such, because other people in a largely isolated context use it very differently and have for a while now. It's not just a 'but we wanna' argument, it's a term people use to self-identify and represent themselves to others within a community, which I think is worth talking about.  Keep up the over-the-top and creative benders, Contra. Still love it. ‚ô•"
"God I really wish I could get everyone in my peer group at school to watch this. I go to an all boys school (which is stupid btw) and the amount of homophobia, transphobia, sexism and racism I hear everyday is astounding. Everyone is so hung up on being seen as straight that they are just horrible to anyone who doesn't 'seem' straight. Hopefully I can use your videos to teach at least a few of them!"
"I wish i could dislike this video twice. Your content is deteriorating as your entire life is consumed by this mental disorder. Men can be attracted to boobs crudely drawn on a bathroom stall, does that make the stall hetrosexual? I had to stop the video halfway through as you ranted about your feminine penis not being gay for 6 minutes straight. This is pure delusion. Can you not see how your ideology blinds you from reality? I honestly wish you the best and hope you don't irreversibly mutilate yourself with GRS. There is still time to undo the damage to your body."

"I just kinda wanna issue a citation on 25:16 no porn is any kinda positive, porn is crazy racist,sexist and probably 4 other 'ist' words That's kind of been it's shtick for a while(context, i'v worked in a few porn shops in my day, definitely an industry of fetish and taboo even if the topic shouldn't be). But that is definitely off topic to the video. That being say way to be girl, both informative and entertaining as always, I enjoy it when these videos crop up in my recommended. Phenomenal content."
"I really, really appreciate what you said about meeting people where they are. Otherwise, what's the point? A genuine interchange between people who have different beliefs at the outset is only possible if you meet people where they are. Also, I appreciate how you talked about, quote, 'the black-and-white thinking of an identity dogma'. Your videos are always so well thought out and thorough, and they do a great job of appreciating the nuance present in a lot of these thorny issues. Keep up the good work!"
"Question about porn. Around 25:00 you imply that straight men's porn habits show they are actually really quite into transwomen, qua trans and also qua woman. But you pointed it out in the context of North Carolina, which got me thinking about how people use porn. We don't always watch what we love. Could some of those views be satisfying something other than attraction? In general, it seems that masculinity is toxic when it uses sexuality to assert power and not for mutual enjoyment and relationship. Most of your treatment focused on untangling a straight man's attraction felt to a 'trap' from the artificial shame of imposed labels. Can you address the tangle of internalized sexual uncertainty with the act of sex with an external other? ('Fuck you' is an insult.) In conclusion I wrote a lot and I think you're great and please answer why we can't love."

"Trans people are murdered at a lower rate than the national average, the average for men (which is highest) and the average rate for women in the US and the UK. It's safer to be trans than any other gender identity in both of those countries. It's daft to talk about trans sex workers and make out that they are killed purely for being trans when one of the most dangerous groups of people you could belong to is 'sex worker', 'drug addict' is pretty much up there as well. Given that the trans murder rate is so low you could argue that the trans murder rate isn't even worth discussing as it is deliberately misleading. I would say, however,  that there is probably an issue worth looking at regarding why trans women are overrepresented in the sex work industry as this is potentially related to their general acceptance in society."

"Another fantastic video. While I think your frequent use of Ben Shapiro there was quite justified I'm not so sure your use of Jordan Peterson was.  I am a straight guy, and while I questioned my sexuality some when I was in my late teens (mostly because of role-playing a woman online) I never really felt a pressure to perform heterosexuality. I'm still pretty uncomfortable with the idea of dating a trans woman, and would be pretty upset to discover that I had been in the bedroom. Not violent upset, and I wouldn't feel like my identity had been threatened. I also wouldn't feel terribly embarrassed to share the experience with people close to me. But I would feel violated somehow. I'm not completely sure why.  I just thought I'd add that data point.  BTW, I'd never encountered the 'Are traps gay?' thing."

"I wish I had an original comment to post here but all I can really say is I'm really proud of you? Based on what you said in your video on autogynephilia it must take a lot of courage to expose so much of yourself to the internet.

"I somewhat think most of the guys who talk about anime 'trap' characters online are too scared shitless of other human beings in general to ever call a trans woman a 'trap' in real life.  Doesn't mean this kind of discourse isn't harmful though."
"Everytime I see and hear that one character, I want to watch The Draughtsman's Contract. Again."
"This is a well made video but... You completely forgot the other side of the argument on basically every front. For the entire video you were focusing on the idea of 'people refer to trans women as traps' but not also 'trap is slang for crossdressing effeminate cis man', because that is what most people think of when the word 'trap' comes to mind.  As you mentioned in the video the term trap comes from males that appear feminine in anime, either a crossdresses or a trans girl. But the thing is, this is not really the case, because i don't think i've ever heard of a trans girl from an anime be called a trap. All popular trap characters from modern animes, like Astofolo, Felix Argyle, Hideri, etc, are simply males who appear and dress femininely but still identify as male.   Also, to say 'the word trap is a slur/is offensive' undermines crossdressing cis guys who might willingly choose to use that word to identify with, because there are just as many crossdressing men as there are trans women.   Finally, you seem to be semi-aware of this but, the majority of people who say stuff like 'are traps gay?' are actually doing so in a sarcastic/joking manner and context, no different from memes like 'fellas, is it gay to kiss a straight girl since they omly kiss guys?' and stuff like that.   So yeah, good video, bad message.  I'm not gonna play dumb and say there aren't people who refer to trans girls as traps or say it as a derogitory word, but the vast majority do not, and to want to try and restrict everyone for that is unjustified. Most folks can tell the difference between a trans person who takes hormones, has had breast implants and vocal training, an a guy in a dress ans wig who's got wider then average hips."

"You always handle the topics you choose to well! You have such decorum and grace! The quality of your videos are always excellent from the well thought out essay to the obvious effort you must have put in to create the sets and characters in your videos. It just feels so wholesome that you express the various issues you discuss in a way that seems fun for you, I think it really makes you stand out and..well I'm not quite sure how else to put this, but there's this overall feeling your videos have to me and it's along the lines of a sort of magical godmother, someone kind and gentle but unwilling to hold back the hard truth, just sorta doing a story time for all the confused kids picking fights with each other. I don't mean to trivialize, you just put a whimsical twist on things that are typically really hard to digest because some topics are just so frustrating for even needing to be discussed. It's just nice seeing evidence throughout your videos both visually and verbally that show you really care and that you get adjusting to new things is hard or learning new information can be hard but that it's all worth figuring out and talking about, because if these discussions aren't started, even if they're hard discussions to have, then nothing will ever be properly normalized and people's minds will not change.  I guess I'm just trying to say I'm a huge fan and appreciate the efforts you make and I hope you continue to garner an audience from all sides."

"90% less anime than advertised. Completely disappointed.   Also agree with you on 99.9% of this and wonder if I should even identify as a trap anymore, probably still going to because right-wingers (most of my friends) for some reason have a much warmer opinion of a human with a feminine features if they refer to themselves as a trap rather than as trans. I don't exactly like it, but it works.  In closing; please let me eat your ass, then argue about socialism vs libertarianism with me for an hour, then let me eat your ass again, then lets go get drunk and eat McDonalds.  XOXOXO, Joy"

"Do you think men who are attracted to both cis and trans women could benefit from a cultural 'buzz-word' that differentiates them from men only attracted to cis women? Everyone immediately knows what straight/gay/bi are, so people often try to fit the aforementioned men into one of those three categories, but none of those really seem to completely fit. The only commonly used word I can think of is 'chaser' (which doesn't reflect well on the rest of us).   Great video by the way. You're a dime, and I'd totally date you."
"This video was awesome I love your stuff so much and I always watch your videos as soon as they come out. I love how eloquent you are and you are so informative while being really funny at the same time :3"
"I get off from the smell alone of pussy, I have a hard time reconciling that with the 'feminine penis'. I've also aggressively called other men gay (in terminology most contra point viewers would find traumatic) if they won't eat chicks out on their period."

"Great video.  Well spoken.  @ 15:51 you became possessed by Jordan Peterson.  Scary stuff."
"While what you said about Count Dankula is true, but the fact that's all you said about him applies some unfair connotations about his character. Considering the category of hate crime is so broad and vague, that jab could easily be construed as 'he assaulted a minority', or 'made a call to violence', etc.    Why was he convicted of a hate crime, or in his case convicted of hate speech?  At the end of the day, Its because he told a  joke, and some people thought it was offensive. That's it.   If you want to use him an example of someone you don't want heading the discussion of 'are traps gay', that's fine.  That's your opinion and you are free to have it. But smearing him as a bigot to justify that opinion was unfair and uncalled-for."

"[This comment is totally fucked up, partly related to what this video added to my existencial thoughts of the moment, you're warned] This video raised a question in me that may sound silly but that I'll ask totally seriously to the materialists out there: would being straight stop existing in a theorical absolute transhuman utopia that got rid of all essencialism to ever exist?  See, I'm a white cis petit-bourgeois guy that mere introversion and sub sexuality among all my priviledges brought to an advocacy of total neverending materialist progress, a meta-left synthetizing every bit of science, a philosophical transhumanism as I call it. I try to think of a coherent model taking every data I master on and fitting without paradox and cognitive dissonance, from symbolism and class to entropy and oil passing by my balls... and Contrapoints makes me realize I still have slight bits of reaction here and there on LGBTQ issues sometimes, I fail to incorporate all these little details into the equation, specifically them, so I think the dissonance is stronger here. This is also part of the equation, this is expected, I'm straight so even if I think a lot of these issues, I think every second of what being introverted means, or what being submissive means, while Natalie thinks every moment of her life what being trans means, and I'd probably disagree on slight bits on a video about introversion, with book-long technical points to raise about one pointless detail. All that to say I'm no more afraid to kill nature and essences, end metaphysics, death and natality. While most of mankind would see me as their cultural equivalent of Satan for that sentence... after all I don't care because those things never touched me, it had always been alien before I analyzed them as the origins of domination and oppression. When you give women education they make less babies, transhumanism as never-ending progress is the biggest middle finger to evolution, 'nature', essences, and conservatism; so I come to the logical conclusion that the logical horizon of progress is the end of natality, and getting old and dying will have been cured for long before we even approach this state. This is 'big', transcendent, cosmic, but without an essence, just like determinism or entropy, it shakes your brain but actually it's not scary, nothing of such things scares me anymore... ... ... ... or nothing but sucking dicks? And even more the feminine dick? It remind me of online plays, I have seen several, most actually, subbies not into forced bi happy to suck dicks if Miss enjoys, but I've never been that kind of 'classic' sub either, slightest deviation from my kinks is a no-no... I love writing my crazy thought as an exercise to order them because I started this sentence as a metaphor to present my writing as classy, subtle and elitist as any Contra's videos that make them so captivating... and I'm realizing maybe it's not just a metaphor...   So we're back to the original question; what if I never thought of straightness disapearing before because it was my blind spot? Originating from a essencialisation of women topping me, evolving into a materialist symbolism of women topping me? I took the essence away but slight bits I fail not to see remain there, and push me into a harder time being as progressive as can be on trans issues and never considering straightness was symbolically inheritently more reactionary than queerness is, no matter how progressive you will to be as a cis het? Genetically, it could make sence that straightness stops existing, if genetic prodispositions are overcome by this transhuman environment of equalitarian hedonist sexuality and relationships, or the genetic predispostions of humans could be bi as well (no consensus yet on the genetic/environmental ratio, right?), so turn pan immediately as a 'first environment state', before changes. If a transhuman horizon is the end of reproduction, it would also make sense to be the end of straightness...  Enjoy this mess of thoughts guys and girls and in between, and no I'm not on drugs or anything, this is seriously what my mind will be on in the next days or weeks likely... so thanks Contra and materialistically hail the mouthfeel of the feminine dick!"

"Wrong! If a guy has sex with another guy that is convinced he's a woman, they're both gay. Also: feminine penis?! As in, clitoris?!"
"I know this comment is probably going to get lost in the endless stream of time on this video, but I wanted to say that your channel has really taught me so much about trans people (I don't know any in real life) and you have shown me the logic and reasoning behind gender (I'm a dumb cis so :/), thank you so much for posting!"
"You played football oh the dream"
"natalie's drinking white wine and not bubbly?! wHOmST?!!"
"It's really misleading to dismiss Dankula as a 'hate crime convict' and nothing more. The reason people know his name in the first place is that his 'crime' was obviously intended to be a harmless joke, and it was a huge abuse of power. Even if you disagree with him I don't think it's fair to write him off simply because he made a joke about Nazis being 'the least cute thing [he] could think of'."
"Why are your videos not so beautiful and entertaining and disturbing and intellectually stimulating at the same timmmmme?"
"I would prefer those boys go to Count Meechan"

"In so many words are you saying a holes a hole you go girl"
"I love you so much!"
"To me, what makes a woman a trap is infertility, and not necessarily whether she's transgender or not. A cis woman that can't bear children is pretty much the same trap as a trans woman. Maybe in the future, the technology will allow trans women to not be traps, but for now the situation is as it is."
"I wanted to put a hole in me screen after about 30 seconds"
"You just got a sub and the respect of a very curious gal. Love the video and you <3"

"nightmare fuel"
"Lol what bitch tried to insult your makeup??"
"I have to disagree. Homosexuality is an issue of sex not gender. So definitionally yes you are gay or bi if you engage in sex with the same sex. Let's stop making things more complicated than they actually are.  The reason guys fuck transwomen is because they look women but they can't get pregnant and they think that if they used to be male it must be easier to have sex with them because women are so hard to fuck but a transwoman might be easier. Now whether that's true or not I don't know because I've only had sex with Trans prostitutes. Which means I'm definitely Bi. But when I tried to have sex with a man I really didn't it. Wasn't a good experience.  So overall I don't believe that cis men are afraid to date transwomen I just think for most cis men they don't see transwomen as anything more than an interesting lay. Something to spice up their sex life and a hole they can fuck without dealing with as much issues as the average women makes cis men deal with just to touch their boob. Sexual repression will make a man do strange things."

"I know count dankula is technically a hate crime convict but did you really have to introduce him that way? His 'hate crime' was making an edgy joke.."
"I believe the key is simply accepting people as people.  I'm a relatively straight man, but honestly don't have an issue with my sexuality...I could 'fall in love' with anybody, and not feel bad about it.  I can be sexual with someone I'm not physically attracted to, as I don't see sex as the heavy thing we like to make it.  I have no children, and no plans to ever have any (I'm 57).  I recognize that some have gender confusion - I've known some, and some were friends. I've not been attracted to any I knew - but was attracted to some I didn't know. In the right situation, I certainly wouldn't have simply turned them away.  Why worry about it?  Simply put, the disdain and disgust is simply pointless.  If someone has an issue with it, they should simply walk away.  It's horrible when violence is the response, and there's simply no excuse for that.  Oh, yeah, having my prostrate massaged is amazing.  Nipples?  Not so much."
"'the fundamental dick umami' is a phrase I never realized I needed in my life."
"Ugh... Why shit on Count Dankula? If you knew who he actually is you would know that he just a dude that made a funkin' joke, a real joke, not a funkin' dog whistle (haha, 'dog whistle'.). He did not really commit a hate crime, at all. He made a joke that literally mocked and degraded Nazis but the court did not take into account THE CONTEXT of the joke at all. Research him and you will see that he is not t bad, hate-filled, bigot. He is a good person."
"The way you talk about trans sexuality is a revelation. Keep going!"
"I came here for memes, fuck"
"hey Natalie, i realize that you did briefly mention NB folk, but i think this video overall had too much focus on the binary spectrum between male and female. i realize that you know who your audience are and nonbinary isn't a popular idea yet, but it would have been nice if you at least attempted to bring up NB within the context of this conversation too."
"Is it gay to be attracted only to guys if you're a guy?!?!?!?!"

"I love that beautifully framed picture of Astolfo that's just in the background for the entire video.   I'm a cis girl, and I'm one of Those folks who tends to be deep in anime hell, but I've also known 'tr*p' is a pretty shitty term for quite a while now and it just makes me super uncomfortable that it's so baked into Western anime fan culture now, I feel so bad for all my trans friends and acquaintances who have to deal with seeing it so normalized. I love the Fate franchise - the place where the aforementioned Astolfo comes from - even if it's peak anime garbage, but god in heaven, that fandom is a disaster zone outside of tumblr. I try to stick up for my trans friends and help explain why the way both series and fandom treats Astolfo (as well as similar characters such as the Chevaliere d'Eon and Mordred) is Really Really Bad, but a lot of the time I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. I even see this bullhonkey happen with actually genuinely canonically trans characters in anime works, like Cagliostro in Granblue Fantasy, or Lily in Zombie Land Saga, and it's just the worst to see even if I'm not the one being hurt by it. I can only imagine how this one bad meme being this normalized among anime fans feeds into much bigger problems, and you all deserve better than having to deal with this shit."
"Thank you for taking the initiative to discuss this topic with rational and style. Only  10 minutes in and wondering if Alex Jone's forbidden fixations will be brought up.

Please discuss the distinctions if capitalism- socialism-communism and where the intersect and how they differ.  Also, a bit more tolerance, the fans are rabid..."
"before i watch the video, i just want to point out my useless opinion to the age old question 'are traps gay'. My answer it depends on the situation.  It's not gay if you find someone feminine pretty and sexy because there is no indication that this person is a trap.  If you know the person is a trap, and still go for it, you are gay or bi with a fetish"
"That framed Astolfo in the background though. Truly a woman of culture you are, Natalie"
"I agree with most of it, but, I think you glossed over the crossdressing/transvestite angle of it a bit too much. A lot of anime 'traps' actually identify as boys who like women's clothing because it makes them feel pretty (IE Astolfo who you have a photo of in the background) and a lot of people who genuinely like 'trap' hentai like it because it is somebody who identifies as a male yet is cute and effeminate dressed in cute clothing and wouldn't be attracted in the same way if they identified as a woman / were a birth sex girl in the same outfit with the same outward appearance. I know that is probably super niche compared to most of the other examples you bring up, but, I am kinda curious what your thought is on it? Should they just use another word than 'trap' for it or do you think it is an invalid 'like' in the first place? I ask as a man who is pansexual with a leaning towards other men, but, I like 'trap' hentai. (I put trap is quotation as to make sure it was clear I was using it as a reference to the used term and not a passing dismissal of the word being offensive.)  To add on to that there are males that identify as male who model (online usually) in female clothing or like to dress in female clothing because they enjoy that it's cute / certain garments like skirts and stockings, should that just be moved under the tag of 'crossdressing' as a borderline kink. . . or does that more mean we need to challenge the idea of traditional gender-attached clothing and have any factor in this conversation?"

"You make a good point about perception.  People who equate lips on your face with labia and the shape of your hips with child birthing ability obviously want to make babies with someone.  For those who want to have children, there's only one way to make that happen.   When a straight man involuntarily becomes sexually attracted to a trans-woman's lips, he expects those lips 'mirror' or 'represent' her labia.  Finding out their involuntary, biological attraction is false because the lips on the face do not reflect the lips between the legs creates a cognitive dissonance...a confusion not easy to work through."

"As a straight man who didn't share the same opinion on a few of the topics you covered initially, I can admit you altered my perception slightly. However, as soon as you said 'sucking another man's dick just to try it does not make you gay' I had to revoke your credibility. Even though I disagree with some of the feminine penis points, overall I'd say you were doing so well. But that one line got you cancelled."

"Are traps gay? Neither. In general, it's closer to straight, than it is to gay. It's not gay, but it's not completely straight either. But really, it's not even in between gay or straight, it's a sexuality that exists separate from the gay to straight scale (that can be described as being closer in proximity to straight than gay). However, I would say its proximity to straight and gay, is dependent on one, whether or not the attraction occurs with or without the knowledge that the woman is anything other than a cis woman (with knowledge is closer to gay in comparison to without knowledge), two, if there is knowledge, whether the attraction is towards transgender or androgynous women or crossdressing, drag queen, or adrogynous men (attraction towards transgender/adrogynous women is closer to straight in comparison to attraction to crossdressing/drag queen/androgynous men), and three, in that knowledge, whether the attraction occurs in indifference or as a response (attraction that is indifference to the knowledge of the queerness is closer to straight in comparison to attraction that is a response to the knowledge of the queerness).   Traps are neither gay nor straight. Actually it's not even somewhere in between. Traps are a separate sexuality that (as far as I know, doesn't really have a term- that anyone uses) with  has varying levels of proximity (I outlined 5 levels) to straight and gay. This promimity if which usually closer to straight than to gay.   I actually think the question of 'Are Traps Gay', putting aside the historical baggage attached to the term and just viewing the term 'trap' as men's exploration into their sexuality is actually an important one. Sexual identity and understanding of one's sexuality is an important part of development and general happiness of a person, me thinks. I can actually remember finally learning about the word 'gay' and what it really meant, and realising that that's what my sexuality can be categorised as was kind of a comforting experience. There's a sense of confidence one can gain when one feels they can conceptualise and explain parts of themselves, especially something so essential as sexual identity.   Men who ask 'Are Traps Gay?' are really just going through a similar sexual self discovery/introspection that other queer people go through (at least those who may ask the question earnestly and want to get an intellectual answer)."

"Nice"
"as a Gay; i think i can speak quite clearly on the issue: traps are not gay.  think of it this way; a straight guy jerking off to Buck Angel (a beautiful ftm guy) and claiming its all hetero cus the dudes got a pussy - hes not heterosexual, hes in denial."
"lol, so much mental gymnastics. if you are a guy and you fuck someone with a y chromosome that makes you gay. being gay is perfectly fine but lets not call apples oranges. it doesnt help anything."
"Another important point: trans men exist. If being attracted to a trans woman is gay, then it‚Äôs also completely straight to be attracted to Buck Angel, for example."
"I'm doing my best to learn.  You lost me at 'lady dick' and 'feminine dick'.  So far, I know trans means 'on the other side of' and gender means, 'one of two physical sexes either male or female' so transsexual means 'on the other side of physical sex either male or female'.  So how do I know what a person is 'on the other side of' if I don't know their biology?    I'm still learning."

"Huh no you made some really good points. I've been a closet homosexual most of my life (only came out last month actually) and I used to watch futa/trap porn because that was as close to 'gay' as I could get before it was actually just gay... Think of it like drinking almond milk even tho I want good ole 2% (is almond milk milk?) Once I actually embraced being gay though, I didn't find        T-girls attractive anymore... Like at all (except contra points of course ^^ I'd be straight for that feminine dick) it really is about what they identify as, because I do find femboys attractive but I don't find a T-girls (that's not a slur is it?) Attractive even though they're both feminine. Cool vid I always enjoy watching you make me scratch my brain about stuff i usually don't think about. Keep up the great work! And makeup!"

"Dang you look so good ‚ù§"
"'...their will be discussion of transphobic slurs....'   I like it already."
"I brought up the topic 'are traps gay' to my boyfriend who was kind of on the fence about trans issues and had a fairly negative view on the whole thing, I found myself struggling to regurgitate points I've heard in the past into decent arguments but found them to be inadequate, so I showed him this video  he was pleasantly surprised and changed his mind quite a bit, so thank you so much for that  he also said you look quite attractive, which I will second  love your videos <3"
"The only issue I take with this video is that you haven't properly addressed what is happening with the kind of people who joke about this issue. Not all of the people you specifically depict using the meme are doing so in a serious context. You've presented the argument as one in favor of societal norms, and that it is distasteful to use this specific word in common parlance in any way. Jokes of this kind are specifically meant to go against societal norms. It is precisely the offense that these people find funny. It is exactly the same as people that ask to be roasted except without consent. Nobody is above this. I do agree that a certain subsection of trans women can be seriously affected by the discussion, but that is bound to happen when you're using offensive comedy of ANY stripe. There's plenty of women who miscarry every year, there's plenty of men and women who get cancer every year, and there's plenty of shitty drivers that have traumatic experiences on a nearly daily basis, but none of these people are special enough to be considered exempt from jokes being made about them. Dead baby jokes are some of the more popular jokes of this type. If properly contextualized it is actually cathartic to joke about it.   Why should we accept your proposal that this section of society is exempt from being joked about?"
"'What am I gonna do with a sacred passage?' and its answer made me have to pause the video. Golden line. I needed that laugh genuinely. XD"
"I always felt like the most important distinction was the self imposed title. Like... if someone ELSE calls you a trap that's rude and potentially offensive, but if it's you assuming that title yourself then it's empowering.  As to the 'gayness' of the trap I can't help but wonder... why does it matter? You are attracted to whatever you are attracted to. Why can't because just accept that and move away from imposing derogatory on other people?"

"Absolutely beautiful.  Here, take a comment to boost the metrics."
"I like your point of view. I see why the term can be offensive for sure. I also like how you don't assume the worst in those who use it though. I think a lot of people jokingly having the conversation are actually creating a satire of overly-masculine 'gay-afraid' people. The idea of somebody feeling attracted to someone but having to check with other men to make sure it's not gay is inherently ridiculous which is why playing that character in the 'bit' is comedic."
"So, I've been a member of four patreons before, all of which were strange as many didn't do anything extra with the money. With your videos, I love the fact that there's a very visible differnce between your videos before and after patreon and it's for the better."

"Most straight men are cowards. They really are. I might as well be a trans woman because there are just as many women who don't have a penis who have to date vag-phobic men who are THE WORST, most selfish lovers imaginable. Most straight men are TERRIFIED of vaginas. Most won't go down on a woman, but the expectation of oral sex from a woman is a 'given' in straight man world, and on the rare occasion when a man does go down on you, he acts like he's doing you a huge favor. I'm of course not including the fetishists, who ONLY see the vagina, and not the whole woman, which is just as depressing a narrative. When you consider that the average straight woman (around 40%) have been polled as NEVER having had an orgasm EVER, with ANYONE, the onus is on straight men to stop being such big fucking babies and to realize that in fact, their phallocentrism is not the alpha and the omega of everyone's existence.   Ironically enough, their mothers for the most part are at least partially responsible for this narcissism-- her 'little man' is infallible, and is going to be an empire builder and is perfect and can do no wrong, amirite?   Of course that goes into internalized misogyny in a patriarchal system that rewards the, ahem,  other 'little man', but only in the very narrow context of straight, cis, heteronormativity, and even then pitting race, tax brackets, stereotypes and other 'acceptable norms' against each other. It must be exhausting being a straight man. Preserving their het masculinity must be like the ultimate game of 'the floor is made of lava', except instead of floors, its genitals."
"bless you"
"You're a woman, you're a very feminine woman and you're totally beautiful. I have no clue why anyone would get confused. I do think that a person has to grow and change to actually allow themselves to understand a trans person. Like would I date a trans-man, more and more I think, 'Yeah, why not?' Of course I still sadly have some thoughts that worries that it could be weird, but as a 30 year old woman, I have grown out of the past thoughts about how important gender is. Love is love, and the older I get the more I learn that it's true. Sadly people have to grow and some just never go. :)"

"A brick mad that he couldn't 'trap' anyone"
"This was a pretty good video, but when people use the word 'Traps' they're usually referring to cis men who dress as women. its a term thats usually used in anime."
"Who the fuck googles 'are traps gay?' isnt it a rehtorical question thats meant to provoke debate about nature?  'traps' aren't gay because they are displaying female signals but they aren't 'straight' because you have to remember if it wasn't for modern advances they probably wouldnt be displaying too many of those female signals to begin with. Naturally men and women look different and we have evolved to use this to work out what is best for reproduction. All this goes out the window when we talk about a small minority of people who are either infertile or unable to reproduce due to to their brains, making 'chicks with dicks' or 'dudes with boobs' a real outlier  I think for the majority of men they are repulsed by their meat sticks (just as females hate vag) so when they find an attractive women they like has 'the opposite' they would probably describe it as 'a trap'. I think because men tend to be the types to be attracted to visuals cues like make-up, when they find that they pre-judgements were wrong they blame those responsible for using those visual cues. If I stood at a bar and sorted out my pockets and let a business card fall out or sports car keys for example, whilst wearing my more succesful brother's clothes only for you to later find out I'm a poor, un-motivated man, who can bearly iron a (dirty) shirt you might also call it 'a trap'. This is because your expectations have been averted.  Summary, I think men are going to make snap decisions based on your appearance that women would see right through. i.e I think MtF transexuals are found more attractive by men then FtM transexuals are found attractive by women (prove me wrong but my hypothesis is that this is the case) Men fall for the trap so to speak, and women dont.   Of course there are still those guys out there you can call 'gay' and they freak out and start punching people in the face, but soon enough they'll all get a good dicking and come out the other end a super-fairy. :3"
"What are you even saying? Why does anyone care if being attracted to a 'trap' is gay or not? You guys don't make any sense. The whole point of 'traps' is androgyny and gender ambiguity. The only reason why you're asking this question or even trying to answer this question is because you don't understand history of Japanese theater. Traps don't fit in the binary gender ideas or LGBTQ ideas of gender so you're all getting confused. They aren't supposed to be transgender women or transgender men (most of the time). They are an expression of androgyny and gender ambiguity in Japanese culture. But It's hard to get that when we only have western words to express it. It's coming from a completely different mind set and so meaning is lost in translation. Basically traps exist because of Japanese theater back in the olden days but, that's a long story to tell and I'm not going to tell it today."

Does this excuse homophobic slurs, death threats, assaults and even murder? No, those are still very much a crime, but you know what can help a trans person not get into those risky situations? Being up front with their trans status and make sure the man they're trying to hook up with is actually fine with it (sure, this mean that the men you hook up with will mostly be bi and pan men, but hey, still better than risking getting murdered right?). No, expecting you to be upfront about your status is not transphobia or oppression, it's about honesty, respect and trust, you know, some of the ingredients that are very fucking important in a relationship? Or you know, you can keep bitching about it, and and you'll keep getting insulted, beaten and killed when the insecure straight guy finds out you have a dick... whatever floats your boat... hey maybe it's a fetish or kink some of you have, who knows..."

Surely a guy crossdressing as a woman wouldn't look feminine enough to be considered a trap.

"I think that the word ‚Äútrap‚Äù itself is an offensive slur and saying ‚Äútraps‚Äù is transphobic. But anyways, I don‚Äôt think pre-transitioning guys and transgenders are straight, nor are they gay. Romantic and sexual attraction is about liking femininity or masculinity, but as well as dick or pussy. Fucking a transgender is kinda gay but thinking a transgender is cute/hot is more straight then gay. From my experience with straight males dating a transgender, most of them like cis woman and trans woman, not cis men and trans woman. You could also say the homosexualness of it can also be based on dick size, or if they have bottom surgery, as well as how easily they pass  I think that transgenders aren‚Äôt gay or straight, but rather bi or pan"

This would mean being pegged or having your nipples sucked by a female, as a male, would not be gay, whilst simultaneously determining all non-XX (baring diseases/mutations yielding triple chromosomes) members of the species would be cause for gayness if engaged with romantically/physically.  I suspect this argument would be the most robust."

I don't get how intersectionalist can believe that if a black trans person is being murdered, white middle class trans people, or any other person (freed from intersectional unnecessary 'categorization/class/race putting in boxes' ) can't complain."
"'if a man has sex with, or is sexually attracted to, a trans woman, is that gay?'  wow that is crazy to think about but i think most of the people who actually do have sex with trans women probably would identify as gay. but whatever.    my question, and ive asked it many times before, is why dont you branch out into mediums or subject matter that are not so narrowly limited by your own journey? you have so much, i mean so much talent and heart, and i would like to hear your take on so many things... i dont really understand why sex and gender are so endlessly fascinating for some people.... anyway, i love you, youre the best. i expect great things from you!"

More, you dress this colossus of thoughtful argument and truth in this bizarre transvestite noire where insecurities are laid bare in reaction to it. The filthy aesthetic of it is entertaining but belies the ironclad intelligence, and frankly will, to put forth logic and reasoning that would poorly translate into the audiences that need it the most if it were put forward in traditional media and academia.  tldr; You're awesome.

What I would like to mention is, however, that you should never NOT talk about an issue. You did state early in the video that you nearly didn't make it because some people think it's a topic too sensitive to even talk about. I think that sentiment is always wrong. If you don't talk about an issue you don't start a conversation and without that conversation people like me would be none the wiser regarding the issues you brought up in this video. What I'm trying to say is, please never consider silencing yourself just because a group of people might be outraged or irritated by it. No topic should ever be banned from being talked about.

"I think she brought up some valid points, I'm glad she brought up the mouth feel (didn't know that). I really agree with the whole you're attracted to what you're attracted to stop trying to label it but we use labels to more easily identify. I'd like to add anal doesn't mean you're gay if you're a male. Not all gay men like anal sex, and just because you like anal sex doesn't mean you're gay. Homosexuality (as she clearly defined in the video) is some one who is attracted to the same sex. Anal sex is merely one way two men can express that sexual attraction with each other, but not the only way. Also as a homosexual male I've had heterosexual men that wanted me merely for the purpose of getting off (I went into it knowing that it was ok I thought they were hot and it was mutually consensual); just because they used my ass or mouth to get off I don't think that makes them gay or even bi. They were just horny, looking to get off and I was there to provide (I have no shame in this I really don't). I do think people should stop trying to guilt trip people into sexual activity (while story behind this) which a FTM trans guy tried to do to me before.  Don't get me wrong I'm not attacking trans people, I don't think anyone should ever do that. Good video Contra üòä"
"'Homosexuality is the romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same SEX or gender.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality  Transwomen are 'women' in the social/gender sense of the word. Sex can't be changed.  You yourself admitted this during the 'pronoun' video.  'traps' are indeed gay by definition."
"Hey so I agree with everything said in this video, but I'm gonna give some explanation as to why some people (this is just anecdotal, based off of me and my friends who are far from being bigots) use(d) the word Trap.  So we view the word Trap as only applicable to crossdressers that still identify as male (and this is the definition I'll be using for the rest of my post, for clarification). But it seems that throughout the years, as the word as become more widespread through the internet, it has slightly shifted meaning to also include Trans people. Now there are people that are trying to transmute a word that has been in our vocabulary for years into something else (and actually do use it in a hateful way), and there are other people that as a result shame us and revile us for using a word that we have been using for years. This creates a sort of backlash where we feel like we're being cornered from two sides. Now this makes it sound way more important or dramatic than it actually is, it's just a word after all, but it's mostly a subconscious reaction. Personally, I'm probably gonna try to use it less, or at least especially when it comes to real people. I don't wanna be bothered by rabid people on twitter for using the word, and I don't want bigoted hicks thinking I'm on their side. About the whole 'is it gay' thing, I personally never gave a shit. Sexuality isn't just 2 checkboxes you can choose from, to me it was more of a question of 'are they hot?' than 'what do they have in their pants', it just happens that I only find feminine people hot. (So far, at least) A friend of mine is actually pretty adamant that traps are gay, even though he's really into them (he's not at all into 'normal' men). I think it's because he feels like it empowers him, to consider himself gay in some way? I've wondered where he draws the line, though I haven't asked him. Anyway these were some mostly pointless ramblings and thoughts on the topic. Goodnight whoever is unfortunate enough to read this."

Its unfortunate that a trans person was born in a body that doesnt fit them but thats just what it is and we have to make the best of it for everyone but that doesnt mean we should pretend things that are arent."

For one, I've had friends tell me they fetishize those types of people (males signaling as females, that don't identify as trans).  The main problem I have is the crucifixion of people that use the word instead of simply saying, 'Hey, we shouldn't use this word because it hurts people.'  The people getting all enraged just seem nuts, especially when they aren't trans themselves and aren't saying why it's offensive."
"The Romans had a curious view towards sexuality, which may explain why some of the 'is this gay' absurdity exists. The Romans recognised two sexualities, but that weren't clearly heterosexuality and homosexuality. Rather, there was a masculine/dominant and a feminine/submissive sexuality, and there was a sigma on being the wrong sexuality. Penetration was pretty important in determining this, so if you, as a man, fucked a boy up the ass, that's a totally macho move and masculine or 'hetero', whereas taking it up the ass as a man is totally gay. Women couldn't really penetrate men so I guess they were just always ok. Historically lesbianism wasn't (as) looked down upon as me homosexuality.  Now why all that existed in the first place, I can't tell, but it's clearly something that's a very old part of European culture."

"Okay, when you say the masculine clitoris do you  mean the prostate or a trans man's vagina?"
"A point; the semantic connection between the word 'trap' and the repudiating phrase which it stems from, has been or is in the process of being severed.             People interested with traps, or interested with most related matters (ie. anime and suchlike), indicate little connection between transgendered women and androgynous male crossdressers/anime characters, in my personal experience. (It is hard to source this as most of this is from imageboards, videogame chats, personal experience and some facebook groups; though I am certain that the 'test base' (if one can call it that) is ideologically diverse, as it spans everything from anarcho-capitalists, fascists in denial, 'enlightened centrists', and anarcho-syndicalists; there might be a bias for males, queers, and transgendered females in this judgment - all of whom are young, (eg. around 18-25 years,) are mainly middle class, and all mostly have an interest in anime or anime subculture.)              I don't mean to be normative when writing this, nor do I wish to disregard the experience of trans people, but I feel that the word trans is more strongly a symbol of [gay] crossdressing than to pre-operation trans women; this is also slightly for the reason that the word is somewhat sexually charged and undeniably has a sexual element or an element of sexual appeal connotated to it (traps can indeed be considered a fetish; being a trans woman, ie. a biologically male woman, is a gender. (A note on this sentence; transgendered women are in fact women, regardless of any XY-chromosomes and biological; biology is not very relevant to gender, as identity is individually conceived. In more slogan-esque terms - '[trans women are women.]')); there is nothing innately sexual about an identity, in contrast to often-promiscuous, often-suggestive effeminate anime boys. It's as a contrast between something essential to a person versus a set of accidental traits or √¶sthetic.              I also ought to confess that I myself am an amateur (gay, cisgendered, male and all those words) crossdresser, and that this might cause these statements to be biased; regardless, I hope that my comment is thoroughly considered by anyone reading, regardless of any bias that might crop up within this anecdote. I personally feel complimented when being called a trap, though this might be due to me not being part of the demographic for which this is perceived as a slur, nor (perhaps more importantly) part of any community which uses the word as one. I guess one could compare it to the Afro-american vernacular to 'black person' in that sense, as it has semantically changed to fit a certain sociolectical internet subculture. In any case, the most descriptive definition of a trap I can come up with efficiently, is that 'trap' is a certain √¶sthetical subtype of [male-identifying] androgynous or effeminate crossdressing, wherein the crossdresser does not deny [his] gender, or a transgendered (androgynous) woman; regardless of any connotated sexualities or sexual elements, whilst still in acknowledgement of said elements. By this definition, it is clear that 'trap' is an √¶sthetic, or perhaps very dependent on an √¶sthetic, which makes sense as it is not an identity in itself. A point of interest that I might mention, is that there have been many (formerly) male-identifying crossdressers that have later become transgendered. There is a connection between the two, undeniably, but I think that occurrences such as this only add fuel to the fire of the question of whether 'trap' and 'transgendered woman' are symbols for the same essential thing.             Are traps gay? Depends; the √¶sthetic itself is indeed queer, but not gay per se; I have met some heterosexual crossdressers, and I know certain women with what I can only describe as erotic desires for traps. Traps can thus certainly be heterosexual. But there are also a lot of homoerotic and homosexual elements and, er, fantasies, surrounding traps. Mostly with respect to anime-inspired erotic artwork, but also undeniably with respect to real people. So yes, traps can be gay too. But it is neither in essence, I think. It's as if asking whether the emo √¶sthetic is gay. Or if impressionism is gay. In literary terms, it's more of a mode than a genre.             In closing words, there is a lot of confusion around this, and whilst interesting to write about, it feels like a redundant rabbit hole filled with red herrings and semantic confusion. Semantic confusion because of mutations and intersections betwixt the syntagmatic and axiomatic aspects of the language, not to mention the shift from a slur to a vernacular word in the symbol 'trap'. A red herring, because of the abundance of questions simply not relevant to the matter at hand, as well as the various definitions of 'trap' and disputes over what the referent of 'trap' in fact is. Redundant because at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter and people should have the freedom to act on their desires [so long as they are morally sound], and a rabbit hole because I spent two hours writing this comment.             Defining a word should rarely be this hard, especially a word such as this."

I could absolutely be wrong, but i think it would be worth bringing up in the debate, as the debate more changes to harmfulness through generalisation of the concept than any debate over the validity of trans women.

But these characters are widely known as being actual male, like felis from Re:Zero, and if you still think hes attractive I'd consider that 'gay'."

The problem is other men who are both ignorant and small minded, and most who would actually sleep or have a sexual encounter with a transgender women and they themselves can't rationalize why that is, they see a trans girl in a club or a bar and are immediately turned on, so once they find out shes trans, they can't rationalize why they were attracted to her in the first place. So rather than understanding what just happen, they want to blame someone else for their inability to rationalize its gross its unbecoming and i don't stand for any penis in my vicinity to be acting as if they got 'trapped' its like bruh your attracted to a woman, period. Great video.. trans women are women get over it....Drag queens are part time dress up women, thats how you gotta see it.. a trans women will never stop being a girl, there is no wig coming off or any of that, and damn it i love all your trans girls for it!!!

"I liked the video and have heard 'Are traps gay?' a million times but never connected it to transwomen, I always thought of it as an anime thing. My stance was always that its not gay to be attracted to someone for womanly traits unless you are specifically as you say 'fetishizing the penis'. I am glad to have watched this video, it helped me understand the argument in a deeper way, even giving me a deeper understanding of the foundational preconceptions from which I essentially made the argument 'The dick don't make it gay unless thats what you're after'. The idea of a feminine dick is new but certainly changes the equations. More and more I am moving away from the system I previously held to and towards a more 'Fuck if I care' state of mind."

"Wait, I thought this meme was dead... I still think it's funny the question ever came up."
"Honestly I love how open Contra is about stuff. I am an anxious person, and lately I've been questioning whether I'm attracted to men. But the images of giant, throbbing dicks, rough play, and bad attitudes about women and LGBT stuff really put me off. I don't know if I like dick, but I'm fairly certain that I wouldn't like the way your standard cis/het would use it. By extension, I was afraid that a transwoman would be a soft woman in every other aspect, but then just raw you and get you pregnant. Lots of transwomen online assure you that they wouldn't use their penis in that way, but don't state how they would. (Understandable, I wouldn't want to talk about something so intimate either.) So there's still this grey area that's totally unknown, and therefore still scary.  But Contra has concisely laid it out in a way that seems okay. I don't feel nearly as terrified of the female penis as I did before, now that I know about 'mouth feel.' The main hangup I still have is just having to deal with everyone else's perception of a potential partner. And I already hate listening to my dad prattle on and on about non-binary people."
"Natalie, that eye shadow is fantastic. <3"
"I just found this channel and wow, what a great core of logical arguments wrapped up in a very creative and engaging presentation."
"Im going to have to disagree as a man who has had sex with cis women and trans women who pass in clothes pass it is definetly not a heterosexual experience. As much as modern medicine has progressed,  transwomen still do not look like cis women, granted they dont look like masculine men; but id say they are close to really feminine gays then women. For example they still have larger hands broader shoulders, and when they are about to cum they slouch just like a man. I know objectively these arent big things, but when it comes to sex men are super visual and so you really notice this stuff quickly. All in all I wouldnt call traps as a gay as like the ymca, but more gay like jefree star or James Charles."

"Respectfully, in terms of defining whether a sexual encounter is 'gay' or not, I think it does a disservice to everyone to view 'straight male and trans female' sexual encounters fully through the lens of a microaggressed, activist reaction to an unpleasant, at best trolling, alt-right meme, allowing that meme and viewpoint to excessively influence how we view personal interactions that are completely unrelated to it.   In your aesthetics video, you suggest there is some aspect of visual cue required in order to seriously suggest pronouns as legitimate (i.e if Dave is just the same Dave but now he says he is trans, isn't it a farce for Dave to assume he is owed the female pronoun??)....now, whilst I might not wholly agree with that, the point is valid and I think a perceptible, visual cue is inherent in defining whether an interaction is homosexual or not.  A trans women with female pronouns, is a women, with female identity. But that it a social phenomenon, where people have agreed to represent the metaphysics of the trans person above any observation of physical gender (i.e the gender vs sex distinction). In a sexual interaction, the distinction becomes a physical one (if indeed it is necessary to define it at all), that has to have some qualification of how feminine someone appears to be. One cannot suck Dave The Quarterback's cock and claim the act is heterosexual because Dave identifies as female, but still looks like Ving Rames....you can agree to say its heterosexual as a parameter of social respect, or to normalize a sociopolitical ideal,  but from a phenomenological perspective it misrepresents the complexity and nuance of the interaction. Now, let me make it clear: who has what genitals are not the defining factor as to whether it the interaction can be defined as heterosexual....it would be a combination of the identity of the participants, and the degree to which their sexual attraction is femininity aroused by masculinity, or the degree to which it could reasonably seen as a 'man and women' (however you might aesthetically define that, some kind of community standard). A  homosexual relationship between a femme, cross dressing gay man and 'straight acting' gay man does not become a heterosexual relationship if the femme cross dressing man simply changes his pronoun to she, in any kind of meaningful, observable sense.  Also - at the end of the day, why does it have to even be defined? And why does it matter if something is gay? Also perhaps, as evidenced by this video, issues of transgender sexual relationships are so specifically complex that perhaps it deserves its own field of sexual orientation separate to simply gay or straight, that has its own specific psychosexual and sociopolitical challenges that are caused a disservice by being lumped into non-trans sexual identities?"

"'All I want here is basic human decency'  Oh look, the answer to 90% of all gender issues. If only we could manage it..."
"First Are traps gay? Answer, yes. If two people of the same biological sex engage in sexual/romantic relationship then its homosexual activity which is perfectly normal and healthy. Now it‚Äôs true that history is filled with individuals who for some as yet undetermined reason feel/desire to live as close as possible to the opposite sex which again is perfectly healthy and normal. In addition there have been many individuals who aren‚Äôt transsexual/transgender who will/wish to engage in relationships with individual of a trans experience and again this is perfectly normal and there should be no shame or stigma attached to such activity. However, to attempt to develop a series of poorly developed and superficially evidence arguments as well as conflate separate issues in order to hide that it is indeed homosexual is dishonest  and unhelpful in dealing with the issues encounter by trans women or those they form romantic attachments with. Finally, as to the question of should people use the phrase are traps gay? Again the answer is yes, they can. People think and say things all the time, even Ms Wynn has and most likely will continue expressed opinions which have been offensive to someone at some point. This attempt to again superficially conflate speech with other issues of a criminal nature is not only erroneous but dangerous as if you can‚Äôt say what you think then you can‚Äôt actualise it either. Trying to develop and argument that implores people to not say something because you don‚Äôt like it and then try and fail to show how the phase itself actually causes harm and then resort to implying it does in order to justify a poor proposition is not only dishonest but potentially represents an actual attempt to disguise the wilful desire to control language for a partisan/sectarian aim which is regressive and not something progressive. And that is something that can not be countenanced as such. Because such tactics can easily be used on groups that need to ‚Äúhijack cars‚Äù be very aware of the games choose to play."

"Okay, a couple of things I've noticed:¬†Racists, sexists, homophobes etc. don't actually care what others think. Or they do, but they will soon forget the criticism. Even if a homophobe would have gone to an LGBTQ rally and feel like 'I see the error of my ways', I'd wager that immediately after they leave it and come across a 'clearly' a trans person in the supermarket, they'll start feeling this 'disgust' all over again. SOOOOOoooooo... What's my point?  *The WORST way to tell them to stop being homophobic IS to actually tell them to stop.* (Explain thyself hethen!) No matter who you are, being told what to do is regarded as patronizing. And that just makes them angry and hate these people even more. They tell you-you shouldn't be gay? Do you feel bad and don't want to even listen? That's how homophobes feel when you tell them that they shouldn't be homophobes. Sounds absolutely stupid, but you gotta fight stupid with stupid...   The best way to tell them to stop is like this video: *Explain and educate.*  It makes them feel smart that they connect the dots; 'A guy just likes dick...

"Well, it's not that problematic, but as a lesbian (like TOTALLY INTO GURRRLS, and like male dicks yuck) I have noticed that I am attracted to trans women and I have wondered, well, IS THAT STRAIGHT? My conclusion was 'nope, as t-women are women, they're feminine, and you love feminity so much that you're not attracted to butches'. I did come to a conclusion that a girl dick probably (like I don't have any sexual experience with t-women and that's why it was 'probably') isn't the same as male dick. So yeeeah, a little lesbo wondering about her sexuality has also found an answer in your video, thanks."
"Just because 'trapping' someone doesn't justify murder doesn't mean you aren't deceiving them nonetheless.  Making yourself appear female when you are biologically male, regardless of how you may feel inside, is done to send the signal that you are female and not male, and that is deception.  I'm not saying murder is in any way justified, but that's a real moral issue and there is no getting around that.  Framing the discussion as a trans-victimization or even a 'is it homo' problem is done to invalidate the people who believe biology is significant by dismissing them as insecure homophobes, and it's probably motivated by the whole 'my group has suffered more than your group so just shut up about it' shtick."

"I think so much of this comes from disconnect between the people using it, and the people getting pissed about it, and what they each think a 'trap' even means.  When people talk about traps in the context of traps being gay, generally they mean their anime traps, but here's the thing: *traps are always guys*. Always. To the point it's a trope in anime for a trap, an effeminate looking guy, to be misgendered as a girl and then be upset about it. So, if someone is a transgirl, they're a girl, and thus by definition aren't traps anymore. Anybody calling a transgirl a trap is using the term incorrectly - same as using it to apply to futa. We have a word for that... it's futa, that person is quite distinctly not a trap on account of being a girl.  So when someone says 'are traps gay?', they aren't posing some question about transexuals, they're asking if being attracted to the form of a person is more important than what's inside in determining your sexuality. But they're asking it about feminine looking guys who are still very much guys - and frankly, saying traps is used toward transwomen is almost taking it away from the men who embrace the term as being theirs to describe an aesthetic in how they dress and present themselves, which is already hard enough for them because guys get enough crap for being femme, and now the people who should be telling them they're valid are the ones erasing them and telling them how they identify is *wrong* somehow.  You can argue that some high profile people or use generally has gone more toward being transwomen, but hot take: I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually CAUSED by transwomen themselves making a big deal out of it, because it seems kinda recent. So no, I disagree that using the term 'trap' or asking if 'traps are gay' is offensive. It might be if it's being used to deliberately misgender someone - insisting that a transwoman is a trap is calling them a guy, after all - but wondering if your sexuality is defined more by overall form or by bodily function, albeit in a jokey memey way, is a pretty valid question - like asking if you can still call yourself a lesbian if you're dating a transwoman, and having sex with her, while she still has a penis. Sure, it doesn't change the fact that love is love, labels are arbitrary and we should all just get with whoever the hell we like, but in terms of figuring out where our own sexuality and it's labels blur and where we sit on that spectrum, it's harmless speculation at worst and honestly might actually be helpful in helping someone discover their identity at best.  TL;DR: Transwomen, most of the time you hear people talking about traps they're not talking about you, they're talking about that cute guy who definitely is a guy but still wears chokers, does full body shaves and makes you look twice if they're even a guy sometimes - because he is a guy, and all traps by definition have to be guys. Trap lovers, you probably don't use the term towards transwomen and if you do you're calling them guys, which like... y'know, not cool, so don't do that. Contra's right that we need more understanding, but... it's of what the other party mean and how they use the term, as well. But then maybe my experiences are just vastly outside the norm and language has long since moved on so now trap only applies to transgirls and futas, who knows?"
"I haven't seen nearly enough comments on the lighting, make-up, and set design. That's a fucking crime. And the fact that you manage to be one of the few left-leaning channels I've seen that actually try to make sound arguments makes me wonder how you don't have more subscribers."

"I watched the whole thing. I'd like to give you a nod, and a counter argument.  Nod: Are traps gay? They can be. Assuming a trap is a trans woman who didn't tell her partner that she was a trans woman until she pulled her pants down. If she's only attracted to guys and she doesn't tell her partner she's a trans woman until the last minute, she's a straight trap. If she's only attracted to women, she's a gay trap.   Counter argument:  I consider trans women women. Why not? It isn't non-futile to try and go around saying that all trans women are men with mental disorders and things like that, because truthfully, I don't think I know if they are or they aren't. Everybody I know could be lying to me about the truth behind gender expression. Maybe, for example, both Judith Butler AND Ben Shapiro are 'paid shills', although they both could be right and wrong about some things. However I notice that your immediate predicate in this video upon which everything else is built is that trans women are women. And usually, people who do not like trans folks will say that no, they are men. And I'm sure you've heard this millions of times and probably thought of it. Actually, I don't know if you have a video or not specifically addressing gender performance and how it relates to gender expression. But it kind of reminded me of Descartes trying to prove God exists logically on the predicate that God = perfection and the more perfect something is, the more indicative of reality it is, therefore God is reality. You say similarly that if trans women are women and heterosexuality is when a man 'relates' to a woman, then it is heterosexual when a cis man relates to a trans woman. I'm not confused though by your statement, I'm still trying to work out the Descartes one to be honest. But I don't think this video would convince the more heavily transphobic people that I know. I think you do a good job for people who are on the fence."

"I used to actually call myself a trap for a period, until I realized I was actually just trans, my joking cross dressing led me to realize it. Now I do understand all the differences, and I‚Äôve realized that in anime what most people refer to as a ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù is not a trans person but rather a Femboy, although this can still be shitty it should be known to understand how people feel about this issue, although saying that a femboy is a trap as well is also kinda shitty."
"I stan your work. The aesthetic is so pleasing and thank you for calling out the fake woke people."
"I loved the video although there is one thing that concerns me about the term 'trap' you never touched upon. I have met people that now identify themselves as a 'trap' and this includes someone I have met that is trying hard to give themselves breasts through diet and trying to increase their estrogen levels to have a chest. I feel like the 'trap' social climate is confusing many people whom have body dysphoria or euphoria into thinking that's how you identify if you are wanting to be presenting/identifying female ect (this goes for identifying guys too but I mainly see this happening with the former). I don't actually know how many people experience this but if you go to the anime community, there are many whom identify themselves this way. This includes the want to be called she/her and vice versa. I'm not really sure what to say to others really, I don't want to discredit their identities just like I wouldn't want mine to be. But to adopt the term because you only know of that term as a way to identify how you feel (which is an exact to trans in most cases but not all,) does concern me.   I guess a lateral would be to consider yourself the f word instead of gay and go around calling yourself a f as a replacement for the word. That's the main reason it concerns me but then again people have taken slurs to identify themselves before, but it's such a mixed bag and never does truly take away the power of it being a slur in the first place."

I'm someone that wears old military jackets, wears cargo pants, and I kid you not, have been wearing old surplus brown undershirts from the British army I got en masse on the cheap in 99 when I was too small to wear them and they were sacks on my tiny little frame. After? Attraction was totally gone. Cos I didn't smell right, and my skin wasn't attractive. Straight guys did occasionally hit on me. Mostly bi and lesbian women. Only kind of 'gay' guy who's into me is the dense weirdness of the furry subfandom of bisexual men clinging to gayness because its a badge of honor you see often in the furry community. Ya know, the same kind of gay men who's fursona is a hermaphrodite multiboobed hyper who mostly RPs boinking other weird hermaphrodite multiboobed monsters."

"But there is a difference in being sexually attracted to a gender and being romanitcally atracted to one. Fro example aromanic and asexectuals. So one can want to have to have sex woth someone qithout wanting to fall in love with them and one can fall in love withou wanting to have sex. This should influence something in this debate. One can be attracted to people who have 'man parts' and dislike boobs and vagina but still be able to fall in love with a nurturing feminine cute girl. Hence the furanari fetish."
"You do a good job of breaking through a lot of the standard beliefs 'straight' people have about trans-folk. But I still haven't seen a response to the idea that the phenomenon (if you can call it that) is closely tied to the late/decadent stage of civilization (I think Camille Paglia made this argument). The idea being: if you, Natalie, had been scooped up at birth and sent to live among some hunter-gatherer, communitarian or otherwise 'primitive' tribe of tall white people, would you still feel you were born in the wrong body or the need to express yourself as feminine? Or, given the culture or lack thereof, would you just 'be'? We could go a step further and place you trapped on a desert island with no human contact. Would you still feel this dysphoria and the need to act out femininity?"

I am shocked to hear stories of transwomen just being murdered for walking down the street and being assaulted for being in bars, I don't believe anyone deserves outright violence based on the manner of their personality/appearance and the fact that there is even stories of these things happening is worrying. I believe in recent years society has been more open to conversations and it has brought people together and overall made more people accepting to trans people and LGBT people as a whole."

"Answer is no, not gay. Is not 'PURE' heterosexual either (or kind of): Gynandromorphophilic.  Sexuality is a spectrum, lady. And BTW you missed and oportunity to the argument patriarchy also oppress men, even straight, even white, even rich, they are maybe idiots but that is not the point.  GAMP (Gynandromorphophilic) appears to be a variant of male heterosexual orientation, with the additional sexual interest in GAMs, who manifest as anatomical females with a penis. GAMP may be a paraphilia, and it is certainly strongly correlated withauto gynephilia,which is a paraphilia."

"can somebody summarize in simplified english?"
"Basically...especially with the rise in technology and science making it possible to sculpt the body in ways previously unknown; actually the whole concept of identifying sexuality through the notional 'presentation of gender', be it straight, homosexual, bisexual, trans-sexual or pan-sexual or whatever, is actually hideously reductionist and makes about as much sense as forming whole social groups around having a birthmark in a specific place or being attracted specifically to people with mono-brows...trouble is we do like them tribes as humans and those have to be dropped on all sides really before any real progress can be made beyond the general 'group think' and towards what should really matter in regards to how people group, i.e their actual beliefs, ideas and content of their characters (to coin a phrase).   Perhaps it will take trans humanism, when everyone can virtually live out a variety of personas within a realistic digital world before everyone realizes how ridiculously fluid it all is for everyone...it is also sad that, even though we are now in 2019, the ancient Greeks over 2,000 years ago were better equipped socially to deal with that message that we are now! Although, I suppose it was generally expected then, that every man should marry and procreate no matter what else he did or how he identified...and I guess women did not have the best time comparatively in those societies, but still, they did appreciate that 'fluidity' in humanity...that's why their God's transform to have sex with mortals (and each other) and get involved in all sorts of shenanigans."
"Sharpio's pronoun view makes no sense. He has even said that he would say 'that woman in the orange shirt' if it was practical to do so which undermines his entire point."
"The whole idea of traps seems to come from the idea that trans people don't exist outside 'western' countries. There are in fact trans people all over the world but some people don't seem to wanna accept that. Cause most of the anime/manga characters dubbed 'traps' are actually trans in their respective shows/stories. Plus the word 'traps' doesn't even exist in Japan. So...?

But it seems like transwomen are especially detested in the black community. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack with that.  Also, I‚Äôm in love with your outfits, makeup, and hair.

And before this video I think I was open to the idea of dating a trans woman, but if we had ever gotten to the point of sex I would have been extremely surprised and I don't think I would have taken well to the idea. I guess what I had thought before was that going on hormones would turn a penis into a vagina? Which looking back I feel incredibly naive for thinking that.

I'm sure this exists cuz everything exist out there but I have never heard of a gay man who's attracted to other game in looking for a man who does not have a penis. Please don't get me wrong here I'm not presenting counter-arguments because I am prejudiced or hate trans people I really don't and I hope you don't hate me for debating you because I truly have no Venom towards anybody who is gay transsexual otherwise, but I would argue that most porn that is taboo is probably more popular and looked at more on porn sites than regular male to female sex. And that goes probably for any taboo subject you could think of cuz people are into things that they feel or that Society tells them they shouldn't be into."

It's like I can't get mad if my significant other doesn't want to deal with my depression or something.  I'd absolutely be disappointed and maybe think they're being insensitive - but I can't be mad they don't want to be with someone who's depressed or they tell me they can't handle it.  it's up to the person to find someone who can accept all of them for who they are/want to be."

I'm being serious and believe me I hope they all rot in prison ,but if there is a young woman who looks older than her real age and is perceived to look older and very attractive does that make it okay for a grown man to want to be with a little girl? Of course not right, and I agree because of age of consent and it's just plain wrong. The thing is though if we're using that same argument that all we have is our senses and that's why men are sexually attracted to people because of our senses and nothing more, well then of course a man could be attracted to almost anyone in almost any situation based off that argument. Shit, even a fucking llama wearing a mask dress up as a woman who knows nowdays LOL. So does that leave the door open for those sick fuckers to use that same argument as a reason why they're innocent for being attracted to young women? Also I'm not trying to be a dick im just being curious and honest ,that there is truth to it that our bodies are attracted or aroused to stuff based off of touch and the other senses. There has been information out there that people who are molested actually become aroused by the person who is molesting them even though they don't want it. It is because they're being touched and their body cannot help or differentiate the difference between Good and Bad Touch. A lot of victims cannot live with themselves after that because they were aroused when this was going on because their mind was feeling the opposite that their body was feeling. So that's what some would argue that just because you are physically attracted to somebody and they are touching you and they physically look good that mentally you still know they are a man because they were born that way  and so even though the body doesn't know the difference the mine still does which still makes you gay. Not the same but you get my point just as if a person were to be touched by a predator their mind knows it's wrong, but their bodies can't help but be aroused. Well a man who sees another person who was born a man,but is dressed up as a woman and he thinks that 'she' looks attractive and then hoes home with her and even though she gives great blow jobs in the end if they still know that this person is really a man especially if they still have there male genitalia then does that make them gay?"
"This video is amazing and I can't believe how perfectly your views matched with mine. Feels like you read my mind. I'm a newly realized trans girl and this is all just so great. I'm not straight so luckily I don't have to worry about what men think about me sexually, but I feel for all the straight trans girls out there who have to deal with this shit day after day. This video is just awesome in so many ways and so professional and I love it. You're awesome."
"I disagree with you on that point as well men do look at vaginas and when they go down on a woman they see every different vagina and they know that vaginas look different. So if they go down on trans girl or trans woman that has had surgery and the vagina looks all mangled and disgusting and weird looking then yeah they're going to be turned off and probably turned off transwoman forever ,but that goes the same for a straight woman. If they go to bed with a straight woman and her vagina looks disgusting and smells funky than that man is going to be turned off as well but probably not towards all women. That is the difference because the straight man being with a transgender woman it's risky for him and his head he's thinking that and if their encounter is something very enjoyable that maybe that person will think different afterwards but if it's not then that's probably going to change their mind as far as being with trans women from that point on"

"Why can't you just buy private insurance you can get private insurance or will that not help?"
"Now if a trans woman has a vagina then I don't think that it is gay to be with them because they don't have the same Gear as you. The thing is for a straight man it's going to be hard to be able to be in a relationship with a trans gender woman and go on dates and places like the beach when you could obviously see that this person has a penis. To the straight man that's a No-No and there's nothing wrong with that why are we trying to make it look like there's something wrong what the straight guy not wanting to be with somebody who has a penis I don't get it?"
"Thank you for this great video. I learned a lot and paused many times to consider. I appreciate how you cover all bases without going too far on a tangent, and this was a rare moment when I can say I didn't waste 45 minutes on youtube."
"When I was first getting acquainted with weeb culture I actually thought 'trap' was just a Japanese word for a boy that naturally looks like a girl, only later did I realise its more trans-phobic origin. Should have been obvious really, but it's not like lolis are anything to do with lollipops."
"That's a man."
"It's all because of the filthy, disgusting Weeaboos. I saw an anime once about Milo Yiannopolous's origin story. I think Paul Joseph Watson directed it, he has a very soyish face; certainly a Chad in disguise who suffers from carrot calves. Bottom line, people are who they are, who gives a shit? As I was once told, if her hair good, her makeup good, her nails done, and she smell good, she got a beautiful smile, and her breath good, and she dressed nice, and she got no Vericose veins, or no blemishes on her skin etc, you better be mindful, cause her dick is bigger than yours. Keep doing you. ^_^"
"Great video :) i loved the insight and the thoughts. The shaming hit a little close to home though lmao"
"But do women have a penis? Because that's the biggest hang-up for Straight Man. Maybe I'm onto something or I'm just crazy but I would argue that women do not have penises only men do. I wouldn't say it's not possible for a transgender person to be pretty or attractive because of course somebody could be attractive , if they have a penis it still doesn't work out though for most straight guys. Mostly because the other person they're having sex with has a penis as well. I never grew up as a kid and daydreamed about a woman who would stick her penis in my mouth. Usually it was actually the other way around and never as a straight person did I ever want to have a penis in my butt. straight men are not trying to sword fight with another man's penis they want a vagina and there's nothing wrong with that. So in my opinion I'm not saying I have anything against transgender people because I truly don't, but if you were to sleep with somebody knowing they had a penis just like you and you ,then you are now having gay sex which makes you gay. Honestly if that's what you're into then there's nothing wrong with that ,but why are we trying to pretend that somebody who may be attractive and has penis is really a woman? It's simple not true women do not have penises and science and biology if proven that .  A women doesn't have penises unless they're born with both sexes which then makes them hermaphrodite. Once again don't get me wrong I'm not saying there's anything wrong with people being gay I'm not saying there's anything wrong through transgender or hermaphrodite or anything I'm just stating the obvious what we've known for millennia that if a baby is born with a penis it will grow up to be a man and if it is born with a vagina it is a woman and most likely she can bear children. Women and men are meant to be together to procreate and keep the human race alive. If you're not into that and you're into other men then that's okay there's nothing wrong with that but let's not pretend that a woman with the penis is still a woman. She might feel like she is a woman she might look like she is a woman and she may deserve to be treated like one but that doesn't mean she biologically is one and because of that that person should be straightforward when she is sleeping with another person especially if they are straight and come from a culture that is not truly okay with gay sex."

"What about a gender fluid person? I'm a boy and a girl  Also my cum is clear I dont take hormones though. But my body is already kind of feminine to begin with."
"This is the first video of yours that I've ever watched and while I'm only two minutes in, I just had to pause and say that your delivery is absolutely phenomenal. 'The subject of the portrait was in sooth, not a daughter of Eve, but rather, that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite skullduggery'. I love it :)"
"This was a good video, entertaining and presenting a perspective I don't hear often since I've never had a conversation with someone openly trans. I lean very heavily towards biological definitions and explanations for things like gender dysphoria. I subscribe to the model that genetic sex, biological sex and social gender are distinct but influence each other in a hierarchy. Standard development follows inheritance of a genetic sex coded by chromosomes which coordinates embryonic development through mechanisms such as hormones to produce morphological features signifying a biological sex. These features range from very striking like genitals, to more subtle such as white matter patterns in the brain. There is then a complex interaction between how an individual is biologically predisposed to think, their social environment and how they visually perceive themselves that then results in the development of gender behaviour on the spectrum from masculine to feminine.  Therefore gender is not a complete social construct you can change on a whim, nor one and the same with sex. For example if a hormone imbalance in the womb caused by a viral infection resulted in a fetus becoming subtlety biologically intersex (particularly in brain formation) they would be more predisposed to developing a gender that does not correlate with their chromosomes or perceived biological sex, resulting in gender dysphoria.   I think the sex-gender distinction is very important, yet even trans activists use female, woman, feminine, interchangeably. Female/male has to refer to sex, but the rest could refer to gender if people prefer. Therefore someone trans could accurately be a woman because they identify with the feminine gender and she has modified her body to gain more female characteristics but she isn't a true female unless we invent chromosomal gene therapies.    Personally, I recently decided I would be open to a relationship with a trans woman in theory, since it is the biological female characteristics and feminine gender I am attracted to, not the chromosomes. I now wonder if I would be ok if they still had a penis, I always thought the 'feminine penis' was a joke since I hadn't considered how the hormone treatments effected it. I think I would miss the vagina, but it might not be a deal-breaker anymore...  I would have to REALLY love their personality though."
"Ok. But this whole trans women lying that they're cis is so unrealistic and is used just as an excuse to why men kill trans women. Like 99% of trans women aren't passable enough to deceive anyone."
"41:31 that was such a cute (and feminine) laugh ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"thank you"
"I disagree because I think that trans women are not the feminine gender.  They are their own gender. There are at least four genders... masculine, feminine, transmasculine and transfeminine.  People can be attracted to only one gender, if their preferences go that way.  For example, while a man with a feminine attraction could be attracted to a trans feminine person.. this is based on a misunderstanding. The man is getting feminine biological and social ques that this is a woman.  When animals get confused about ecological ques due to circumstances changing rapidly ( like trans people having more respect and being recognized as part of the human condition in modern, secular life) and make decisions 'by mistake'  we literally call this an ecological trap.  The man should be aware that there are other genders besides the regular feminine and the tran woman should be in a society where its expected and okay and celebrated to be loud and proud with your gender.  They shouldnt have to hide amongst the feminine.  Two spirit people should be celebrated.   So trans people, though its a hateful word, can be literally traps... are traps gay?  Im not sure. But people who's attraction leads them to interact with transpeople can have the preference to not want to be with a trans person.. But that doesnt make them gay and that doesnt justify violence."
"I'm glad I found your videos. I have been following folk like Ben Shapiro and Dankula for a few years now (I still do, but I get annoyed more often from watching Shapiro's videos) and I really hadn't seen many videos from trans people, or philosophy and intellectual videos from people on the left.  Having these topics rationally explained and deconstructed has been very good for perspective, since often times, political ideologues will only show you the crazies they can rip apart (Ala the format of Tucker Carlson, PJW or Crowder).  I personally really wish that Dave Rubin would invite you to his show.  I know a lot of people may think he's just a shill for the right, which I can see, but I mostly think it's because he has his head a bit too far up his ass at times.  I feel like a conversation between you two would be very useful for a lot of people who identify as Right leaning only because the only examples they are shown of people on the left are the rampant crazies.  You're really smart, and really entertaining.  However. . .  33:55 You spelled victory WRONG. Literally unwatchable. lol."

"Do you know why the rate of trans women who are black is higher for murder than white women it's because in the black Culture being gay is something that they have not totally accepted yet. Honestly there's nothing wrong with that either if you don't believe in being with another man then there's nothing wrong with that I just think Live and Let Live. Nobody should be attacked for not believing In or being okay with it gay sex and it goes the other way as well people who like or believe they want to live their lives that way should also be able to live their lives that way without people telling them how to live or what not to do. Never at any point in time should either side Force the other to do what they want them to do or trick them into doing something they don't want to do. If you are a religious man and you are against gay sex or gay marriage there's nothing wrong with that as long as you are not attacking others for the way they live their lives. Same goes for homosexuals and the gay community they should not be attacking straight people who are religious just because they don't believe in gay marriage or gay sex unless that person attacking them or trying to harm them first. It's a free country we should be able to believe what we want to believe but we should never trick or Force others to do what they don't want to do."

"She should have stayed at home no and she deserves to be able to go where she wants to go but at the same time if you know someone starting to get into you just to be safe and to do the right thing you should be upfront and tell them who you truly are or at least what you are when it comes to if you have a penis or a vagina. Believe it or not some people find that very important whether or not they sleep with somebody who has a penis or a vagina."
"The language captioning is in Choctaw, wtf is that?"
"I disagree with you that men pick the side of people who murdered trans people just because. You just literally told a story about a trans woman getting her titties felt by some man and then him getting enraged once he felt downstairs and found out she was packing. Why would you take somebody home or wherever and sexually allow them to caress your body and make out with you then touch your privates knowing you're a man and they think you're a woman? And even if you're not sure if they know you're a woman or a man downstairs when it comes to Anatomy then they should have probably been upfront and honest. They should have probably said I'm really feeling you, but I just need to let you know this or that or whatever the hell they would say to try to see if this person is okay with that. Because honestly if I were with somebody and we were making out in the club and I was touching her breasts then we went home together and I took off her pants while going down on' her' and she had a penis I would freak out too. I wouldn't kill anybody and I  wouldn't  assault or even yell to much at the person ,but I would definitely cut it off right there and leave and I would be upset.Other people feel like they were tricked or duped into doing something with somebody that they didn't want to do. That's like tricking someone into letting you touch them or having them touch you without telling them first that you're really a man or you have AIDS or you're married or any of those things. Those are things that you should probably just disclose before being with somebody because it's always better to be honest and upfront. I'm not saying it's right that these men murdered people because no one should be murdered for that ,but at the same time I could understand why they would be angry."

"I was willing to hear you out until you positioned Count Dancula as a 'Scottish Hate Crime Convict' The 'Hate Crime' he was convicted of was bullshit, and if that's the most pressing criticism of him when there are much better things to slam him for, then I just can't gather the respect needed to hear your points out fairly.  Count Dancula is a lot of different levels of asshole, but to focus on the 'hate crime' shows a lot of levels of disingenuous and immediately puts you in the camp of 'we should have free speech restrictions like those in the UK'."
"While I agree that a lot of the 'Traps are Gay' argument is dumb memeing, I still don't think that a guy who is attracted to preop transwomen & knows about the dick aren't entirely straight.   The way I see it is that you have the 'idealistic straight man' on one side and the 'idealistic gay man' on the other. The 100% straight guy is attracted to women both socially (the feminity of women) and biologically (vagina) and the gay man obviously being the same only flipped. Guys who are attracted to transwomen are neither of these cases, as they are attracted socially to women but also can be attracted to male genetalia (this would be the second option of guys you've been with as you said in the video). I wouldn't say that they're gay or even bi, but these guys aren't completely heterosexual either. If 0 is straight & 100 is gay, they would be like a 25.   Just wanted to add input to the conversation & been thinking about this topic for a while now. Sad to say your video did not change my mind, but good job none the less."

One drop of non-white blood or one drop of semen and you're out of the club? Seems extreme to me.  Also, to contribute to the conversation: my high school sweetheart came out as trans a few years after we broke up. I was attracted to her back when she looked and acted as a man and I'm not attracted to her now. That, to me, was one of the the biggest experiences that helped me key into where people who are trans fit into the phenomenon of sexual attraction; it was the first time I observed in real time that attraction to women is a prerequisite to being attracted to a trans woman. Which in retrospect is like... duh."

"I'm really not trying to be troll or anything of the sort, but at 7:15, you claim that transwomen are 'killed at a disgustingly high rate.' Which was 29 in 2017. Now for starters, that 29 included both transwomen and transmen. But then problems arise if you use the study published by the Williams Institute which had the population of transfolks in America as .06 of the population. I know the number the common YouTuber uses is between 0.01% and 0.03%. Those who identify as trans right activists or allies will use the higher percentage. The ones trying to say that tranfolks are such a minority that their issues aren't that significant will use the smallest fraction.  But back to the claim that being trans in America is dangerous. The total number of homicides in 2017 was roughly 17,500. If we use the 0.06% figure, the proportional number of murders would be 1,050. That means that transfolks are over 30x less likely to be murdered than CIS gendered. And this was of all transgenders, not the transwomen that Contrapoints claimed.   My issue is that if you are going to try to teach people why they should or shouldn't do something, and you start off with a falsehood which also tried painting that the averaged cis male in America are thoughtless killing machines, then don't expect to listen to the rest of your arguments. You could have easily made the same video as the title suggests, leave out fallacious statements or misrepresenting American culture, and been much more effective. Otherwise your video as structured is claiming that, 'you shouldn't joke about 'are traps gay?' because you'd be supporting a culture that tolerates transfolks being murdered.' I'm sorry, as well intentioned as you usually strive to be, you have to be precise with your logic and reasoning."

"@14:50 'what sort of thing is that??' Really? I think it's the cock and balls. That thing, that men would find pretty gay to have a penis inside of them.   I paused it, so I don't know if you're joking, being facetious or just willfully ignorant. Resume.  Post op, yea no rational guy is going to call that 'gay' but most guys aren't going to be pleased to take a woman home to find a dick in their face. I'm not gonna lie, it's a fantasy I HAVE. But I'm comfortable with my sexuality, and i believe a transgender woman is just *_gasp_* a woman"
"Thanks for this video.  As a black-hearted cis white male reactionary it was enlightening.  There is a weakness to the argument that hetero men find both transwomen and women attractive and therefore it's not gay to sleep with either: it's reductive to say that a woman's physical appearance is the only thing that a man finds attractive about a woman.  Sure, initial chemistry means we become attracted sexually, but it's not the full story.  What runs through a man's mind when he's flirting with or having sex with a woman is not simply a constant stream of appreciation for their appearance.  The attraction has much deeper roots than that.  Women are attractive to men for dozens of inscrutable reasons which, because of their inscrutability are hard to 'mimic'. Consider the disgust mixed with pity that is the normative reaction to men who develop relationships with 'real' sex dolls.  The dolls' attractiveness is not in dispute (if you squint), the disgust derives from the understanding that for the man, there is nothing deeper to their attraction than the physical.  How can a man be turned on by the sex doll if the doll does not have its own mind?  Where are all those inscrutable behaviours that are so alluring to a hetero man?  I am not saying that transwomen don't have their own minds of course, but the belief is that they're mind is not, somehow, authentic.  And authenticity is supremely attractive. Happy to be directed here as my mind has and is evolving."

And since we are talking about being offended, I guess that I would be one of the people who could be offended about him (Austrian and (most of) my greatparents were definetely not Nazis) More power to you."
"Well, the problem is that in my common language, trap is a slang for a man that looks like an attractive woman, either by cross dressing or not. By that definition, trap isn't an offensive term for trans women as it doesn't refer to women. Now, although I could consider changing my vocabulary for a more appropriate term, thing is that most people in my cultural demography (call them nerds,weebs, etc) have already associated the term trap with the meaning of a man who is attractive enough in a feminine way as to pass as a girl, and finding a term for that that was just as widely accepted would prove a difficult task. I could just go for transvestite or cross dresser, but those terms don't guarantee that the person cross dressing legitimately looks like a girl. So I'm in a tight spot here."

"Apart from all of that, is it really a problem for a word to have different deffinitions? As stated, in my cultural setting, trap has one specific meaning.

As a cis woman who has also read farrrrrrr too much of the amusing - if hysterically acrobatic -  contortions of philosophers living and dead on the matter of gender, I have to say I find your approach to the ontological and epistemological category of womanhood to be both delicious and comprehensive. I have been fairly high femme my entire life, but you, my divine, delicious sister, have much to teach us all on what it means to be a woman.   (Also, TERFs.....do not get me started on the regressive, arch-structural, theoretical bankruptcy of all that. Threatened creatures have a tendency to defend even the most decrepit piece of land they can call thier own. Womanhood is not so fragile a construct and pussy is a way of life ;) I am so sorry you ever felt excluded, sweetheart. I am sorry that any transwoman ever is.

"Loved this video. I am glad to see a measured response spliced with ironic jokes. Got yourself a subscriber! ;)  I have used this expression ('It's a trap') myself among friends but I always found it titillating. As I saw it, if they (the 'traps') could arouse my interest romantically or sexually, be it a cross-dresser or a transgender, then I don't care if I fell into the 'trap'. In fact, falling into the 'trap' itself is exciting. It helps me question my sexuality and how complex the question can get. How far am I willing to go and whether it matters how far if I am genuinely attracted by the individual. Initially when I saw the expression and used it myself, I thought others were of the same mind as myself. A gross mistake on my part."

"Trap is an American white trash word first of all, the Japanese don't call the androgynous crossdresser characters a trap. These 'traps' are usually male identifying characters who crossdress, much like drag queens. A vast majority of drag queens identify as gay, as they are male presenting and attracted to other males (usually with dicks because phallocentrism amirite). However, in many cases the characters in question show no sexual attraction to anyone for that matter. Ergo, those who are attracted to the 'traps', i.e. a MALE character (no matter how much they be crossdressing) ARE IN FACT GAY. As you are attracted to a MALE. In this same context what we NEED clarify with bravado is the abismal difference between being a transvestite and transexuality. That is something we MUST teach the wittle sad peeper owners of the world. Not that they will learn it, their brain capabilities are quite limited. So hereby I propose mass genocide as it has been shown you don't *actually* need sperm in order to create new life. Only the transgenders and cisgender women shall be allowed to exist. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."

"Are they gay? Some are and some aren't, although that designation gets real muddy, real fast. I do know that there is a disconnect between their biology and their thinking. I don't know whether it is genetic, or a mental issue, but in my opinion, they are just broke. I see no real difference between this and schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder, other than a trans can function in society. I was gonna say 'and not be a danger to others or themselves', however, unfortunately, the latter is not true.  I do not believe that I am a man because I believe that the way I think or reason is how a 'man' or even other men think or reason. I suspect I do, based on the things I like to do and interest me or the way that I react to situations is similar to the way other men react. But I have no way of knowing for sure. Bottom line is, I believe I am a man because I have a penis. I believe I am male because I have XY chromosomes. I am my own person, and being male does not dictate how I behave or act. It is simply a biological fact.  Maybe if you end up with XYX or you have both sets of reproductive organs, then you can be considered not male or female, and would be an anomaly. Everyone else is easily identified.  I am not saying that there should be consequences or actions based on the 'wrong' identification. Go be whatever you want to be. Dress however you want to dress. But requiring (not asking) me to recognize something that is contradictory to this basic definition is not gonna happen. And penalizing me for not honoring your demand is complete bullshit. You don't have any rights not to be offended."
"As a semi-closeted trans woman, I can't tell you how much the 'are traps gay?' mentality still perviates my experience with the public, whether I'm out and about in full woman mode or not. There is an assumption that trans women only get judged on this basis when they pass, and that it's later revealed that they're trans. However,  I feel that on some level, I'm constantly judged in society on how conventionally vs unconventionally attractive I am, and it's this perception of this that my womanhood is constantly judged on to figure out my gender. Hell, I was just at a restaurant the other night, and it was obvious to my friends between addressing us as ladies to then saying to me 'Oops, sorry, didn't see your face,' to correcting her, and her acting disgruntled towards us for the rest of the night, what that was communicating.   BTW, for all the cishet people in the comments section of this video, especially if you're in any type of service industry, you don't need to address anyone as sir or madam. Or, if it's literally required by your work that you do, I won't be offended if you simply ask where I stand on pronouns."

"I somewhat(yet don't completely...) disagree with the part where you say 'White middle class transwomen aren't the ones getting murdered'. Don't get me wrong - it *definitely* is a good point you made that it's usually the lower class and non-white members of the trans community getting murdered(especially in the USA), that much is true - and we should address it. But, I have to say - I have middle class (mostly white brit) trans friends, and I don't envy what they put up with. One of them in particular has had EDL supporters graffiti swastikas(among other unpleasantries) onto her wheelie bins. This wasn't a random act - because the same gangs group around her and verbally abuse her whenever she leaves her flat. She often tells me how afraid she is that they will physically harm her one day, and she never leaves the house alone at night - she always wants a friend with her after dark(although much of this abuse occurs in broad daylight, since it's the only time these abusers see her).    I mean yes, technically she hasn't been murdered - and I *do* hope it stays that way. But I know people really do want to hurt her, and would take an opportunity(whenever it's dark and there aren't witnesses - which again, said friend thankfully avoids as much as possible...though, who's to say she won't one day feel confident or just sick and tired enough to go out after dark? What then? Or what if the gangs decide they should just go ahead and target her during daylight hours, since they'll pick up that'll be their only chance?).  I'm just so sure there must be white middle class transwomen and transmen who've died as a result of harecrime - I know some who were pushed into suicide rather than being murdered(which feels almost the same to me),  and I've certainly known some who were beaten(although thankfully not fatefully wounded).   This is a good video regardless of my take on that, and I'm not knocking you...I just wanted to get that off my chest, I guess. Still obviously agree the lower class and the black, hispanic and asian trans are statistically more likely to be targeted. (PS, that tiffany glass lamp is beautiful. I want it)"

"Yknow, as a trans girl  I honestly call myself a trap"
"Maybe you mistook a stare of visceral desire for an icy one? Maybe he realized how much creepier you might find it if he asked if you would invite him back there. I think the purpose of trapping is to make all men 'count as gay' until one day it's just generally agreed upon by all men that it can't be that every guy is gay and the opinion is abolished."

"My idea of traps when it comes to an actual serious problem is when a cross-dresser and or transvestite does not tell their partner of the same biological sex of what they actually are that is deceptive that is wrong now in the past you wouldn't tell this to somebody up front out of fear of being rejected by multiple multiple people because they're just not into that which I really think you should or else you're going to get your ass beat by someone who isn't into that and it's not because they're homophobic or at least to an extent it's the thought of being completely lied to and violate it and it doesn't give a good name to those of the LGBT who are trying to move past the one thing that is holding them back by actual traps for being these devious perverts who don't care about their partners we have places on the internet where you can find somebody of your interest and taste and who share the same interests when it comes to sexuality such as dating sites for LGBT I'm not going to say Q because queer is not a sexuality queer is often vague and just an oddity anybody can be queer due to their personality and how they act but they say it's a sexuality that leaves open a huge can of worms you do not want to open because queer can mean you're sexually attracted to inanimate objects or non-consensual animals I'm not going further down the list but when people say that they're sexuality is queer they mostly mean how they View their gender which makes no f****** sense when you look at the definition so to recap biologically speaking traps are gay whether you're a man or woman going after the same biological sex and when referring to traps as a serious matter it's because of deception I don't want anybody getting hurt but I can see if a straight person gets upset for being lied to and possibly get violent not saying that's right and they should probably go to jail if they hurt you but I understand why and to a point I don't blame them you need to be honest and secondly queer is not a sexuality nor gender"

I pointed out before in one of your videos why white people didnt understand why people of color overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 for example. Im surprised as someone who seemed to understand intersectionality would blow off issues important to cisgendered women, particularly over their biology. Access to contraception, OBGYN doctors, cancer screenings, the economic and healthcare issues with abortion rights, Planned Parenthood and forced pregnancies. Sad that I consider myself an LGBT ally and support your social and legal rights -  things I will never have to deal with, such as housing discrimination due to gender identity -  but now know that a large part of the transcommunity has a slur just for the exact issues I care about for my own health, safety and social progression."

"Hey, thanks for your videos on this sort of thing. I just discovered your channel a few days ago, but I'm finding it very educational on the struggles of trans people. I'm a bisexual cis woman, so while I've defended trans people and their identities, hearing about what people experience in day to day life as being trans is fascinating and incredibly valuable.   The term 'trap' has bothered me ever since I heard it. I first came across terms like 'trap,' 'ladyboy,' and 'futa/futanari' while roleplaying in online games and seeing other people discussing their preferences. 'Trap' has always seemed incredibly dehumanizing and seemed like a defensive term used for 'but I'm not gay!' when discussing women with penises, so having a whole video on this from the perspective of a trans women is wonderful, both in explaining what I've struggled to articulate as a cis woman for years and opening my eyes on aspects of it I never considered.   I would like to ask - what are your thoughts on 'futanari'? I've heard from some trans women that futanari are not a real thing, just something made up for the purposes of fetish material. Since so few of the futanari characters I've seen are played as anything but 'lol tits AND a dick wanna fuk bby?', I really don't know what to think of the concept in general besides being uncomfortable because I don't want trans people feeling like they're being reduced to nothing but a fetish."

"Another good video. I think 'are traps gay?' is just a joke though, your concern about murdered trans women largely comes from the groups in society with incredibly high murder rates anyway (look up London's knife killings - the victims & perps are almost exclusively of this same societal group). My good tranny friend (and yes he is a tranny - dresses up for sex) is called a Penis Fly Trap with great relish. Sometimes the context of the phrase and not just the context of the penis matters, 'are traps gay?' is not something that needs scoured from humanity. I would go so far to say that a light hearted attitude towards it may even progress things, because if there is one thing which makes you want to fight someone it's when they tell you what you can and cannot say (and it is the postmodern neo-Marxists who have spent so long telling everyone 'do what you want' but now they are the orthodoxy round on us and start instituiting the rules - you can take the church out of the town but cannot take the dogmatic desire out of its people).  You can take a le se faire attitude toward sex and sexuality but you need to take that attitude towards speech too, but I do appreciate your points, I personally was never very happy with 'that's so gay' because 'gay' is a stand in for 'shit' but you definitely also need to allow for some offensive jokes in people's lives (and them being offensive matters - people need to feel they are being transgressive every now and then)."

Why is it that the same guys who drew cartoon dicks everywhere would be the same guys who'd look at me with disgust if I were flirting with them? -If I knew how to flirt- . During my later teenage years, I thought the idea behind it all was to make other men insecure about their sexuality. (Which was probably definitely true for the guy who tapped my ass but digression, digression.) And to harass women, I realize now. I suppose considering that men are generally insecure about and plagued by (if they overthink it, like I do, probably even otherwise) their sexuality, no matter the orientation, that theory still holds some water. But the inherent disgust some seem to display towards gay men is also a factor that needs considering.  -Speaking of water though, I hope Spencer and his loyal pets swallow a disproportionate amount of it-"

"Hey Natalie. I don't normally make topic requests, or post comments in general, but (as you have mentioned it in a few videos including this one) I would be interested to know your take on Poly (amory/fidelity, ethical non-monogamy) and its basis as an alternative to serial monogamy/infidelity. Though it's not exactly as important a topic as what you normally cover, it's something my partner and I identify strongly with but have trouble exploring because of how deeply ingrained monogamy is in society and how afraid we are of looking like we're 'cheating' to those around us.   P.S. Love your videos"
"My only critique is the implication that trans people need to be on hormones to be perceived as a certain gender. I‚Äôve known plenty of trans women who were passing and not on hornones and the same goes for trans men. Being on hormones didn‚Äôt stop them from being feminine and masculine respectively and it didn‚Äôt stop me from finding them attractive as their gender. I mean sexuality isn‚Äôt all about senses, it‚Äôs also about perception. I‚Äôve had transphobic moments when my gf was misgendered where I forced myself to see ‚Äúthe man‚Äù in her. But it also goes both ways. Sometimes you meet someone who isn‚Äôt passing but they come out to you and suddenly you see it. I think the main thing is sexuality really doesn‚Äôt matter. People shouldn‚Äôt have to prove they are (gender) enough to justify other people being attracted to them. Hormones are good for some but not for others either from choice or inability to access them."
"I think this is one of the best videos you have ever made. I was literally talking about the transphobic notion of 'traps' the other day and now I have a 45-minute, incredibly informative video to direct people to, which manages to untangle and refute all the bullshit of the stupid meme."

"As a straight guy, I 100% agree with pretty much everything you said, as those are the same conclusions I've reached myself by pondering those questions, but here's where I disagree with your overall point: I had to ponder those questions first. So had you. And the reason I pondered these questions is the same reason you made this video. We both came accross the quintessential question: are traps gay?  See, I understand when you say that the question is offensive, and I agree it's the wrong question to ask in the first place, but the overall knowledge and understanding of the human society is what it is. The average straight Joe is likely to never even consider all those questions. The question of japanese drawings' influence on his sexuality is the one major entry point he has towards this whole reasoning. And I do feel it's a reasoning most, if not all, people need to ponder at some point in their lives.  It's a case of, on one hand it's insulting, on the other hand it leads to a discussion that needs to happen. So here's what I propose: fight fire with fire. Straight guys insulting you by calling you traps? Well call them the same when THEY are being traps. Because straight men can be traps. You described it yourself: you're hanging out in a social environment, when suddenly some guy walks up to you and starts flirting with you. He's handsome, he's charming, you open up to him and tell him your a trans, and next thing you know you're flat on the table, your nose is broken and one of your teeth has fallen off... THAT is a freaking death trap you just unknowingly walked into.  So go ahead, call these type of guys traps. It'll feel cathartic, and these guys need to be made aware of how deceptive they themselves can be."
"Was the ‚Äúis good actually‚Äù phrasing a reference to ‚ÄúSome more news‚Äù with Cody Johnson. It seems like a tenuous link, but I noticed he uses that expression a lot, and you seem like you‚Äôd enjoy his YouTube stuff. Also, as per usual, I love the video. I got a friend into watching you recently as he was looking to find the right words for why Jordan Peterson was a charlatan but couldn‚Äôt be dealing with all the academic jargon that deliberately masks the issues"
"The right answer is that it doesn't matter, but if contra points said no then the answer is yes."
"It's not actually that complex - as you eventually get to.  If you're going to fuck someone with the same genitals that you have, then you're engaging in gay sex - regardless of the genitals concerned.  Everything else is social conditioning and posturing.   Bottom line, you know who / what you're willing / wanting to have sex with and the gritty details nobody's concern other than yours and the owner / wearer of the genitals concerned.   The rest is social politics and nothing to do with sex at all.  (edit) Concerning the 'trap' aspect - if there's deception involved in getting someone to fuck you, then yes, you're a trap. Is this 'gay?' See above."
"You always have the most amazing clothes *swoon"
"Hi ContraPoints, I like the vid but in the same way you consider yourself qualified to talk about white trans problems rather than intersectional, let me give my two cents as an anime idiot (although one that does not understand 'trap' to  apply to trans people).  You mentioned people who refuse to stop misusing the word trap as feeling above trans people. While such people surely exist, I do not think it is the most charitable or parcimonious or even accurate depiction. I think they believe themselves above censorship, valuing their right to say offensive stuff about other people's right not to be offended. I am doubtful that they care if the ones they offend are trans or gay or black or whatever. It is, then, the difference between a dickhead and a transphobe. Which still sucks, mind you, but not on the same level and not for the same reason."
"So fabulous. So accurate. Such a well-supported argument. I must dance with serious joy at this exquisite complexity. But first, my forehead bows to the floor in stunned awe. Frikkin 21st century brilliance. Holy crap wow.  *Ahem.* More, please."
"If there's no concept of manhood or womanhood which is universally recognised then: what is being trans?  If you can have feminine men and masculine women, then Feminity and masculinity are not part of your gender identity. So what does one use to define their own gender? It's clear very important to a lot of people.  I'm really looking for an honest answer here, but I understand that maybe the answer doesn't matter"
"Thank you for taking time to thoroughly explain it instead of just yelling that it's wrong. When I found out the word was offensive, yeah, I stopped using it, but I really wanted to know WHY. The twitter call out culture 100% did not help that, and it just became an unknown 'no no' until this.  Now I get it and I can remove it from my vocabulary because I KNOW instead of it being just hip/pc/etc."

"You guys are confused and I don't mean trans, I mean guys. Guys are confused by considering any of this as a possibility. When I was a teen I thought I might be gay cause I had a dream I was making out with my best guy friend. I later realized I wasn't gay, I was just lonely. There was this girl I really liked back then but I couldn't bring myself to ask her out. It was just loneliness. I didn't shy away from the thought that I might be gay and I'm glad I didn't cause that lack of fear taught me about myself and who I was. People who have different desires than me, don't trouble me one bit.  Not sure I would be into a trans woman but I wouldn't run from it or be scared or freaked. I would roll with it and see where it went. As I did when I was young, how you feel will show you the way.  I remember I was waiting for a bus and a guy asked if I wanted a blow job. I said, no but thanks... Yes, I actually said that. I kind of thought it was nice of him to ask. After he left, I smiled and laughed a little to myself. I had a few gay friends when I was younger and I guess that's why I wasn't freaked,.  It's why I'm glad you have your show dear. This stuff really helps some people who know nothing about LGBTQIAPK that there is nothing to worry about. You're pretty great.

"i am an NSFW artist who indulges in what is called futanari content, which is effectively the equivalent of 'shemale' content with the exception that the subjects are not trans and are a completely fictional gender. in the nsfw art community, we dont regard trans individuals as traps because we only see the word 'trap' as applying to very-passing crossdressers whether it be real or fictional. tbh whenever i would look up the actual definition of 'trap,' it always bothered me to see that it applied to trans women. i never considered tags like 'trap' or 'futa' as slurs because i, and most if not all artists in my community, only use it in a pornographic context, which i believe should be harmless. i know perspective can be formed off of porn, but that doesnt mean it'll always be a negative one.   so i use those tags in context. if a male character or irl guy crossdresses to deliberately present the illusion of being a girl while maintining cis status, then in a porn sense, i see them as a trap. futa is a very specific tag that denotes fictional biology for fictional characters, so i would never use it in context of a trans character or person, unless the person likes that sort of thing(few do).  tbh, porn has defined much of my life, unfortunately. but i like to think that i have an open mind. i may indulge in both futanari and Tgirl content to satisfy the dickgirl fantasy, but i can easily recognize that trans people are people like me. its no different than recognizing that gay people are people, which isnt hard at all.  however, the mental barrier that is biology isnt something easily shattered for most cis people. but that barrier should only be reduced to a matter of preference, not whether or not your sexuality is threatened to such an extent that you think you should straight up murder a human being. i can understand being a little upset over being 'tricked,' because thats just something thats gonna matter to the majority because, yknow, the mental barrier that is biology. but being compelled to kill a human being for that? thats inhuman. and i cannot understand how a person would be compelled to harm another person in any way just for being 'tricked.'  there were a couple things i didnt agree with, but i believe the purpose of the video is to get cis people to be more open-minded. i believe it does that job decently enough.  though i wish it addressed the whole  'if you dont have sex with me, you're a bigot' mentality that are plaguing some corners of the internet, especially twitter and tumblr. the message, as i interpreted was 'be more open-minded.' couldve gotten extra points for saying 'you can still have your preferences while being open-minded'"

"It's ok fit a woman to be attracted to trans women and gay feminine men only? and why that may happen?"
"God bless you."
"So, when are we getting an hour long dissertation on all possible combinations of gender and genital?"
"In the shemale porn targeted at straight men it is typically not a feminine penis, as described in this video, that is imagined, depicted and desired. Typically it's an absurdly virile one that the lady in question brandishes with all the actions described as 'masculine usage' in this video.  So if the 'penis question' comes down to context, usage and physiology, then that's two out of three that don't make it less gay and if anything make it more. Can it be any wonder then that straight men find this question not as easily answered?"
"TLDR; yes"
"The british accent was on point. The way you said 'after' made me almost spill my tea."
"i'd definitely find the term trap being used to describe a trans women in real life offensive, but to me the word trap is just something limited to the anime sphere, so it's not intrinsically problematic. this could also be a sample bias based off of the group of ppl that i hang out with online (mostly weebs) as i don't know how or what other guys outside of the net think of when they hear/see the word trap, but to me it just means 2D boys that dress & look like girls, and that adding the label transgender to them is just tacking on real world complexities to something simple that's not supposed to really mean anything. they're sort of just meant to be a meme and rile up the audience a bit, not be reflections of actual trans girls in real life."

"cross dresser = male or female appears to be the opposite gender to various degrees of integrity, done on purpose e.g. Sister from Arakawa Under the bridge   reverse trap/trap  = person who appears to be the opposite gender but has no modifications done, personality traditionally correlates with opposite gender, may not be done on purpose, e.g. Hideyoshi from Baka to test newhalf//trans person = medically transitioning to opposite gender , done on purpose e.g. Contrapoints  futanari = a fictional mixed gender referring to both genitals present, naturally occurring e.g. everything incase draws   none of these terms equal each other but you're using them interchangeably, when people talk about traps they're talking about feminine men usually."

As a man myself, I feel outcasted from the rest of my gender even though I'm straight and have none of the qualities that most men do. Still, the openness and softness I carry emotionally allows me to enjoy stuff like this because I'm not afraid to hear something different."
"Traps are gay lel. I needed to reaffirm my superiority over you, just to be sure you couldn't tell me what words to say.  Real talk though, great video.

"But, I wanna be a queen?!"
"Very thought provoking video I loved it. I must say I never thought of trans people as traps and the people I talk to neither. What I think of as 'traps' are A: the steotypical trap in anime/manga and B: a crossdresser that only identifies as a man (or vise versa gender switched)  For example I had a conversation yesterday where someone talked about a 'trap' and he said 'x is very attracted to this trap. Actually I don't know if he is a trans or not now but I'm very sure he identifies as a male.'  So at least people I know and myself included see it that way. It's about what you talked about that you are not a facade, when the make up comes off you're not suddenly a male. So argumenting from that point of view you and people like you would never be considered traps (or should. Because apparently people do call trans people traps which is obviously wrong imo)  So yeah if I had to answer if it's gay to be interested into traps as a straight man. Then I think it's heavily contextual. If you know a guy that identifies as a male and then he crossdresses and you're attracted to him crossdressing that's not gay. But if he 'turns back into a man' and you are 100% attracted to that version of him and his male energy then that might mean you're gay.  But you are right when saying that this question in itself isn't sth we should put so much focus on because it is implying that being gay is wrong. Which is, as we all know, bullshit."
"I know you already made a TERF video, but I hope some day you elaborate on the issue of transphobia in the lesbian community, cause as am immigrant (cis) lesbian, the feeling that no community is safe is one of the most negative aspects in my life, and I'm honestly horrified by the idea that we make trans wlw feel that way. The implication you made in this video that cis lesbians are worse than straight cis men makes me feel unspeakably awful about the lesbian community..."

"[constructive criticism]  As someone who is bi, and has been with trans people before, there is something inherently homosexual about it, HOWEVER people's sexual preferences can be changed, and people regularly change their tastes in attraction. It is still important to discuss this matter, as for many it helps them to explore the less than heterosexual side of themselves, allowing for further acceptance of trans people into society.  The problem isn't masculinity inherently, but rather projected insecurity, I've personally witnessed hetro women getting worked up on the idea that I also screw dudes, we should aim to kill off all assholes with mannered reasonability, not straw-manning people like this^^^^. Masculinity is a great thing to be on the receiving end of, and to be, or simply to witness in its positive aspects, if you hate masculinity or femininity then it says more about your insecurities than the personality type, same could be said for hatred of gays.  ps. TELL THEM YOU HAVE A DICK OR VAG IF ITS NOT OBVIOUS! you should give your sex partner a pleasurable surprise, not a bewildered surprise. yes it sucks to get rejected, but if you are basing your identity and self-esteem on someone else wanting to fuck you or not...that's dumb... don't do that... stop it... shut up your dumb brain"

"I have to start by saying thank you.  I allowed myself to become a bigot over some negative experiences with two trans women who were involved in a feminist bookstore I worked at in my past (these lovely ladies informed me what is and isn't feminine and  it turns out being submissive and letting men lead is feminine; also the confederacy wasn't about slavery which is unrelated but I just want to illustrate how much these two ladies sucked).  I really let this limited interaction determine my view of trans people in general which was super STUPID of me.  Looking back I am ashamed I used these two individuals as an excuse to be so bigoted.  Thank you so much for being you and sharing yourself with us.  If you've knocked sense into me I'm sure you've knocked sense into others.  Keep up the great work!"
"Very good points but is it homophobic to be attracted to a trans. Women until the fact is known? Bc I don't feel it is wrong to not want to be in relationship with someone because they aren't born a woman and they aren't having sex with a true vagina. Of course it's not gay to be attracted and have sex and relationships with a trans woman. But having a preference isn't transphobic, it's just that... a preference, like being attracted to athletic women or big women. And it's not just facing judgement at home, there are videos of trans women outing there ex boyfriends to there bosses and getting them fired which most of the guys seemed to deserve it, but men have to take things like that into account as well. Some trans women are perfectly ok acting feminine until they get mad and want to shame the guy, which seems messed up to me."

"Great video and thank you for the hard work assembling it!  There is an aspect of sexual gender psychology that I wish you had touched upon. It is the perception of self when being on the receptive end of sexual desire. I'm shooting from the hip here, but here are two cents (and two articles):  There is a pathology to straight sexual desire in straight men, it prioritises a single active stance: ONLY I radiate desire + straight women are ONLY absorbing subjects + My sexual desire is successful only when a certain capitulation to me has occurred, and its due to my sexual precedence. Many times the straight masculine state of being sexually desired has only one favourable condition - A woman desires my (subjective) desires towards her, I have created a new condition in her reality and she desires the position of the receiver, she is an instrument that asks to be played.  Conservative Straight men sexual desire is not well trained in containing an others radiating sexual desire, it is not nourished or suited to understand external sexual primacy that makes one responsive."
"As you've mentioned in the piece above, A man being nipple touched by his woman sexual partner might be perceived as gay by some. In my opinion it is due to an instrumentation reversal - 'It's is not only my desire that plays an external sexual entity but the external sexual entity might desire to play me'"
"The above is complicated even further by another theoretical axiom that, in my mind, most people share - MALES are by default the originators of desire.  In regards to an uninformed courting of trans women, ones position in the sexual order is harshly threatened, not by physical penetration but by cognitive thought. An uninformed straight man who fancies a trans girl due to all the 'right' visual and communicative ques will find himself in a state of terrible dissonance when fully informed. Finding out that the person you've sexually noticed is a fellow sexual originator puts one at the POTENTIAL risk of being ONLY on a receiving end of compliments and sensation, stripped of the spontaneous sexual privilege and 'brought down' to the level of an object. The POTENTIAL for sexual reception is even worse then sexual reception itself as it obliterates any possibility for 'authentic' capitulation by the other party.  Where the measured response to this dissonance could be solidarity with a potential sexual originator and a polite cancellation of the exchange, some straight men are conceptually unaware of the option for solidarity with the desire towards themselves and will react with an intense will to nullify any potential of this occurrence. In a nutshell - The 'TRAP' is the violent revelation act of sexual scope that a conservative thought pattern might find challenging.   Hope I made sense, English isn't my native language.

"Bless you ContraPoints <3"
"Omg 21:47 Tatiana same parts."
"Dude I was fully with u and everything ur channel represents till u labelled count Dankula a hate crime convict- if u can‚Äôt see the complexities (by which 8 really mean the simplicity of his innocence)  involved in that whole scandal then how am I meant to use u as the all knowing absolute source of all my opinions I look for in a you tuber"
"13:43 Emperor have mercy, she turned into an half-daemonette."
"It's reasonable to say that being attracted to pussy (I mean an actual one, not a gaping wound that ejects puss and blood; I know... semantics) is a necessary but not sufficient condition to be considered a straight man, but I also don't care if dudes, who consider themselves straight, want to date chicks with dicks. I don't want to date a trans person, if that makes me a transphobe, I'm fine with that. Needless to say, my preference for non-trans women doesn't justify acts of violence against trans people."
"Your lamp looks like Ickis from Aaahh!!! Real Monsters."
"When 'Are traps gay' forbidden footage started playing, I thought, yeah, that's about the right closer. I shouldn't have looked at the seeker bar."

"Congrats Natalie, you succesfully highjacked the conversation bus. You're now the first result on google.  You are a beacon of hope in this post-truth world where all the facade of civility got abandoned and lies and fabricated outrage are on their way to destroy the planet itself. The work you are doing is epochal, because you are showing us how we can go back to sanity where  empathy, facts, reason, nuance, context and civilized discourse can prevail."
"So tl;dr it turns out that human sexuality is a vastly more complicated spectrum than 'BUT DICKS ARE GAY THO'   I mean I find animoos sexy and not real people so don't use me as an example."

"Oh dear God, I remember when I managed to convince my friend to be homophobic. I stopped, but he is still going strong, and I can't convince him back.  I wouldn't put it past him to be hostile to trans women, even white/non-trans in the ways you describe..... and he's far less bigotted than most people here in Serbia.  So yeah, I would not be so sure of my safety if I were you Contra. Stay safe.  P.S. Your make up artistry is genius"
"I think it's amusing that Matt Colville is probably watching/will watch this"
"All this put me in mind of a very dear friend. He had a build that could only be described as willowy, a very fey voice, he was that shade of handsome that's maybe half an inch away from being pretty...He got called gay a LOT. So one day, he thought, okay, so many people say this, maybe I am. He took a guy home. He blew the guy. Didn't particularly care for it. And he was comfortable enough with himself to take what he'd learned and be straight. I loved him for so many other reasons, but that was a big one--he was totally, completely, comfortable in his own skin--as a bishy blond boyish straight. It's a big world and it takes all kinds, but that's the big lesson we both took from that--men need to be more comfortable being who they are and less hung up on what society thinks they should be."

"also for some one who wants people who to do what ever makes them feel good(sexually) you really seem like some one who doesnt like people to enjoy themselves(intellectually) from the whole you can't have the debate about 'are traps gay' cuz it offends people or possibly promotes ideas you disagree with. God dammit Contra Points you were our only hope to unite the world not divide it. P.S Free for any open discussion about anything i've said or was said in the video :)"
"hey just fyi if you want to paint Milo Yianopolous, count dankula, Jordan Peterson, and Ben Shapiro as alt or far right, you are, in their eyes the alt left tbh. P.S Free for any open discussion about anything i've said or was said in the video :)"
"This may be one of the most divisive, anti man, self centered videos i have ever seen. Really funny person but my god there are so many things wrong with the arguments and so many principles that are dangerous that it really made me feel that Transgender people will just never be accepted. The invasion of political ideology and generalizations made about men, women, and the opposing political ideas were so gross and dishonest i refuse to believe this video had any intention of convincing anyone who doesn't already agree with her. Like i feel really really bad about videos like this that really do seem like the things that drive libtards further left and conservitards further right. God dammit even after sitting here typing this a few minutes after this video ended im just so idk what to call it, ashamed? disappointed? upset? disheartened by this video and it's attempt to make people accepting of other people who are different than them without understanding the other side and lack of anything convincing other than personal ideas and opinions with vague reference to outside information and science. It is a true shame this is the first time i've watched a Contra Point video and it was this bad. Well if you start 2019 at the bottom you can only go up from here. peace P.S Free for any open discussion about anything i've said or was said in the video :)"
"I've been watching this channel for a little while now and there's definitely some very insightful commentary to be found here.  However that small descriptor on Count Dankula wasn't very honest nor nessesary. Small quips like that butcher nuance, and I really would like people stop inserting them into serious videos."

"If vaginas suck... isn't that kind of a twofer?"
"Oh you made my day so much better. Love ya girl, keep doing your thing"
"welp this video was useless, idk if she doesn't know English or what but 'are traps gay?' has two literal meanings and only one was discussed. The only question she tried to answer was 'Is it gay to have sex with or be in a relationship with a Trap?' didn't even touch the absolute literal question 'Are people who are Traps gay?' and i feel i have wasted 44min because i was here for the second one. also btw at least in every discussion that i have had of 'are traps gay' its in the context of a cross dresser so already seems you might be projecting or dont understand the discussion. P.S Free for any open discussion about anything i've said or was said in the video :)"
"ok never comment on on this channel before, but...I live in a red state as a former factory worker now at work in the kitchen of the local LGBTQ bar. and wow is life confusing right now."
"woo hoo it ticked your bell for the first time ..."
"buuut trans people are gay and yeah if you're dating a trans person you're gay no matter what but it's ok. I'm not disagreeing that trans women aren't women but that yeah there is an inherant difference between those born female and trans females but it makes them no less of a woman just a different kind and thats OK. Like this wouldn't even matter if dudes weren't so fucking hung up on NOT being gay in anyway. It's like when you hear people talk about how women's sexuality being on a gray scale honestly at this point every ones sexuality is probably like that to a degree even if its small. SO WHO TF CARES?! Just don't kill people over your insecurities.But the main argument of the video I understand how the traps bs is harmful in the first place but it wouldn't be called that if men didn't see doing a act thats 'considered gay' as a bad thing ."
"As a women I have had some scary experiences with men who was nice to me before I told him I was a ' christian and I practice abstinence' and I would explain. Some guys can be so fucking evil as a born women I can 100% understand the way tran women are beaten and raped and killed. Some men are just evil as fuck. Always be safe. Some men just prey on women. This takes me back to my single days 1996-2014. Scary! Thankfully happily married."
"Here's an idea to think about? - most medicines are tested on men. This is I think because the fluctuating hormone levels of women make drug trials on women more difficult to interpret the results - basically for whatever reason it is more difficult than trails on men. The trouble is that medication for women is just adjusted for body weight compared to a man a lot of the time - meaning toxicity is a real danger as hormone difference aren't taken into account...   So, trans women tend to have less fluctuating hormone levels - why not test drugs for women on trans women if that would be easier?"
"Why does everyone in left leaning comments sections feel the need to prefix their arguement with what sexuality race etc they are, if you think race and sexualitys are equal you shouldn‚Äôt need to use it to prop up your arguments."

"This is a comment for all of you people who (1) don't know who Mark Meechan is, or (2) are saying 'ma boi Dank did nothing wrong, he made a JOOOOOOOOOOKE.'  A. It was a joke or it was a hate crime. It was neither, Meechan was charged under the Communications Act 2003 (a contentious law in the UK) primarily for saying 'gas the Jews' while giggling. Although to put it this way utterly removes the context of the 'piece' and as Meechan himself is so keen to point out, context matters. The dog, which the press focused on for reasons of entertainment before truthful reporting, is unimportant in the final legal decision. Otherwise it would have been a charge about abuse of animals or similar. Also, despite being fined, Meechan has yet to pay the fine and often states that he will never pay the fine and that he should be jailed. Something the Scottish Police have yet to do.  B. It's about Freedom of Speech. Shouldn't we all have the right to use racial slurs as casually as any other word at any time and in any situation? If you think 'no' then uh-oh you're anti-free-speech! However, if like Meechan you believe that context is important then you will know that societal conventions (not an actual law) apply limits on what we say and do in various situations we encounter in life, and that baiting the Scottish Police to arrest you might actually be a bad idea.  C. The Boy who cried Nazi. A joke is a joke is a joke, except when it isn't. I hope that's clear. Also, as much as I dislike UKIP and especially fellows Scots who would join such a political party, they are not Neo-Nazis. However, the EDL are, and Tommy (a pal of Meechans) is the former leader of the EDL and now a member (sorry, special advisor) of the UKIPs. Confusing ain't it? How do we know who the bad guys are, if they won't tell us? I suppose we'll just have to judge them by their words and deeds. Thus, is Meechan an Nazi? No. Is Meechan a prick? Yes. Is being a prick a crime? No.   Your Honour, I rest my case."
"Are we really merging real world issues with this fucking meme of anime jargon? Smh."
"I was assuming traps was referring to transvetites/drag and not transgender people. In which cases traps can actually be gay. Or not but if the male is trying to hit men as discuised as women, the I would assume they're gay. I doubt this is very common or happens at all outside of fiction.  Being attracted to them is certainly not 'gay' though. As said you're definitely being filthy heterosexual breeder."
"You are my hero."
"Trans or not, doesn't matter to me, you are gorgeous and intelligent.  The murder intersection of gender class and race... that is deep and disturbing shit and while you aren't of that perfect combination of death, I still think it is important to voice your perspective.  Personally, it is hard to see some of these issues as a white man in America.  I haven't seen the conversation framed so well before.  Thank you for the video."

"Y‚Äôknow, I disagree. Youre trying to make the argument that being attracted to and possibly having sex with trans women is the same as doing those things with cis-women. But its not somehow. Its not gay to have sex with trans women but its not straight. it exists in some strange gray area, where many men are more than willing to travel.   I‚Äôll be honest. Youre attractive. If you were into me I might be tempted to see where it would go. afterall, its femininity that I find attractive and trans women are nothing if not feminine. But....  But,"

"It's a wonderful day whenever Natalie makes a new video. I used to be one of those hardcore anti SJW types but your vids really broke that loop for me. After seeing one of your vids (don't remember which one) constantly pop up, I gave it a watch. Then I kept binge watching more and more.  You're doing great, keep up the good work."
"There's also 'trap music' which is cool now in the mainstream, but originated from the ghettos - and regards either 'poverty traps' or getting 'taken out' in a drug deal (like at the beginning of the film 'Carlito's Way'). But then, y'know, galling inequality is somehow sexy in the USA?"
"'Let's not get cocky.' Just here to appreciate a good pun."
"Let me just say a couple of things here. Natalie, you have made me feel very good about myself just now...er for the uh...4th or 5th time...aye madame, those saucy words that come out of your mouth have once again reinvigorated my sense of self worth. Yes, that and nothing more...he said fooling nobody. But! But the fact that I am unashamed of my attraction you, this biologic woman, makes me entirely as manly as often times I don't feel as a born cursed hermaphrodite. If it takes a man to embrace himself unabashedly and love that which he loves, then a man I indeed am. Thank you for the bolster miss Wynn. Have a satisfying day."
"Wait is that a blunt in the intro lol? You get down like that??"
"1) I'm a straight white guy (I'm not sure what cis means, and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask) 2) This was my first ContraPoints video 3) I am now subscribed  This was eye opening and entertaining... well done Natalie!"
"I like your videos but why do you have to bring the Count into this? Calling him a hate crime convict shows that you aren't informed about his situation. Again, I agree with your points but this just bugged me."
"Yes. And extremely immoral"

"The statement has always been very dumb to me. You never find a person sexually attractive based on their genitals, sexual attraction has always been about physical characteristics. Do you like muscles or curves? Do you want your legs smooth or hairy? Or do you perhaps find nothing attractive? Maybe we gotta stop questioning the nature of sexuality and simply accept that we like what we like even if we don't fully understand why."
"I love all the different character costumes and how elaborate they get, but the 'natalie wynn' look in this vid was the best imo"
"Personally- as a cis hetero woman- I don't know if I would like being sexual with a trans man. I know I could have a romantic relationship cuz I love any masculine man. But for me... I really love dicks. I love A LOT about dicks. I NEED a dick with a sexual partner. I don't know if a masculine clit would cut it for me- its not the size that matters (as long as its 4' and up im good) but just that its not functioning the same as a dick. I don't wanna get too graphic so I'll stop my explaining there."

"for me if your using the 'are traps gay' as a meme or in the context of anime, i'm cool with it, but i dont like the idea of calling real trans people 'traps', that just rubs me the wrong way. but anime isnrt real, its animated drawings at the end of the day. Calling a feminine male character from an anime a trap is cool, but a real life trans woman? nope"
"soooooo, what about masculine vagina?"
"üôå"
"I think the term Post-modern Neo-Marxist does have a contextual validity. As far as I've been able to interpret, it combines moral relativism and a proclivity to identity politics, which obviously means assigning people to groups or stereotypes based on gender, race, socio-economic status, or perceived class and making value judgements about individuals based on this."

"'a real man is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices control his life' So real men are stoics? Can't really argue with that.  On another (similar) note I find it strange that people will get so worked up about if it is gay for a man to be attracted to a trans-women but no one really (that i have seen) question if the same is true for a women going out with a transman. Actually trans-men seem to largely get ignored when ever the trans topic comes up."

These videos ought to stand the test of time and I hope they are perceived as, if not more, valid as the long form essay has been for centuries."
"I‚Äôve always interpreted the question this way: ‚Äùif traps are men who crossdress as women when they try to pick up other men, are they gay even though they present as women in that specific context?‚Äù And perhaps also ‚Äùare the men who sleep with crossdressers (who intentionally hide the fact that they are just crossdressing as women) gay for sleeping with a person who presents as a woman but identifies as a man?‚Äù Interesting to hear your take on it anyways."

"I called her big red, I don't know what or where, but she was nice to me and I liked her.  My wife liked her too. What really pissed me off was that she/he whatever was jumped by three horny boys who didn't give a damn and she defended herself with a blade.  She went to jail which really bothered me ... In Ohio if three or more people attack you you have the right to use to lethal force.  Big Red was jumped by three me and she defended herself with a blade and she went to prison.

"Did you just call Count Dankula a 'hate crime convict?' That didn't sound like a joke.  Anyway, when using the word trap, I've never thought of a transsexual person, only a guy who likes cross-dressing which happens a lot with my type. I'm bi and my type when it comes to boys is definitely the 'pretty boy' and girly aesthetics. In fact, when I think of it, trap is just not an adjective that even applies to women in general."
"Another great video!!!  I learned a ton, I really appreciate how you share your perspectives :)"
"One major factor that leads to transwomen of color being killed more is the rampant homophobia and toxic masculinity in poorer communities. And, the reality is, there's more toxic masculinity among men of color in these communities. The only times I'm ever threatened for who I am is by minority men in primarily black and brown neighborhoods. Nearly had a gang of men attack us in a train station! You can yell at me from your white middle class suburb but that's the reality you need to face."
"Natalie, your content has genuinely inspired me a ton. I have a ‚Äúmanly‚Äù side, and a flamboyant side I don‚Äôt show anyone, and I think I‚Äôm going to start being more confortable about both of them. And going through the rest of your content really inspires me to do YouTube too. I used to be an ‚Äúedge-lord‚Äù right wing kind of guy, so I hope to appeal to that crowd and show them the other side of the curtain. Anyways, I‚Äôm glad I found your channel, because I really think it‚Äôll make me a better person. Or a post-modern neo-marxist hellbent on cucking the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù."

"Natalie, you walked into the room at 2:40 and my heart stopped. That outfit is KILLER on you.  I loved this video. I have laughed at your take on 'are traps gay' ever since Justine dropped it at the beginning of the Tiffany Tumbles video, another favorite of mine. I always appreciate these deep dives into issues that are tangential to my own life struggles. I don't have to live my life as a transwoman, but I have some of them in my life, and I always want to know more about how I can be the best friend/potential partner I can possibly be to them."
"You know what would be a interesting topic to hear you talk about?  Dysphoria.  But in relation to transness (?) and like whether or not one should have dysphoria to be trans (or what do we constitute as dysphoria.)  Like what /is/ gender dysphoria.  Where do we draw a line.  Are people who claim to be 'non-dysphoric' actually dysphoric but not in ways doctors expect?  Exactly how dysphoric does someone have to be.  Another thing is like the fact that I've talked to people who are non-dysphoric or their dysphoria doesn't impact them and they seem fine.  I've heard of people who say they are non-dysphoric technically who transition and are happy.    Or like sometimes I know dysphoria might just come later.  Like what makes a person trans or not trans.    And honestly trans topics are kind of hard to talk about science wise because I've been learning the science.......isn't really there.  There aren't enough studies to really make serious conclusions.  I hear the brain IS gendered but also it's NOT gendered but also it's kinda gendered but like not by a lot.  And like no studies involving nonbinary people.  (I have yet to find a single one even exploring the idea.)  No brain studies, no DNA studies, nothing.  What about sex chromosomes of trans people?  Also why is a butch trans lesbian not valid as woman but a butch cis lesbian valid as a woman?  Like what about masculine women?    Cis woman in my life have always had 'masculine' features and I had no clue they were considered masculine until I came into contact with white standards of beauty.  Hell a lot of women here have really deep voices.  Some even sing in tenor/bass parts for music.  And the men can sing really high falsetto notes.  Like?  What the fuck is gender presentation.  I got away from my point but honestly yeah."
"I‚Äôm some type of Bi (Cis White Male) And I like Women and date women but I fantasize about dick. I wouldn‚Äôt date another man i don‚Äôt think or have intercourse with a man but I like giving BJs. When I date a woman however, my definition of what‚Äôs expected in sex is a Vagina. I like vaginal sex. Not having that would be a huge let down IMO. I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to dating a Trans woman but most men I believe who are straight want vaginal sex. They like vagina. I like vagina. I don‚Äôt think its too crazy to think straight men are attracted to, among many other things, a womans‚Äô vagina. There is a spectrum of Queerness obviously and it all depends on thousands of factors. This is just my opinion on the subject."

"QUESTION FOR TRANS-LADIES OUT THERE:  Have any of you seen the 1997 UK film 'Different For Girls' (starring Rupert Graves & Steven Mackintosh)? It's about two childhood friends, one grows up to identify as a hetero male, the other is a trans-woman. Without giving too much away, it's about their reconnection as adults, and their ever-changing relationship with each other (if you haven't seen it, please skip the trailers. They make it seem like 'a wacky gender-bending comedy' because 1997 obviously didn't know how to handle this movie. It's a lot more sensitive than the shitty trailer suggests).  It has been one of my very favorite LGBTQ films for years, I was blown away by it when it first came out.   I still feel it was ahead of its time, but I'm not a trans-woman. I'm asking because I would so dearly love to hear thoughts & perspectives on it from trans-women but reviews are so hard to find as it's not a well-known title.  Generally: What did you think of it? What do you feel it got right, and what do you feel it got wrong? I would love to hear any and all thoughts, even if you hated it.   I know this might be an odd place to ask, and maybe no one will respond, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Thanks in advance for any replies :-)  P.S. There's a copy of it up on YouTube, but it's labeled 'New Version'. I haven't seen this copy, so I don't know if they've changed it from the original cut. I just fear they changed something vital to make it 'more acceptable to transphobes' or something (I hope not, if they changed it, I hope it was to add more & not take away). It's available for Amazon Prime members in the U.S."

"I loved your video and you did great as usual. Cheers, sis! One thing that I also wanted to comment is, as part of the animu community uwu, that 'traps' are not a trans woman. A trap by the anime culture is a biologically man who identifies as a man dresses as a woman and pretends to be a woman to fuck with straight men's minds.  Of course 'normies' or, tbh, stupid men are going to asume that the trap memes are trans women cuz the pp which is totally bullocks. Overall, great video and I hope you have a great day! <3"
"What a great video!  It really makes you think about how sex and gender are viewed, and how we allow other people to impose their 'moral mandates' on us.  I really appreciate how open and honest you are."

"Natalie, I really love your videos, you always make me laugh till my sides hurt while also explaining fantastically whatever issue you focus on.

"Watching all those boys talking about their ethnostate, no wonder you have an alcohol problem. It's probably hard to subject yourself to that much brain cancer."
"Not trolling:   If female and male are social constructs, or subjective, or identity / social role - based, how can you claim anyone is right or wrong about who counts as male and who counts as female? Don't roles change? Which society gets to be right? Aren't they talking about different things? It seems that our subjective, post-modern starting ground allows us to imagine that every individual person has their own thing that they're talking about when they say 'male' or 'female.'  One answer could be: Contrapoints is not making a point about what definitions for male/female are arbitrarily correct, she is trying to point out what we actually DO mean by them, just like she'd tell a friend that they 'dont actually want that' or 'are clearly in love with X,' she can peer into other people's minds and correct their mistakes, reveal what they mean (in this case, by male/female) to themselves, and so on.   We started with a freeing idea - gender subjective, gender is real, its not determined by our genitalia - but ended with something less - that civilization has been generally wrong about one of its most basic (and massively important) social binaries, and it can take smart people with the right experience correcting the meanings of the teeming masses - 'traps aren't gayyyyy' - but i guess that's just life."
"How come people who hate homosexuals actually hate male homosexuals and not lesbians? I actually had a conversation with one of my neighbors (I live in Georgia... So yeah) who said it is an Abomination against God if two men have sex but two women is totally fine and in fact quite 'hot'.  I don't get it."

"I think there's a problem with labels. It's not gay if you're not gay, just like who you like. And for all the people that absolutely need labels to live and do what they want, then make a new label for people that are attracted to pre-op transexuals and be done with it. It's not gay unless a gay person likes them and it's not straight unless a straight person likes them cuz it would likely be for different reasons if you're only talking physical. A straight man who is attracted to a trans woman presenting as a woman is not gay, they are presenting as a woman, not a man. And even the genital thing, there are people who only like a certain kind of vagina, there are people who think a foreskin or certain size is attractive or not, this is no different. So yeah, it's not gay unless you're gay."

"To everyone defending Count Dankula he joined UKIP around June, 2018. That absolves him of any innocence he may have had when he was convicted. You cannot claim that he isn't racist or bigoted when he joins a political organization which espouses those beliefs. I really wanted to believe he was a victim of so called, 'anti-free speech leftism,' but that isn't the case. Also thank you Natalie you're a goddess."
"Man I thought I was super accepting of everyone, but then I realized I still had some shitty ideas about trans folk. Idk this just made me realize a lot more things about trans-ness and it was a really interesting video to watch. Thank you!"

Plus your Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro references had me dying as usual. Something about ragging on those two fools never gets old for me."
"Maybe I'm not seeing this correctly, but it has always been considered normal to be a woman from Cincinnati...the same cannot be said for woman who was born biologically male and still have a penis. That is probably what people mean when they say 'I didn't know you were into that sorta thing'"

"I guess it shows that I really don't get to talk to many trans people since I straight up didn't know that trap was honestly being used as more than a denotation of a particular kind of body in anime, hentai, and porn.  I fucking love this video for too many reasons to list, but just wanted to say that there is another reason that at least some people have to be upset or annoyed by the 'are traps gay' meme/rhetoric/accusations. While While I have no idea how many are actually like me, I personally find that it's at best an obnoxious misrepresentation of my tastes.  If I was into guys I'd fucking call myself bi. If I wanted to suck dick and get ploughed by _[insert hunky actor/celebrity here]_ I'd be absurdly up front about it, to be frank. But I unfortunately find nothing attractive about the male form (I say unfortunately, because pragmatically speaking: shouldn't we all prefer to have 100% of the populace be potentially pretty looking, fuckable life partners for us?). The only time I can find a male's body sexually attractive is if it looks completely like a _not male body._  So the lame insistence that 'traps are gay' by the few who take that dumb meme seriously is just completely counter productive to anything aside from (sometimes willfully) miscategorizing someone's preferences to try and invalidate them in some shallow meaningless way, or just otherwise being a petty dick-nozzle. That's one of the many reasons I fucking love this video xD  This was seriously phenomenal and I'm glad that someone so damn articulate made this video. (And I'm surprised I actually learned some stuff too!)"

"Homosexual acts are not sex with people of the same gender, it's people of the same sex. It's there in the name.

It just means they're doing a good enough job at passing your sexual orientation litmus test."

Also, IDK if it's a faux pas to comment on this, but I just wanted to say your transition has been magnificent in terms of surface-level aspects. You look very beautiful and your voice sounds effeminate without seeming forced. I apologize if it's rude to even mention it, my intention is purely to compliment."

"I'm your typical straight white cis politically moderate man who's not really understood a lot of trans things because a lot of the ideas are so foreign to my existence. This video is really great, and you're very charismatic, funny, and articulate, and this video has made a lot of sense of these issues to me and helped me understand them better. I hope others from backgrounds like mine are willing to give this video a shot and sit through it. Hopefully once they get a couple minutes in that isn't too hard, because this video is unbelievably watchable and the jokes are crazy good."
"As a straight, white, hetero, middle class male, all I will say is nice hair"
"Can you pls get out of my recommendations"
"When I clicked on this video I thought the title was referring to the trapezius muscle and got very confused."
"i did not realize until now that shemale was offensive, makes alot of sense though."
"I don't think I agree with everything the video says, and I still think that there is a level of knowledge concerning a trans-woman's state of being that transitions attraction into 'gayness'. But this video DID remind me that the line I draw is hardly canon, as there are some dudes that draw far more strict lines at nips and wiping. So at the end of the day, the most I can do is augment the question into, 'Is being intimate with a trans-woman, who I did not initially realize was a trans-woman, gay for me?' to which I can only answer a resounding 'Sometimes, it depends.'  But that's a step further along than I might have been otherwise, so that's pretty cool I suppose."
"I liked what was said at the end (while agreeing, or being educated on other points throughout) the insecurity of cis dudes isn't in and of itself bad, its normal.  People react to new experiences in themselves very intensely, and it is scary when you suddenly find out something new about yourself. You always hear, 'Is being attracted to this trans person, or wanting to have sex with this person gay?' and the answer is 'No, because trans men/women are men/women, and fuck you for asking... idiot!' and it's like, yeah I get that answer, but  it doesn't answer the dude's real question. Which of course is: 'I don't like men, or dick, but the idea of THIS dick is getting me going in all kinds of ways, and I don't know what to do with that, what do I do?'  And I like that you can relate to those guys, and you know, give them language to use, and examples of what to expect. While also not giving an inch on those insecurities giving rise to shitty and dangerous behavior, being unacceptable.  I learned a lot from this video. Did not know about the concept of trans changes to the penis, and I doubt a lot of cis men do,  though they make sense when you stop to think about it for a second. (An aside, I think one way to also tell where you might be at gender wise, is how you react to that whole bit about the tuck. That sounded like the single most uncomfortable thing I could do to my genitalia without doing real harm, but maybe that's just me.) I know people transitioning, but not well enough to ask how it changed their genitals. The whole process is still such a mystery to people, it makes sense there are these confused reactions, and misinformation spreading memes about it. I think videos like this, and more education are the real way to open peoples eyes to what the hell is actually going on."
"I don't imagine this comment will be seen but I figured I'd make it for my own sake, at the very least. I am an FTM trans man. That being said, I enjoy crossdressing. I like passing as a woman while identifying as a man. I, to myself, identify as a trap. A very roundabout trap, but that's my identity.  Ideally, I would like to have a penis and male anatomy, but be able to convincingly present myself as female. I personally see it as a type of crossdressing (or in my instance, doublecrossdressing). I suppose it's more of a cultural thing than a more universal identity, but I like the implications of being seen as a trap. That being said, I don't want to have cheeky fun with a concept that gets trans women killed. It almost feels like a part of me is trivializing the struggle of my sisters and that isn't something I want to do. I also don't want to normalize the idea of traps to the point that it begins to encroach on trans women, as it pretty much already is. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that although we're few and far between, there are people who legitimately identify as traps. However, anyone using the term trap to justify any kind of transphobia or to refer to anyone who doesn't explicitly identify as such is being a fucking prick."
"I think one of the biggest things I never dealt with growing up as a straight man is that anxiety about masculinity. My mom was honestly responsible for me not feeling like I HAD to join a sports team or do athletic stuff. She didn‚Äôt mind that I preferred to stay inside and play video games or do other stuff. I grew up with a gay sister and so my introduction to the idea of being LGBT was done very early. She‚Äôs my half sister, technically, but we all grew up together so she‚Äôs just my sister to me. She used to talk to us about this stuff. So from a very early age I didn‚Äôt care if I was manly. Around other boys I could just mimic their behaviors, but I mostly hung out with boys like me. Bookworms and nerds. I think the support from Home helped me not fall into the trap of masculinity anxiety. Not to imply I never worried about my masculinity because I do to a degree. I worry about testosterone levels and the fact that I can‚Äôt grow facial hair well. I stress about not having big muscles. But I don‚Äôt feel the need to worry about being gay and I don‚Äôt feel the need to constantly want to be stereotypically manly. I‚Äôm just content with me as the piece of shit I am."
"Hmm. Interesting seeing this as someone who used to be an 'anti-SJW'. I now understand what people mean when they address 'men'. Despite being a straight white man, over half the times you addressed that group of people I didn't feel as though I was being addressed, because the criticism either didn't apply to me anymore or never did. Strange how you don't get an accurate picture of a group through their opposition."
"But das gay tho..."
"You rock. Thank you for this. Subbed."
"'Mouthfeel' and as a wine lover, I am so curious. Curious and curiouser... Also, raawwwrrrrr."
"You seem to be arguing that if someone perceives trans woman to be a woman than she is a woman and it is not gay to be attracted to her.. but doesn't this alienate the majority or trans women who are not passing?"
"I like how you throw Dankula under the bus even though he's on your side of this issue."
"Yeah it's all about perception. Men have sex with pictures mostly. The trap is this statement- I'm visual'. Their excuse for everything."
"Am I the only one who could't stare at both sides of the half-queen costume at the same time?"
"Fellas is it gay to be gay?"
"Regardless of sex and gender empaths will generally find this triggering. I initially paused and/or skipped some that depicts death and violence cuz it came to me as too much. But I watched it again this time without pauses and skips and I learned a lot about the condition of our colored T in the LGBT+ in a slightly scared manner. I consider myself an ally of the trans community (I'm a cisgender lesbian), thanks to you ContraPoints I now know what to say to dickheads when they denigrate trans women and trans men. Your channel is wonderful!"
"I'm a straight cis man and it's interesting because for us Polynesians the trans issue is not a big deal. It is perfectly acceptable in my community to date a trans woman or man and as such this whole trap talk is unfamiliar to me. A trap in our community is a cis woman that pretends to be on birth control while fucking u and gets pregnant. My workplace is mostly white and this is where I learned that trap is also a slur for trans woman. Amazing video. Loved it."
"I watched this whilst in a peppermint milk bath.  How very appropriate and Contrapoints."
"So I was eating pecans during the tucking part and the irony of that is not lost on me"
"I'm a pretty biologically focused straight guy. I like vagina and ultimately would prefer it in a female partner. However if I ever encounter a peer genuinely ask me if he should date a trans girl, I'll say 'You like her? Then ask her out if you do.' Diminish their fear and replace it with fun. Hetero or not, who cares? If you want to sleep with someone, why think about what others feel about it? Fuck those people. This is your life. Fuck whoever you want. This is a free (unfortunately bigoted) country after all."

"A Scottish hate crime convict as a description for Count Dankula, although technically true in a way, he does not have hate towards the people he is accused of, 'my girlfriend thinks her pug is the cutest thing in the world and is always banging on about how cute he is, so i thought i would turn him into the least cute/most horrible thing i could think of, a Nazi' paraphrased as i can't be arsed right now to quote exactly but my paraphrase is accurate, the joke being her cute pug is turned into something horrible, the joke being he spoiled her cute dog but it is a dog remember it has no ideology, he was convicted for uttering a phrase and the video going viral. He doesn't believe any Jewish conspiracy or say anything anti-Semitic he has even argued against that in debates on livestreams.  Hell to the fucking no, its not reasonable to victim blame a murdered trans person for not disclosing that they are trans , however the world is not an idealistic fantasy, there are people out there who are irrational psychos, if a trans person wants to be safe and avoid these psychos, it is best to disclose that they are trans before they get into a private setting so they can see how the person reacts in a public place and if the reaction is irrational or psychotic, being in public provides more safety, if you wait till you are in a guys bedroom alone and then disclose, the danger is far higher. These murderers or assaulters are not justified in their actions in any way, people are just saying the world is not entirely full of rational and reasonable people, there are psychos. They shouldn't have to disclose that they are trans in an idealistic world, but we don't live in an idealistic world and we likely never will and all past attempts to strive for utopia have turned to genocide, oppression and starvation.  Trap means a variety of things, transphobes mean its a deception, where as non transphobes mean that a trap is an attractive trans person, they pass fully, they are being humorous, being serious all the time makes for a depressing life. Is it possible to tell a racist joke without being racist?? is it possible to tell a sexist joke without being sexist?? yes it absolutely is, so a person can be fully accepting of trans people and still call them a trap as a joke, it doesn't mean they are automatically transphobic, do people know what humor is?? can we please use some nuance. Obviously in common decency you probably shouldn't call someone who is not a friend of yours, a trap, but with friends who are truly fine with a bit of jokey banter it can be used as a joke. I am using the word trans to encompass the whole umbrella of non cis gender."

"I'm sorry. I'm an enlightened liberal person. I try to keep an open mind... but I just can't stand the term 'mouth feel.' It's right up there with words like 'blog,' 'slacks' and 'moist.' There are just some words that make me feel like I bit down on a gnat that flew into my mouth.  The rest of the video is excellent, though."

"God damn, this is truly illuminating. Thanks for explaining more about the feminine penis, I really was curious about that. Next, I think, some FtM youtuber has to explain the masculine clitoris. That's the next step. Then maybe the gender-neutral penis/clitoris, by an enby youtuber? That might be interesting. Is there such a thing? I don't know, but it's people like you that I trust to speak the truth.  Anyways, I'm glad the feminine penis is becoming mainstream."
"Hey Natalie! I loved this video sm and I think you did a great job fully deconstructing everything. The one point that I will make is from what I‚Äôve seen, a fair amount (not everyone or the people who you were talking about in your video) of people see traps as a man dressing up as a woman to show submissiveness. From all the le epic xdd memes I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äòtraps‚Äô aren‚Äôt trans women, but very effeminent men who still identify as men which is why they dress up in female clothes. A fair amount of it too is fetishization, and personally in these cases I think it‚Äôs a way for ‚Äústraight‚Äù men to explore homosexual or bisexual thoughts, but because of the femininity and female presentation not have to fully commit to the heinous act of being an out and out gay. I‚Äôm not defending the use of the word and I think overall it‚Äôs become a slur, but I just thought that this was an interesting branch of the issue. Anyway again amazing video!! My friends and I always look forward to when you upload"

"Coming back from a comments section where people were using echoes of the 'trans panic' logic to talk about a gay woman who came out after being married to a man for almost a decade... this was very cathartic. Thanks for that. Thanks for doing what you do in general. I always learn so much from your videos, or if I'm already familiar with the subject matter, I learn how to look at it with a bit more nuance.  ... also Ben Shapiro getting increasingly more Triggered TM in the background is fucking hilarious to me, 10/10 would ask you to include in every video going forward if I knew my amusement wouldn't taper off eventually."

"Yo, when you brought up the phrase 'I'm just  not into that', it threw me right the fuck back into the bittersweet hell that is stealth dating as a trans woman. Going out on few a dates with a guy who very clearly falls for you, only to have him tell you 'I'm just not into that' after you confess you're trans-ness to him is an experience that tows the line between bizarre and infuriating. It begs the question, what exactly do you think you need to be into to continue being interested in me? Do you think that, now that I've told you, I can let the proverbial beer belly out, start uncrossing my legs and growing out the ol' armpit rugs, or, god forbid, putting the 'boy pants' on in this budding relationship? Is it genital preferences when you don't know what I've got under here, and when, to put it crassly, I've got some other pretty rad holes for ya (that do more than just fine, critics say)? To borrow a phrase from Philosophy Tube, it's the most prolific 'Yer Dad'-ism I've ever had the confounding displeasure to experience. Also, I think we as trans women oughtta take the term trap for ourselves. After all, it describes a successfully socially transitioned trans girl. What better compliment could there be? I guess I see it as the n-word can be for african americans; once we've beat the fuckers, we take their shitty words and use them to empower ourselves."

"Until recently I never realized the 'are traps gay' meme and how it became so dreadful to the trans people. I have been into manga and anime for over 20 years and the concept of traps has been always in the manga as a crossdresser who completely passes as a woman, even in the voice, but not referring as a slur to trans women or not necessarily to talk about sexuality, it's quite a common trope and there are reverse cases too. In fact it started to appear in mangas because japanese crossdressers became known for being really good at it in the early 00's and there was a lot of popular visual key groups who had androginous looking or very feminine men (more than today's kpop) and Japan has a history of crossdressing in arts, prostitution and entertainment. I sometimes found this discussion on boards and it looked so stupid to me since I know where it came from.  This meme and its drift tell a lot about the cesspool that many anime boards are nowadays. Fortunately I started so long ago I never had the necessity to use 4chan, mal, reddit and other boards to find new material to read and watch and find decent people to talk to. But anyone who gets into it now will invariably go to those sites since its the easiest hub to start and usually are very young people who aren't educated enough and get sucked into those shitholes. Is quite sad, back in its day the anime community was way more open and progressive, now I have even blocked certain forums because watching and participating in discussions will invariably lead to some bigoted annoying kid saying some dumb shit, generally about women, or finding yourself in a thread full of people with pepe, ahegao or trump avatars."
"I also like how you low key shit on anti-materialist trans politics that talk about the 'true self' and your 'true gender' or spirit or something like this. Although I am cautious of bashing it too much, because it's the first time trans people have really developed a line of thinking coherent with their experiences. Of course it's not perfect.  I also like how you describe the narrowness and fragility of heterosexuality. Its status in relation to masculinity needs to be further emphasized, and it really goes to show the fluidity of sexuality."

"I mean, if I use the term ‚Äútrap‚Äù I personally exclusively am referring to cis male people who dress as women exclusively to try to trick others/seduce men/deceive the viewer of a show. I didn‚Äôt really even realize it was used towards trans women.  I always thought the word being used as ‚Äútrap‚Äù specifically referring to how cis male characters would ‚Äútrap‚Äù other cis male characters by deceiving them into believing they are cis women.   I always referred to traps as ‚Äúgay‚Äù because they are cis men trying to attract the attractions of other men by dressing up. Trans women obviously aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgay‚Äù if they are being seductive towards any man tho, they aren‚Äôt even in the same category as a man who is merely cross dressing.  A transwoman is a woman who is merely beguiled unceremoniously by some men for things she can‚Äôt help. A cross dresser, aka trap, will never understand her because they can just take off their make up and live a ‚Äòcis‚Äô life where as she cannot revoke her trans status.  It isn‚Äôt gay to be attracted to trans women. It is gay to be attracted to someone who is a cis male dressing up as a woman (if you are aware of their cis male status and still attracted to them.)."

On the one hand, his theories and data on the 'stereo sliders' of morality seem totally credible. Reading about them long ago gave me some profound insights into why people vote conservative, for example. But on the other hand, the dude totally goes around complaining that 'radical extremists' in college are nothing more than coddled Gen-Z neurotics while meanwhile pretending that socialists don't exist or are just part of the liberal spectrum. In my ideal world it would be Haidt rather than Peterson who became the avowed centrist going around dissing the left, since by comparison he's a lot more polite and backed by actual almost-science."

"Essentially, the answer is YES only if you go by one of two criteria:   1. If 'gay' is a term for a social stigma rather than a sexual orientation. You address this point in the video, and I think it's a serious concern in a world where heterosexuality is regularly conflated with a rigid, ritualistic heteronormativity.   2. If 'gay' is a term for intercourse that is not at least symbolically procreative. There is some overlap with #1 here, of course, but this one is more about 'biology' than the first criterion. The strictest form of this take is that all sex must be potentially procreative, but even when we escape from Catholic City into Protestantville (where not every single sex act has to be an attempt to make a baby), there's still the assumption that male seed must be placed in or on some part of a female body for the sake of representing insemination.    The ability to impregnate a female-presenting person with ovaries and a uterus (whether or not that ability becomes an actuality in any given act) is the ultimate measure of virility and, by extension, manhood in this second model. Since a trans woman could not even hypothetically get pregnant (whereas a cis woman who cannot actually procreate at least has the vestiges of potential), a trans woman does not meet the requisite definition of 'woman' in this worldview, namely 'a fleshly vessel that could conceivably conceive a man's offspring.' Hence, even if a trans woman need not be labeled as a 'man' in this model (possibly even being regarded as a third gender), any intercourse with such a person would not be heterosexual and thus would be 'gay.'"
"Contra should run for president one day"

"Not all videos can be all things to all people, and I applaud this video--especially its nod to the fact that many cis-het men consider both trans women and drag queens to be 'traps.' But there's one group you left out, and that's our friends in the gender non-conforming community. For example, one of my partners is XY and has both the T and the D--she's on hormones and would probably be included in the whole 'traps' discussion by these shit-lords, and yet tends to date men more on the bi or gay side, and she seems rather comfortable with using her D in ways that trans women typically wouldn't. You might at least give a one-sentence nod to folks like her in the future, since she is part of a major group being dissed. And she introduced me to your channel!  That said, I think this was a powerful video. I thought for sure I was rapidly and assuredly 'working towards woke,' but I came away from this realizing that, even though I've dated trans women and marched in the streets for their rights, in some ways I've been more like that politically correct vapor dad than like his son (though possibly in part because I'm vaping right now). It had never occurred to me to actually ASK trans women which type of guys tend to date them and what their experiences were like. I had assumed most men who dated trans women MUST, of necessity, be bi guys like me. Turns out I've been wrong--and prejudiced--because like the Ben Shapiros of the world, there's still a part of me that thinks trans women are not fully women. Thanks for helping me address that."
"what's truly sad is that we need to have all of these labels in the first place. who ever you are, you're always you. you know who you are, and that should be enough. i have never understood why some people try to force others to fit their idea of who they should be. the simple reality is, that it's easier to accept others description of themselves, than to try to force them to fit your notion of what they should be."
"If being attracted to hot chicks is gay, then I'm gay."
"THANK YOU!  I finally have the answer I've been looking for. Now that leaves one more question in regards to transwomen: can they reproduce children? It's an important question for those who want to keep their family bloodline/surname from going extinct."

Just because it's feminized by hormones doesn't mean it's still not a male organ. But then again, I am one of those cis WLW/lesbian (who you nonchalantly conflated with TERFs in this video) who you find scary. I can't blame you for conflating us with TERFs though because most TERFs are lesbian."

"I‚Äôm inclined to argue with you a little as someone whose been a long time anime fan. I‚Äôve never actually seen ‚Äútraps‚Äù used in the way you did most of this video.  Now I‚Äôve heard people talk about the claim that traps are trans though. That has a flaw.  Hideyoshi is basically a standard example of a trap.  Hideyoshi is male, claims he is male, gets annoyed when anyone implies he isn‚Äôt male, etc.  The point being that he isn‚Äôt trans.  A trans could be a trap, but a trap is not necessarily a trans.  You of course would know better than me if anyone has ever called you a trap, but to me you would not qualify as a trap (I‚Äôm unusually picky though).  From a biological perspective I would argue that attraction to the trap is not gay.  We tend to go off of visual cues.  If the guy is convinced they look female (especially before knowing), then I don‚Äôt think we could realistically expect an instant change in the neurotransmitters and other hormones when finding out about the other anatomy."

"@ContraPoints I appreciate your apprehension but I think your misgivings misplaced; Should it turn out that your new vagina sucks, I do not believe it will be quite as bad as one might imagine.  I think a lot of men could be pleased with a vagina that sucks! In fact at one time or another I bet a great deal many women wished their vagina did suck.  I will admit, I'm no vagina expert, in all honestly I'm rather biased toward the preservation of people penises.  That said, putting my chauvinistic tendencies aside, I think everyone is right to feel entitled to their authentic genitalia even if that means the pathological and parasitic penises have to go. <3"
"Thank you for that video, it's amazing. I especially loved the part where you show how the whole categorization of what is supposed to be gay or not is no more than ritual considerations very similar to religious casuistry. Made me laugh a lot thinking how the pedants who fueled that pointless debate in the first place would receive this."

"cope reaches unprecedented levels at 16:13"
"I wanted to address the 'Being gay is good actually' part of the video. You say that the only reason that straight men would not want to be gay is because they have some inherent homophobia. I don't think this is true. I'm a gay man myself and I've gone through phases where I thought I might be bisexual. I really didn't like it. Not because I think bisexual people are bad or I didn't want to be perceived that way, but because I had lived my whole building a sexual identity around being gay. I was then potentially going to have that ripped away from me. It's a frustrating thing to have happen."
"If gender is a spectrum and so is sexuality,  sometimes two people don't line up even if they are both hetero.  I see lots of women, and not all of them are attractive to me.  Trans-women/men shouldn't feel this entitlement that everyone of a certain gender might find them attractive because it's an unrealistic expectation even for a cist person to have."

It is absolutely unfortunate that the visual stylized cartoon archetypes of futa and traps and shit are conflated with real people and that people are stupid enough to think that these can be even remotely related. Also I like to self insert as the bottom and bottoming is something I think Natalie will agree with me on.

"From around 33:00 forward you deliberate on the ritualistic aspect of heterosexual intercourse, which frustrated me some, I admit, in a way that left me wanting for more. For instance, I expected you would talk more about the origins of this ritualistic and implications of failing to conduct oneself by it. As I understand, we have inherited from our Roman ancestors, arguably the largest influence on our society, that the male figure ought to be the penetrative party, and that to be penetrated is to be deprived from this very nature, that is, the male role in sexuality. You would seem to be in agreement, at least to some extent (because we are part of a society), as I observe in your commentaries at around 28:00 from the video. Now, I would argue that sexual attraction, the eros, plays a bigger part in our minds, that is, through the perception of fulfillment of expectancies, or roles (because I am inclined to believe a fetish is just that), and that perhaps that leads to something even deeper -- but this is beyond the point. What I've wanted with this truly is that maybe you would speak your mind more on this subject. What do you think of sexuality, from both what you've read (and I'm convinced you're quite well read), and from your real life experience as a trans woman?  As always, great content."

"First, thanks for the video. While I don't agree with everything, it was pretty informative. I didn't even know trap was considered a derogatory term. While I've never called anyone personally a trap, I use it to describe a type of transwoman among my group a friends. And honestly, I'm going to continue to do so, as I do with many other words. I just refrain from using it around people who don't like hearing it. Also, while I like the debate and argument of something being gay, does it really matter. If something turns you on, and it doesn't hurt anyone, go for it."
"You mean so much to me Natalie. Just, thanks."
"'The archetypal feminine penis has meaning, deep meaning, infact. Without a concept of a feminine penis, masculinity descends into utter chaos. Some would say, well, 'A penis is a penis, and that's that!' But it's not! It couldn't be further from the truth. Have you ever witnessed a very masculine penis? With its veins protruding? It's like the erection itself is channeling the deepest parts of our complicated history! A masculine penis has its own story! It's OUR story! The male archetype is captured in the rock solid foundation of a hard penis. To try and group that together with a soft penis is an attempt to impose penile marxism! Therefore, you need to understand the feminine penis in order to appreciate the ideal male penis! Otherwise we all descend into nihilism and then there's no point in even having a penis to begin with. Then where do you end up? Well, all of the sudden you realize there's no value in having it so you might as well get rid of it! You can go down that path if you want to, but it will take you to a very dark place.' - Jordan B.

"5:12 the use of the title ‚Äúhate crime convict‚Äù literally makes me want to throw up, especially when used for a guy who makes funny videos and advocates free speech and only free speech (something I think most people can agree on being a good thing), but besides that, good video"

"I was just ready to link to Pedantic Romantic's video, super rad to see it get referenced here. Leftist content creators like Foldable Human/Dan Olson and Hbomberguy who focus on television and movies and video games are SUPER important, and anime really needs it.  Pedantic's video has some interesting talk on how 'tr*p' is entirely created by English speaking anime viewers, and how the Japanese language has a bunch of words that talk about crossdressers and the expression of gender that (too my limited second-hand knowledge of Japanese culture) seem a lot more woke."

"This could not have come at a more cogent time in my life, as a bi man deeply attracted to trans women but wondering how that affected my identity in the scheme of things and how I should present, and I guess what my part should be in the community. I really appreciate your help, thank you."
"'But what. _About._ *_The penis?_* '  Probably the hardest I've laughed in a while"
"Didn‚Äôt want this to end"
"I've always found using the word 'trap' for a transexual or cross dresser super weird; thank you for outlining WHY I think it's weird.   Well, mostly why. The other reason is because there's a type of person who really IS a trap: a narcissist."
"In fact, is not a problem of femininity but of contemporary masculinity, the source of all harm in the internet today. This the emerging male insecurity. Peterson, Shapiro and all the other freaks, just take advantage of the wave of toxic masculinity on the internet. We (cis man) need to work our shit together and rebuild a new masculinity based on empathy for others and ourselves."

"Violence always has to be proportionate to the offence. It‚Äôs not ok to punch someone if they hit on you and you don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs not ok to accept a sexual invitation without disclosing you‚Äôre a considerable sexual minority. It‚Äôs ok to not disclose such things to your co-workers. It‚Äôs ok to shove someone if they grab you, mistaking you to be attracted etc."
""
"Honestly, ‚Äúpassing‚Äù is something we might need to get over. Once people stop caring about passing people can stop trying to look like another stereotype, drawing attention to the differences. Yes, trans people are being disadvantaged if they want to safely pursue sexual partners, so are non-hetero people (just based on the pool size). Prejudices and insecurities make things a lot worse. Passing seems to be one way of avoiding the everyday backlash, yet it contributes to the ‚Äúdeception‚Äù angle. If you don‚Äôt pass you get shit on a daily basis. If you pass you‚Äôre risking someone freaking out on you or worse due to not just personal issues but issues society-wide."
""
"If you‚Äôre afraid of rejection and don‚Äôt explain your situation when physical stuff comes up you are being deceptive. People are being deceptive all the time, especially if they want to make a good first impression, yet who‚Äôs a man and who a woman used to be quite clear. As people age and the world evolves, changes often complicated their lives. Most people will assume sex and for a reason - in most cases it‚Äôs safe to assume. If you see someone in the USA it‚Äôs safe to assume they understand English. I know it‚Äôs a weak comparison but this makes regular interactions simpler while hurting the minority a bit. I don‚Äôt think that every assumption that helps the majority and hurts the minority has to be rooted out."
""
"The pain of being misgendered is much greater, yet how are we to communicate if pronouns stop being a closed word class, something to simplify communication. People care about their identities, they want to be recognised for whatever they identify as, be it their marital, parental or social status, profession, education, experience, knowledge, fandom‚Ä¶ so whatever you spend time and care cultivating is also your weakpoint. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs going to change and I don‚Äôt think people will stop fighting over what it should be. :/"

"Trans women are trans women. For me, there are men, women, transvestites, transgender m/w, transsexual m/w, and many woefully unexplored birth/developmental anomalies."
""
"- Anomalies sounds harsh, so do the words like ‚Äúdeviating‚Äù or ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù because people use them in a derogatory way. From a scientific standpoint those are aberrations that need to be studied but the fucked up thing is they need human trials. We won‚Äôt know much until we test how people develop biologically, mentally and how various factors change their place in a society. Or maybe if we get to a point of simulation real enough‚Ä¶"

"- ‚ÄúTrans people‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough. It‚Äôs avoiding the touching subject of sexual reassignment but transgender and transsexual is an important distinction. Are trans___ women women? Trans___ women are trans___ women. Also M to F and vice versa matters. Trying to argue it all comes down to men/women and nothing else is, again, playing into the stereotype."

"Concerning sexuality, I‚Äôm not sure. Both what people identify and act as can change. People can be hetero, homo or bisexual in a very strict sense, ‚Äúperson-sexual‚Äù (when the exception is a couple of individuals), in transition, partial to one over the other‚Ä¶ and there are too many factors to consider to keep using just the ‚Äútrio‚Äù (reproduction, physiognomy, squeamishness, attraction, foreknowledge‚Ä¶). I guess the answer is ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to listen to the long version‚Äù, which similarly to the personal pronouns issue makes practical assumptions harder. Depending on the context the answer can vary greatly or be pretty much inconclusive. ‚Äú‚ÄôIs liking transsexual women gay‚Äù is a stupid, broad question."
"Fuck yeah, dude!  Please keep up the hilariously inspired and self-deprecatingly honest great work Natalie.  As an X-ennial ally trying to stand ground in this bombastic media hate-fuck orgy of a socio-political climate today, your videos make me proud.  I'm glad some reason and understanding of what it takes to win hearts and minds is surviving online."
"I learned a lot from this and I'm glad that my head was in the right place for a lot of what you talked about :D such a great video!"
"As somebody that is pretty engrained in the anime scene I think you might be missing the point as far as anime specific 'Traps' are concerned. Due to the fact that the vast majority of 'Traps' in anime identify themselves as dudes but are super effeminate looking. The Japanese even have a word for these sorts of characters 'Bishounen' which translates to pretty boy. In fact one of the most famous 'Traps' in anime Hideyoshi from 'Baka and Test' makes a point to remind the males in the show that he is a dude every time they say he looks like a pretty girl. All that being said I did still find the other points you made to be very good. Also I would like to go on record as saying that the attraction of a straight dude to Bishounen characters is not gay (Since the whole point is that they look lady-like). Lastly if your attraction to 'Traps' is because of the combination outwardly lady-like features and said character having a penis then I don't really think 'Gay' or 'Straight' really apply to that situation.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Still I think the vid was solid, keep up the good work ma'am."
"You are so hot in this video ohmygawddddd"
"If you spend a moment to think about the question one should be able to come to the conclusion that gay men are attracted to men, not women. Therefore strictly gay men shouldn't be attracted to traps, since the purpose of a trap specifically is to convincingly appear as a woman."
"Oh shit i did not know female penises squirted, good to know since jizz is fairly well recognised as gross"
"Natalie, I love you, but you really fucked up your research. I have been shitposting on 4chan's anime board for over a decade so I know what I'm talking about when I say that 'trap' can also, especially during the earlier days, refer to a man who simply looks like a woman but identifies as a man like Nagisa from Assassination Classroom or Kojuro Shuri from Masamune No Revenge."
"Ask a straight man which one he is attracted to more (without the presumption of knowing who they are): Carmen Carrera or Buck Angel?"
"Another great video"
"'It must needs be remarked' made me bust out laughing. Natalie you are incredible <3"
"You‚Äôre like the only YouTuber who‚Äôs skits aren‚Äôt cringy and actually funny tbh üòÇüëè"
"You've changed my perspective a lot with this video, but I don't think I'll ever be able to take the 'feminine penis' argument seriously. It's still a penis. I don't believe that any amount of social rewiring could get me to view it differently. That may mean my understanding or internalization of the idea that trans women are women will always have an asterisk attached to it, but I don't think that's actually a problem.  It seems disingenuous to try and argue that someone who is NOW a woman has ALWAYS been a woman when there's simultaneously so much weight placed on presentation. It won't change any of my other behavior or support for trans rights, and I have absolutely no desire to be involved with a trans person romantically, so I suppose this remains at the level of headspace. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
"Natalie this is your best video I swear!"
"People who get offended by the existence of trans women and call them 'traps' just shows the fear they feel because they know that they could easily percieve a biological woman and a trans woman the same way,  since they have never worried about understanding femininity as an acquirable caracteristic  more so than just consuming whatever the media and obsolete social standars and stigmas sell them. Those people can¬¥t claim to know what a 'real woman' is, given that they wouldn¬¥t even know the real sex of their courtship targets until they can have a good look/feel under the skirt, and that¬¥s just in case said trans woman hasn¬¥t had the surgical procedure done to have a vagina. It¬¥s all just empty prejudice, since in the end, the only one thinking the guy is gay to begin with is himself, and he is terrified of it."
"Thanks for making this video, Natalie! I really hope most of the weebs from the anime community will watch this but I doubt they will because they like being shitposting edge lords which is one of the reasons why I hate or strongly dislike most of the anime community."
"When even your beginning-of-video content warnings are badass: an exploration of ContraPoints."

"Wait count dankula and Richard spencer got out of their cage? I told them we needed to build a god damn moat with alligators but NO that would be 'in humane' fucking snowflakes am I right?"

"omg i love that contra choker :0"
"Another cracking vid, thought I was pretty 'woke' but this vid helped me address some views I didn't even know I held. Always assumed that as a bi man, attraction to trans women fell into my attraction to men, looking back that's pretty daft and a bit embarrassing. Your vids are always Brill and this is no exception"
"But traps are not trans... The anime community has another word for trans woman, and let me tell you, they are quite popular ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). (Clears throat) Anywho, Traps are males, who identify as men, who are extremely effeminate to a degree that they look like, and are often mistaken for woman. SOME are crossdressers though. So yes it is indeed 'gay', not that there is anything wrong with that.  Though, I guess you d have an argument if somone uses that word to describe a trans woman. Because they are a moron."
"how many Sargons long was this?"
">Graphic displays of anime lol"
"*30 minute standing ovation*"
"In the circles that I run in, we delineate between traps and trans woman. A Trap is a person with XY chromosomes identifying as a man but presenting as a woman in order convince a person into sex with them, essentially a crossdresser into it for the sex, while a trans woman is a person with XY chromosomes identifying as a woman, regardless of presentation. We just find it more useful to have 2 descriptions of 2 different experiences rather than not recognize one of the identities and merely another umbrella slur for trans people."
"question about the feminine penis: what about dominant trans women? can she still top you and order you to get on your knees and worship it and all that or does that instantly transform it into a Masculine Peen? i feel like with dominant cis women nobody's talking about the masculine vagina no matter how boisterously she brandishes it, so wouldn't it be a double standard (i would also be down to hear about anything on the masculine vagina from a trans male perspective)"
"in the amount of time i watched this the dislikes went from 706 to 792... such a shame"
"i'm ready to hijack the car !!!"
"I think lesbians get the pop too but so far in my experience it‚Äôs never had ANYTHING to do with the body- I‚Äôve always always always been attracted to girls for their personality and their sense of style. Which I guess kind of sounds like I‚Äôm trying to sound like I‚Äôm not shallow??? I am shallow. I‚Äôm shallow as hell. It‚Äôs just that titties are more of like a cool bonus for me (and in my experience, other lesbians that I know as well) while my main thing is dying over girls who wear suits. And in that case like, fuck yeah, trans girls are exactly the same. You‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a trans girl wearing a suit??? Sign me the fuck up dude!!!!! I‚Äôm literally already writing our wedding vows don‚Äôt even fucking joke about it"

"This videos are going to make history one day."
"Before i watch: 44 minutes to tell us whether or not male crossdressers like other men??? Like i realise crossdressing has nothing to do with sexual preference but CLEARLY the gayness rate of crossdressers is high."
"I still find it really impressive you can talk about these things so frankly."
"loved the vid, but i feel like The Dankula hate convict line is unfair and goes against 'if you want to persuade anyone,  it helps to meet them where there're at' philosophy, which is among the best of things about your channel"

"this video has been very inspirational and eye opening for me, thank you!"
"Let me level with you and everyone else who is Trans. I learned A LOT as a straight cis male POC while watching this video. Beforehand, if you were to ask me if I were to date someone who was trans I would have said no, not because of the sexual stuff but because of the social stigma that would have most definitely been placed on me for doing so. After watching this I feel a lot better about doing this if the moment ever confronts me.   And as a side note, everytime I watch you, Petercoffin, Philosophytube hbomberguy, etc. (left wing YouTube in general). I am so proud and happy to be finally learning more. More about what I was never introduced to as a child. Right now my State (yes I'm in the US) has a massive incarceration issue that affects POC, the poor, and yes LGBT lives and causes massive harm. I've decided to give my attention to do that and devote my talent to solving that issue. Just... thanks I guess. Thanks for being you, and continue being you."

"Great video, as usual. However, I do wish you had given more context when you brought up Count Dankula instead of putting him on next to Milo and Dicky Spencer and calling him a 'Scottish hate crime convict.' There's a difference between the joke video he made with his dog and the shit that Milo and Spencer try to pull. By the way, everyone knows that nothing's gay as long as you say 'no homo' first. ;)"
"'The only way to win is to hijack the car.'  Hell yeah!  Be gay do crimes, boo!"
"Real quick. Love the vid. Don't like Dankula being thrown under for his false criminal acts. I'd appreciate he be attacked for his stupid ideas, not some superfluous hate crime."
"For real, there are men who won't clean their assholes because they're afraid it'll feel good? How have they been wiping all this time?"
"Im really sorry but unsub"
"Well. Fricken. Done. It's like you read my mind while I was watching. As I thought, 'Why hasn't she brought *this* part of the topic up?' you touched on it! I was weary of such a long video, but holy cow this was so good."
"I think the question is really just a canary in a cave, testing the waters to see if they're going to be attacked or not. If the majority responds that traps are gay and icky, they'll keep their preferences to themselves. If they respond that no, traps aren't gay and it's totally natural to be attracted to them because they look like girls, then it's time to upload their 4TB of dickgirl porn with the rest of the Discord server."
"lmao there's an alt-right dipshit who actually named himself 'Count Dankula?'"
"The reason someone would say something more if it's offensive is related to basic psychology - the more you forbid something, the more enticing it becomes. Although I can't rule out that specific trans hatred isn't also a factor, since I think it is a factor, the above factor should be taken into account as well I think."
"Actually I do throw shade at people dating people from Ohio. I'm sorry Ohio but you are the state that Iowa makes fun of."
"I always think it's funny how people think that simply refusing to talk about something will make it go away. Kind of like if Black Lives Matter decided to omit any discussion of the subject of black people killed by police or if people worried about climate change just opted to avoid any reference to the countless forest fires, droughts and starvation already wrought by severe disruptions in the earth's natural cycles (caused by greedy oil companies)."
"also are you implying that you don‚Äôt pop????"
"I disagree with your definition of gay (circa 36:40). You say it has to do with attraction to the same gender. That's definitely false. It has to do with attraction to bodies that are the same as mine. It's a sexuality after all, not a genderality."
"After the Tiffany Tumbles video I Googled 'feminine penis' and 'the feminine penis', intrigued by the concept and expecting some academia on the subject given the name. 3rd-Wave radfems writing scholarly articles on the subject, that sort of thing. Instead I found fucking 4chan memes that dates back to a 'are traps gay?' argument. Is the use of the term feminine penis in this context some form of reclamation? A pisstake? An attempt to make the video comprehensible to 4chan memelords? I'm genuinely confused, because given that has the same etymology as the slur trap it seems off to use it in an academic way like it is here.  That aside, I just want to say thanks. As a straight man I've had pretty much all the same frustrations the way manhood and sexuality are tied together and all the bullshit that comes with it, you were preaching to the choir here, but it was almost cathartic to have so many of those frustrations dissected and torn apart the way they were in this video."

"Actually Natalie pornhub just recently changed their categories recently. They had already removed the ‚Äòshemale‚Äô category for some time now it has been ‚Äòtransgender‚Äô however they just days ago added ‚Äòtrans with guy‚Äô ‚Äòtrans with girl‚Äô ‚Äô and ‚Äòtrans guy‚Äô. And also still ‚Äòtransgender‚Äô. So there ya go, old news. Really enjoyed the video however."

"Transwomen aren't t****. Someone has to identify as a male to be a ***p. (That doesn't mean you can brutalize them. Or anyone, really.)"
"Trans people are free to seek any partners they want.  Just as long as they are up front with the fact they are trans then they can hit on whoever they wish.  But if they hit on a straight guy and do not let them know then that is a low act.  I would not blame any man who once discovering they had been fooled for getting very angry and maybe violent.  So it is up to the trans person to make sure any random conquest KNOWS your sexuality before things advance to a sexual level."
"You are amazing, big hugs!"
"I've got to be honest, as a hetero guy, I really do just like vaginas. I like looking at them, I like touching them, I like tasting them. I think they're swell, and a bit of period blood isn't going to dampen my enthusiasm at all either.  And in equal measure I really don't like penises very much. I really don't ever want to touch or come close to anyone's except my own. Which is why I think I'd still maybe have a hang up with trans women who still have one. I definitely agree that trans women can be just as attractive as cis women, but if they still have a penis, I'm personally probably not going to want to see them naked. Not that I have anything against a man who would or against the women who still have them. Just that I get why it's treated as a little bit of a 'oh you're into THAT' in a way that dating a woman from Cincinnati might not be."

"Great video! I love your costuming and sets. The curly hair really suits you in this video"
"Why does it matter if it's gay or isn't? Why can't people just be allowed to do people things without fear of physical or social harm due to ones freedom of choice?"
"your choker game is on point"
"I agree with most of your points. There's still some things they think not fully correct.   The only part I really disliked was calling count dankula a hate crime convict. Although it is technically true he got arrested, but it was for making a Nazi  joke. And by no means should that be a crime."

"I didn't think I was going to watch the video in its integrity _(because it lasted 40 minutes)_ , but you intrigued and captivated me. You educated me so well as a straight girl who,yes, always supported the LGBT community but did not know about some of the things you mentioned. As a straight girl, I have never experienced the struggles that trans people have to go through but you have helped me to better understand in order to stand up for lgbt rights and my friends. I'm just happy to have more knowledge about it. You just don't blame people without argument, no. You know what you are talking about,  you are using rational arguments and reflexions, facts and humour. This is a video so good in the educational content, your personality, the organization of dialogues and segments, the characters, the way you talk, EVERYTHING. You can really make this interresting.

He's really just some prankster who taught his dog a trick to peeve his wife (and a victim of a monotonous parliament). I can see why people are mad, but I feel like there's some missing context and a lot of people have portrayed him as if he's some sort of *n-4-z-1* rather than a troll who was just having some harmless fun.  That being said, at least you looked into him enough to find a joke he made (the one about being gay for touching your willy, lol), so maybe you've looked into him more than I thought and you're not missing context. You might just disagree with how he and others see that situation.  Either way, this video was really entertaining and you made some great points. I hope you make more like this in the future. :)"

"I love your videos but hate your opinions"
"I loved this video (as always, everything you put out is phenomenal), but I do have one bit of criticism.  A lot of the statements you make in the first half of the video or so make it sound like all straight men should be attracted to transgender women, and any who aren't attracted to them don't fully accept trans women as women. I'm a cisgender straight male for context but it is extremely rare for me to get turned on by trans women (assuming I'm aware that they are trans), and thus I felt a big part of this video was taking a dig at me and people like me. Trans women are 100% women but, if we're using the standard of 'consistent attraction', I'm attracted to ciswomen but not transgender women. So the one criticism of mine is that next time I would put clarifying statements like 42:50* towards the beginning of the video.  Like I said though everything else about the video is absolutely great! Keep fighting the good fight :)  *I'm identifying this statement in particular because (unless if I missed something) this is the first time in the video that Natalie acknowledges that straight men can lack an attraction to trans women and it be okay."

"this video was great.  that fear of the stigma is hard as fuck to get over. A trans coworker and friend i have were talking about this in not as eloquent terms years ago as we drunkenly ranted about our life problems. And one of her deepest primal fears was getting into the dating game. She hated the idea of someone being into her as a fetish. And even though she got hit on occasionally she never allowed herself to pursue because in her mind every potential partner had clocked her (i'm not gonna lie, at that phase of her transition and her body before it was a concern) and was most likely a chaser given life in our small town.  as she lamented this it made me uncomfortable too as i started to question my own feelings and biases about this topic. That feeling of 'man, am i mentally forbidding myself and shaming myself from feeling attraction to transfolk?' and to this day. To answer it, probably yeah. If i've ever been attracted to someone trans, it's because i didn't clock them. The few transfolk i've clocked and known weren't individuals that i'd find attractive in general, so i've never really had to have the hard decision time in my head for it.  And this is odd to me because i generally consider myself lightly bisexual and have enjoyed a cock a time or seven.  so, i guess this post doesn't really have a point aside from 'man i'm glad this video is at least talking about these anxieties in a way that doesn't outright dismiss them.'  thanks Nat, i enjoyed this thoroughly."

"I think if many men just let go of their inhibitions about sexuality and just do what feels good, they'd have more fun and get a lot more action. Most women certainly don't seem to care and are more willing to experiment, leading to more liberating sex lives than most of their male peers. It's gotten to a point where some guys can't even seem to compliment one another without prefacing it with 'No homo'.  I've dated a transwoman and had a couple fundamentally gay experiences afterwards, but I don't regret any of it. Hell, straight women typically tended to get even MORE interested in me when I shared those experiences than keeping them to myself. Homoeroticism and open-mindedness is a helluva a turn-on, wouldn't you know it."

These people have claimed the term 'Trap' to describe themselves, while still identifying as male.

"Natalie - you've got to do videos more regularly. We're getting withdrawal symptoms. But seriously, I am disappointed. Any effort to regularlise trans women is bad for me.  People who have to work hard to perfect their persona are often much  more authentic than the spoilt brats who match the stereotype and believe the world owes them. Trans have more character, they are more open minded and they are more appreciative. Give a trans flowers, open her car door and take her somewhere unexpected and she'll love it. Do the same for a sis brat and she will complain about her missing friends.  Trans women are the best secret in modern male society. Unfortunately videos like yours expose these hidden beauties.  If having a partner with extras makes me gay, sis or a sheep sheared, it has generally been worth it. Ive got to warn men that once you've enjoyed an elegant, intelegent, appreciative trans, you may find most other women boring..."

I know it is pointed out that they same group think that 'whatever doesn't 100% fit correct gender roles during sex is gay', but still. If you pointed that example out, it would probably switch back to 'but they look like a man so it's gay', which would also contradict their arguement about transwomen."

These guys are from all walks and races and corners of society. Many of which are either married or engaged and some with kids.   These guys all lament the same thing: they can't handle trying so hard to please a person who refuses to make compromise or not flip out or not fight about everything.

"This is going to be long. Don't read it if ya' don't wanna, but don't complain to me telling me it's long. Why do that?  ----  So, in the course of watching this, I accepted that on a subconscious level, I don't perceive trans girls as girls, but I don't really see them as boys, either. I'll use preferred pronoun and whatever, but I'll also use whatever the last pronoun used was without thinking. Like, if I'm talking to someone and they call ContraPoints 'she' I'll end up using feminine pronouns, but if they say 'he,' I'll end up using masculine ones, because my brain doesn't really feel like it even matters. But, while that was more-or-less covered in the video, one thing that wasn't, that applies to me, is just not being attracted to the concept of transsexuality on an abstract, emotional level.  It's not a thought process. it's not a decision. it's not a fear of gayness. It's just how i experience transsexuality.  For the first two thirds of this video, until it was covered, I was sort of confused about what the subject really was. Like, obviously it's not 'gay' to be perceptually attracted to someone who looks, acts, and seems like a girl. How and why would that be gay? For dudes who are afraid of being gay, and hate gay people for it, why would hitting on someone who looks and otherwise seems like an attractive girl feel gay or 'scary' enough to like harm that person, or really at all? I didn't get it--seemed dumb.  But, that sort of plays into an area I feel wasn't really covered by the video, but where my feelings and thinking fall. I'm not afraid of being gay, as I don't even know why it'd matter, outside of having a harder time with life due to prejudice, and I don't really care about my masculinity. Although, I do think boys (sorry, I hate the words 'men' and 'women,' they just skeeve me out for some reason) are kind of inherently gross. Like, biology is like almost inherently gross, but then like dudes are extra gross. Like, I think girls should also think boys are gross. Anyway, my reasons for not wanting to, or probably being able to, have sex with a transsexual person has nothing to do with perceptions, or fear of gayness, though i do think it's linked to the fact that I don't necessarily view them as either boys or girls.  I think ContraPoints gets progressively prettier as the production of the series goes on, and why wouldn't she? She's taking hormones, has nice bone structure anyway, and I actually like girls with features that skew to the masculine, anyway. The strange thing though is that i don' really see her as 'hot,' despite being pretty. In a sense, transsexual people are subconsciously desexualized to my brain--attractive, but not sexual; at the risk of being offensive, and I'm sure it will be, because it's some easy shit to misunderstand, it's a similar feeling to seeing an 'attractive' cartoon character for a normal person who doesn't want to fuck cartoons--I recognize what's perceptually attractive about the subject, but the subject doesn't trigger feelings of romantic or sexual compulsion for me. Visualizing sexual contact doesn't repulse me or anything, it just doesn't do anything that picturing sexual contact generally would.  My biggest fear in being in a situation wherein I hit on a transsexual person somewhere, then realized they were transsexual, and having them be reciprocal, would be the complete brain blasting terror of not knowing how to navigate the situation without accidentally hurting their feelings or making them feel bad about themselves when they realize what's happening in my brain. Like, watching this video series has actually made even thinking of being in that situation more severe, because I know how ContraPoints (whose name i can't remember) talks about how she feels about herself in that regard, and things that can and do hurt her feelings. Even listening to her talk about her anxiety in sexual encounters just makes the scenario of 'rejection' seem so much more awful for everyone involved.  My thing is that I'm just not attracted to the concept of transsexuality in an abstract, subconscious way. It's a big part of why transsexual people are basically desexualized in my brain. They don't register as sexual entities, even when perceptually attractive. I wouldn't be offended or repulsed if a transsexual person made a physical move on me, I just wouldn't really feel anything sexual, and the only thing I would be feeling is the terror of how you turn this situation down without making them feel bad, or worse, about being transsexual.  Like when you get hit on by a gay dude, you just say 'oh, I'm not gay.' Everyone's ok with that. You're not attracted to them because you're not attracted to men.  With trans women, you're not attracted to them sexually because they used to be a different sex (which you can even boil my experience down to), which is like the thing that makes them feel worse than anything else (seemingly). Like its the source of so much pain, self doubt, and worry in their lives, and you're just like affirming it, but you can't help it.  I don't even know what my point is, other than there is a class of person who isn't like worried about masculinity, perceptions, or gayness who aren't attracted to transsexual people on a more abstract level, and more-or-less involuntarily. So, I guess I felt it was a little bit unfair to frame every single person in that department that way. I mean, maybe it's dumb that i can't process transsexual people as fully either sex, but it's also not like a choice I'm making. Colorblind people don't choose to see blue as purple, it's just what their fuckin' body does with the stimuli. It's like the same shit in my brain, but i'm transblind (when it comes to sexuality)."

"In the 80s, at an SF convention, I was hanging out with a  girl for most of the weekend. Came early Sunday, and we went back to my room. And she started crying, saying she was trans and she thought I'd be mad at her. My reaction was, 'So?' which made her cry harder. We didn't wind up sleeping together, but I did comfort her for the rest of the con. Now that I'm transitioning myself, I find myself wondering whatever happened to her, if she made it through okay. She was black, but I didn't think that was important in the story. At least it shouldn't be."

"The argument started with proving exclusivity of the term 'trans-woman' assuming that 'heterosexual man' is an exclusive term. The strongest point of this video was the notion of relativity of the term 'heterosexual man'. But this notion also undermines the above mentioned proof.   One of the biggest logical fallacies of gender discussions is ignoring the fact that words 'man' and 'woman' may carry different cultural and biological meanings while one meaning does not exclude the other: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232363.php  Insisting on insult on base of implication of deception is silly. As silly as Plato who was insulted by the deception of all art except flute tunes addressed at marching soldiers and pasturing goats. Not to mention the crimes connected to art works.

"I'd honestly never heard this line of reasoning until watching your Tiffany Tumbles video recently, so this was actually kinda useful.  It might have had something to do with me being bi (however, with my growing understanding of enby people I'm starting to think I might be polysexual as opposed to strictly bi, but I am certain in my being attracted to both men and women) so I never really considered what the orientative (yes I did just make a word up on the spot) ramifications of dating a trans person would be because of my preconceptions of the overviews of heterosexual and same-sex relationships in conjunction with my belief that trans and non-binary people are the genders they identify as."
"Real talk: I 'finished' (you know) transitioning four years ago and I've been living an entirely comfortable normal young woman's life for eight, 'passing' completely - which even as a concept feels bemusingly distant to think about now. And I absolutely adore Natalie's essays, but I cannot ignore the nagging feeling I always get, in increasing amounts, when watching a new video: In comparison, I feel unattractive, boring, dumb, and worst of all, like a total chickenshit for not being out about my own past. In a word, I feel bad. Be it online or IRL, if I'm appearing under my real identity, I never speak up when a situation emerges where I would be well in a position to educate, debate or scold people about or over trans issues. I stay silent for my own benefit, afraid of the (in reality, to myself almost non-existent) disadvantages of again being seen/known as part of the minority weirdo troupe of not-real-women(tm). I should be and do better, but for now I'm just super glad this channel exists, even if it makes me feel personal guilt in comparison."
"As one of the world's foremost researchers on this topic and the 'is it gay?' game, I'm honored that an esteemed colleague could replicate my findings. In all seriousness, I think the 'is it gay?' game can be fun, juvenile banter and a useful outlet for discussing sexuality, but as soon as we introduce the presumption that gay things are wrong things it quickly turns into moralizing to other men about how to have sex."
"For me, the word Trap means a guy, who is biologically a guy, who identifies as a guy, crossdresses in a very feminine way, and 'surprises' people. It could also mean any guy who cross-dresses as a girl, but i would consider the use of Trap in that certain context to be less specific."

"this video has given me a lot to think about, and some hearty laughs as well. Regarding 'trap' as a term I just use it myself because i used to hang on 4chan a lot and I also find the onomatopoetics of it very sexual, the shortness of the word and the 'ap' sound; basically, it just sounds cute, but also i think it's hot as fuck to imagine a pre-op transgirl (or girl who was born with dick) tricking a straight man into fucking her and he ends up loving girl-dick. To me, that's less outrageous than Jane Anybody's rape fantasies....  As someone who is very much into transgirls and dickgirls, I have to say it's not just 'girl with dick fetish'. For me , it's also about body transformation, abnormal anatomy, and quite simply the uniqueness of such a creature. Do note however that I really, really like dick. but if I _fell in love_ with someone who later underwent vaginoplasty, I don't think i'd leave her just for that. What is interesting also is how many dickgirls there are in porn. I have noted that they do not seem to dislike their genitalia, and so perhaps it could be argued whether they are 'real' transgirls if they don't abhor their male genitalia (which is of course a separate and rather large discussion).  Natalie, if your anecdotes about trans feelings / trans thoughts are representative of transwomen, then it likely means that I am not a transwoman. I like my dick and a few other parts of the male anatomy, I'm also exquisitely visual (your description of 'the pop' was very poignant and relatable). This will prolly change the experience of my mild gender dysphoria and I will be interested to find out whether I'll have any more 'omg i'm trans' mini breakdowns -- if I don plastic boobs again, will I not feel gender dysphoria then?  The 'trap' discourse in itself is strongly tied to the discourse of 'passing'. And to me, the very idea of passing is socially constructed, and I cannot philosophically reconcile this with the binary approach of the 'pass / don't pass' categorisation of transpeople. I understand transpeople who want to pass, but as you said yourself, human sexuality is not black and white, and I'd argue it's much the same with gender. I forgot where I was going with this last paragraph. maybe something like; to me, you don't have to pass as anything. if you look sexy - you're sexy. I mean, John Maclean passes for a woman but doesn't even identify as a woman. I think the dichotomy itself might not be false, but is something 3-dimensional rather than a 2D axis.  This video really needed to be about 3 hours. there was a lot of stuff to cover and the vid was a little too fast-paced IMO. Also i love your voice, your smile, and your countenance.  I find the use of censorship in this video questionable."
"So damn right!! My high school sweetheart ex-boyfriend was my 'trap', broke my heart :( He's straight, I'm a gay trans guy."
"Another amazing video. I personally have tried and tried to find a cis straight mans perspective on dating trans women. There seems to be a serious lack of this perspective on youtube. I think for a lot of cis straight men the message of trans women are just women and it doesn't make you gay to date one (even though there is nothing wrong with being gay) would be received better if it came from someone they perceived as more relatable.  I understand the social pressures of why we don't see this perspective but I still think it would be helpful to the cause.  Anyway, keep up the good work."
"I love you ContraPoints!"
"i really wanna watch this video but your confidence and general aesthetic perfection is intimidating"
"Why did you not release this video before??!!!! about 1 month ago I didn't really know what this was and I mentioned 'traps' in a casual conversation with my friends, and they responded: 'Do you watch Hentai?' It was the most awkward thing in my life!"
"Lately there was LOTS of horrible people on anitwitter who tried their damndest to find a way not to refer to the character Lily from Zombieland saga as Trans or a 'she' when the show was being very obvious about it (for anime at least) and many used trap as their go-to.'She's not trans, she's a trap' The character is a goddamn child! Who's she trying to trap ya sick fucks!? my point is,  Anime is good, Anime fans were a mistake"
"damn natalie, you become prettier with every video"
"traps are not gay but they are if you don't know that the person is the same sex as you and you are atraccted to them thats not gay but if you know and you want to have sex with them noing that they are same sex as you that makes it gay (this is an argument where we all agree that there are only 2 sexes a fictive imaginary univers like ‚àö-100 imaginary numbers )"

"One thing I don't understand is need for (I guess hetro more but everyone really) people to identify/connect with a particular sexual orientation. Like I'm straight but if suddenly I found a bloke I really wanted to fuck I wouldn't think twice about it"
"Some problems I have with this video.  You seems to come at this from a one sided point of view. You ignore the anime community's views on this. You don't even try to understand where we stand on this. So it comes over as preaching.  You did try to understand man and all the genders but left otaku, cosplay, trap culture out of it but brought up anime traps. I would recommend I part two on this and really try to understand where anime stands on this. BTW traps and trans and wtv else you are in the anime community we are super accepting and open to others just to preach to us. By liking anime we already are outcasts of society we don't need another moral authority talking sown on us."
"Your merch link doesn't work"
"You're gorgeous, hilarious and really good at lighting  üíúüíô‚ù§ But yeah what I dont think helped at all was media presentations of trans women. Like how in many films where it's revealed that a guy finds out the women he slept with or kissed is trans and then they projectile vomit. Like this is a joke used so many times for so long. I mean I think I became aware of trans people, trans women esp, intially was from the movie Ace Venture Pet Detective and where a trans women was the villain who apparently slept with the entire police force to which after rhe reveal everyone starts to gag. You slept with a trans woman?...Why is that bad? Oh yeah it isnt. Shut the fuck up and go to a doctor for your projectile vomit tendencies."
"I always love seeing my favourite Scottish hate-crime convict pop up where I least expect him. I'd rather him answer the question personally, as the question is a shitpost, and he is a shitposter. If the question was, 'are transgenders gay', the answer is simple - either 'ask them individually' or 'it's none of your concern'. I love the content both you and Dankula put out, and while my personal ideologies align closer to his, I still love the work you do."

"When are you going to sell body pillows with your characters on it?"
"AS A CIS STRAIGHT MAN (who is ignorant), I don't have a clue about the real issues of trans people. So thank you for talking about that. The narrative in your videos always seems to follow my thoughts; when you talked about the pretentious socially progressive liberals, that at first sounded like a reasonable position to me. But of course it isn't. This video seemed really complete and intelligently made to me ;)"
"trans people are the victims of gender stereotypes... sad"
"Honestly, until this video I had never even considered applying the word 'trap' to trans women. The way my friends and I always saw the word trap as meaning a cis gendered gay man who purposefully displays himself as a woman in order to trick straight cis gendered men into sleeping with them. Which obviously doesn't really happen outside of anime tropes and porn."
"I'm glad it's only gay if the balls touch, 'cause I will never give up swordfighting."

"Still watching the video, but are you seriously going to call Count Dankula a hate-crime convict as though that makes your point more valid?"
"What if a cis woman is attracted to a trans woman?"
"But if sexual attraction is based on perception, then is gender not immensely relevant (rather than sex exclusively)? It seems to me that there would be an unseverable link between sex and gender, because no matter how much one personally identifies as X, there will always be the possibility that they are perceived as Y. Furthermore, I imagine this will only get more complex in the future when more genders are normalized.  Basically, (without getting super logic-y partially because my head hurts) it seems to me that the supposed expansion of gender has a major obstacle to overcome if it isn't going to inadvertently perpetuate the binary, this obstacle being the lack of 'objective' tools or tips used for appreciating or respecting people's self-identity without having to become intimate with their souls. Such a lack will, in my cynical view, lead 'woke' people to try and come up with an efficient set of criteria to try and help non-binary individuals, but the set will just end up reflecting something too rigid (AKA the preset binary) to be helpful. Make sense???? It hardly does to me but I had to respond spontaneously, because, you know, youtube."

"Anyone who thinks that trans people are out to trick cis people is fucking retarded. Nobody is going to spend years of gender transitioning just to fool someone into sleeping with them! That line of thinking is not only bigoted as hell, but also a bunch of Wile E. Coyote bullshit! I don't care if a girl is cis or trans; it's all good. Hell, I wish I were trans just to piss off transphobes."
"'BUT WHAT (gong) ABOUT (gong) THE PENIS (gong)' is probably my favorite part of the video. I love Natalie's presentations because of the whole aesthetic, but also because she's always able to find a point between comedy and seriousness, and makes some very good points without being extremely academic."
"Two things I hate on YouTube that are constantly on it tick tock adverts and the question are traps gay? Only a question that comes from supposably heterosexual people when they realise they're attraction to the queer end of the spectrum is finally being burst like a bubble thank goodness. Oh no,  I react in the most stupidest way and ask the most stupidest question of all time. When I finally got over myself and realise I was about to walk on the wild side and that I do find all feminine women and feminine transgendered women attractive the question put above I realised was ridiculous. The queer boy wants to be trapped in a closet with a trap."
"Dankula admits to jerking off to the degenerate trap shit, so if anything, he's on your side"

"The answer is no. 'Trap' means he / she looks feminine. Being attracted to someone feminine as a man makes you hetero, not homosexual. Similarly being attracted to Joi in Bladerunner2049 or Ava from Ex Machina doesn't make you a roboto-phile. Whether the trap identifies as male or female or has a dick or not, etc doesn't matter."
"this video contains disappointingly little anime"
"Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I've heard the '29 murders' statistic quoted a lot as if it's high... but isn't that actually quite low? If there are 1 million trans people in the US that's a homicide rate of 2.9/100k, well below the 4.9/100k for the nation as a whole.  Otherwise quite like the video."

"Dude (that's a gender neutral thing)   I just thought this shit was educational.   -middle aged cis straight square nerd who loves you"
"First I want to say that your videos are always entertaining and your are arguments well argued and well articulated. You seem self aware, have a great sense of humor, and have a good grasp of morality. I think the most important message you have conveyed in this video is:  'A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves!' I really couldn't agree more with this.  That being said, I almost always disagree with almost everything you say in every video. So let's talk about a few of those contentious points: 1. The term 'Trap', as used in its birthplace, the anime community,  refers to a CIS gendered males 90% of the time. Astalfo (the effeminate gentleman in the portrait in the background), Felix, Ruka, Hasuta, Saika, Hideyoshi, they all identify as men. Exactly 0% of them have taken hormones or had 'the surgery'. Many of them not only identify as men, but are straight to boot. They are just men who naturally look like cute girls, which is essentially a fantasy concept. So, I think taking this topic seriously in the context of the real world is a bit of a mistake, since there is hardly any real world equivalent. It is like calling someone who engages in bestiality a furry.  2. The only reason we are talking about this at all is because as the word trap began to normalize this concept of desirable cute boys,  real life weebs began to self-identify as traps and market themselves as such. They would post lewd photos of themselves in trap threads on 4chan and such.  My point is that there are people who self-identify as traps, and so for other people like you to declare that that isn't a valid identity isn't really fair. The people who are offended by this term believe its usage to be far more widespread than it is, and that is is used by the kind of people who exhibit transpanic behavior. It is not. It is mostly used by those who identify themselves as such, and thirsty-ass 'chaser' weeaboos.  3. No one calls futanari traps. I think you are lacking in the requisite weeb knowledge for some parts of this discussion. Lucky you.  4. Being offended by the word trap is such a missed opportunity. The more popular traps become, the less stigma there is around being attracted to them. Trying to shut it down is like Pelosi having the illegals that came to her house taken away by the police instead of inviting them in and showing them some hospitality even though they disgust her. Just a complete lack of self-awareness and no understanding of PR. You should be spreading the love for traps as much as possible.  5. Transpanic violence is inexcusable. Even when the victim really did intentionally deceive the perpetrator in some way. However, I think telling your potential partner 'I have a penis' before getting naked together in a hotel room is a good idea. It is best to be honest and not waste people's time.  6. White masculinity? I'd love to see the breakdown by race of those who are guilty of transpanic murder. From the little research I did, it seems disproportionately non-white. So let's not try to blame transpanic on whiteness.  Now we are getting in to the primary point of contention. I don't think that trans women are women. Though, I don't think they are men either. In any case, let's break down your arguments for why trans women are 'real' women. 1. 'The people who are attracted to trans women are primarily people who self-identify as straight men, therefore trans women are women'.  There are a couple issues I take with this idea. First of all, it isn't like they are objectively straight, this is a self evaluation. People don't self evaluate accurately even with benign things, so something like their sexuality is definitely going to be an issue. More importantly than that, you are using circular logic. If having sex with traps is gay, then the men having sex with traps are gay, regardless of anything else. In order to call them straight men, you have to have already concluded that traps are not gay. Additionally, straight men are known to have sex with a lot of things, just like you say in the video. They fuck trees, tessellating marble floors, and other 'straight' men. Those trees, tessellating marble floors, and 'straight' men are not women, so why would them having sex with a trans woman mean that trans women are women?   2. 'Sexuality is based on presentation and behavior'. I think this is half true. It is half true because there are two elements of attraction, and this is one of them. The other half is sex and all the things surrounding sex, like building a family. If a man can only be happy with a partner who has a vagina, then even if he is initially attracted to someone who is presenting as a woman but has a penis, the man is never going to be able to have a real relationship with that other person. When a straight man sees someone that he perceives to be an attractive woman, he is typically going to imagine having vaginal sex with them. If they find that their partner does not have a vagina, they are likely to lose interest in that person. Now I do think that these two factors are of different levels of importance for different people. I think that when certain straight men meet a trans women with 'pop', as you say, they sort of think of it as a compromise. They get to be with someone who has a very attractive presentation at the cost of there being a penis, and they are OK with that, even though they prefer a vagina. The question is does this compromise constitute a breech of heterosexuality.  3. I think that what makes a person a woman is a lot more complicated than any of these arguments. It involves many different factors, which is why any argument like 'it is based on chromosomes' or 'it is about identifying as a woman' ends up coming off as incomplete. Not only are there many factors, but each factor should be weighted differently. For example, how feminine a person's behavior is can be a factor, but someone who has feminine behavior but also has a penis and identifies as a man is definitely a man. It would be hard to map out all these factors and their weights. I will say that in my opinion, even if you 'pass' as a woman and present as a woman, if you have a penis, you are not a woman. I still wouldn't call you a fake woman though. You are just a trans woman, which to me is its own unique category.  Perhaps an even more important question is 'What does it mean to be gay (for a man)?'. Is it being attracted to people who are biologically male? Or being attractive to masculinity? Or is it something more complex? If we can answer that question, then we may be able to answer the 'are traps gay?' question even if we can't all agree on what makes someone a women.  Hopefully someday science advances to the point where trans women can become undeniably women. Then we can finally be done with this mess. Also, to anyone who spent the time to read this entire youtube comment essay on traps, I'm sorry."
"So does sitting on your balls not hurt or what?"
"Where is your head, exactly, that you feel the NEED to put 'cis' in front of what men and women ARE naturally? Like ... humans are born and - except for a teeny tiny minority (that want trans to stop co-opting their INHERENT intersex experience) - ARE male or female BECAUSE OF their reproductive organs. Literally a state of being, either male or female. Down to the parts of you that you can't even see with your naked eyes, you are that immutable being. AN IMMUTABLE STATE OF BEING, NOT A FEELING. A thousand surgeries and a million pills will never alter that state of being.  Your existence as man or woman is second ONLY to your existence as a human.  However, the transgender community now feels ENTITLED to place a qualifier - CIS - in front of our natural state of being. This slur - and it IS a slur - labels our natural being as UNNATURAL. If you are living AS THE SEX YOU WERE BORN WITH, they say that YOU are the freakshow. They say: YOUR UNNATURAL STATE OF BEING MUST BE DESCRIBED. And in the meantime, do they go by 'transwoman' and 'transman?' No. THEY have commandeered 'woman' and 'man,' WITHOUT QUALIFIERS, without adjectives.  With this qualifier, CIS, they have stolen our very EXISTENCE."

"Con-trap-oints, I get it."
"25:25 I love it, lets turn it around! If you jerk of to it, you should give it rights!"
"I had the chance to sleep with a transwomen, I felt down her pants and didn't know whether it was a penis or a vagina. I ended up leaving her that night without doing anything. I feel bad and I knew she was trans before, but I just wasn't emotionally prepared. I'm a straight androgenous genderqueer male, and I feel terrible about doing that to someone after getting there hopes up. I hope that in the future if the chance ever arises I will be more emotionally mature to accept the advances of a trans woman, thank you for making this video Natalie."
"This same parts reference!!! (great video btw)"
"Time to rematch this for third time to fully enjoy the high production value."
"Cincinnati people CALLED OUT."
"I really don't have much to say, except that you have consistently been my favourite internet/youtube person of 2018. I am in awe of your wit, courage, integrity (and also beauty). Watching your videos, even those that are about troubling and sometimes painful issues, invariably leave me feeling happy and optimistic (or at least more happy and optimistic than I was feeling before). Thank you for being you and doing what you do and I hope you will continue doing it for a long time to come. ^_^"
"i fucking love you"
"28:04 - unbleeped version pls"
"I hear sarabande - Handel as the background check a few seconds into the video, instant like. I LOVE that piece."
"Natalie, you are KILLING IT. Every video just gets better and better, and your arguments are just as strong, well thought, and well spoken as always. Thank you SO much for this content."
"Gonna leave a quote here  'But surely an account that begins and ends with 'I'm not a man because I don't Identify as one' is pretty weak.'"
"CW: Transphobia, Homophobia  I watched a movie the other night titled, 'The Crying Game'. Maybe you've heard of it. Here's all you need to know.  The 1992 film is rather infamous for its 'reveal' shot that the object of the main character's affections is, in fact, a trans woman. Fergus, our protagonist, reacts by screaming 'i think im gonna vomit', violently shoving her to the ground (with an arm across the face that causes her nose to bleed), and audibly retches/vomits offscreen for an extended period of time. He retains his relationship with her through to the end of the film, though he continues to misgender her, and constantly interjects that she's 'not a lady'. This thread coincides with another regarding his struggling with implied feelings for a man earlier in the film, and the resolution of the film's character arc revolves around his choosing not to care or ignore queerness rather than accept/embrace it, or even acknowledge Dil's validity as a woman.  The film plays like the internal monologue of one of the men Natalie addresses in this video, all the way down to its final resting point of 'ok fine sure she's a woman... BUT'. Attractions to trans women are linked to Homosexuality both textually thematically, and the crux of the work is the male angst of working through those nebulous, corrosive gay feels.  Its fascinating how completely it falls into every pitfall of ____phobic mentality that Natalie outlines in this video."
"Dont know if i will understand how people can be awful to one group of people, then go whack it to some porn depicting said group later."
"So what you're saying is women from Cincinnati shouldn't expect men to want to date them, unless they're into that sort of thing?"
"Looooool V.I.C.T.O.R.Y!!!  This video was awesome. Love the makeup, and the philosophical genius."
"Yo, I'd suck the fuck out of a female dick"
"If you don't disclose your sex (with or without a penis being present) to the person that you are/want to have sex with then 'it's a trap', technically if could be considered as 'rape by deception', it doesn't matter how you identify, it only matters if it would affect the other persons decision to have sex."
"Traps, are not transactuals.  They are just men that dress up as woman. Soo they are closer to drag Queens.  But I refuse to call drag Queens traps. Traps are focused on cuteness and cosplay. Drag is just over the top and flamboyant.  That is just way to much for me.   So, I love traps but dislike drag, trans I don't really care ether way. It's the over the top flamboyantness that I find of puting. Same with girls.  A awesome trap is a YouTuber, BOXBOX."

"sexuality is as much on a spectrum as trans women.  i mean as much as gender heh.   these boys, well one in a hundred are secure with what they want and that's the ones that make it all worthwhile."
"In my country we made a festival called 'Trapito Fest', that means Little Trap fest :3..."
"You pop"
"I always say 'if traps are gay, I don't want to be straight!' whenever I come across such a conversation. As of yet, nobody has replied to this. But in reality I don't care. I never even understood the question until you outlined the terrible concept of 'trans-panic'. I legit do not understand this. (I'm a cis male btw, so I somehow think I should understand it. But I don't.)  I don't even know why I don't understand it. I always think 'If I like a woman, and we hit it off, her having a penis would just be one fact about her.' Am I weird?"
"This is so fucking awesome. Not just the script, but the edit and overall production of it is so beautiful and well done!"
"only if the ballz touch"
"It ain't just that she's insanely smart. It's that she knows how to get her points across to people who ain't on her level... people like me üòÅ The ability to explain complex ideas in such an accessible manner is a very rare gift."

"You look amazing in ANY wig. How!!!!  Amazing video as always."
"Thumbs up for demystifying the tuck, if nothing else. Kinda always wondered. Thanks!"
"Whenever I encountered this meme 3 years ago, it was all out of context.   So as a true meathead I thought it was about men attracted to the trapezius muscle. Maybe it was the then latent bisexuality but I thought this was TOTALLY normal."

"I accidentally came in my own eye once. It was painful and confusing. Also I dig Count Dankula's channel. The good Count delves pretty deep into the darker more taboo and weird parts of society and is pretty funny in a 'don't cut yourself on that edge' way."
"From Cincinnati here. Feeling very attacked at 14:51."
"another great video Ms. Points!"
"23:29 I understand male homosexuality in terms of liking things with dicks. I like dicks. I like vaginas. Therefore I'm bi.  Plenty of men only like one or the other - they might still be sexually attracted to a person with either, but they have preferences. I can't speak for all men, of course. I wonder how many other men are actually attracted to genitals rather than superficial sexual features.  I expect it would be fairly high, and I can understand people being pissed off if they are unexpectedly exposed to genitals of a type they dislike (though reacting with violence is, of course, completely disproportionate, and I'm not trying to defend the actions of people who murder trans women, I'm just saying I understand why they would be angry)."
"You are one of my favorite YouTubers never stop"
"Good video"
"A long haired hippy man is hitchhiking out west, when a semi truck driver picks him up.  After several hours of silence, the hippy asks the driver, 'aren't you going to ask me if I'm a man or a woman?'  The truck driver replies, 'oh.  That doesn't matter.  I'm gonna f@#% you anyway.'  Not sure what that has to do with this, but I thought I'd share.   Love your channel, sweetie."
"Natalie, you are enchanting."
"Great video, once again. Is a 'chick with dick' an okey term to refer to a transwoman who is okey with her penis, or is that term one should only use when scripting a youtube-video about touchy subjects and also identifies as a person such term might refer to?  I especially liked the last part about sis-men like me protecting our identity. I like to think I don't do that, but then again admitting quilt is not straight male -like.  'Are traps gay?' was always the wrong question. All along it was scared men, taught to live up to identity they were raised in, fearing they might brake the sacred code of manhood"
"I was expecting the mouthfeel and I wasn't let down"
"I really don‚Äòt appreciate how you speak about Count Dankula and in which context you mention him. The reason as to why he was convicted is ridiculous. The video he made was clearly meant to be humorous and he even (not so) indirectly states that Nazis are the worst since he wants to make his cute dog be a Nazi (in this contrast lies the joke).  Just so you know, he used to be a dirty comulist just like we are, he could be won back, I am sure of it. For this to happen however, one would have to show him some respect instead of using him as an example of a bad person."
"Gay men are not into dick by itself. Source: I've tried."
"It is one of the most enigmatic questions of the modern world. Scholars throughout the ages have spent lifetimes in dusty libraries, hunched over eldritch tomes and immersed in a sea of forbidden knowledge, but none have as of yet come forward, nay discovered the answer. it is a confounding mystery throughout the centuries. it was one of the first sentences ever recorded, found etched into the ruins at the site of the first temple of humankind. it has appeared and reappeared throughout all of history, it shows up in ancient manuscripts, in the temple-hieroglyphs of Giza's burial chambers, on a doorframe discovered by the spanish conquistadores in chile, chiseled into the colloseum, the taj mahal, and the washington monument alike. it is found on a scrap of paper pinned to the very top of the Burj Kalifa, it is enscribed on the flag atop the mount everest, but no living soul has the answer."
"What if I think gender and intercourse are meaningless outside of reproductive output?"
"As a cis lesbian who has been in a relationship with a trans girl right after coming out, i was worried people would think 'well its fine she's not really a lesbian after all' upon learning that my ex-girlfriend was trans.  Lesbian TERFs get on my nerves so much, reducing lesbianism to 'being attracted to vaginas' is not only transphobic but deeply misogynist and lesbophobic too. As you mentioned, this stupid opinion is obviously ignorant of what a romantic and sexual relationship with a trans woman feels like. Yes i love women and female bodies, including trans bodies. Lesbianism as i experience it has been mostly about the persistent desire to put women at the center of my life, not only my love life but in a broader way my social life. Pussy is such a small part of it (don't get me wrong, pussy is great but it's definitely not defining lesbianism)"
"Futanari and dickgirls are NOT traps. Nor are transsexuals ffs... it's just an anime fetish thing. It's amazing how people appropriated a word from a niche community just to feel offended over it. But sure, the word is ruined now, keep it, congrats on your shiny new slur.  (And just as a beside, early 2000's 4chan was way more progressive towards LGBT than most of the rest of the internet back then - except livejournal - YES that changed, but consider that it was during that time that the word was invented. The 'trap' was that it proved people that they weren't as straight as they thought, it was super important to the definition of the word that 'traps' were male, physically and mentally, and NOT trans)  tl;dr you are NOT a trap but you keep arguing that the word is directed at you for some reason"
"I don't know, if a man finds vulvas unattractive that is a little bit gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
"Nothing calms me after a long day of enjoying my white privilege like a fat dab and a new contrapoints video"
"I've always seen the word trap as being broad and referring to any biological male (with a penis) that is feminine and beautiful enough to sexually attract a straight man. Whether or not they identify as women or just as crossdressing men doesn't matter."
"Okay, but can we talk about the misalignment of the hairline with the 50/50 facepaint?"
"And THAT is why I, as an LGBT person, believe LGBT people should own more guns, specially women."
"I wanted to say something meaningful but what could compare to 'what would I do with a sacred passage? Get fingered by the pope?'"
"My only issue here is that Natalie seems to imply that 'it is gay' if the woman has not been on hormones. All her arguments are completely valid, but she keeps adding in all the effects of hormones as if that's the only way a transwoman can be understood as a woman to a straight man's sexuality (as opposed to his social understanding). Of course it's more likely that way, but it is in no way exclusive. Thoughts?"
"As a straight man, I can confirm that the 'pop' is real.  The causes vary from guy to guy, but for me I *think* it's a mix of curves, hip sway, eyes and smell.  Trans women can absolutely cause the 'pop'.  Also this is a really useful term.  I think Straight-Cis-Guys would genuinely benefit from a larger and more nuanced vocabulary to help solve the problem we have at 32:32 - there's a surprising amount of different stuff bundled up and grouped together under 'straight'"
"45 minutes of ContraPoints? Hell yes."

"This has helped me process my feelings on these subjects immensely. Looking forward to browsing through your catalog, thanks for sharing."
"I disagree with a lot of points in this one but I love your channel."
"I feel like this one was the least polished in quite a bit of time, but it felt a lot more like you were telling what you thought and it was hilarious, so very refreshing. Looking forward to the next one."
"Why are we defining what real vaginas are according to the sexual preferences of men rather than the real lives of people born with vaginas?"
"I can't even describe how much I love Contra."
"Thanks Natalie, love you! <3"
"I know you got your start in New Atheist youtube back in the day so I don't know whether this was intentional but your use of language as Foppington (?) at the beginning of the video was like a spectacular parody of Christopher Hitchens. I've often thought that part of the reason he had a reputation as an good orator had much to do with his verbosity: he'd use quasi-legalistic terminology like 'adduce' and 'rejoined' much like you have in this piece. Even the cadence of your character's speech is quite similar! I'd love to make a video analysing his use of language, but until that eventuates I appreciate you poking fun at it here - assuming it was intentional!"
"Horrifying right off the bat. I'll see those eyes in my nightmares now."
"As a lesbian yes, being with a trans woman is hella gay."
"Will the next video be the lesbian version? 'Are traps straight'...? (Fatuous thing to say, sorry, there's no call for it...) As usual, I really like the unapologetic depths you go into with these topics, because you're right - sexuality IS complicated. Giving people specific labels is a good starting point, but the complications are hard to ignore when topics, such as the ones you raised, are at hand. The point you raised about straight men's obsession with dicks is something I sometimes wonder, because there are many times I have felt that I'm the only straight man who likes the vulva more than the dick (not to mention finding it more interesting and more aesthetically pleasing). And another thing I hadn't really considered, was the fact that among the reactionary machismo-esque minded, heterosexuality is as much about performance and bedroom roles as it is attraction. So, by those standards, despite the fact that I've never had even the slightest hint of attraction to a man, my fantasies of being ridden, bridal carried over the threshold, sucked on and protected by strong-jawed women more stereotypically masculine than I am makes me the gayest gent ever."
"Ok but WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT NATALIE‚ÄôS ICONIC DIAMOND BROW???"
"'Transgender' is a slur for 'Trap'."
"My mom is so cool!"
"As a guy who used to be a total d bag when it came to these kinds of subjects I just want to say thank you for both reafirming what I already belive as a more positive way to think and also educating me on some subjects. I‚Äôve always strived to be a better person and you and your channel are actually helping me with this!  I also appreciate the wash your penis parody book that genuinely made me laugh out loud"
"I love your videos. They're so educational. Although I may not agree with some of the things you've pointed out (due to religious beliefs), I don't think I'd argue them either because I respect you as a human being. But there's more to why I don't argue. Man has created so many definitions in order to hold power over others & that to me...is a sin because it's playing God & a sly way to be prejudice without consequence. I wish people would stop seeing everything as black & white & understand the concept of a rainbow.   Sexuality is like food. If it taste good, eat it...so if it feels good, fuck it. No need to worry about all this other bullcrap. I totally agree it hurts cis/trans/gays to fling the word trap around or to even care about what's 'gay'. I am a ciswoman who enjoys presenting myself with a traditionally 'masculine' look and I have had heterosexual men question whether they're gay for liking me. I've had gay men like me specifically because of my presentation. I've even been called a butch....& honestly it's made me feel animosity towards gay women (which I shouldn't) because I'm mistaken for them.   If only the term 'gay' or 'homosexual' didn't exist, I don't think people would feel the need to protect their 'straight' pride. I'm a religious person (Christian) & I've come to understand it's none of our business to care or judge others for what they want to do. There are so many man made concepts that have ruined how we get along in society. Because of these concepts, it's made your life being who/what you want to be incredibly difficult no matter your sexual or gender identity.   I personally only disliked gays not because they are gay. But because they make it seem like being gay when defines them....when it really shouldn't....because they're defining their life like that- Others will become more prejudice. I care more about what someone has accomplished in life. Their character. Not what they want to fuck. That is an irrelevant topic unless they're dating someone who cares about it. It's a stupid concept. Maybe what I'm suggesting is a hippie concept of 'love the person for a person'. Because of my religious values, I find the idea of only dating someone for their looks or genitals really shallow. If anything it should be a bonus to their relationship."
"Very interesting and well made content, which is getting a lot better. Awesome stuff, keep it up!"
"ugh LOML"
"That trans women are women and man having sex with women is straight is... controversial to say the least. Trans women may be women (depending on how you define women), but they're male. Males being attracted to males is gay.  I'm bisexual, so I don't really need to care, but redefining words for political purposes is nonsensical and makes you look unreasonable and authoritarian. You can't dictate to the world what 'gay' and 'woman' mean, and declare certain uses of the words offensive. Language is descriptive, not prescriptive, and words should have definitions people can agree on so that our language can be used to effectively communicate.  Two people define 'woman' differently, and that can sometimes lead to one of them murdering the other due to the misunderstanding. Semantics is far more important than most people consider. I think that a lot of hatred of trans people would simply vanish if they started calling themselves masculine women (rather than trans-men) and feminine men (rather than trans-women)."
"Just saying, Count Dankula's video answering this question was hilarious, hate crime conviction or no."
"Harsh! But fabulous makeup and outfits, Kudos."
"Thanks, you'va answered the questions I had in some manner... well, mostly in knowing who's attracted to Trans women... As for the main question, I recall back in the 90s some guys saying they would punch a women if they found a dick between their legs, even back then I though that they did not have to take it but... but why be so defensive about your own insecurity? and why be so agressive about it?  There is one aspect you have not touched, some guys (and gals) really want a family at some point, and let's say they don't want to raise someone else's kid(s) (which may sound illegitimate to you, but it is a valid point for many, and well... some people have to make those kids, you may as well try to start one in your selected circumstances from day one)... Obviously that is a problem that cannot be resolved.  Now it's good to see your transition goes well (I follow Peterson as well, and I would not place his image beside Shapiro's, they're completely different)."

"u get hotter every video i think im gay for you or hetero for you"
"Let's take a look at what is accepted fact:  Man x Man: gay Woman x woman: gay trans woman x trans woman: gay trans man x trans man: gay  So why do people all of a sudden think  trans woman x woman: straight?  Or even  trans man x man: straight?  Really enjoyed the video.  I actually learned quite a bit, as I always do from your wonderful work, Natalie!"
"I love you contra, as a masculine presenting lesbian I have always questioned my gender and recently started experimenting with men. But I'm still only really romantically and physically attracted to woman, sex is just a fun thing to do with people you connect with. People should be more open and stop policing labels. I get branded a lesbian and then told I'm not a lesbian for experimenting with my male friends but the thing is... I never came out as gay in the first place, I have been mistaken for a boy since i was a kid and people made assumptions about my sexuality before i was even aware of it. Pretty fucked up. Things can seem complicated but everyone just wants to have fun and feel loved and validated at the end of the day."
"But isn't it that wanting to be a real man what makes men kill transfemales? If a transwoman wants to be a real woman, doesn't she transform her toxic masculism into a kind of toxic femininity? Shouldn't one generally prefer to emancipate oneself from these outdated structures (real woman/man)?"
"13:40 I just have to stop the video to say I am forever in awe of your incredible range of characters and makeup work. (And the lighting.)  Oh, and yay for bringing back Lady Foppington.  (That's not what you said in the Parisian salon last night OH-HO-HO-HO-HO!)"
"Yes"
"But what about the mouthfeel tho?"
"Now bra, I think you might be goin' insane... but in a cute, stylish fashion still."

"Our crops gayyy?????????"
"I fucking love you. I was falling in a spiraling hole of anxiety, stress and depression. Then, I popped on to get a distraction and saw a new video from you. I was smiling and enjoying the entire video like a clapping giggling 3-year-old, enthusiastic over the pretty colors of the rainbow. I caught myself with a gleeful smile many times while viewing without realizing I was doing it. Then you brought up an argument I have not heard others talk about in regards to this subject matter... What's so wrong with being gay? I jumped out of my seat ready to applaud the question. You made me feel understood. Yes, in part because I'm gay and you said the word-and-oh-god-she-said-the-thing! But, more than that, because you helped me see that other people think like me. Or at the very least, that other people think about the same things I do. I felt, less alone, affirmed. It gave me hope. Thank  you, I really needed that."
"The arguments brought forth in 'Being straight is pretty gay' is pretty insightful as to how the current popular perception of cultural 'straightness' is... pretty fucking pointless.  Also, I hurt a little inside at the end of 'I have feelings too' when Natalie popped open that wine bottle and muttered GOD DAMN IT, because she's tired and bitter at that moment, and no one deserves that."

"Can I get a link to the song that plays at Part 5? I'll pay just to hear the whole thing."
"The reason I personally feel trans women are offended by the word trap is because it is unjustly used on various characters that are actually trans.  I feel like the word still has a use and is perfectly harmless if used on the right people in the right way.  I would describe a trap as an individual who cross dresses regularly but does not experience gender or physical dysphoria.  A perfect example of this word being used correctly is astoflo from fate who's just a guy that's in to everything cute.  I perfect example of a misuse of this concept is gasper from High School DxD who experiences minor physical dysphoria and discomfort when confronted about his choice of clothing.  Feel free to express your opinion."
"the way you write and think makes my brain so fuckin wet omg... <3"

"I once met a cis bisexual woman who said she would absolutely only date cis women and cis men. She even said that she wouldn't date a man who'd had sex with another man. As a bisexual woman myself I found her attachment to the 'true biological sexes' really bizarre (and not to mention transphobic and homophobic). Really quite sad"
"The Mouthfeel restaurant section blew my mind in the best way. My friends and partners have definitely discussed this but I never would have thought of the way you did it.  I also want to share this video far and wide for all the transphobes that need it but can't share it on my personal social media because all my friends are people who get it and I don't want to offend the trans women I know with the title. I will be sharing this video online whenever the opportunity arises from strangers and friends who let it slip they aren't as work as they think they are.  Also as an agender person, trans women, please come to us non-binary folks. We love all bodies and will cherish the people in them."

Your style is really evolving quite lovely overall though."
"if Contra is a meme and this video is A psychosexual journey to the heart of a bad meme imagine if the gutteral drumbeats was the sound of Nat's heart as it reaches sexual climax?"
"Brava!"
"As a cis man who started identifying as bi based mostly on an attraction to trans women (as well as a rare attraction to men). This video gave me a lot to think about. Especially the part where Natalie lists the 3 general types of men that want to date trans women, since I'd fit into a kind of category 2.5 because I do kind of fetishize the female penis to some extent in the sense that I'm aroused by the idea of being topped by a trans woman and going down on her. That being said, if I was to date a trans woman I also wouldn't care if she got **THE SURGERY** because I'm also aroused by vaginas.  Considering all of these things I started thinking about where I fit in regarding my attraction to trans women and whether it's right to say that I'm bi. Especially because it's true that I occasionally internalise my sexual identity as being straight, for example, when people talk about 'straight men' I feel like they're referring to me and will remind myself that I'm actually bi. However, for every moment I find myself thinking of myself as straight, there'll be another moment when I think of myself as bi, such as any time I find myself attracted to or fantasising about cis men. Plus, one of the main reasons I say I'm bi is actually because I think that that's they way the majority of people would most easily understand my sexuality. For example, when I tried to explain my sexuality to my mum, I told her I was hetero-flexible and tried to explain what that meant to her. This was met on her part with confusion and denial and part of me thinks that if I'd have just said I was bi, then she would have been able to understand how I feel more easily. But if one of the main reasons I say I'm bit is for the benefit of others and not because that's how I actually feel, do I really have any right to say I'm bi?  Well, fortunately, I did manage to come to a conclusion and my conclusion is this: Who the fuck cares about what's straight, gay, and bi anyway? As Natalie pointed out, none of those things are wrong and therefore it shouldn't matter if you consider certain things to be gay or, in my case, bi. Everyone should just like who they like and enjoy the sex acts that they enjoy etc. and not worry about what it says about their sexuality. Don't get me wrong, if anyone is actually curious about my sexuality, I'd still say I was bi because I still pretty much fit the definition and I still think that's the easiest way someone's going to understand it. I'll just try not to get too hung up on it myself."

"Gay boy here: I can definitely say that if being into trans women was gay I had a hard time calling myself gay. I love trans women but I consistently percieve them as women and... I'm not into women. There has been exceptions and I understand that part of my outwards sexuality comes from consciously trying to not be with women (I guess my gayness is slightly fragile), but I also naturally tend to really not be attracted to women, cis or trans. Really, trans women are women and if you're gay, you're not into women (unless you are)"

"'Centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle.'  Weird, I don't remember telling anyone about that dream."

"This is a great video, but I find that both trans people and transphobes don't understand traps. Traps are basically like drag queens, cross dressers. They dress like girls and there intent is to trick men, it's why their called traps.  Futanari would be closer to trans women, as they are literally biologically female excpet for the dick. Thats my two cents anyways."
"allow me to be vulgar for a moment. I am attracted to women. I'd like to suck a dick, or take one up the ass, but I am not attracted to men. 'traps' are like a gift from GOD, and I don't even believe in the big sky daddy! though I am a shut in, my opinions wont hurt anyone in the wild"

I liked hearing the Jonathan Haidt reference. I think with all your dialectic dialogues, you're a bit of a centrist IDW sympathizer on some level. I mean this as a compliment, btw: I get the feeling that you truly do value free speech. Never change, Natalie, you're one of the good 'sjews' <3"
"Not always, but if you want to fuck one,your gay.  I have no idea why this is even a question, if a person has a dick and you have a dick,you gay if you fuck,its about language. 2 dudes,2 girls = gay period.  I would like to add that im a strait dude, and as a strait dude,you confuse me,js"

"The amount of violence trans people face is ridiculous. If I happen to not 100% pass all the time and someone picks up on the fact I'm more feminine than other boys it's amazing how quickly they become violent towards me. Let's just say if I was a cis guy nobody would go to grope me to try and 'prove I'm fake'."
"I am constantly amazed by the sheer style of your videos.  I mean, the content is wonderful too, but the visual style you've developed is a feast for the eyes every time.  Propping, lighting, angles, costume, and makeup are all 'just so' and it's perfect <3"

"In my field,  I do psychology research into sexual attraction and romantic relationships-- I have found that in key points, the sciences are at an impasse and researchers keep getting stuck; because, as you attested, humans cannot see chromosomes, we only perceive the gender as manifested in bodily appearance.

"Let me rephrase the question 'Is a straight dude wanting to fuck Rupaul or [Insert drag queen/crossdressers here] gay?'  that's what the question is referring to in the context, 'Are traps gay?' is referring to 'Is it gay to want to fuck a guy (A self identified male, examples like Astoflo, Felix Argyle, or Bridget) who wears female clothing, knowing its a guy?' (often gay dudes.) Then you have a more accurate video to the actual topic at hand."
"i think you often make casual remarks that throw trans women who don't yet or don't want to pass as cis women under the bus. like i know youre making this video for the people who know absolutely nothing and need to be convinced, but im just not sure im comfortable with 20:27 onwards and the implication that 'it''s not gay because trans women can look like cis women. like, what, is anyone who dates a trans women who hasn't, isn't or can't transition attracted to men now? this argument, to me, doesn't seem like it'll stop transphobia, but only reroute it to hit women who don't pass as cis, aka the trans women who already have it really hard. i just feel like this whole 'see? i pass, i have titties, so i'm a real woman!' doesn't uplift anyone but yourself"

"Genuinely curious. I know people that don‚Äôt use trap to describe real people at all, only the increasingly common archetype of characters within anime that appear/dress feminine but do not self identity as a woman at all. Ie; not actually trans but just drawn fem   In my experience when they say ‚Äútrap character‚Äù it‚Äôs in reference to that. And it was my understanding that this is the original usage (not referring to real trans people)  Tho when I‚Äôve heard it discussed it‚Äôs always predicated on the idea that trap is being used to describe real trans women.   Do you see any difference between the two? Or does that not make a difference to you as a trans women?   (I wrote this while watching so if u talk about this after the 12 minutes mark my bad)"

"Admittedly, I was surprised to here you quote Jonathan Haidt, what with this whole 'SJW's made our kids fragile' argument he's been pushing on the Joe Rogan podcast as of late... And that people who were accused of sexual harassment/ misconduct durning the hight of #metoo are now big fans of his because they see his comments on social media and callout culture as a defence. Maybe it's a different Jonathan Haidt? Regardless of his work - Yours is what I come for. c:"
"To be honest, I first really got into transgender porn. That started it for me, my curiosity. But I reckon I'm reflected enough to disregard slurs and dehumanization that happens to transgender porn performers.  Then again, there's an army out there looking at cis women porn with nothing but absolute hate and vitriol towards women in real life."
"As a cit het guy and long time fan this was probably one of your best videos to date. Thank the greeks for our philosopher queen natalie!"
"Hi ContraPoints and fans, I think I have some interesting inputs on a point that was never addressed in this video. Of course the word trap can be used as a slurr on transgendered people, but my first experiences with the word had nothing to do with trans poeple and more to do with crossdressing. One of my first memories of the word was when I was a 16 year old edgelord who thought 4chan was a cool secret club.  I encountered a thread on 4chan of a straight male shaving his legs. He was posting pictures of this while asking if he would make a good 'trap'. This was a cisgendered male crossdressing with the intent to convince people attracted to women that he was a cisgendered woman, so he could reveal he was male. This was a regular 'prank' on 4chan at the time. Essentially it was people saying 'Ha ha! You thought I didn't have a penis, but I have a penis!'  That was the original use of the word in the word trap in the context of gender, to my understanding (tell me if I'm wrong). Then it broadened to mean anything the looks like a woman but has a penis. Then it broadened further to become a slurr on transpeople, who may or may not have a penis or may have had a penis in the past or may have a penis S O O N. This is the definition that escaped 4chan and into the memeverse the majority of people.  This has led to a divide where some people only know the word as a slurr, while others say it without the intent to offend, and these are both cases of ignorance on how the word has traveled. I believe our best bet is to educate both parties on the history of the word, then convince the latter to stop saying it knowing how it has changed.  I'm not being an apologist here, if you want less people to call others traps, this will make more people stop using the word, that's the goal, right?  In conclusion, are traps gay? Well, what do you mean by 'traps', or 'gay' for that matter? It is a blanket term with no clear answer because sexuality is a spectrum and you shouldn't get hung up on what's gay or what's not.  P.S. Saying' real men' are confident in their sexual desires is still gatekeeping, insecure ignorant douchebags are still real men. They're real shitheads too."

"No topic is too harmful to discuss. But it did take me more than 24 hours to work up the nerve to watch this video due to PTSD and shit. So, thanks for making this video and all the others. Thanks for going past 13:25. I needed this video today more than you could know. You are too legit to quit."
"Just skip to 14:27 for the answer it‚Äôs not gay only if you believe that person is a women it‚Äôs not gay After she will explain in full detail  (Btw don‚Äôt know anything about transgender don‚Äôt really care anyway ima virgin so I don‚Äôt I have a opinion)"
"I loved the video! You always present your information so clearly and concisely. Though, one thing I thought wasn't touched upon by you was gender presentation and roles. I'm from the anime community where this slur really took off and people always used it on highly feminine men. Like in the source material these men would often say they were men ( now that might say something about how Japan doesn't understand that trans people exist, but that's an issue for another day.)  My point is that the audience is too stuck in general roles and presentation to accept the fact that people can dress and act and look how they want, (on top of the effects it has on trans folks.)  Either way, I've been trying to get across to others in the Anime community that this word affects trans people, and I don't want to hear it from them for some time. Thank you for putting this together, I can't wait to share it."

Alas, if only my college courses could be this interesting. Anyway I think you should also know that you look absolutely fabulous by the way."
"Natalie, I normally love your videos but I feel this one missed the point a little bit. With 4chan-speak, 'trap' refers to guys who crossdress, not transgendered people. I'm only halfway through the video so ignore me if this is addressed, but the core conceit of the idea is whether or not it's gay to be attracted to cis males who can convincingly look like a woman."
"As a straight cis man with no attraction to trans women, this was very interesting and I love your content. I hope you continue growing on YouTube and can make a positive change on this platform and outside of it"
"I have the feel that traps and trans are being equated here, I find it a bit wierd since It's kind of an umbrella word more or less disconnected from transidentity, but can be aplied to trans ppl ... in some cases I mean, it's more or less 'geek' or right on weaboo culture, and I can think of many traps that are not trans, I'm thinking of that nice portrait I see on that background"
"The blas√© way you talk about chopping off your dick is extremely irresponsible. The surgery will never give you a vagina it‚Äôs an imitation, that requires sometimes uncomfortable maintenance. It is a high maintenance body modification. My vagina self cleans, and i don‚Äôt have to worry about it closing up. I don‚Äôt hate transgender people, and I am really worried about you contra being so casual about major surgery. I really wonder how this will affect trans women when they have reached 80 and they need assistance in self care. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to have the surgery for people who take it seriously, who understand the risks, and upkeep. You should also always be upfront with sexual partners not just about the fact you still may have a penis"

"I'm a trans guy, and a gay one at that, and hearing about the trans feminine experience of dating and attraction and the issue of genital preference was really interesting to me. It's something I think about a lot in my trans gayness, knowing that many gay guys are just not into that sort of thing when it comes to my genitals. I fear my dating pool is incredibly narrow, and cis gay men already complain about it being small. But c'est la vie"
"I am actually curious about this. Traps being a convincing trap is a good thing. Given I am gender fluid. But I understand why people can find it offensive. The only benefit I see it as it has spawned by the dick makes it cuter."
"I‚Äôm 22 mins in and this has always been something I‚Äôve been curious about in my own head not that it mattered to me cause I‚Äôm ace so I could care less about what anyone has down there lol but you explain this so well it‚Äôs amazing you‚Äôre getting a sub from me cause even though this is the first vid I‚Äôve seen of yours the production quality the explanation and everything else was great and you deserve more views and subs ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòäüòä   One thing I do have to say that I‚Äôm not sure that some lesbians would want a woman with a dick I mean I‚Äôm sure if they were post op it may be diff but that‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm not sure about ..."

"As an Ace/aro, I really appreciate this insight into sexuality. For me, I sort of fell backwards into acceptance of all sexualities. When I was younger, I had no clue that I was Ace/aro, I didn‚Äôt know that was even a thing, and so I was constantly experimenting with what I perceived as weirder and weirder acts to try to find something that did it for me. Other result was that I tried a lot of things, but nothing did it for me, and I couldn‚Äôt understand what other people had a problem with. I was so ignorant of so many hang ups, and totally unsympathetic to those with hangups. Thank you for educating me"
"Flexing about  cuntdancula being convicted is gay."
"I found a little flaw with your arguments that doesn't seem to follow. You mention that straight people shouldn't mind being called gay, because being gay is a good thing. (36:36) Which it is, not going to dispute that. However straight people aren't gay.  Just like Trans people aren't the gender they where at birth.   My point is that one could argue that trans people should not mind being referred to as their birth gender as being that gender isn't a bad thing. Now I in no way agree with that and I know you don't too. It's just something that on viewing that I felt was overlooked. I did get what you meant though, that some men feel like they have to prove their sexuality. As a bisexual man I 100% encountered that feeling. Especially when dating women. I personally think that we men think this way because we think we are catering to the wants and desires of the women we are with. Which almost always isn't the case."
"M O U T H F E E L"
"is this art yet?"
"Contrapoints, I just wanna say that you are quite literally the most reasonable left-leaning person I have ever seen. Even if I wanted to I wouldn't be able to not respect you. You are honestly the reason why I am now ok with transpeople, even if some subconscious part of me is still abit transphobic. Why the fuck aren't more left-leaning people giving good reasoning like you are? Most of them just ignore what you have to say, while you explicitly pay attention to every argument transphobic straight men give. This is seriously one of your best videos."

I was blown away by how many people though I wasn‚Äôt a lesbian anymore, this is so accurate.   After a while we broke up then I found out I was trans. So she technically turned me straight."
"Oh come on Count Dankula isn't that bad is he? I mean I haven't seen anything about him since he was found guilty, but seriously the crimes he was charged with were kinda silly.   'Here is a thing making fun of Nazis.' 'Well there we have it you are a Nazi.'"
"got a bit annoyed at the 'Real Man' bit. That phrase is core to male gender roles, and those in turn are the background to a lot of what you're argumenting against throughout this video.  I'd like to see that phrase completely forgotten."
"I think you should have put the part: Why being gay is good(or at least not bad) in the beginning, because more People watch the start. But if you wanted to structure it like an Essay to convince someone, well, you did good by keeping the best Argument for last"

"I've been watching you for the longest time and I got to say that you've helped me learn and realize a lot of very important issues.

"Hey this was a very good video! Just one thing: recently latin america has been embracing latine (and the -e suffix in gendered words) more than latinx in terms of gender neutral words.

"powerful and engaging, beautiful costumes as usual mme. poi"
"yes"
"the word 'trap' doesn't prescribe people what to think of trans women, it only describes their own view of trans women being that they are still men. So the word is no more than a way to describe your own opinion about something. Of course, calling overweight people who you don't think look good fat isn't something to support but in my opinion, that isn't enough reason to ban the word. The same goes for 'trap'."

"Aw honey u get yourself so worked up but in the most D lightful way.    This one provoked me to actually make u a Utube comment.  I'm a straight (minus a few BJs that sort of thing) but i did have a very sweet time with a young lady out in P town, who,  like how u say, of course i KNEW.  It was so much fun and extra exciting knowing that is was different - but only so that i felt invited into another special world - for the brief wknd that it was i shall treasure it always as one of the landmark sexual adventures that i look back fondly on.   I would venture to propose, and hope- i think most men are like me and  enjoy the fact that 'they live amongst us' if n we are only ever so lucky as to have the opportuinty to indulge.   X x x o xx"
"Mic drop"
"As a gay man I feel left out by your generalizing attack of only straight men. I have also been found to utter the question: 'But.. are traps gay?' in the past."
"Straightish, heteroflexible cis male here. Those 'straight' men who fear that a cis woman pegging or fingering or toying their asses or sucking on and playing with their nipples is gay are insecure in their alleged heterosexuality. Yeah, I'm slightly bi, but not because I want to be pegged or have my nipples pleasured(and pained ;) ) by a woman. Nor does it have anything to do with my interest in also both pitching and catching with trans women if I ever get a chance to have one as a lover(my interest in being top and bottom is not out of fetishism, but a love for anal pleasure, though I would only want a female penis to be used in a way that is comfortable for the woman possessing it). Me being slightly bi is from being bi enough to want to engage in activities that range from homoerotic in an mmf context to full on bi. The complex spectrum of sexual orientation is about who you're turned on by and who you're sexual with, not how you're sexual with them and what you do. Love this video and others I've seen! Great job!"

"Another great one, thanks Nat ;*   'The aesthetic' seems to be a read thread in your videos, for, as you say, sexuality is more correctly understood in reference to appearances and attractions to them, rather than chromosomes. What I am attracted to in a woman is not the rational knowledge of her DNA, but her long legs, feminine curves, soft bosom...These characteristics are of course related to DNA, but not limited to them, as transitioning so evidently testifies to. And again, 'trap' is of course wrong, for it is attractive appearances, not DNA, which is the essence in attraction.   To me, these facts opens us up to ask other, more general and more existential questions about what it means to be human. To my mind, western countries have been very fixated on understanding and interpreting human existence solely on the basis of biological determinism (and biology as solely determined by the 'hard sciences'), a trend I have always had deep problems with. It's so extremely reductive, and in instances like this, also so clearly wrong, but it's still very persistent. While the animal kingdom is of course also healthily populated with deviance's from binary relations, I do think humanity is something wholly different; we have the capacity (and desire) for exploring ourselves far beyond standard categories, not only in relation to sex, but to what it means to be happy, fulfilled, etc.   Of course, I do not know if this is your view on it as well; perhaps you believe all this is intelligible on the basis of ordinary biology. If that's the case, sorry for putting words into your mouth, but I felt like sharing my thoughts here anyways.   (also, sorry for the hubris of addressing you in first-person, as if I'd be so lucky that you read this comment...)"

"Straight men have ascended above male individuals who are sexually attracted to female individuals and have become a social construct."
"Youknow, the whole thing about how pegging and male nipple play is gay sort of got me thinking of an overly elaborate way to visualize the absurdity of these standards. Imagine a 2x2 table showing a man in 4 steamy scenarios with different combinations of two factors; what you do in bed, and the anatomical/karyotypical factors.  In one scenario, the man in question is getting plowed in the butt by another am. Ok, that's pretty gay. In the second scenario, the guy has 'emasculating' sex with a cis woman, getting pegged or whatnot. Supposedly, this is gay too. In the third scenario, the guy has very assertive, typically masculine sex with someone who could be anything from a crossdressing twink roleplaying as a woman, to a model-looking post-op trans woman. Which one doesn't really matter, because you'll still find people who will claim it's gay anyway. It's only in the fourth scenario where the guy has typically masculine sex with a typically feminine cis woman that the sex is by these kinds of standards not considered gay.  The point I wanna make is just that I think imagining the visual of a table laying out these four scenarios sorted by these two binary factors illustrates how narrow that view of straightness is, you have to both get the right combination of the right kind of partner, and do the right kind of activity, making 3 out of 4 scenarios 'gay'."

"We all know that trans women of color are more vulnerable to harassment and violence than their white counterparts but no one seems to ask why. The reason isn't just cultural but systemic, trans women of color are more likely to live in poverty which makes it harder for them to afford documentation from a doctor or agency to have their identification match their gender. Which makes it more likely for trans women of color to be 'outed' as trans, thus more likely to be harassed or assaulted. Protecting trans women of color means addressing these structural issues, even if a you're white middle class trans woman addressing systemic problems can go a long way."

"As a straight man, I think honesty is pretty important in dating (or hooking up). I feel that if people were more honest about what they are into, 't***s' wouldn't even be a thing. I'm not into penis, but I'm into other things. My point is, when it comes to sex we're ALL freaky little monster people (at least I'd hope we are). Trans women should get just as much play as anyone else. That being said, no one deserves to be murdered for who they are. I wish we could be adults about this. We're grown. Shit, I'll be your wingman (I'm probably the one who needs the help anyway)."

"Personally, it feels simple. If someone identifies as a woman, I'll treat them as one. If I find them physically attractive, i wont have this insecure angel/devil shoulder inner debate; i'll be attracted. There are very beautiful trans women out there.There's very unattractive cis women as well. Ive always seen liking dick as a sepereate entity from homosexuality. I used  to think toxic masculinity was some sjw man hating terminology, but this discussion born out of a meme and the more serious issue of the murders of innocent women at the hands of insecure cis men (not to say the former isn't important) has changed my mind. As Natalie says, we live in a world(Not saying society for fear of meme) where men in power will sexually satisfy themselves to a group of people before giving them legal rights, which must be a scary reality for those effected . But back to the point of simplicity, if you find a woman attractive, that should be quite obviously hetero. I feel if your going to treat a woman as a woman, that logic shouldn't break at the question of the bedroom. TL;DR: TRAPS AREN'T GAY"

"This video was really really helpful. I've always considered myself an ally of the LGBT community, but when people were like, 'I don't want to date trans women because i don't want to possibly have sex with someone with a penis.' I found myself agreeing because I guess I understood that; if i were out dating (I'm straight, cis, woman) I would not date trans men because I don't really want to have sex with someone with a vagina. But after watching this video you taught me that those two things don't really go hand in hand. A girl penis is different and that really helped me to wrap my head around it, thanks for that. (Also I can use this info to own the deplorable conservatives muhahaha) Please keep making these wonderfully informative and funny videos, you magnificent person!!!üòç"
"White people can't talk about issues outside of white? You really just need to break that thought right now. That just straight up pissed me off.

If someone could give me a time code in the video where you stop talking about how its not ok for white people to talk about non-white issues, I'd like to watch the rest of the video, but I'm not sitting through being told MY OPINION DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE OF MY SKIN COLOR."

"Every time I saw that meme being used, it didn't even come to mind that it was in any way transphobic. Because like... in the anime I've seen, usually these 'traps' are just guys that look really feminine, and they'll gladly go all 'I'm actually a guy!' so everyone can do that anime thing where they fall over in shock. And like... that's not what trans women are. They're women.  So I didn't really think the term even applies to them, at all."
"The way you built the case against 'traps are gay' was wonderful to watch and to listen to. However, I have one point of .. criticism .. or rather something to consider:  You step back to point out the homophobia element, and drive your other points home, only towards the end of the video. It makes for a great conclusion, but these insights in such clarity will only reach people watching the video in its entirety.  I feel like the people who need these insights the most are the ones that will get here only by curiosity (title), and are unlikely to watch the entire video. So it would be helpful, if you had a tl;dr at the start that is as clear as the conclusion. Unfortunately, that would ruin the arc of your argumentation, and so I'm not sure, if making a tl;dr to cater to short attention spans is worth it."

"Hey, Natalie. I want to take a moment to say that I appreciate your perspective, and that I enjoy your content.  I disagree with you on most of your positions. The purpose of this response is to engage with this subject matter honestly and in good faith.  While I'd wager that a fair amount of people associate the term 'trap' with all transwomen, I've always thought of the word as a comment on behavior rather than a simple slur. There's one aspect of the male perspective I didn't see explored in this video: the concept of male sexual agency.   It might be odd to consider it in this framework, but with attractiveness comes power and responsibility. I can understand why some transwomen may choose to be less than forthcoming with their identities. There's certainly a risk factor with disclosing that kind of information to a prospective partner. I'm certain it's not a fun conversation to have with someone, and doing so probably also requires discussing aspects of yourself that you're not particularly comfortable with. That said, I think it is the transwoman's responsibility to disclose in spite of this.   Each person, regardless of gender, should be afforded the opportunity to make informed decisions pertaining to their body. A transwoman misleading someone about their identity in order to elicit romantic interest or sexual acts is a violation of that person's sexual agency. This is an action that should not be tolerated in your community in my opinion. I'm not saying this is widespread or the trans community at large engages in it, but to my mind this behavior is ensconced in the term trap. In a video which speaks about male responsibility, I viewed this as worth mentioning.  Engaging in deceptive practices like this can be harmful to men. Putting someone in a potential identity crisis isn't fair. I know it can be difficult, I'm not unsympathetic to that, but please be open and authentic with your partners. Both for your safety and theirs.  I'd also like to comment on Natalie's inference to toxic masculinity expressed in this video. Masculinity is not morally wrong nor is it simply the result of social pressure. Many men come by their masculine traits honestly. Insinuating that this aspect of male identity is inherently harmful to men is not only insulting, it's remarkably hypocritical coming from a transgender person. Verbally invalidating the identities of other groups does nothing to further your cause. If your desire is to find social tolerance or acceptance, I'd advise you to be the change you wish to see.  Finally, I'd like to point out that straight men choosing not to date transwomen are not being bigoted. Everyone should have the right to choose potential partners based on whatever criteria they deem fit. I don't think this is a winning battle for the trans community. Be respectful to the inclinations of others. I think that's really needed in general. For each of us to try to understand the other, and to compromise.  That's my perspective anyway."

"As a cis male dating a trans woman, your comments about shouldering some of the burden resonated with me as someone who's family is really against LGBT+ people and the reality is that they'd sooner abandon me for being a 'deviant' than support my decision to love whom ever I want to love. It also reminded me how hurt I feel whenever I see someone in her live stream chat being a bigoted troll or hear about how her own family (bless her mother who's actually supportive) is set against her bc they think she wasted her time transitioning. It also reminded me that despite all that we do shoulder it together and I do need to be ready to defend her at a moments notice. Thank you for this video Ms. Points.

I'm not really sure and I'd like to hear what others think, but I do think that it would be the decent thing to do as everyone is entitled to their preferences and if their preference is cis women then that's okay."

"I disagree. Trap is the neutral word in conversation with homophobic males. As a man it is almost impossible to have a friend group comprised of 100% open minded, rational individuals. Often it is a choice of: tolerate a bit of homophobic bigotry, or have very few friends at all.   I would argue the best solution is one of cultural osmosis. Allow men to think with there dicks. Make friendly jokes about 'traps', such as 'traps are not gay' and 'it's not gay to enjoy a femine penis'.  Also, showing them hot trans pornstars and being like 'I dont even care, I would smash'.   By feigning a slight level of hesitancy, you create a common ground on which to demonstrate that these feelings of attraction are appropriate and some will grow more comfortable with the idea overall.  As we battle the toxic masculinity that fuels this insecurity, we need to be tactical. We need all the freinds we can get. By slowly moving the needle from 'I'd rather die than fuck a tranny' to 'some traps are cute af' we are paving the way for 'I'm a man, I put my dick in any legal thing I find attractive'.  Similar, but on a much larger scale to the 'real men drink black coffee' argument. No real men drink whatever  tf they want."

"dumb question, i cant watch the whole thing thro atm, and will do later, but does she also look in to otaku cultere and what traps mean there. i mean the 'right side of youtube' sure has its meaning, but i find the more japanes/otaku view on the subject alot more. were sex barly happens and is seen as a holy grail, and the lack of female's in general creates a problem of alot of people who want sex, but cant seem to find someone willing and thus create a whole new sexuality spectrum based on lack of willing partners, that also gets perpetually motivated by anime via new charachters that intensaly dress and act as female, but identefy as male in all forms.( thus my anser to that version of traps if they are gay, would be yes, for they are man that love man. aka same sex. even tho they act different from the norm.) traps are popularized on forums as 2chan, 8chan and 4chan. but they do have a more culturail background in japanees and greek history and story telling. is this a trans question? ofcoures. but not 100% of the time. it depents on which trao you talk.  anyways, to anyone willing to read all of this, tanks. and leave a comment or like or something. would like to talk about it more"

"I'm a biological woman and men I've hooked up with have seriously asked me if I'm transgender and I would have to reassure them over and over that I'm a biological woman. Men's masculinity is so fragile lol"

"As a trans woman who just really loves having a penis, I feel a little off put by the stuff about tucking and 'the surgery.' Like hey I'm sure that info was helpful or revelatory to some, I just felt... underrepresented? Invalidated? And like, I do prefer women with a penis sometimes. Other trans women I've been with have gotten uncomfortable about it before and I did not know what to say and still don't."
"Oh Natalie, when you talk sweet SJW sense to me you elevate me to a higher place. but when you do it while playing renditions of J.S. Bach's music, you elevate me even higher into heavenly ecstasy!"

"But if in the 80's and prior being gay was synonymous with HIV, and HIV meant death, how would you expect these men to react? It's attempted murder not to tell them.   Remember that homosexual men have a high rate of STDs. They literally create new ones all the time in California. As we, men, have a much higher sex drive."
"Lost me at the end.   You had a great argument and final points but to climax with telling men to essentially man-up by challenging their manhood was lazy. Telling men to 'man up' which always translates to 'behave how I [the shamer] want'.   Much like the White Feather movement in WW1, people are always using men's desire to defend their manhood to control their behaviour. It is exploitative.  'Man up' and:  Join the Army, Emergency Services, [insert dangerous profession here] Find a wife Be hetero Buy beer, cars, whatever product won't fill the void. Fuck as many women as possible Give more resources friends, family, anyone but yourself. Self-sacrifice for community/strangers Work overtime. Think traps are gay/not gay. The list goes on and on.   Break ur chains bois. Don't 'man up' on anybody else's terms. Man-up twice a day or never at all but do it for you."

"So, let's do a thought experiment then, because I'm going to be arguing the other side. And yes this thought experiment won't be exactly the same, but hear me out. What if tomorrow, some Bi people started calling themselves trans? After years of the trans community having their term, Bi people start appropriating it. And then some bigots start using the word trans derogatorily toward Bi people. And then some Bi people start demanding that all people stop using the word Trans. How does that make you feel? I bet you would feel that's unfair.  That's the thing, traps aren't trans people and it isn't your term. It was invented way, way before the trans community started appropriating it. And yup, it was the trans community using the word second, not bigots. In fact I would say that it only recently came into the mainstream and become an issue in the last 2-3 years, which is such a small amount of time. But my issue is that it is not your term, and I don't think bigots misappropriating a misappropriated word really justifies trying to make an entirely different community referring to an entirely different concept stop using a particular word.  I get that you think the distinction between trap and trans doesn't matter, but it kind of does, because Contrapoints isn't a trap. Because Contrapoints is a woman with breasts, and people who have breasts aren't traps. Which trans people can essentially be referred to as traps? Essentially only pre-op flat chested MtF trans people. No other trans person can be described with the term, so why is it being defined as a slur against all trans people when it only applies in such a small niche of the community? And that's on top of the fact that, again, its an anime community term to refer to crossdressers, not trans people.  I still found the video funny and interesting, but this is one of those times I just can't agree with you because I think several of your base premise are flawed. Though I do think you are right about 'Are traps gay' being the worst. It was funny to me the first time as a joke but I see to a lot of people it apparently isn't, in a very sad way."
"So do you have an assistant to mount those headresses or is there some kind of crane involved?"
"I really needed this. Thank you."
"I was particularly interested in Natalie's musings about the rituals heterosexual men (and women) must participate in to be considered heterosexual beyond the actual definition. The way Natalie phrased it, she seems to think that the rituals are self-imposed upon men. That men as a collective decide what is straight and what isn't, and then behave according to those rules. In my experience and in studies I have read, men do no police themselves, but are instead policed by other men within their social circle. Even if a straight man is convinced that sex with female transsexuals is not gay, he is pressured into behaving how he is expected to behave by his social group or the social group he was apart of while growing up. Other aspects of masculine heterosexuality, such as the pressure to have intercourse early and frequently, are also not values that men necessarily believe in themselves, but that they will be accepted by their friends and given value within their social circle. By later on enforcing these same standards on others, they maintain the value of their own accomplishments. Instead of addressing men as if they all believe in this ideology, I believe it would be more convincing to trust in the judgement and intelligence of men. Encourage men not to enforce the same standards that were enforced upon them by others. A lot of the criticism towards masculinity (evidenced in the recent Gillette ad) encourages men to 'be better'. Men are being asked to choose between disgracing themselves in the eyes of women and tumblr, or disgracing themselves in the eyes of other men. Men stand to lose a lot more of their social standing if they are stigmatised by other men, since it is other men who granted that social standing originally. I'm not saying that arguments from outside perspectives are useless or unwanted, but I wanted to share a point of view and and perhaps a method of improving heteronormative masculinity."
"Damnit Natalie, I live in a cabin up in the mountains. Winter is here and I have shit do to ensure my survival. If you insist on making 45 minute long and very compelling videos, then know I will watch them, and likely freeze to death. Now I'm going to smoke a cigar and get back to work. May your wisdom keep me warm."
"Ok I have been super interested in the feminine penis since you brought it up last time... But now I'm even more curious about the masculine clitoris.  Thank you for having this conversation because there is so little out there that isn't fetishistic."
"as a gay man who just likes dicks, i get nervous at the idea of hooking up with a woman with a dick because of the potential arguments that might arise from me identifying as gay instead of bisexual. i have literally ZERO attraction to females, but adding a dick to the equation overrides my brains gay wiring. i can't tell if i'm just subconsciously assigning a transitioned female a male gender role in my head and that's what makes me aroused...am i a bigot? me brain dumb"
"Okay so the attraction to feminine parts is not gay. But traps are just tricks. A false fasad with the intention of meir imitation. I dont enjoy being called transphobic becuase I dont want to fuck a man that uses tricks to look like a woman. Because I'm not. And saying that's something 'you're just not into' is not transphobic. Claiming that statement as transphobic means you're shaming me because of my sexuality. So straight men can have no preferences or we're all transphobic? Na thats gay.  I like your content contrapoints, but I also don't like dicks. Calling men transphobic for not liking dick is irrational. And even if you have a full surgery it's still just a trick. It's as if you took a psychoactive drug that made all animals look like voluptuous woman. Yes it may look like a woman smell like a woman but it's not a woman. So if you f*** it is it beastiality well yes it is because in the end it's just a trick. And apparently not ' being into' a trick is transphobic. You're wrong about this."

"I came out around 2000 and coming from Cuba I basically had to destroy and reconstruct all my concepts of manhood. It was painful but had I not done so I would have self-destructed. Thank you again for this video Nat‚ù§Ô∏èüåà"
"thank you contrapoints, very cool!"
"Omg I had no idea of the female dick!!! Thank you for explaining this. I guess it also gets down to prefference in genitalia? Or would you differ?"
"I would like to say that any man who smokes a cigar is totally gay, and that's OK. ‚ù§"
"I love this. I love this so much. You made SO many good points and even expanded my already similar take on this topic. This is such a good video and way to talk about this and I appreciate it so much. Thank you for this and I'm looking forward to checking out more of your content!!!"
"I only have one question Did you already own the gong?"
"13:39 monokuma is that you?"
"I would love if there was more debates for example with youtubers that you presented in your video. I think that could be pretty interesting to hear discussion like that from people with completely different point of view. This video was in parts and very polished but I saw few ContraPoints debate videos and honestly I would like to see more of them."
"I like your videos since you tend to take a more measured, less 'ranty' take on a lot of issues that we might be at odds about. You usually seem to be fair to the other side, while still acknowledging and pushing your bias (which in an argumentative essay should be the case)  but at 5:06, calling countdankula a 'hate crime convict' is just blatantly misleading. The issues around Meechans charges and trials go way beyond his personal political beliefs, and using a comedian being criminally charged for one of his (albeit overly edgy) jokes is just a weak attempt at using him as a strawman."
"Can you please do a commentary on the outrage surrounding the recent Gillette commercial?? Love your videos btw and was so excited to see a new one pop up"

"How many k e k folk will ever want to watch something that challenges their world view"

"Professor, is there a field of, or are there any readable papers in, critical heterosexual studies?"
"As a logical STEMlord type this question had always bugged me. It's basically engaging with the edge cases and corner cases of every category involved in the inquiry. Before you can even begin to analyze it, you have to examine every definition involved, ask why it matters, and what you need that category to seperate.   Like 'What is the meaning of Life' it seems profound, but by the time you get it to a place you can answer it, the question had become either trivial or nonsensical."
"Another issue with the word trap is that it's kinda entered 'otaku' terminology.  That is, there are certain terms that fans of anime and manga use, such as 'tsundere' or 'waifu'  For a lot of people, 'trap' is simply something they put into an image search to find pictures of feminine or androgynous male characters.  There's no overt hatred behind it.  Now, mind you, I'm not excusing this behavior..  I just think it's kinda interesting (and sad) how easily hateful terminology can enter common vocabulary.    Thankfully I'm seeing more and more sites replace the 'trap' tag with other alternatives."
"As a CIS-Bi-Guy, I'd be very happy to talk with Natalie about the mouth-feel of the feminine penis ;)"

"Well, this is going to fuck up my youtube recommendations. Oh well. Also, thank god my first real exposure to trans-people was through a transwoman who made a short lived review series of tabletop rpgs and didn't reveal herself as trans until years later, it really helped me to think of trans women as women who are also defined by things other than vagina or lack thereof."

"I swear this is a magnus opus! Best video of yours yet!!"
"I'm only about halfway through, and I just want to say (as a socially progressive 'woke' liberal), prior to this video I definitely would have spent those twilight hours in my own head asking 'but are traps gay?' (although I can say with certainty I would not have foisted those twilight thoughts on future children). Notice that I said 'prior to this video'. Thank you for the wakeup call. It's not my lane, and my opinion doesn't matter. Full stop. All I can do is be supportive, and fall off my chair laughing at the phrasing of 'signing-up for a vagina' (thank you for that). I had never actually heard the word 'trap' before, probably because I don't spend my time around people who would pose these sorts of questions, but I'm glad that I heard it here before anywhere else. When I do hear that question posed, I'm glad I will be armed with the knowledge to be able to challenge the opinion of someone who would sink to the level of asking that question."
"traps are gey lel    My dad still hasn't come home. I still miss him, we used to play out and he used to take me to the beach, and we'd play tag. But one day he just didn't come back from work, and we found out he left for someone else and their family, and mum was really sad. Please come home dad. ;("

Also, digging the Half Queen's costume, I love that there's a literally a visible line down her face where her foundation stops."
"Contrapoints more like contraonpoint. I‚Äôve been waiting for this video my whole life, the way you talk not just about the problem thing but all the other aspects that make it a problem while being incredibly educated and inclusive is absolutely astounding, amazing and inspiring.

"Sadly, it makes a lot of sense that men who were introduced to the concept of trans people by porn would be transphobic - they hear 'trans rights' and they think 'oh my god these people want to live as their depraved fetish porn personas around CHILDREN???' I've known a few former transphobes who have admitted as such (at least one of whom turned out to be a trans man, himself, it just never occurred to him because such an introduction never lets you think transitioning the other way is even A Thing).  At this point when there's yet another politician pushing bathroom bills who gets caught with 'shemale' porn my thought is less 'HAHA EXPOSED' and more 'well, THAT explains a lot.'  That said, I need to make a risky addition - will you delete my comment if I say I 'hate' your makeup because it makes me feel bad about my own skills? Seriously, I'm jealous; where do you get your products and brushes? Share the goods!"

I understand that some people will be nervous on the title which I get and it is going to be a mine field to touch and not a term that will bring out good vibes but the content of the video was really on point and I feel it's a conversation we need to have to unpack this stuff."
"Speaking as someone who was on the path to becoming an alt-right shitlord as recently as 2016, I would like to thank Natalie for continuing to be among those trying their damndest to reach out to folks like me when they're at their garbage tier level of political consciousness. The concept of 'meeting people where they're at' and building that continuous logical bridge from confused and unconscious bigotry to genuine (rather than merely performative) wokeness is something the left should take very seriously if we want marginalized people to win the rights they deserve."

"I'm glad to have you on our side...... Mommy"
"Natalie I uh I do gotta say...you pop"
"First up, love the video. Funny and clever and compelling and technically impressive as ever. My only criticism would be the lack of discussion around context. I know context cab often be used as a disingenuous red herring to pretend a thing isn't offensive, especially on the right, but even saying just that, or quickly addressing people that self identify as traps online by highlighting that it might be inappropriate in the context of this word to reappropriate it would have been nice. Not mentioning it at all stood out to me as a gap or a topic purposely avoided."
"This video was so awakening for me . Thank you so much. Gays are homophobic too. We are trapped in feme shaming . Even a guy attracted to another guy associates himself with femininity as some sort of sexual validation many a times. we are so hung up with the gender constructs that it gets tough to explore what we can enjoy in sex.And I have so many 'woke' straight guy friends who are scared to be 'trapped' to have sex with ladyboys ..this is so fucking deep rooted . Thanks lady for confronting all the awkward talks head on like a man(or whatever sexiest way we can say that :p) .. i look up to you , i listen to you with with total submission cause you never fail to make sense and you keep talking just fucking awesome.you go straight and throw light on my own insecurities and help me see things with perspective without the shadow of the social stories and constructs."
"Love your videos, but tiny tiny tiny detail, you portray Count Dankula as the worst person to walk about the subject, as he is a hateful criminal. When it was a joke he was fined for, when Milo and the other guy have defended ideas of ethnostates and/or gay paedophelia."
"Alright, Nat, I'm officially done. This started with Aesthetic, you dug your heels in with Pronouns, and now you've gone full apologist.  In the span of this video you implied that most instances of 'triggering' aren't for good reason, you implied that there might be something homosexual about a man's attraction to a woman if she's not on hormones or not on them for long enough, you implied that stating that someone is female based on their identity is 'black and white identity dogma', you implied that if a woman's penis is not in an adequately feminine context or is not used femininely enough then it's not a woman's.  You have, in the span of this video, thrown under the bus people who get triggers not commonly understood by the public, anyone who doesn't pass, anyone who doesn't take hormones out of either choice or necessity, most SJWs and trans advocates, any trans woman who tops, AGAIN anyone who doesn't pass, and anyone who doesn't have some picture-perfect small, dainty dick.  As someone who fits into half of the above categories and strongly supports the rest, I'm done. Your followers will say you're doing more good than harm. I don't think you are anymore. I think you're only helping out your cis-passing binary self and friends and everyone else is just going to have a harder time as they're given yet one more popular youtuber who states or implies that they're not trying hard enough, that they need to pick a side, that they're too sensitive, that they're too radical or unforgiving. Because all these cis people in the top comments talking about how much you helped them? That's your audience now. A bunch of cis people congratulating themselves for being woke. Do you think they have non-passing trans friends, or nb friends, or people struggling not to drown in their mental health? Hell no. They're coming here to feel good about the fact they have a token on their friends list.  Enjoy your new audience. May you never forget the people who supported you for years and you springboarded off to get here. Who, like me, are rolling our eyes and tapping the hell out."
"I remember being a confused high schooler who definetly deep down knew there was something up with my gender (i identify as non binary now hi) and making my straight friends uncomfortable with different versions of this is it gay argument. Everytime they'd be super upset and confused but would always answer that it was gay and I would be so angry about it. I feel like I knew the answers to why the game was stupid but this video is certainly the best argument I've ever encountered as to why... wish my native language was english so I could send it to every single straight guy I've ever met haha Thank you for the amazing work Natalie, you're the best."
"Holy crap is Lilly Wachowski listed in your patrons THAT Lilly Wachowski???"

"So sad that Contract even had to waste her precious time in the first place explaining that women aren't men to a handful of YouTube idiots"
"I love you"
"I don't know how you do it, love, but you always manage to take my breath away! Great insight into the 'are traps gay?' discussion. I always learn something new in every video. Edit: I forgot to mention how grateful I am that you are always ready and willing to ask and answer the hard questions about being trans. I have learned so much from you, and your videos have made me a better person and a better friend. Thank you, Natalie"
"People weren't upset you were talking about it. They were upset that you were using the slur like an edgelord. It's kinda sad."
"Really like your videos, but representing count dankula as a guy who‚Äôs just guilty of a hate crime and therefore clearly is a scumbag is very misleading if you aren‚Äôt aware that his ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù was teaching his girlfriends pug to ‚Äúnazi salute‚Äù (raise his paw) to annoy her as a joke. I usually trust your judgements but seeing this misleading representation kind of hurts your credibility in my eyes."
"I asked my token gay friend and he said he doesn‚Äôt like trans women so I guess traps aren‚Äôt gay"
"Once again, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to do a detailed transcription for the closed-captioning.

"Absolutely amazing video. Loved 20:22. Am attracted to women (all women), so I've never really worried about these types of things, but at the same time that means I tend to not consider the effects of language, word choices, or meme culture that I use or that are being used around me. I tend to just use things that I think sound funny. I grew up with the Admiral Ahkbar meme, so when it began to get used to describe anime dickgirls and continued on from there, I just laughed. This video though made a very clear and positive case for why I shouldn't. So I'll try not to. Thanks for that. And thanks for what you're doing to try to change the world in a positive way."

"As a Cis-Het Male, this video was a beautiful breath of fresh air where I didn't feel personally alienated and attacked, and could instead broaden my horizons, even if the subject matter is controversial. I like this channel. Thank you ContraPoints, very cool!"
"I'm a closeted trans guy, but most people people think I'm a lesbian because I'm not out. When I tell people that the woman I'm interested in (or have been interested in before) is trans, they always give me such weird looks and are confused like suddenly my sexuality is in question...... but like bud she's a woman. I like women, and she's a woman, and she's very pretty.  I'm so glad you shared your experience with this kind of casual (and sometimes blatant) transphobia, and gave genuine arguments as to why this question is dumb, harmful, offensive, and just incorrect."
"Great content, once again. Love the progress."

"I'm pretty damn liberal, so this is an unpopular opinion in my normal circles, but as a Latino woman I really dislike this LatinX movement. Latino IS the gender neutral form of the word. And it always seems that this criticism comes from people who either a. are not native Spanish speakers or b. are the children of Latino immigrants who grew up in the global north. There are not many Latin Americans who are going to think to themselves: 'You know what? North Americans are right, fuck the letter O. Spanish grammar? Nononono, its the children of the diaspora who have likely never had any formal schooling in Spanish - THEY'RE the ones who know what they're talking about.'  Women, cis and trans alike, are being murdered at an alarming rate in Latin America simply for existing. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Latino left has chosen not to shine a massive, unavoidable light on that, but is instead doing so on the term LatinX. That's what white feminists see as one of our main struggles now, and that's what they use their privilege to raise awareness towards. Not the femicide rampant in Latin American countries. I don't see 'Latinx' feminists trying to make 'Ni una menos' mainstream. I see them promoting a misguided idea meant to solve a problem that does not exist, because again, we already have a gender neutral word for Latino/a - and it is Latino.

I know she might not read this but I wonder what Natalie's take is on this topic- young trans people exploring their identities on an online game because it's objectively safer than being themselves in real life."

I just want to adore people and maybe rub my weiner on them.  I can't be pin what roots my sexuality. The 'what' I am attracted to. If it is only an aesthetic it seems so vain and vapid.  It is all mysterious.  Saying that I am sometimes romantically attracted to men. No penis for me please though. Got one myself and it is ok.  Am I straight? Bisexual? Who cares?! I say I am straight but I could take a dude out for dinner and cuddle him afterwards. Can't be arsed to label myself, call me bisexual, whatever.  Its all a big adventure."

"Amazing video overall, but i disagree on the part where you say   the only reason men don't want to date trans women is social stigma and a masculinity complex. Some men just aren't attracted to trans women. Sexuality cannot be forced into anyone, if a man isn't attracted to trans women, because of the pee pee or the thought that they were once the same gender (which they are not attracted to) confuses them, then its ok for them to not want to have a relationship with them, just as how a gay man can turn down women."

The mimetic rhetorical aspect of ‚Äúare traps gay?‚Äù is just another extension of the imposing and reassertion of hegemonic masculinity through social relations.   Trepidation in entertaining the question or notion are deeply understandable, because at its core like you say, what‚Äôs being asserted is that trans women aren‚Äôt women. The hope would be that such positions are simply laughable, but it‚Äôs 2k19 and eugenics and race science bullshit and so on isn‚Äôt being laughed out of the room.  Fear of the other and their hidden jouissance rears its head* in many different ways on this topic, but is always part of the central function. Working in tandem with the fear of being alienated from those hegemonic and ideological norms - fear that they would be the butt of the joke, loss of social standing and so on. The importance of love as the sword in relation to combating these idealogical and social ‚Äònorms‚Äô within ourselves or those arounds us can‚Äôt be understated.

"Hey Natalie, Cis-white male here. Great video. Just want to address one thing you said in the video: 'A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.' 38:00 - I will say, since it's somewhat related: The 'is it gay' is not only related to treating the body as a temple but also comes from how men define masculinity. In trying to define what a 'real man' does it uses the same flawed ideological framework that the 'is it gay' game uses - that is to say it tries to define the qualities of the straight-masculine gender role. This is a mistake in my opinion and one misstep in an otherwise well laid out video essay. The 'is it gay' game certainly comes from a man's insecurity of gender roles and masculinity but the absurdity of the game is that we tie virtues to the gender role. It seems to be that defining what a 'real men' is, is playing into those insecurities and perpetuating the marriage of those virtues with the gender roles. ie 'If you are not secure, you are not a 'real man'.' Here's where I'd like your insight because I'm not quite sure how to navigate from here.   Is a 'real man' brave in the face of fear and adversity? Or should being brave be a trait that is separated from gender roles? Is this even possible? Just looking at the way you defined the feminine penis, it seems to be that feminine and masculine will always be loaded terms and characteristics that will continue to define the gender roles and perpetuate insecurity by people constantly questioning whether they're filling their roles correctly. I don't think we can ever separate ideology and people like to think in (somewhat) well defined boundaries. I don't see a way out of this muk. I hope you can provide some insight in this regard and would like to know if you would reconsider that statement of what a 'real man' is/does."
"ur fukken amazing"
"Hi Natalie,  I want to ask you a super superficial question: I love your costumes/clothing, all the headpieces and props and the set design. Dressing up with you must be great! I was wondering if maybe you could show us some of the pieces and tell us something about them? Or maybe about how you go about creating a look?"
"Great vid Natalie, and your hair looks very attractive.  Also fuck Ben Shapiro.. I mean don't fuck him.  He should spend his time alone and sad.  It will take a few hundred years to drain the toxins from mano-culture.  But we're working on it, one drip at a time.  Also #takebackadmiralakbar!"

"Thank you. You're always very thorough. You gave me something to think about."
"I normally watch these videos because I find them entertaining, and I usually learn a thing or two and that‚Äôs fun as well. Me clicking on this video was another case of ‚ÄúI think I know the answer, but let‚Äôs watch for kicks and giggles.‚Äù And, as it turns out i was wrong.   Last summer, my friend came to me saying that he was attracted to trans women. He said he wasn‚Äôt actively seeking them out, but if he happened to find a woman attractive and later learned that she was born a boy, he wasn‚Äôt at all turned off by it. He told me this because I‚Äôm the only guy he knows who openly identifies as anything other than heterosexual, and he was asking me if being sexually attracted to trans women was gay.  I told him that it wasn‚Äôt gay, but it wasn‚Äôt really straight either.  I guess in my mind I‚Äôve always assumed trans people to be a sort of ‚Äúthird gender,‚Äù or that a trans woman isn‚Äôt really a woman because of genitalia and chromosomes.  I really appreciate this video, because it showed me that my beliefs about trans people were incorrect, and it was entertaining and fun.  As for my friend, he‚Äôs now openly bisexual and has had a couple of encounters with cisgender men, so I don‚Äôt think he was asking me ‚Äúare traps gay?‚Äù But, or at least I think, he was asking his GBF for permission to suck dick."

I'm a straight Cis born woman, and even though I consider myself straight, I'm attracted to and have even had sexual encounters with various identifying genders. It will be so much better when people understand that as you've stated, it's an acid trip of colors on this sexual spectrum. Please never stop making videos ‚ù§"

"As a straight dude who used to browse 4chan, and is gennerally against bs, i still have to say i like the video.  The points made are great, and I will never call a human a trap in a demeaning and hurtful way, especially after watching this Video, with that I mean that I will continue to use the word in reference to some artistic depictions, and as a way of comedy. Personnaly I dont have a problem with that, as I dont belive a word itself is hurtful, it fully depends in the context.   I think this video highlights a great point, without ever using the dumb phrase toxic masculinity it simply highlights that masculinity in some peoples views is simply unacceptable behaviour.   And the entire thing of if you like women with a dick or not, has to do with personal feelings and desires. You want to be a women, i dont want to fuck anyone with a dick, pretty simple. With this I do belive that it is a trans womens job to tell a man if she has unusal sexual organs, I think that anyone you want to fuck or be sexualy, and maybe even emotionaly close to deserves the respect to know what they are getting in to and making sure they are personnaly okay with it. If they dont desire such a thing they shouldnt be expected not to be mad (in moderation, commiting a crime because of this is unaceptable). Everyone has their own views on sexuality and what they are okay with, and what they are absolutly against.   Deciving someone who deseves the respect to know, is hurtful to the relationship and the person decived. However a person hitting on you is not a person who deserves that respect. Its a special status that needs be achived to be deserved that knowledge.  Now to the question are traps gay: who gives a shit?"

"Oh Ms Wynn you did it again. Thanks for the brainfeels!"
"The people who raised me helped make me somewhat unfased by other people's sexuality or sexual identity. I simply don't care as long as no one is getting hurt. The problem is people _are_ getting hurt, and it's the self-titled moral police doing the hurting.  I _do_ get extremelly angry and frustrated by injustice and perversion, by hate and evil aimed at anyone who just wants to feel safe and free to be themselves. This channel helps me process that anger, by informing me and also by occasionally making me smile. So thank you."
"Hey Natalie, have you ever played D&D?"
"I'm only half way in and I've learned so much. I love how you are able to explain so much without it feeling like a boring, posh boy, philosophy lecture.

When you started it was the same, but the transition is clear! I'm not trans, though 1) Your perspective opened a whole new worldview for me and 2) I just enjoy the way you think and reason and it has influenced my life positively beyond the purpose of your channel! Thank you!"
"I am personally open to being with and dating a trans woman. But I so think it is important to let whoever you find yourself in a sexual situation with know that you have that equipment down there. At the very best  youll get an awkward situation and no sex. At the very worst, well, you know. Protect yourself."

"I just lost my shit at 'what am I gonna do with a sacred passage? get fingered by the pope?' üòÇ  Honestly, I'm so freaked out by that view of vaginas. I'm transmasculine and the only time I ever feel dysphoric about my junk is when people get all 'fertility goddess' about it. It's fine if that's someone's personal connection to their body, but I think forcing that view on other people is so freaking gross and weird.  By the way, thanks for doing this video. It's nice to have more things to point at when people ask me why I'm uncomfortable with this term."

"Hi Contra, I've seen a lot of people on my country calling pansexuality a  gourmet bisexuality. They say it's a useless term that only sjw use. What do you think about that? I always use the term to include trans people, but also genderfluid, non binary, etc."
"Okay so, me and my best friend both identify as traps. We are boys who like to look like girls or androgynous.  We are not trans women. We like being who we are and being androgynous beings who literally identify as traps.  I haven't heard of trans women being called traps until very recently so I'm not sure where all of this came from it sounds more to me like they mean 'trick' as in tricking? Could it be that 'traps are gay' threw the word trap out there more and it had started being used in place of 'trick'? Regardless, I digress back to my point of traps not being trans women.   Traps are a group. There are Discord servers, Kik groups and entire communities of guys and girls who are androgynous and embrace that. They aren't transitioning, we are just like, in between? That's what a trap / androgynous being is and I'm sorry but Natalie you didn't even acknowledge our existence at all?  EDIT: by trick / tricking I do not mean using the term as like, turning tricks. I mean, like 'tricking' a guy into thinking you're a woman and then you have a penis but that's kind of the entire thing Natalie explained only she referred to it as 'trapping'.  Like, traps are another thing entirely and it's kind of a disservice or willful ignorance to act like they don't exist as a group of people and instead simply focus on 'trap' as a slur.   I really hope Natalie sees me or my friends post because it's important at least to me. I don't know if I can support or take Natalie seriously after that if she's willing to just ignore androgynous people and write us off."

"you get more and more beautiful with each video <3"
"I was spending a lot of time trying to articulate my own response to the question, when around 37:10 you said it.  As little as this means: I actually enjoyed it when 'straight guys' wolf whistled me from their cars, only to then shout slurs because they realised I'm a guy too when they drove past and saw the beard. I found it amusing that their perception was so limited, and too often continues to be. That said, I'm not trans, and never have been a cross dresser, which makes it all the more amusing. And I'm now seriously considering trying some 'womens' clothes. But I also recognise I never received, or even truly perceived the level of threat this group faces.  On the question of 'traps', though, I still think I'd like to respond with: ''Traps' are people and people are too complicated to put into nice neat little boxes. Want to know if that 'girl' has a dick and likes guys? Get to know them, and don't be a judgmental dick about it.'  Finally, glad I found your channel and subscribed. Helps find the barriers or other gaps in my conscious understanding."
"I didn't know people actually used the word 'trap' to refer to real life human beings. I thought it was used exclusively for cis-male anime characters crossdressing. I won't be using that word in reference to people, fictional or not, from here out. But really, what defective morons were actually using that word in reference to actual, flesh and blood people? That's a human person."

"This is really good I was apprenhensive because of the title of the video but you managed to go beyond the debate and delved into questions about sexuality that are way more important (and way less harmful) in regards of our relation to trans people than the question originally asked.  Turning the fear of trans people that the debate entailed to the fear of one's own sexuality was necessary to make the discourse useful, and I think you nailed it!  However, I hope that with this video the question doesn't rise up from its grave and manages to only be seen as the frightened mumblings of men's fragile egos."

"People referring to transgender people as 'traps' are ruining the original meaning of the term. It used to refer only to passing crossdressing cis men NOT transgender women. It's complicated because I don't take offense to the term when people call me that because I perceive the term as stated above but understand that an increasing amount of people are adding transgender women into the list which I disagree with. At this point it's too late to reclaim the term back to its original meaning but I at least clarify what I mean whenever I use the term."

"I don't know anything about count dankula besides his pug video, but i think labeling him a 'hate crime convict' is a pretty misleading way to describe him, especially to an american audience. He didn't burn a cross on a black families lawn, he made a video where the joke was he was going to turn his gf's pug into something unloveable, a nazi. Telling people who know nothing about him hes a 'hate crime convict' because of the UK's weird contextless speech law is uh... well misleading is an understatement  Anyway, great video as always, love the work you're doing and glad to see you getting attention in articles and what not."
"Kudos to Ms. Wynn.  Her intelligence and wit dealing with complex topics are effective tools that are making me a better and more empathetic person.  Wish I could be her friend irl because I have so many questions.  On this topic, I was never a person who would begrudge a transexual any political or civic right, and I don't have any hang-ups on my own sexuality...but.  But I must confess a twinge of feeling deceived when I encounter transpeople as if they are trying to get one over on me.  I want to be able to tap my nose or pull on my earlobe and communicate, 'You do you, boo, but I know.' I'm working on it."

"My view - no, 'trans women' are not 'women', and this is irrevocably reality to me. The very fact that trans women themselves say TRANS WOMEN when talking about themselves is indicative that they are not simply WOMEN without the addendum. I am attracted to them. For example, I would smash the uploader of the video. I think the reasoning that this is 'straight' is because straightness is denoted by the physical attraction to secondary female sexual characteristics, which trans women do display. I have no issue admitting it and it's fine. No shame or whatever, but I still don't buy the whole view hook line AND sinker, just the hook and the line atm. It was still an interesting vid, thanks for sharing thoughts."

He's not a type like richard spencer in any way to my knowledge, and the crime he is convicted for may technically be a crime, but I think many here, including contrapoints herself will agree that it shouldn't be a crime. Always check out yourself what someone might have done when they are used as an example of a bad person, left, right, middle and anywhere in between."

"I did some research a while back, and if you take number of trans ppl presented by idk, reports? census? (which probably no person can actually verify) and the population of America, and the number of trans people murdered and the number of not-trans ppl murdered.....trans ppl are murdered at a rate lower than non-trans ppl....  Maybe I did something wrong, but, if I'm correct, I feel like the murder numbers of trans ppl shouldn't be brought up... Only the reasons, which are of course deplorable. I think conversations about sex, and a lack of gender expectations, would be very helpful in drastically reducing the problems this video is discussing (negative attitudes towards trans ppl, violence, misinformation, etc etc)"
"My apologies for the novel... (and I really don‚Äôt intend to derail. I just gotta get this out there.)  Tbh I can understand the ‚Äúgenital preference‚Äù argument in terms of trans folks and sex or dating... The problem comes when someone falls for a trans person (before knowing their status), and then cuts them out (or harms them) of their life after learning they‚Äôre trans. That‚Äôs a really scummy thing to do.  My thing is, I‚Äôd still be with a trans person, regardless of if they have a dick or not. I‚Äôm personally not aesthetically into dick, but I am still bi(pan if you really wanna get specific). Like, it isn‚Äôt a deal breaker, as some can be cute... I just don‚Äôt bottom. üòÇ  and this may be a bit tmi... some of the most intense and profound conversations I‚Äôve had about sex have come from trans-folks into me (as well as ‚Äúsimple‚Äù crossdressers) and older women that I met through certain social media venues..  Especially when they‚Äôre willing to open up about what about me they find attractive, even aside from aesthetically.  The openness is really a wonderful thing.  It‚Äôs really, really been a long journey for me to accept a lot within myself considering my first sexual experiences were a series of blackmail/sexual assaults at 12-13. They had turned me to repress out of self-defense what was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to have been my eventual bisexuality, and resorted to self harm to cope for years.  Eventually I grew to accept myself (mostly), despite not being able to genuinely be ‚Äúout‚Äù given my area.  And thank ya Contra. You really are amazing."
"Watching this on my schools internet lmao"

As a side note, you have so many folding fans, and as a weirdo who collects them, I appreciate that a lot."
"I know that I'm probably going over bounds, but I don't think that you should have sex change surgery on your genitals. It's very risky. The biggest issue I would worry about is orgasmic sensation. However, you're very intelligent and have surely studied this issue more than I have. I love this video, because it explains that attraction varies by person, and straight guys can love sex with trans women. I understand that trans people are often very uncomfortable with the genitals they were born with. That is a problem, because it's hard to have great sex when you are not comfortable with your own body. However, in my limited view, it seems that one of the reasons trans people are uncomfortable with their genitals is due to their fear of how potential lovers will view them. Maybe having the right partner is one of the most important things when it comes to feeling comfortable with yourself during sex. I'm not saying it's the only important thing, but it likely ranks in the top 3. Straight women also fall into the mindset of permanently altering their body to please sexual partners. The rate of labiaplasty surgery, for example, has increased a lot recently, including among teenagers (and then there's female genital mutilation... yikes). Both trans and cis women get painful surgey on their genitals to make it look more acceptable to certain men. I posit that there is a huge problem with men refusing to accept their lovers for who they are, and expecting lovers to alter their bodies for them. I'm not sure how widespread that phenomenon is, as there are many awesome men out there, but it appears large enough to be a problem in many societies."
"So,  I grew up in that culture with anime and all the tropes such as traps,  and I've for a very long time identified as a trap. I don't attempt to trick men, but I'm a boy who looks like a girl. I don't have any intention of transitioning, I like looking female but still being male. Is it bad to call myself a trap? Is there some other term?  I don't think I would count as a drag queen because I don't wear wigs or stage makeup or padding or big over the top outfits, I just look like a regular girl, have my own hair grown out, luckily have soft enough facial features etc and usually pass as female when in public. I don't have those moments where I'm suddenly a dude so to speak either, since I always dress and look this way. I'm not attempting to start an argument or anything like that, I'm just genuinely curious and having a bit of an identity crisis ^^;"

Being religious isn‚Äôt an excuse to be an asshole to other people, as much as certain supposedly religious people seem to think it is.

"The bit about the existence of the feminine is considered by men to be provocative is so on point in every way possible.  I instinctively knew this as a teenager when I hit puberty. In my attempt to not be overly enticing, I realized that meant I was dressing like a boy even though that wasn‚Äôt my intention. My intention was to dodge the creepy gazes that dressing in a high collar and long skirts attracts from men while appearing female. But society also becomes outraged if women intentionally dress like a man, rather than it being a tomboy thing that passes through with puberty.   So you‚Äôre damned if you do and damned if you don‚Äôt.  To complicate matters, women with uteruses who dress flamboyantly and unabashedly feminine get shit from both the left and the right on top of everything else. (All women get shit and possibly killed from the right for being feminine, however.)"

"Another great video, but as usual I have a few niggles.  >it's mainly coloured transpeople being murdered therefore 'it's not a conversation that should be lead by a white woman' For anything other than 'topics requiring specialist technical expertise', why does it matter who discusses what? Terrible 'deduction'. This particular 'only identity X can/should ever discuss X issues' rubbish detracts from the otherwise reasonable point about demographic emphasis.  You define a few (by your own presentation, not mutually-exclusive) groups of people: people who think the trap discussion is harmless shitposting; and people who for whatever reason might see violence on transvestites/transsexuals/whatever as somehow justified. With that in mind: >by using the term trap you show you think of us the exact same way as people who justify attacking us My impression is that you want to convince me that I somehow have to accept some responsibility for the latter group just by nature of being in the former - nonsense guilt-by-association therefore dismissed pending further clarification. This is probably 'inferential difference', but 99% of of my awareness of the term is self-aware social-critique, where the usage is deliberately intended to ridicule the bigoted, absolutist ideas about masculinity you yourself also criticise; and the remaining 1% is just mainstream lolcows riding on the term in a vain attempt to seem relevant.  >arguing traps aren't gay because they're women is circular reasoning since them being women is effectively that which is under dispute Sure, but then: >traps aren't gay since many heterosexual men are attracted to them without the realisation that this in fact has the same problem (see: how 'heterosexual' might be defined other than blithe self-identity, the very sort of thing you just dismissed in the interest of more convincingly proving the point)  >picture a woman, then picture a penis, that penis is therefore feminine because of the context This is unfortunately nowhere near as convincing as you think it is to someone who isn't already convinced that 'penis' and 'feminine' aren't already contradictions-in-terms. You might as well try to say that a triangle with an extra side is still a triangle.  Going back to the assault statistics, I had a point somewhere early on about how I think it's essentially pointless to try to use the motive of an illegal-regardless-of-context crime like 'deliberate assault/murder' for anything other than 'we determine the motive to thus prove it was deliberate' - to then use the specific motive (be it 'gay hate' or 'personal grudge') to lessen/intensify punishment seems absurd. *Even if* specific motives increase the likelihood or severity of such crimes, once you convict someone the occurrence statistics are meaningless, and the injuries don't become any more/less severe (or the person any more/less dead) just by further attribution of the 'reason' for the attack.  I can't think of how to tie that in directly to what you said, so I'll leave it as food for thought.  As a final point, the biggest disappointment was not including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mgSMOZM7NA - where the irony of Bearing putting so much effort into the sexualised depiction is not lost on me.  I'd be interested to hear some responses."

They generally identify as a man who enjoys to dress as a woman and have an incredibly stereotypically feminine figure   and want to look like a woman as much as they can but for fun mainly and without gender dysphoria or bad feelings about their genitals. This is a general description though because I also know there are non binary self identified traps etc, so I‚Äôm not trying to be minimizing.... so I totally understand where you are coming from girl and I usually appreciate your videos but I think this may be erasing a subculture, while defending trans people so I have mixed feelings on this one"

"Somehat related point: calling things 'gay' is - an ideal world - an ok expression to use. Some ways of behaving, speaking etc are typical of gay people, they can be boiled down to stereotypes and used to metaphorically describe other things. As long as it is used descriptively or jokingly, and not with a real intent to offend - which admittedly is often utopic, depending of the social context in which you find yourself -, calling things gay is not inherently derogatory. It can even be a positive epithet, come to think of it"
"My thoughts throughout this entire video : 'UGH HER MIND!!! üòç'"
"Heterosexual men and women fetishize each other's various body parts and noone calls them a 'chaser' I think it's weird for the LGBT community having a problem with possible fetishzation  when pride parades can be overtly sexual, besides isn't it normal to for attraction to begin with what you find extremely attractive (a fetish), as long as a real love for that person develops and you care about their personality I don't see the issue with a person having a fetish, I would also argue that many that do may infact be late blooming bisexuals, who have a different experience with attraction than gays or straights"

I told my mum myself that girlfriend was born a man and was transitioning, and she cried for a few hours. I never found out what my dad's reaction was, but they're accepting of our relationship now, and I tried to tell my mum's friend about the difference between transgender and transvestite. The only other times were when we were going out and some random man said out loud to his family that 'that isn't right', and also my gay brother called my partner a tranny when he was mad at me. We had a falling out over something else, but I thought he wouldn't use slurs, since he should be familiar with them and their effect"

It's traumatising for the other person; it's not only non consensual- it puts trans people at risk. shouldn't be like that, they deserve to feel safe, but in our world it does propose a danger to them.

Will talk about their right to be equal but at the same time will put down woman especially black woman, talk about how unnatural they think being gay is or how trans people in their minds are a travesty.   It annoys me to no end to see these guys who want to be treated like a human being(which we should, I'm not self-loathing by the way, well I hate myself not my race.) turn around and want to deny others that same basic right, like damn man what the fuck you've felt the pain of unacceptance for something you can't control. Felt the fear of being abused for it and still, you turn around and want to inflict that pain onto others for something they can't control what the fuck.  But here's the kicker I used to be like that and that was and is unacceptable, I will forever be ashamed for how I felt how I thought, and how I treated other minority groups, I'm sorry and you deserved so much better from society."

"I learned a lot about penises today I never thought I'd learn"
"Once again, very entertaining and well produced. I truly enjoy watching your videos.  Once again I have to disagree with you here on one-two fundamental levels:  You left out the most basic component of this whole mess.   Sure, there are many reasons why we - as human animals - are having sex. But there is only one basic reason. The one reason that connects us to all the other animal beings across time (and space, if you will)  ... Yes, you already know it ...  PROCREATION.  Let me surprise you by telling you that to men procreation matters on a fundamental level. Conscious or unconscious. It is the hidden motor for most of the things happening on the surface. Specially because there is not such thing as 'male reproduction rights' - that is a power only held by women.  And in that context traps are truly traps and also basically gay - or at least bi.  And transgenders are truly restricted by their chromosomes. Granted, that is not a nice thing to say, but it is still true.  In that context it doesn't matter how impressive your mental gymnastics are to define a 'feminine penis' or redefine (or rather 'undefine') the categories 'woman', 'man', 'gay' or 'straight' ... Further down that road these words will definitely stop meaning anything. I guess that is the endgoal here: The ultimate freedom! Nothing means anything anymore, so we can stop talking and go back to just being animals. Fucking animals, fucking."
"Yeah, a lot of the it's-a-trap-flavoured transphobia is really just internalized homophobia in straight guys. If your identity is so dependent on being straight, people who make your heterosexual attractions seem gay can be threatening on a very intimate level.  It's very liberating to break free from this mindset."

"Maybe I'd trans women don't want to get murdered then they shouldn't rape men. If you don't know that someone is trans then you can't consent, therefore you have been raped"
"My outlook.  You are gay if you enjoy sex involving the same set of genitals that you possess.  As long as all parties involved are consenting, then it isn't anyone's COTdamn business.   There ain't a damn thing wrong with liking dicks if you have a dick, or liking vagina if you got a cooter.  There also isn't anything wrong with liking someone that has feminine features but still has a dick or vice versa.  The issue here is as with any consenting relationship.  If person A likes pussy and person B does not disclose the lack of having said kitty and instead is swingin a meat saber.   Then naturally that is not a compatible pairing and if the presence of having an extra dick in the equation was not disclosed until clothing was shed.  That's not cool.  It'd be a similar logical path that if a het male wanted to have sex with a Les woman.  He then appeared as female and when it came time to knock boots...whips out a dick."

"Excellent work Natalie! There is a male social obsession in being a 'real man'. The fear of rejection from not being a 'real man' triggers homophobia in most cases. Even trans woman are sometimes homophobic about dating 'real man'. Some respond to this fear of rejection with aggressiveness, and 'alpha male' training. I'm tired of seeing men trying to accomplish 'manhood' by being a jerk, competing with their friends to be the  'alpha', and this standard was set up by antisocial, and not by coincidence, they succeed at 'attracting women'."
"Perhaps this homophobic social tension could be alleviated if the 'real man' standard can be flexed to a pro-social model, to reward harmonic behavior and personality development, to be attracted by persons, not models."

"As a cis gay man... thank you! It's things like this why I've become so insistent in defending the rights and integrity of trans people, because in a lot of ways their violation comes from the same place of ignorance and a fragile idea of masculinity that most homophobic people have, and that I have experienced. The question 'are traps gay?', problematic and ignorant as it is, is the perfect example to encapsulate that, like I don't think of myself as very feminine nor as very masculine, but for a long time I've been afraid of doing things that could be considered feminine because 'I didn't want to be a stereotype' (and those are basic things like hand gestures or talking about some things), and that was the wrong way of looking at it. Basically, those are things that 'are gay' and I didn't want to 'be gay' even though I know I am gay, and that came from internalized prejudice that I had and I still have some of (working on that). Like you said, in the end everyone (including cis straight white men) would benefit from a change of mentality like that, and what do you know, I don't feel any more feminine now but I do feel very much more confident. Also, I'm glad you included trans men in this discussion and mentioned the boy clit.. _WHY ISN'T ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT THE BOY CLIT????_"
"This is some of the most important content on the web rn. As a cis guy who has dated across the gender spectrum, I can absolutely attest that trans people can teach you a lot about gender (and about yourself) in bed. I mean, they can teach you a lot about gender outside of the bedroom, too, but I figure we're on the topic of sexy times. I once slept with a trans guy that my girlfriend at the time was dating (we were also PC slutbags :P), and he was absolutely more of a man in bed (but in a good way) than the cis guy I slept with a few years later.  Don't knock it til you try it guys. And stop fucking killing people because you find them attractive, you cowardly fucks Thanks, Natalie for being such a scholarly BAMF."

"It's not gay, but the penis and trans status complicates things, so ignorant twats hate it because they don't have the brain cells to wrap their heads around it. I label myself bisexual because people understand that. It's more simple than the truth- I'm technically pansexual. I hate 'pansexual' as a term because, to the ignorant majority who don't understand it, it just sounds like I have a fetish for cookware. Thus, I meet people where they're at if it comes up. They have no reason to know who I'm attracted to, but I'm also not ashamed of it. Bisexual just sums it up in a way they can immediately understand, & if the conversation goes in-depth, I clarify that my scope of attraction includes trans. And for full-scope, I happen not to have met someone I knew was ftm who I happened to be attracted to, but I conclude this to simply be a coincidence & that there are ftm I would be attracted to- I just haven't met them."
"Amazing video as always!"
"I just think that people need to tell the true. If you are a trans women say that you are trans women. If you like trans women just say that you like. There's nothing wrong with that. This problem only occurres because people are not truthful."
"See I withold that when you say 'traps arnt gay' you give homophobic dudes an excuse to like people who they are attracted to without forcing them to revaluate their world view. and thus they still act hateful to people who are non heteronormitive. The crux of my opinion is that traps are crossdrssers and not transwomen i guess. But hey, my expirence as a transgirl is pretty different from other peoples imo. My only connection to the trans community for me is the internet. I've never had a bar or a group of irl trans freinds to visit as a girl. So maybe transwoman who live in diffrent parts of the world have a diffrent opinion then me becuse the word trap is thrown at them like a fucking bar stool. Also if i used some wrong terminology Im sorry not trying to offend anyone i just have other responsibilities. i don't have time to look up the right words. P.s. awsome video and awsome look. You inspire me to put more effort into it."

"i love you and your content, but you gotta understand that the trans community is different in japan. very few people identify as trans, more people identify as otokonoko which means they crossdress, either always or just sometimes. very few traps in anime identify as female, or use female pronouns. ive also nearly never heard anyone talk of real trans women as traps in any other way than a cheap insult. i still see the problem and the relation to trans panic, but the community in japan is very different."
"Nothing wrong with being gay. So are transexuals homosexual? Depends. Homosexual is attraction to the appearance of the same sex... so.. what?  Trans women aren't women, but they may look like one.  This is the first time I heard 'trap' in this context."
"Okay, I can't agree with the argument that if men are trying so hard to prove they're not gay, it means they think there's something wrong with being gay. Why not generalise this logic? Trans women only try so hard to prove they're women because they think there's something wrong with being male. Sounds pretty bigoted, right?  Sexual orientation is an identity, you said so yourself. There's nothing wrong with asserting it, and feeling uncomfortable when it's being questioned."
"The organ theme in the very beginning sounds SO familiar. Is it some classic baroque motive or I'm deluded?"
"Maybe I missed it (but I don't think I did) but one thing I thought you might bring up is trans-men and how they would fit into all this. Because surely if a straight guy being attracted to a trans-women is gay then a straight guy being attracted to a trans-man would have to, by that logic, be straight. Which I think even the Ben Shapiro types would have to admit doesn't really make a lot of sense, especially when you look some trans-men."
"So I generally agree with the whole thing about just not worrying about someone's gender or what's gay, as well as the thing that people are attracted to the presentation and not someone's chromosomes or gender identity. However, I'm not sure if this always works. Take the following example (and please point it out to me if I misrepresent anything):  Alex is a cis-man who strongly identifies as homosexual. One day he meets Blake, who presents as a cis-man as well. The two are very attracted to each other and start a relationship. After some time Blake comes out as agender. Alex still perceives Blake as masculine and would not be able to visually perceive their gender identity if he didn't know. He also still has the same strong attraction to Blake as always. Blake feels the same way for Alex but also feels the strongly about their gender identity. This presents a problem. Blake feels that if Alex still considers their relationship to be a homosexual one, that would imply that he still perceives them to be a man. Alex strongly identifies as homosexual and feels like being in a real relationship that is not homosexual would betray his sense of sexuality.  In this case, should Alex give up on identifying as homosexual because he has feelings for someone who does not identify as male? Should the two just split despite having feelings for each other because the sense of identity they both have is irreconcilable?"

The only thing that bothered me was when you were talking about your boobs and you said 'I mean they're small but it's not by any measure a male chest.' I've seen lots of trans women and trans men say stuff like this e.g. 'I have boobs now and boobs are female therefore I'm female' or 'My voice broke thanks to hrt so now I have a male voice.' I don't think we should use the exact same crappy arguments transphobes use to deny our gender to affirm ourselves because if we do that we end up delegitimising pre- and non-op trans people as well as trans people of a different gender to our own and we lend credence to transphobes when they point out any part of us that still resembles the sex we were assigned at birth.  Every trans man who has boobs has a male chest. I think we can argue that people often perceive trans women as women or at the very least not as men (and vice versa for trans men) without falling back on that kind of thing.  The way I argue that people do in fact perceive me as non-binary even if they don't admit that enby genders are real is that women don't see me as one of them and neither do men. I've never been invited to a stag do or a hen do. I don't get invited into any kind of gendered spaces and if I ever insert myself into one there is noticeable discomfort/confusion not just for me but for the other people there. People don't grant me the authority, space, speaking time, etc that they grant men and they don't expect me to perform emotional labour the way they expect women to. Interacting with me challenges people because it's very difficult to pretend something doesn't exist when it's right in front of you. Aside from the obvious painful alienation this causes me it is validating and kind of entertaining to see people do double takes at not just my presentation but my mannerisms, speech patterns and the content of what I say. Medically transitioning has been life changing for me but it's not what makes me non-binary."

"People seem to conflate being dominant/active vs being submissive/passive with entire gender identities. As a cis lesbian I sure as fuck only ever want to dominate and penetrate my partners through any means agreed upon. I don't want or need an actual dick (maybe a fake plastic one, at most).  And as an aside, it's fucking stupid that people often imply that doms/tops/subs/bottoms are translatable as a social hierarchy 100% of the time. Liking to be dominated, owning it and clearly estabilishing their likes/dislikes is what all subs/bottoms should be able to do. Personally, topping another top would be utter nonsense -- I need to respect the needs of those I seek."

"About a month back I was in a room with a bunch of men. I was stealth, a passing trans man, being treated as a man and socialized as one by the others. At some point one of the men...well I say men, they were mostly boys, 18-19...he used the word 'Trap'. I found it pretty safe to call him out, as a fellow 'man' he might even listen to me. What ensued was a lengthy and frankly exhausting discussion where I had to explain why this word was harmful to trans women when all I had said was 'please don't use that word, it's harmful'. I did expect to give some sort of explanation, but I also half expected him to just go 'okay', since I was a fellow man calling him out. I've had that happen before, where I've been able to use my ''male privilege' to call other men out and they've been okay with it. By the end it did seem like this young boy had gotten some new ideas knocked into him and hopefully he's gone and done his own research (it genuinely seemed like his first comment had come from a place of ignorance, not malice). I did learn that I should remain stealth at least, you never know who are comfortable tossing around transphobic language casually like that.  I was surprised a few weeks later to find out that among ourselves there had been a closeted trans woman though. Goes to show that there can be two trans people in a room and the Cis have no idea."

"I am a straight man who is absolutely disgusted by dudes. Absolutely zero attraction to guys, their parts, muscles, hair or any of the masculine things.  I adore women. Everything about them tbh. Their soft skin, pretty hair, smell, voices, hips, lips, tits, butts, (body etc), their feminine minds and everything.  I've seen a couple drag queens in full costume who looked hot, but really not into it. But I'm mildly attracted to these (synonym for traps). Only the most feminine and passable tho. Its definitely not the fact that they have dicks. Seeing that lil deformed worm spinning around really grosses me out, but there is something about them that turns me on.  I LOVE the uber feminine, cute, girly girls. My hot points are the hair, makeup, all of that feminine stuff. I am attracted to the female body yes, but it's the image that turns me on. One thing I've come to appreciate about some trans women, is they build their image off of those things. They overcompensate that feminine image and really go the extra mile. There are exceptions, but 8/10 I'm not gonna be attracted to messy women who just wear sweats and no makeup. I'm from a state where alot of the women dress outdoorsy and kind of tomboyish. I'm NOT attracted to tomboys at all. I like those southern belles. My ultimate is like Audrey Hepburn, Mamie Van Doren, Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, SZA, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, the more feminine the better.  A couple of years ago, I matched with a trans woman who looked JUST like a young, sexier, Lisa Ann in her pictures. It was all boobs, red lips, pornstar makeup and hair, over accentuated body. I was taken aback when I found out she was trans. I was shocked, confused, disappointed, and started telling her how I had been tricked. I said to her, that I saw all those visual cues (hair, makeup, boobs, red lipstick) and I was made to believe she was a girl. Her reply shattered my mind. She said: that's kinda the point. I have grown and thought alot since then, but that run in definitely made sense of things for me. I understood that I was attracted to femininity. I understand now that it's not always the gender, it's the feminine imagery that I'm attracted to. If it looks like my mental image of pure femininity, I probably want to fuck it, regardless of the chromosomes.   Still never have slept with anything other than natural born females.  Still grossed out by dicks in general. Definitely no desire to touch, fondle or have sex with a dick.  But I'm alright with being attracted to trans women. I'm not attracted to the 'trans', I'm attracted to the WOMAN.   Also: I kind of applaud trans women for pressing females to step up their game. You guys put in the makeup and hair work to look on point, its putting alot of these natty's to shame."
"just wanted to point out that ContraPoints is so smart and wise, cause in fact, in essence, and in her core nature... SHE IS MALE MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
"This is one of the many reasons I'm grateful to be a straight trans man rather than a straight trans woman. Women generally seem to care less about this stuff, if they like me then they like me but if they don't then that's that. There's less of this internal conflict of wondering if they're a lesbian because they're attracted to a man who doesn't have a penis (this is just my observations and experience obviously I don't speak for all trans men or women). So long as we look, feel and smell like men; women just seem to give less fucks about our genitals"
"natalie, i love ya, but this is the first video of yours i have some major disagreements with. it's very regrettable that the word has become misused by clueless dumbasses who literally cannot discern between transwomen and crossdressers, but 'trap' refers to an actual subculture of, putting it simply, queer cis men or enbies who enjoy female gender expression either part time or full time. it differs from the term 'crossdresser' in that the latter only describes clothing, not this particular feminine aesthetic or overall vibe.  i've seen several of these videos which rightfully scrutinize and denounce its use as a pejorative word for transwomen. but none of them have seemed to have ever interacted with self-identified traps, or are even aware of their existence. there are lots of internet communities comprised of traps, femboys and transwomen all getting along fine and supporting each other. these communities hold a lot of emancipatory potential and queer empowerment, and function as genuinely empathetic and helpful support groups as well as offering us a space to connect with others and potentially meet partners.  utterly denouncing the word 'trap' and telling people to stop using it, *period*, entails ripping the identity away from these groups of queer people and erasing the culture we consociate under. the word 'queer' used to be a slur, but it's been reclaimed. the desirable and right thing to do in my view is to reclaim 'trap', with its legitimate definition, because condemning it altogether means erasing a very real, already marginalized group of people -- or, on the contrary, just causing them to spite everyone telling them their identity is a slur and creating even more division among our already strained community at a time when we desperately need solidarity."
"You fall into the trap of generalizing the porn habits of straight men. I'm very much a straight male, and there are no dicks in my porn. I also acknowledge how homo-erotic 'bro culture' is.

"Overall I really liked this video, but there's one thing I took issue with I feel like is worth pointing out. You brought up trans women of color, and the fact they are targeted for more violence. I think it's worth pointing out its people of color who Target them. my interaction with white nationalists makes me feel like they're more likely to attack a white transgender person than a transgender person of color  In the white nationalist mind-state, transgender people are undermining the white race, and I imagine they probably don't give a fuck about sissy people of color, if anything in there Twisted minds they're probably relieved that they're undermining their own races.  I don't feel like violence towards trans women of color is a racism issue. The fact of the matter is the safest place for LGBT people are white majority Nations, and presenting violence against trans women of color as an issue of racism is intellectually dishonest. There is not gangs of white nationalist specifically targeting transgendered women of color. People of color are targeting transgender people of color"

I have an honest question about the womanhood of trans women (not to be confused with questioning the womanhood of trans women; sorry if this hurts anyone):  when we say 'trans women are women', to what extent is this supposed to imply that we do not make a difference between trans women and cis women? I ask because I've noticed that the one trans girlfriend I have, while she has pulled every string currently possible in transitioning, still sometimes exhibits distinctly male behaviours which are clearly due to her being socialised as male until early adulthood. for example (trivial anecdote, but still), she consistently doesn't offer to help clean up after dinner at me and my wife's place, a behaviour that seems to have literally a 100% accuracy divide between cis women, who always offer help, and people who are not cis women, who never offer help.  I would love to see a video from you going more deeply into the question 'are trans women different from cis women?'. but whatever you do, it's gonna be great, so thanks in any case."

"The issue with 'fake femininity' is not restricted to trans women, unfortunately. A long time ago I bought into the ludicrous idea that even the simplest makeup was 'fake' and an attempt by less desirable women to attract men. I know, I am sorry about that. I know better now. But I am pretty damn sure that many men think like that, disregarding if a woman is trans or cis. That is the reason why so much porn where the female actress does have breast prosthetics still affirms on the title that the mentioned breasts are natural. Frankly now that I think of it, men are entirely too concerned about 'how things naturally are', maybe in the attempt to gatekeep and dissuade people from learning? That people say 'grow a pair' instead of 'learn to be a man' is quite telling. Anyway, great video."

"Very tricky video, I'm sure a lot of people will swallow it up. You avoided, very tactfully I might add, the discussion of femininity and what is represents on a spiritual level. All of you people love to focus on looks and appearances and feelings, and I agree, within those factors you are a woman and fucking you would not be gay. But this is a false equation. Femininity is more than just about smells, fuckholes and pretty lock on your head. You brushed off the 'holy passage' argument the same way people brush off the 'traps arent gay' argument. How about you give equal respect as the one you are demanding for your view in this video? What is a woman but a mother? Everything YOU sexualize in womanhood is just a biological system for motherhood. Like beasts for example. Women have breasts to feed their babies. Why the fuck do you need a pair? You are fetishizing motherhood and it is disgusting on a fundamental level."

"Are you piggybacking off 'Misinformed'???? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pSshx4VHOY  My apologies. 'Are traps Gay?' It is obviously an issue. I need to watch the rest of the video. OK, part way through video. I must confess that I was a little reactionary cause that intro was a bit much. Great video and information so far. I had never heard of the term 'traps' as used in this video until I had come across the 'misinformed' video, so I didn't know what it was.  Interestingly you talk about straight men using 'trap' as a slur against being tricked. I have also seen straight guys grow angry and accuse 'ugly' women or women who were formally 'ugly' 'unattractive' etc and got plastic surgery or worked on themselves and became attractive as tricking these guys into being attracted to them. Cause an 'ugly' woman becoming attractive is fraud and should be called out or killed or something. I am not sure what the mentality of these guys are. It is confusing. I don't get it. I am trying to find out what is driving it.  Part way through. Have to go to work. Will watch the rest tonight. OK, What drives men to use the term 'traps' masculine anxiety around sex. Masculine anxiety around identity. Information filed and stored."

"Once again, a fucking great video!"
"The 'traps' in the 'are traps gay' meme are male crossdressers (often fictional, from 'the orient'), such as Astolfo from the Fate franchise. They are anatomically male. Likewise female crossdressers are referred to as 'reverse traps', such as Naoto from Persona 4. Fictional transsexuals are given their own terms such as 'futanari', 'newhalf', etc based in Japanese culture, one example being Poison from Final Fight/Street Fighter. Ignoring this point, the rest of the video is great, and you even argue that the question isn't worth asking anyways. However, those acquainted with the 'dank memes' might be dismissive because your premise doesn't line up with their understanding of the word 'trap'. Real life is obviously more complex than what I've laid out, but keep in mind that the people asking these sorts of questions are typically buried neck-deep in fiction. So maybe what I'm trying to say is that you didn't really tackle the fictional aspect of this 'debate'. I totally understand why you would do so, given the importance of everything you brought up in the video. tl;dr the video needed to be 5 hours longer and talk extensively about anime and sad pandas"
"I don't care what you call it, Astolfo is legit cute af."
"CON TRAP POINTS  - With points from a ... Did you just... ?"
"I agree with everything, no buts. (Here comes an observational but though) But even then I must say that in colloquial register if you say 'sucking a man's penis just once to try it isn't gay', it doesn't map well to the actual use of the word. Like even though I  understand how it isn't, my first response is to think 'well fuck me if it isn't, it's basically the definition'. I *know* it isn't the definition, but it seems  such an essential part  even though it's technically not part of the definition that in regular use it's hard to discern between both . I think the argument you used against Ben Shapiro / Peterson about the pronoun 'she' (with which I agree completely) kind of applies. Not a one to one relationship because gay has more history of fragilizing masculinity but it still can be argued that if the way the word is used has something so ingrained working around it so it fits your definition (even if it is the actual textbook definition) seems odd and doesn't translate to reality."
"Good god goddamn this video is great.  I am a 20 yo straight cis guy who dabbled in the 'skeptic' part of youtube, and when you talked about what it means to be a man, that especially got to me.  Also, you're pretty hot"

This is a question for  psychologist 's.   It is such a complicated topic, especially with all these hormone therapies and surgeries which completely changes the playing field.   By your description of the men who date trans women there are clearly deeper psychological factors at play than gay/straight sexuality."
"actually natalie, sex with a trans-woman is just that. (sex with a _trans-woman_ )"
"Natalie making me think a lot about all this trash that the other people put in me.  I mean Im currently at the stage like 'I didn't want date trans cuz I hate dicks'... But what would I say if I grow up in much less misogynistic environment where the others would show me that it's okay to date a trans? I mean animals didn't have a society dependent tastes, they will fuck same gender/tree/human leg. I feel like underdeveloped self dishonest coward =\"
"To me you are the singular testament to the interesting place we are headed in the future. Most people when thinking about the future, focus on the futuristic techno-dystopia/utopia routes, but your combination of personal liberty, intellectual standards, and a cultural synthesis of too many things to count, is what I believe is the kind of transition (pun intended) that awaits many modern-day societies. The content and production quality is so good without overtly depending on technology, and instead placing in the limelight your commitment to good narrative and discourse, with a unique ability to avoid both 'oh I expected that view/argument' AND 'well that's just being a contrarian'. Just wanted to share that, good stuff!"
"Bloody hell, you're brilliant."
"'oh yes, the penis' me at every hour of my life"
"There's a lot of talk in this video about how insecure some men seem to be about the thought of 'becoming' non-straight, or being peceived as such, but I actually think there is a slight mischaracterisation in talking about this insecruity as if it is primarily a kind of outright conscious or unconscious dislike and devaluing of not being straight.  I think that for a lot of people, the cornerstone of the insecurity about being percieved by others or by oneself as not straight is not technically what you might call biggotry, rather it is more a kind of fear of change, fear of the unknown, fear of not fitting in, fear of feeling different, of having to adjust how you think of yourself.  I think a lot of people take comfort in being 'just normal' in a lot of areas of their lives. Of course, most people wants to stand out in SOME way, but conformity for conformity's sake is also a pretty poweful thing. So it doesn't HAVE to be that someone thinks not being straight makes you technically inferior in order for them to be insecure about it, I think it's also the fear of complicating one's identiy, of wanting to be complacent.  I think this is why a lot of non-trans people seem to be inexplicably freaked out by the term 'cis', even if the word is not an insult. I think the reason they don't like it can simply be that the term cis is a specific word that describes them for what they techincally are, rather than defining them for how normal they are. It frames them as having a specific identity, rahter than the comfort of simply being 'identity neutral', 'default', 'just normal'.  So in conclusion, I think it's worth remembering that the perception of struggle is relative, and that whilst it may seem trivial compared to having some kind of marginalized identity, the discomfort that can come with being insecure in a 'normal' identity is worth understanding and empathizing with. That way, you're more likely to be able to show people that they don't have to be afraid, and you're more likely to win support and understanding for your cause."

"I watched like 35 minutes and there is something important that you have not yet discussed I don't know if you do it later on in the video, because frankly I don't think you will.  It's the question of wether or not trans people should disclose that they are trans when they are dating. For instance, if Joe is okay with dating trans people but Jim isn't, surely to prevent Jim from dating you in the first place would be preferable? Surely the men who are not (as) turned on by trans women would appreciate the openness? Maybe I'm just projecting but I really think it's the simplest way for everyone."

"so i‚Äôm a trans girl myself and i don‚Äôt know if you were in character (it didn‚Äôt seem like it ?) when you called count dankula a scottish hate crime-convict. the ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô in question was he uploaded a video of his pug while he made tongue-in-cheek jokes about the holocaust. they‚Äôre jokes. jokes are free speech. he did nothing wrong and his conviction is an embarrassment to all of the UK.  he‚Äôs also not equivalent to milo, although. i can‚Äôt say the same about the other people you showed him among because i have no clue who they are or what they stand for. milo actually holds hateful opinions, many of which i believe count dankula also disagrees with. i really, really hoped you‚Äôd do a better job of covering the fact that an edgelord (who actually holds fairly leftist opinions) was convicted of a hate crime over literal jokes.  also i‚Äôm apparently the only trans girl who‚Äôs never been offended by the word ‚Äútrap‚Äù lol i sorta like to use it to describe myself."
"Long live the queen of dairy!"
"I'm an intersex person since I am diagnosed with De la Chapelle Syndrome. My Genotype is 46XX, I'm a woman, and yet I also have a penis.   As to what effect it has had on my life or my experiences, I am sorry to say: Literally none at all. It's intangible and invisible and totally meaningless. The simple truth of the matter is that people care about how I look and act, and nothing more, since, as Contra said, nobody can detect my chromosomes. Even medical professionals seem to care more about looks and behavior than genotype. After all, that's how you know what my gender is - observing me. Whether I get hate in public, or not, depends entirely on attractiveness.   'Cis privilige' is about being in a zone of acceptable apperance, and otherwise, you're screwed. I doesn't matter what you actually even are, and even the odd cis woman gets trans-hate. Sure, I can bring it up, and it might just reassure a small percentage of people - but most don't care. On the whole, it makes no difference. Really, most peoples answer to whether it's gay or not is based entirely on how hot you are; that's their real depth of analysis.   You could call me a transwoman or not, I would never do that - I don't like to differentiate myself, and I was raised mostly as a girl. I I apply for the diagnosis of GID since I feel dysphoria - which should be understandable, penis and all, but according ICD I literally cannot be trans. Funny how that works.   As for the overly simplistic and sometimes hateful biological determinist - they will always just keep finding excuses to exclude people they feel are icky. If a Transwoman has the genotype 46XX, the argument just becomes about post birth treatment instead. If that excludes some women they wouldn't want to exclude, it becomes about natal development. If that doesn't work, true women, to them are only women who at some point in their lives had a working uterus capable of bearing children. That might also exclude somebody they don't want to exclude, an intersex person who had surgery at a young age. But the excuses will never end, and they never define a standard. They don't care. These people are rarely consistent with themselves. Really, that type of argument is just an excuse to exclude you in the moment it is being had. It is a disguise.   These people really just need to be called out.   Suddenly being a woman is about nothing other than the ability to pump out a unit every 9 months, as George Carlin would put it. And anyone else is gay to touch. 'Is it gay' is men having shamed each other over perceived lesser-ness of transwomen. Screw that type of toxic insecure masculinity. It's men being hurt themselves, for no reason whatsoever, in a transphobic way, making themselves act in a transphobic way for defense.  'Is it gay?' is only worth asking if you have fears about being gay. Otherwise you'd just accept your attractions, dumb memes notwithstanding.  To have that fear, you must implicitly view gay as a bad thing. Which is why having to ask that question is homophobic. My reply to 'Is it gay' is - 'who the hell even cares'.   Also: Let it be known that if Chromosomes make it gay or not, my girldick is safe for consumption.  :*"
"Whether I'm right or wrong  or if I'm being too ' ignorant redneck' with my thinking on this subject but what people don't know won't hurt them! I'm not trying to be an ' ignorant redneck'  but the way I see it's all about illusion you got it or you don't. We gotta understand not everyone's gonna get it whether their being intentionally mean or just a simple mistake. For instance Contra here as opposed to Gamestop Contras  got it Gamestop has obviously has not got what it  takes! It's all about tricking the eye as for gamestop sadly i dont think will ever transition far too manish no amount of surgery will kill the manly attributes. I'm not trying to single Gamestop out but he or she is a perfect well known example of my illusion hypothesis.  Contra here is transitioning very well and isn't a brute man in a wig like Gamestop do you see what I'm getting at. If you can't look in the mirror and see who your aspiring to be don't expect others to and get butt hurt about it when they dont. I'm not trying to be mean just real if you want to be accepted as the other it's about illusion. I don't use the terms I use as a mean thing I just can't think of another word to fit what I'm trying to say. I'm a redneck country boy granted I don't understand any of this gender thing that's being sorta shoved down our throats but be nice to me and I'll be nice to you. If your a linebacker in a wig don't act like a 2 year old and flip out you gotta understand your a linebacker in a wig. Contra excellent video as always and lol if your vagina does truly suck that sounds like a good time and you should promote it more often lol!"
"hey Contra , a while back a really close friend admitted to me that they wanted to start crossdressing, but they used the word trap to describe what they want to do. i guess they've always been more on the edgy side anyway, but should i say? also they were born a man but they crossdress and i wanna be super supportive what pronouns do i use"
"I adore you Contra but Count Dankula did nothing wrong, and its upsettingly disingenuous of you to simply refer to him offhandedly in the manner with which you did early on in the video."
"How would a man know if he was gay or not if he never sucked a dick?(how would you know unless you tried it) To truly be 'straight' a man would have to actualy suck a dick to make sure they don't enjoy it. Tastes can change over a persons lifetime so a man would have to requalify every year or two or they could turn gay and not know. Ergo the only way to accurately call oneself straight is to regularly suck dick.    Logic and stuff gets pretty absurd when you try and apply it to humans because we are to complex to be accurately described by simple statements, which is why I think a lot of psychology is mostly crap.   Trans people are human, and just like every other human on this planet they should be treated humanely. If you get into the bedroom with a trans woman and her dick weirds you out that much, then politely excuse yourself, but make damn sure you let her know 'its not you, its me' because it is."

"You are cowardly in just one way, you focus all your words onto men. You, as a trans-woman are totally unable to criticise cis-women because you know they more than anyone can actually revoke your access to the girls club.  I don't disagree with your criticisms of men at the end. However to call men pathetic cowards for not being strong enough while ignoring the how women treat them for being honest veers into hate. Women don't *have* to call men fags etc. they hold the sexual power so all they do is smile and say 'aww, you're not my type sweetie but you'll find someone'. *cough cough just not me I think you're secretly gay*.  Those thoughts you talked about in a parents head when their child brings home a trans girl are nothing in comparison to a woman's thoughts if she found out her partner once sucked a cock. All the while, she can experiment sexually however she want with no loss of social status.   So you'll never speak your true thoughts on women, you can't. And I honestly even understand. But I rest easy knowing that at night random incel talking points circle your thoughts, frustratingly unable to escape from your mouth."
"I don‚Äôt think male heterosexuality is only self-policed. Having tried to be openly bisexual as a male, every attempt to date women ended with them expressing their disgust for me having had male partners previously. Why would straight men want to risk being outcast from 99% of their dating pool? That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so paranoid."
"I know, this has nothing to do with the actual thematic of this video, but it¬¥s nice to see a shakesperian trained actress on youtube."

"I‚Äôm so glad I can support you, you‚Äôre nearly to half a million subs!"

"Me @ 15:55 - 'Dont nerd shame me Contra, NOTHING IS REAL'"
"You were very disingenuous when you mentioned Count Dankula. He doesn‚Äôt think traps are gay so you‚Äôve obviously not looked into his views at all. Also an interesting fact is that Blacks are 5 times more likely to commit a violent hate crime against a trans women than whites. However FBI stats include Hispanics and Arabs as white, I imagine that if you only counted Europeans as white when the differences in hate crimes would be even higher. So diversity is literally killing trans people."
"Ok, this may come back to hount me, but I can understand the 'families that reject man that date transwomen'. Because 'families' are (sometimes, traditionally) about, you know, families, children, passing on genes. And dating a transwomen makes it kind of difficult. Not that I dont think that we have enough people on this planet and if you dont want o have any, good for you, thank you, but, I am playing devils advocate and I can understand the families. (Not agree, understand.)"
"Brilliant stuff as always CP. we have a long way to go before trans people are treated equally by society. It reminds me a lot of how gays were treated in the 80s & 90s, but I think trans acceptance will be harder to truly achieve. Good on CP for bringing attention to this seldom discussed issues."
"It's sad for me that what I mostly took away from this was that she probably slept with Ollie and that my hope that Nat might date me if she met me in real life seems more likely, seeing as I am a beautiful bisexual woman which I hope is her type."

"But but.... are drag queens gay?   Jokes aside. I vaguely remember that when the traps meme came about - it was circling around metrosexual anime characters who identifies as men, but are so pretty that straight men are attracted to them. Somewhat like Mulan and Shang when she was acting male. So in a way, it's not so simple, since these pretty men prefer to be men (but not masculine), and is the definition of your sexual attraction to presentation or identity? Are you gay because you fuck masculinity or you fuck self-identified men?"

"The notion of the 'Trap' is flawed in a way similar to the movie ghost trope: The ghost - for some unexplored reason- is driven to scare mortals, but with no apparent motive, no inner life: it is just there to scare you.   The 'Trap' is the object of a mix of hysterical castration anxiety, sexual curiosity and titillation; a sinister gay scheming to rob you of your masculinity.  This imaginary monster only exists in the minds of the insecure, socially conservative people, alongside the figure of the sinister foreigner."
"God you improve upon everything! Subject matter, editing, makeup, jokes, writing, dress, etc. etc. My roommate and I get excited every time we see you've uploaded a new video. Can't wait for the next one!"
"If only straight men knew just how much gay men don't wanna date trans women... Hell, most gay men don't even want to date other gay men who work as drag queens. Or even just other gay men who are slightly too feminine for their preferences. If dating trans women was gay, don't you think gay men would be doing it? Yet it's mostly just straight men. Food for thought."
"I don't remember how I found your channel, but I will be ever grateful for the circumstances responsible."
"What a strong ending! (Who you wanna shame)"
"Great film Mommy!"
"I'm probably wrong or oversimplifying a lot here, but I can't help but think that the root of the anger towards the 'T**p' is based in a lot of these men viewing the female form as existing solely for their sexual perusal so when a woman turns out to be Trans they feel like that woman woke up that morning with the sole purpose of tricking him... Because you know she can't just have been existing for anything else but his boner"
"Well said. As a lesbian who's only really dated other trans women, I really don't have too much to worry about from men freaking out at me. However, there's been a few scary encounters, most of them involving terrifying glares or verbal attacks. It's shitty our society has developed such a toxic attitude about sexuality among other things."
"When I explored my feminine side, I learned to love the man who I was inside. When you explored your feminine side, you turned away from the masculine energy that was inside you.  You are then like a yin yahn symbol who has pegged out of its eyes and then thinks they see clearly because they can only see one truth since they have eliminated their other halve.  You are not man, nor are you woman in my eyes, you are a  person who has lost contact with themselves and their spirit.  I honestly do not care if you are a man or a woman, since a true soul is neither man nor woman, but is both at the same time, which is something straight cis people also don't understand. You can be anything you want to be but the last thing you should do, is reject the source from which you are born, that source is both masculine and feminine.  So in honesty, I think I am more of a man and more of a woman than you are right now because I do have contact with both sides of myself whereas I feel you have shunned and neglected your masculine self.  Also yes traps are very gay. In that they don't accept half of who they are. Which is sad.  To give more context, I have had plenty of dreams where I was a woman and felt all the female emotions, it was great, the worst dreams I had were the dreams where I did not know what I was and where I should be regarding my gender. To be confused about your gender, that truly is a huge burdon to bear and everytime I woke up from such a dream I thanked the universe for putting me back in my own body because the life as a confused person is a hell in and of itself.  Do love your videos though, you make interesting points sometimes but I do mis your masculine side. I think you wee a beautiful man."

"I think you may have covered this slightly in another video, but what do you have to say about\what do you feel about women who identify themselves as traps? Are they making things worse, or are they reclaiming the word for themselves?"
"I am non binary, so technically (if you accept my existence) I can't be either gay nor straight, and even if I could, I consider myself bisexual at the very least. But the reason I am attracted to cis 'traps' is because they are men who put an effort into looking fem, a bit like drag queens. On the other hand I am attracted to trans women as women, and with a whole different set of criteria. So, are traps gay? Yes, if you are a gay man who is into crossdressing cis men. No, if you are a straight man that likes them because they are female presenting. Things can have two answers."

"the last part of the video is on point. the 'is this gay' game is so exhausting. it becomes so much more freeing when you just stop giving a shit and learn who you are and what you're into. In fact exploring different things and being open to new feelings has confirmed my identity as a straight man to a much larger extent than freaking out over what is and isnt 'gay.'  I think i'm pretty straight but sometimes I've felt like i'm 'less straight' than other guys, but I think that's just me defining 'straight' as 'insecure' lmao"

I did not think of you as attractive then (it was more that I was also a postgraduate philosophy drop out). But now you look more like, um, a woman?

"Question: How much chivalry should an man ally extend to a by choice hyperfeminine trans woman?    Basis To call any woman ugly or unattractive, or has an unattractive penis or fails in some other way to conform to the myth would be un-chivalrous but in feminism that can be a mixed curse or even a blessing. However trans women if I'm reading this right, often emphasise conformity with conventional feminine role model (whether to avoid cis -male shit or as a matter of expression I would guess varies). To these women the beauty myth would be a real thing? If so then any slur even an incidental remark on appearance would be very hurtful.    So - should one pay insincere compliments to a feminine trans-woman in the style of perhaps the 1950s? One would not want to role play 'Brief Encounters' or would one? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDCTlVWduk  Attempted answer I'd say no more than a greater sensitivity to 'does my fat ass look fat in these jeans' type questions. Until one knows preferences that is.  But I'm guessing.  Not important to get an answer, I would think. More important that I pay attention and show some signs that i'm trying to get my shit together. And that I prepare my mind to stand up against violence on emotional, verbal, physical or other level because some time I'm going to get called on my shit by some asshole giving a trans woman shit within my orbit. And that is one test I want to pass."
"This is beautiful- thank the goddess for Miss Wynn. You are beautiful too."
"I think what I like about your videos is how you make the world both simpler and more complex. I'm firmly middle-aged, so the specific terms connected to sexuality and gender are new to me, but what those words describe aren't novel at all. People are fundamentally unchanged from the late 1960s , at least in my experience. What is new is being able to see and hear a wider variety of people wrestle with these ideas and the language.   I like that you're specifically a wider variety of people all on your own. Maybe you're out of your mind from time to time (I don't believe you are, by the way), but that doesn't mean you're not right."
"Videos like this are healthy. Especially for people who are capable of realising faults in their day to day thinking that they dont question. Seemingly nice and understanding people that just havent explored their own minds and tastes enough. Because for the average human its like 'why delve into how i feel about a concept that i am completely sheltered from and dont encounter at all in my life' until they do encounter it and then act innapropriately. Anyway videos like this help me, I live in australia in a small town and i never see anyone outside my family, what i know about myself is im attracted to the female body but im also attracted to dicks i guess but not the male body (i.e a male stripping does nothing for me).  Romantically im definitely too nervous to pursue anyone other than a woman and im rarely sexual so romantic attraction seems more important to figure out for me. Anyways this video helped me realise i need to think about this more."

I've been spending years wondering why transwomen were offended by the word trap. Because I thought trap exclusively referred to gay men dressing as women on purpose to attract straight men. Naive me, 'How can a transwoman be a trap? She's a woman and... *baffled look of innocence untarnished*' Now I know and realize that I was just very confused. When before has education been so sexy?!?"

"Thank you for making this video."
"As a trans gal i agree with a lot of things you are saying, buuuut, i think you're over generalising, saying that its just men saying it (when my female friend was the one who taught me the meme) and how only trans women of colour are being murdered and not white girls, which may not be as common but still would be happening. I also think that its alright for a guy not to be into me cause ive got a dick, just as much as I understand some guys are mainly into girls who have dicks. Its not that they think 'ew there actually a man' its more of there just not into it which is completely fine!"

"I do agree that any cis straight male who's having or had sex with a transwomen isn't gay and should be considered as one in any sort of way, and this video sheds the light on that point because way too many cis straight men are on this constant state of a 'sexual crisis' where they believe that they have to profusely remind people and even themselves that they're heterosexuals. But however I have a question and someone please answer it's a long one...  In my case and probably some others, I'm just not attracted to transwoman sexually or romantically and prefer not to purse them. For anyone reading this so far just hold on and hear me out,  I'm going reiterate I do not think in any shape or form that having sex with a transwoman is gay nor contradicts my 'straightness' but if I were to be given a choice to have a relationship or sex with one I would decline due to my and my alone personal preferences. But here's the issue with that, how do I go about it in real life? As in I don't go on dating apps or sites where I can display my preferences and people will know beforehand, and it's also considered rude and very disrespectful to ask or demand people to disclose their sex/gender and medical records because to many their records are none of my business and I respect that. So how do I go about telling people my preferences irl?  Also this is in no way a 'gotcha' question nor me coyly trying to imply anything harmful, I'm just want to know better."

The answer I can never truly know as my opinion changes on a day by day basis.  That may sound like a cop-out but it's the only way I could have explained.  Until now.   Nat, your video gave me a wake up call I should feel ashamed this I like seeing dicks being pleasured.  Maybe because I want my dick to be pleasures.  Do I want to pleasure dicks other than mine own?  I can probably say no to that. I made out with a dude and didn't get going so....I think it's just a empathy thing.  Anyway Ms. points,  your video was very informative and I'll try to not like my fear conquer me.  As it is to be a man."
"A s   a   c i s   g a y   g u y, I started playing this video thinking it would be of utmost irrelevance to me. I wasn't hung up on stupid transphobic nonsense, I watch anime only in secrecy and pray to my kami-sama for forgiveness, but also, I wasn't attracted to trans women because trans women are, repeat after me cis-folk, W O M E N. Turns out, and I really should have seen this coming, this special psychosexual brand of transphobia is in part motivated by internalised homophobia / a reactionary need for a masculine self-identity. Sister, and do I ever know that. My fellow men, liberate yourselves from thineselves. Stop limiting your sexualities beyond what you're attracted to. Start exploring your feelings instead of asking yourselves if your actions make you less straight. Heck, I wore a flanel shirt the other day, not because I've turned into a straight lumberjack or a lesbian baseball coach, but because I felt like it.  Also, this video had your best comedy so far, honey. You're doing kami-sama's work."

I've found a lot of this in my own experience as well. Many 'allies' are people who have only recently come around to the lines of thinking that they so proudly proclaim, and they're really only trying to convince themselves when they go on 'woke' twitter rants.  I'm also glad you ultimately said the answer to the question at hand doesn't truly matter. I think most have the potential to come to that conclusion themselves but that it's buried underneath a lot of stigma and confusion that can be hard to cut through.

"I‚Äôm done with Ben Shapiro - in my mind, up until recently, the only leg he had to stand on was his menace to transgender people. When I think about the neverending arguments (the neverending story ah a ha ah ah ha ah‚Ä¶) ‚Äì yes, it gives me anxiety. But then to hear the pathetic way Ben lets his argument fall out of his mouth like some baby man watching puddle puff people learning about pouring water into magicky bucket. I just think ‚Äì why do I even waist thought on these eccentric loser's words?   Basically the main staple of the Right is 'victim blaming' isn't it (and victimizing people)  Ben Shapiro is even willing to throw his own grand father under the bus apparently: I mean not only is he willing to deny the rights of people he might decide to shoot, he was also in one of his debates I watched telling a story about his schizophrenic grand father to defend his anti-transgender rhetoric, by trying to make them equivalent ‚Äì and you know what, maybe they are!...   When it is known that a big factor in triggering schizophrenia is stress... as in I am saying that he doesn't care if his brand of transphobia is actually a big factor in the cause of mental illness in transgender people, in the same way he doesn't care if his callous policies lead to greater mental illness in the general population such as his grand father suffered from.   Honestly, though, Ben Shapiro should watch himself - to me he seems only a hair trigger from being schizophrenic himself as he (like Donald Trump and Jordan Peterson and Alex Jones and all the other nuts on the right) already displays classic symptoms of schizo-typal personality disorder it seems to me.   Apparently, the insular cortex mediates our transition from internal to external awareness - and as such is heavily implicated in many mental health problems.   I guess it is no surprise that the insular cortex is implicated in both disregulation in switching between internal and external awareness (due to damage from stress - e.g PTSD) in the case of schizophrenia, and gender dysphoria by way of pain signals (for example regarding body dysphoria) that in people go to first to appear into conscious awareness through the insular cortex (chronic pain and self harming also seem to involve the insular cortex), as well as emotional disregulation (for example Reactionaries) also being a feature of problems with the insular cortex‚Ä¶     It‚Äôs all part of the same sickness, it seems to me, and figures like Ben Shapiro are a chief candidate in the cause of the symptoms: they just want to shoot at your feet to make you dance (gross domestic product) like some phlegm spitting sun roasted outlaw cowbay who has become permenantly encrusted into their long johns they stole off their tall dead brother called john because they shot him for being tall and called john.  f*ck you Ben Shapiro."

"Our culture is still extremely Puritan when it comes to sex and nudity  and toxic with masculinity. I have a few straight guy friends I know who have made out with a guy and even experienced a bit more. I still think of them as straight. They don‚Äôt seek out men and are very much only interested in being with women. I very much agree sexuality isn‚Äôt black and white and is indeed an acid trip spectrum. I admire and respect how comfortable they are with themselves.  Wish I could be that comfortable!  You also have a surge of professional athletes coming out who feel they had to constantly beat the straight guys to reassert their masculinity as if being gay makes them less masculine.   I also empathize with the ‚Äúwomen‚Äù being called traps. I often wonder at what point in dating do you usually inform a guy you‚Äôre trans? I can‚Äôt imagine the anxiety and fear of rejection that comes along with having to get close to someone who could potentially have that toxic view of trans women."

If some one gets really excited or quiet when they realize you have a penis or might have a penis nothing good can come of it. Yeah it is scary especially being small I have no chance of fighting against them and also being on estrogen gets rid of any muscle mass you used to have. It could be because my uber account says to the driver: 'Pick up Dave on the right' When it should say 'Pick up that little sissy faggot that might be a girl so you can sexually harass her, on the right'.

"This meme and similar is X gay memes can be condensed to 'is it gay for a man to have sex with a woman'  Like, the MFM threesome example, how gay is it to have sex with a woman? Is it gay to have sex with a (trans) woman? Is it gay to be aroused by a crossdresser who manages to tick all the boxes that make women attractive to men?   In short, is it gay to be straight?  AronRa says that religion reverses everything. When the alt-right reverses gay to mean straight, it is a point to me that this might be a cult."

HE FOUND CAPTAIN WINKY!'   Couldn't resist.  Seriously, though, props on the long ass video. I'll just see myself out now."
"1) Okay, straight up. If one of my male friends said he's dating a girl and she's from Cincinnati, Ohio. My reply would actually kind of be like 'Okay, I didn't know you were into people from Ohio.' My wife is from Ohio and she wouldn't date people from Ohio. As she puts it 'There's a reason why a lot of the astronauts want come from Ohio.' https://youtu.be/Q54rRJv-jhI?t=94 2) Traps came from the japanese futanaris or otokonoko? Then they've completely missed that point of those branches and fetishes by asking the question in the first place. You might as well be asking 'If a women rides a man, does that make him gay?' at that point. And yes, I once asked a man who saw himself as progressive and/or liberal. And he jumped straight from the idea of pegging to 'That's raping men.' and ' Most men would think it's rape.'. 3) Maybe that should be a law. If you jerk off to a group of people, that group deserve equal rights and treatment. 4) Honestly, thank you for the video. Especially your personal experiences. I honestly thought trans people jumped from dating/having sex with one gender to another with no problems (or very little).  Also, I feel like the question itself makes as much sense (if you don't know the context and read the question syntactically.) as the famous question of 'Does Bruno is gay?' https://youtu.be/2Uy4jBAc6NQ"
"The term trap was adopted by the shit-posters not invented by them. It came from a group of gay men who would cross-dress and try to pick up straight men as a statement on the abitrarity of trans-phobia. Which I would argue makes traps literally gay.

"It's shocking that the best media dialogue I've seen on exactly this topic came from Louis CK's Horace & Pete. There, Horace (Louie) has sex with a black woman, and in the morning she jokes about having been a man. Or is she joking? It's actually never made clear, and Horace ends up really confused, and it's portrayed as if that confusion is fine. But the episode ends with him wanting to see her again, and in the next episode he is with her. Horace & Pete is a great series that deals with plenty of modern conversations - politics, mental health, racial relations. Don't let Louis CK's creepy behavior stop you from watching it. It is essential viewing."

"i think the entire reason 'are tr*ps gay' is a question in the first place is because cis het men society is fundamentally so gut-wrenchingly terrified of being perceived as anything but a beer-guzzling hairy-chested straight, that they shriek at anything more out of the ordinary than cis penis in cis vagina sex. their concept of masculinity is so fragile a light tap would shatter it and it baffles me; i'm a trans man, i'd do a lot just to experience having a cis penis and flat chest and they still don't think that's enough  honestly though its kind of messed up. there are so many weird societal rules to make cis people feel insecure about their gender presentation and the fact that it's still such an astronomically worshiped ruleset in *2019* despite how horrible it makes people feel and how much money it wastes is a tragedy"
"The pope does like vaginas."
"If a man is attracted to a fully transitioned trans, I would say he's hetero. If a man is attracted to a post op, or a hermaphrodite for that matter, and knows they have a shlong, and really wants the T & the D there may be a little bit of bi in them (b/c the p3n!s is a male part even if the person who has it is all 100% woman and if he was all gay he wouldn't be into breast), and what's wrong w/ that? Nothing. Furthermore there is the kinsey scale that says that many ppl are somewhat bi, and I believe many are bi or more bi than that'd like to admit (but if a guy goes for a fully transitioned trans woman that's 100% hetero). Regardless of labels of what category the sexuality fits into, one should nvr be ashamed of who they are attracted to or who they love, and this homophobic belief in society that being gay or bi makes one less masculine as a man is dangerous when men explode in toxic masculinity b/c of their internalized homophobia and fear of what they deem in themselves as femininity, which becomes psycho transphobia when they turn on the poor trans woman. I wish we could somehow dispose of that so trans women wouldn't fall victim to insecure pos men. I don't buy into that sexuality as a social construct but, u can experiment around and not be gay, hetero, bi, ect., and many ppl have a little bit of bi in them to some degree. U can identify w/ anything but if u like the same sex ur gay, if u like the opposite ur hetero, and if u like both ur bi. The flaw is being ashamed of one's sexuality, or thinking it makes u less of a man or woman b/c of it. Whatever one likes, provided it hurts no one, one should embrace and celebrate those things. Love and lust is beautiful wherever u find it (provided that it's 2 consenting adults or however many if it's an orgy LOL)."

"I don't know what I feel after seeing this video. It's not necessarily cowardice to shirk away from an aspect of one's own sexuality - it's heavily dependent on the circumstances. Like you say, dating a trans woman invites heavy stigma into the man's life. And why take on that stigma without some deeply compelling factor like love (which already requires deep commitment) or some intense lingering interpersonal attraction? The stigma surrounding trans women isn't necessarily confined to men either, so to ask men to be radically individual feels pretty inadequate as a solution to creating a healthy dating world for trans women. Why would women be okay with more competition?  I'm a big fan of Jung and the Shadow as a way of looking at people. This is why I think the 'dirty little secrets' treatment of trans women is actually a natural tactic. The Shadow of the men attracted to trans women wants what it wants and the ego, diplomat that it is, picks the least risky tactic for sating for the Shadow's demands: just fucking trans women. All the fun with none of the risk or upheaval of the ego.   I do agree that mainstream society puts too much emphasis on an ethics of purity though. Nobody should ever feel like they have to murder someone just so they can feel secure about their own sexuality."

"While I could choose any number of specific praises for this amazing video, I feel it's more appropriate to speak my mind simply.  You're making the world a better place, and I mean that sincerely.

You cant have your cake and eat it too. Quit raggin on whitey."
"Do you know Sacred Games on Netflix?"
"The only tiny facet I can disagree on is that sexual relations with a trans women isn't gay (or at least homosexual) sex. I think it is, but in the same way that chromosomes share a high correlations with gender but are entirely secondary to a person's self-determined gender identity, sexual acts are highly correlated but entirely second to self-determined sexual identity. However, that's small potatoes and more of a pointless pedantic categorization argument similar to tomatoes being a fruit or Die Hard being a Christmas movie.  I do think you hit the nail on the head about the deeper problem inherent to the discussion, it relies entirely on 'gay' being a negative modifier that makes it bad. Despite JK Rowling's best efforts, being gay is not like being a werewolf; you aren't bitten once on accident and then suddenly become a rampaging monster that's a threat to anyone nearby."

On a related note it reminds me of how I have difficulty knowing how to answer if my partner is gay. I am a trans man and I began transition about 2 years ago and he and I have been together for 4 years and known eachother very closely for 11 years.  He is a straight man but he is very supportive of me and still loves me as well as continuing to be attracted to me and not seeing that stop eleven with surgery. Sometimes its hard to assure him that he is a straight man when he gets shit from people for being with me. Its hard to give him an answer that is more than 'you are straight because you feel straight' and I guess help in answering this wpuld be helpful.  Great vid and looking forward to the next!"

"Another great video and more in depth than I was ever expecting on the topic honestly. I personally never associated the term 'trap' seriously with trans-anything people, as it specifically originally applied to female-looking male characters, which as you explained in the video, was basically just a dumb joke. I do know though that it does upset trans people - one of my closest friends who is trans especially. I don't know when the term began being applied to actual trans people, but whoever had that bright idea needs a sound smack on the head."

But most guys can't  and shitting on them for not bucking the whole world , a struggle you do have deal with but expect them to just volontarilly jump into straight away, well thats asking an awefull lot. Because I can assure you these days on the street a trans woman will get much more support than the cis white male who dates her. There are no hug boxes for us, not anywhere."
"Goddess, your makeup is always on point. Existence is resistance."
"Genuine question: Why is it that trans women of colour are so much more at risk of violence and murder than white trans women? Are the people who murder trans PoC also PoC and it's therefore the toxic idea of masculinity which is perpetuated in their culture that is to blame (white people and PoC have different cultures/influences, that's undeniable), or do ALL races murder trans PoC BECAUSE they are trans PoC (double minority)? I hope someone can try and answer this question without calling me bigoted. I genuinely just want an answer and to be educated :/"
"I would think the only sticking point with a man dating a trans woman is if he for some goddamn reason REALLY feels a has to breed directly.  Even then I would expect technology will pick up the slack at some point.   I'm a gay man and not attracted to trans women and I'm glad I completely missed this Trap/Gay meme as it's just horrible.

"In my home culture of 4chan, I have literally never seen the word 'trap' used to mean 'transgender'. Over there, 'trap' exclusively refers to cis males crossdressing as women; and more particularly a more specific aesthetic version of that.  I appreciate your concern over the use of the word 'trap', but you're using a definition of the word based on a tiny minority of edgy internet personalities rather than the actual originating culture of the word. The whole first half of the video is predicated on a still erroneous definition of 'trap'. In my opinion, the use of the word 'trap' as a pejorative for transgender women should be called ignorance, not slurring. Even as per descriptivism, I'm pretty sure the core (non-/pol/) 4chan culture (and its related subreddits etc.) is still the majority of use of the word 'trap', and thus de facto defines that word. In fact, it's where pretty much all the useful use of that word happens; outsider ignorant use of the word is mostly political and *about* the word.  (by the way, the same argument applies to usage of the word 'futanari', especially if you include the fact that there's a whole country where it means something very different from 'transgender woman')   In fact, to some extent I could argue that this video helps is spreading an alternative and more problematic definition of the word 'trap' than the current definition, something both culturally appropriative and misinformative."
"I disagree with your assertion that most people who continue to use the meme are doing it out of a sense of superiority (of course some do). I think people, in general, will psychologically go against what they are told to do.  As far as trans women being women should be a more nuanced topic, particularly what it means outside the bedroom. But I understand the primary subject of this video was about sex and not family.  I also find it odd that you mock men for being insecure about their masculine & straight identity when a very large part of the LGBT movement is all about accepting that identity. To label wanting to be straight as inherently homophobic comes across as disingenuous. I'm pretty sure no gay person would not be offended if you told them 'being straight is good actually.'  Struggling to have a stable identity is a very human experience, whether that is political, sexual, career,  etc. Being initiated into adulthood is a powerful and positive force when applied correctly. I think it is a disservice to the human race to take that away from straight men specifically. We will have a generation of men who are boys.  Another great video overall. Always applaud your willingness to engage the conversation at a deep level."
"I like the Astorfo pic you put up behind you"
"I think there are plenty of men who are attracted to femininity, regardless of biological sex, and can't reconcile this feeling with the expectations of masculine culture. Still, others fetishize the idea of a transsexual or transvestite, which is also problematic. I think both of these reactions are due to seeing trans women as purely sexual beings. And why not? Men tend to view women, trans or otherwise, as sexual objects. I'd like to believe that this way of viewing women is typical of adolescence and changes as we grow, form meaningful relationships (sexual or not) with women, and begin to see them less as targets of sexual desire and more as just people. However, that isn't what the evidence seems to suggest. I made myself sad."
"best video yet. thank you ms. points."
"The term trap is generally used 'false advertising' where someone may assume the state of a feminine persons genitals and those not being the case.  I highly doubt that any post op transgender people are seen as 'traps' because at it's core they aren't 'falsely advertising'.  At it's core sometimes guys don't like dicks even if the dick is on a girl.  Just like a straight girl may not be ok licking a trans boys vagina because they physically are not into vaginas."

"Just gotta say, Count Dankula was literally convicted for teaching his dog to seig heil, so I think bringing that up is kinda dumb. He does genuinely seem like a dick at times, but including him as a 'hate crime convict', while technically true, is misleading, given the actual material of his hate crime was a pug raising its paw"
"Since one of my best friends, a trans woman, was subjected to a lot of shitty behavior and being called a trap throughout high school, I can't help but find the term incredibly rude and distasteful. I don't find jokes about it too funny coming from cis folk. My buddy, she was really shaken up by those experiences and it makes me so sad and angry to hear about it. I hope people will come to understand how hurtful it can be to describe someone's gender as some kind of malicious trick... it's disgusting."
"You know...I first saw you when I stumbled across the Incels video. Didn't know you were trans right away. Just saw a pretty woman with a kind of husky voice. But when I did find out, I only allowed myself to think of you in that way. Superficially, I suppose.  This video kind of made me admit to myself that I am just attracted to you. It's not weird, I'm not ashamed. I think I'm still pretty much only interested in cis women, but...I don't even know, really. It's complicated, I'm sure you understand. But before, I think my feelings were similar to 'She's beautiful, for a trans woman'. Sounds worse that way, but it's how I sort of hid from the fact that I like you. Anyway, I'm just one random straight dude on the Internet and it doesn't matter. Just wanted to tell you that I like your videos not just for being funny and smart, but for helping people become better. And you look great."
"I'd like to flip the narrative just a bit, because as a trans man I find the same 'is this gay' with woman. I identify as a straight man. I like woman and I am attracted to the lady genital presentation. But Cis Woman worry about 'is this gay' because they are with 'a woman'. And I don't want surgery for my genitalia because like you I don't have that much dsyphoria about it's physical presentation, merely it's biological function. I am not into woman who are not going to take me as a man. As you put I like to conquer. And I want a partner who sees me and views me as that conquerer in the bedroom. It's the same narrative as a trans man, especially ones more androgynous presenting as I am."

"Dudes who are always worried about being gay are just trapping themselves into an emotionally small and immature world. If they want to lead fulfilling lives, they'd best get past their insecurity and aggression."
"I didn't appreciate the terms different definitions being confronted but quickly glossed over.  Just because a word can be used in a derogatory, demeaning, and 'slurry' way doesn't mean it is always used as such.  Honestly the very definition of it is all over the place depending on who you ask, even the subreddit to looked at to define the word included transgenders, but also had literally anyone with a penis who looks feminine, drag queens, futanari, you name it.  Honing in on transgender issues doesn't do it proper service in my view, I understand that it is important to you and you would like to focus in on that part because with that part the word can do the most harm, but the word is not always used in aggressive, derogatory, slurry ways and shouldn't just be treated as a slur because one of it's possible definitions can be used to bring people down."

"23:30 Idunno, I think vaginas as they are are pretty sexy. I mean, look at what one of the most popular sex toys is, the fleshlight, cisguys love that shit. I've seen trans-women who look sexy to me, but the penis is somewhat of a turnoff. I would have sex with a trans woman though, provided that she were post op. But you hit the nail on the head, the overall sexual attraction of hetero and homo is the overall femininity and masculinity of the person, and that picture of the masculine man with a vagina beside the picture of a feminine woman with a penis always throws the cismen into a frenzy in threads"
"If I say no homo and sucking dick, is that gay?"
"YEEEESSSS!"
"Do you think it's prejudiced to ask that a trans person, when they are considering taking on a cis person on as a sexual partner, first disclose the state of their genitals? I would think taking such action could prevent a potential negative reaction that might occur if they were to find out the truth during the first sexual encounter. Especially if you want a relationship based on trust and affection. Even if the sex is casual, wouldn't it be a better investment of energy and time to quickly establish that parameter before continuing? Wouldn't that weed out undesirable people for you? Even if you want people to see you as one gender, that might not mean they won't assume you come equipped with the body expected of that gender. If they assume your gender, they might assume your sex. What do you think?"
"Finally an answer to the question on the mind of many since the dawn of time."
"So the entire point of the joke is that it's a complicated and utterly irrelevant, yet introspective question. It's effectively a Buddhist koan that emerged within and thus took on the language of shitposting meme culture. What is the sound of one hand clapping? If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a noise? Are traps gay? It's a question that doesn't really have an answer, but instead asks questions of the person contemplating the riddle."
"My favorite uppity tranny. <3"
"That was quite a view, but for a topic like this, I think this was the best way you could have tackled this, risky title aside. Hell, even that's a risk worth taking. I was weary of the titular term for quite some time, even used strictly as a meme,"
"but if it can reach the people who need to hear it this way, then I think it will pay off. As a cis-man myself, I may not carry a lot of weight in this conversation (nor should I), but I think this video could provide a lot of much needed perspective, and lord knows some of these chuckleheads need it.  On a personal tangent, segments 8 and 9 have a lot of very healthy advice that people need to hear more of, and I thank you for sharing it, even if it's not the heart of the conversation. If more people were comfortable with their sexuality, people would probably suck just a little less. Plus, sexual or not, being honest about your attractions just feels good. Hell, even if I discovered them through that godawful meme, being honest about liking Astolfo (the cutie in the picture in the background, for unaware readers), regardless of their presentation, intent, or physiology, was by itself been a very liberating experience, once I moved past the meme. Apologies for the tangent, but if that's what I could get from just a small cut of the video, then I get the feeling it has a lot to offer almost anyone who will give it the time of day.  tl:dr version- Great video, hope it becomes big in all the right ways."

"It never occured to me that violence against trans women would have a race factor other than possibly black on black.  I am fairly good at spotting trans women. I was totally fooled by a lovely trans female in Thailand. Reflecting back I should have noticed the exaggerated female behavior, not over the top, but present. Even her breasts looked and felt natural. I assume they were hormone induced. It wasn't until removal of the remainder of clothing that she stopped and expressed concern that I was not aware and was afraid I might get violent.   Being violent never crossed my mind. We did not continue with sexual activity. I complemented her on her looks and ability to fool me. Now, years later, in the same situation would I have continued with sex? I'm not sure, maybe. I have had years to reflect on it. I was a bit shocked and uncomfortable at the time."
"Thank you Contra, I've asked myself this quite a lot recently as a guy. So it's a weird coincidence to see you release a video on the topic in the same time period.  Edit 1: Weirdly, I've also sort of tried exploring the idea of what it would be like to live as a transwoman. And I know it's an almost insulting comparison but I'm currently roleplaying a transwoman in my Dungeons&Dragons campaign and she's easily my most favourite character to play so far.   It has also been an interesting experience to play this character alongside my friends. Some of whom do indeed still stigmatise her and make consistent 'are traps gay' jokes. And before now I've never quite had a rebuttal to the use of that term as until now 'trap' has always been the non-serious internet joke I know I've used myself in the past. So thank you once again for your insight into this topic.  Edit 2: Love you xx"

On the issue of are TRAPS‚Äôs gay I don‚Äôt think I even get the point of the question. However on the issue of is a Trans person posing as an actual member of the sex (not gender) that they are not in is a big problem."
""
"Now up front some guys (and it is mostly guys) are giant assholes that‚Äôs granted right at the offset. I hope you readers will grant me your ear without assuming that about me. The point I will attempt to make is that though it is perfectly OK to be trans at any stage of transitioning it is not OK to willingly deceive a partner that you are just simply the other sex and why that can end very badly if you do."

"As you must know many men are homophobic, it‚Äôs not like that is a news flash for anyone. Men are raised in an environment which views masculinity as a treasure we must hang onto dearly and sacrifice much to keep. I‚Äôm not saying that is right just that is how it is pretty much all across the globe with a few rare exceptions so it‚Äôs the world we live in as a guy."
""
"Now if a straight guy meets a girl who seems in every way to be a girl and at no point before getting very intimate lets him know she was born a man there is a lot of deception there. And I know this part will offend but please try to see the other side just for a moment. He thought you were sexed female at birth which means this could be a relationship which will bear children, this will not be a relationship most of society will brand me gay for engaging in etc. Those are assumptions which come with dating any person born a woman which do not usually come with dating a Trans person. Certainly not the child bearing part."
""
"This is actually a very big deal and very unfair to deceive someone about and expect them to be cool with it. So now my story and how it didn‚Äôt go badly but you can imagine how it could have. I was deploying to the Iraq war. We had 3 weeks left and were forbidden to go to Mexico or cross any borders. So naturally I did Tijuana was 2 hours away and I may not live through my next year. Your god damn right I‚Äôm going to go pay to get some."
"I had many amazing adventures in that place but what I want to focus on is one. A stripper asked me if I wanted to go to her place, she had a stunning smile and seemed sweet, I was a little worried about being robbed or something since she opted for her place but my gut told me ‚ÄúI think she kinda digs you‚Äù. So I went with it.  Fuck it I may die next month anyways live it up."
""
"So I go to her place with her and we start kissing and escalating. She was very passable so I still had no idea. And she asks if I would prefer anal. And well duh yeah. But at that moment I think wait aren‚Äôt there a lot of transvestites in Tijuana. But I thought does it matter if you find her hot what does it matter, so I go with it, and realize yup this is a transvestite. I also learn for the first time that‚Äôs not really a problem for me. However afterwards not only the initial deception which would incite violence from many soldiers she starts going on about I probably got her pregnant."
""
"Now firstly I was in your ass that‚Äôs not how pregnancy works and two you have testicles not ovaries you can‚Äôt get pregnant. I was pretty fucking furious that she would take the deception to this level, like really mad. What started as two people finding some comfort in a mostly cold world turned into a con game? She is fortunate that I am very disinterested in wraith, because in that moment, that deception was intense. And had I been even the least bit homophobic I probably would have lost my shit entirely."
""
"From what I hear this type of thing is not uncommon. And I understand the validation that comes from straight guys finding a Trans woman so passable it gets to that point. But put yourself in my shoes for a moment. Would you have kept your cool? I did, but I was honestly deeply offended that someone would commit to a lie so hard even after it was exposed. Now I realize she may have had a mental illness or something that made her believe she could get pregnant‚Ä¶even in the butt‚Ä¶despite being born male. But these sorts of encounters are not isolated to just me. And most men won‚Äôt be nearly as nice as I was when it happens."
""
"I don‚Äôt regret the time we shared, I am not mad about having sex with someone I thought was born a woman but was trans. I am mad about the deception. I realize how hard it must be, no I can‚Äôt even fully realize it to labor in this defines everything by poles world to be Trans gender. But no one is justified in deception, it is never OK to be a ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù You have to be honest with who you play with or you have no case."

"I liked most of your video except for the parts unrelated to trans people. I don't know how you can be aware of toxic masculinity, be against it, and simultaneously use phrases such as 'a real man would...'  Also, while being trans definitely comes with a lot of struggles, they're actually several times less likely to be murdered than cis individuals. There's an article on medium that discusses the murder rate using 2015 data, which was a particularly dangerous year for trans people, and the murder rate for trans people was lower than both the general population and cis women. And, as you said in your video, the murders that did occur were almost entirely done to minority trans women.  I did crunch the numbers on hate crimes though, and I found that trans people were more likely to be the victims of a hate crime (not counting murder) than gay/bi individuals. I know this isn't the sort of distinction you can make when you feel threatened, but for whatever reason, you're less likely to be murdered as a trans person than as a cis woman."

"'A Legendary Pokemon'"
"Loved the video, but I'm fearful of people misinterpreting things or the title. One second on twitter already had shown that some took offense to the usage of the term being used, despite the context being explained in the early moments of the video. I guess what I'm worried about is people claiming that you're a gender essentialist or 'truscum'. Course I didn't get that, but apparently some are quite outraged. Whether it's reasonable or not is up for debate, and it's not my place to say. I will say though that I can't compare you to people like Blaire White of Kalvin Garrah, both of whom have actually perpetuated harmful ideals, meanwhile you're working to educate, at least from my point of view. I think the most common critique I hear is that you often leave NB people out of the question, and that your definition of gender is supposedly dependent on visual presentation and perception. What I'm conflicted about this thought is that... You never really denounced NB people, and a lot of the emphasis on perception is important to trans people who are not gender non-conforming. Obviously the context here refers to trans people who aren't necessarily NB, and albeit, I understand the worry of not mentioning those things, I feel that NB people being marginalized, Trans or not, is an even more complex issue because perception of gender goes out of the question. That comes down to the rejection of constructs that aren't 'typical', and anything that's not considered 'traditionally feminine, or traditionally masculine.' You're obviously referring to what the collective perception of what womanhood is, and how transwomen appeal to that perception in order to come off as how they want to come off as: The typical, normalized view of what feminine is often described as because to themselves, it's what brings personal relief, and also being able to pass as how they want to in social spaces. I think the most probable reason for this complaint is maybe the disregard for pre-op transwomen too who don't pass strongly? I'm confused as to why so many people take you talking about transpeople wanting to pass, as you denouncing NB people? Or being 'truscum.' (you've never mentioned anything about dysphoria being a determining factor of transness, and it being a requirement so hhhhhh) I don't see you trying to de-legitimize gender non-conforming individuals, trans or not, but I guess the discussion based around gender conforming trans-individuals exclusively means advocacy for denouncing NB individuals. Idk, I didn't get that from this. (I do know according to some NB and Transpeople, a lot of their anger sort of derives from The Aesthetic and their initial frustration with that video.) Dunno if you'll see this comment, but I'm truly curious as to what your view on that is because some NB and trans people are claiming you have 'truscum beliefs' which... I don't believe. I think another aspect of the arguments against you is that you're appealing to a 'cisnormative view of gender expression' which, I dunno what to think about that. I guess I can see the issue with appealing to a stringent view of gender expression that is defined by stereotypes and things that perpetuate hurtful attitudes towards women, but at the same time, I don't see what's wrong with presenting however you want, whether it be conforming, or non-conforming, and I don't get why some people think one being conforming means that everyone else has to be conforming. I can understand not wanting the existing norms to exist so those who are non-conforming can have the potential to be themselves without scrutiny (which admittedly, is an issue even among trans circles, with transpeople unjustly calling NB people 'transtrenders'), but you aren't actively trying to take someone's identity away from them. You aren't policing other transpeople and NB people and redacting their pronouns, identity, etc. I also don't think being one or the other takes away from one another? Not sure what to think about a lot of this, really. I hope you might be able to give some clarity if you happen to stumble upon this long af comment, Contra."

I imagined a adult video in which two men standing as a woman is on her knees blowing their flutes. The men are smiling at the pleasurable stimulus, they look down to see the woman swirling their poles around each other, rubbing the heads together. In got confirmation that it funny when, to my surprise, I saw it in a video. I laughed hard. I still laugh at the recalling.  I don't laugh as much at that as I do the movie that I carefully edited to not reveal that the main character was a pre-op M to F then loaned it  to several CIS Het shipmates who enjoyed it, never caught on, and surely masturbated to it.  I do not think they would appreciate being informed of the truth about what they were fapping to. If any of them figured it out they never let on."

"ONE CRITIQUE, IF I MAY....saying 'you like what you like' but then calling all guys who like ladydick because they HAVE dicks 'Chasers' is a biiiiiiiiit unfair. There are guys out there who want relationships with girls who have dicks, not just the one night stand or side-chick interactions - to me, that is a definition of a chaser. Someone who wants a relationship with a transgirl who has and will keep her dick is still a valid preference. As such, I'd like to suggest there is a FOURTH GROUP. Also I don't buy the fetishising argument - it has merit, for sure, but no one ever says men fetishize vaginas - and yet, a lot of them have the same allure to vagina as some I do to penises. I hope you see this, Queen."
"So I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of anime, but all of the anime characters I've seen labelled as traps identified as men, and most were not actually trying to appear as women. That touches on a whole conversation that Contra got into a little bit about how femininity is viewed by men (basically, it's supposed to be your fault if I'm attracted to you), but I just wanted to know if anyone had any counterexamples. How have you all seen anime portray actual transwomen? I'm guessing it's not super respectfully."
"Thank you so much for sharing your experience, especially the more personal bits, 'cause I learned some really cool and important stuff! Sometimes it's hard for me, a Basic Bitch Cis Woman (TM), to put myself in the shoes of a transperson since it's so alien to my experience with my own gender, but you always speak in a way that makes it so easy to understand and relate to you, while also being hilarious. You're fucking awesome, girl <3"

I'm a huge fan of your work and speaking as someone who at the ages of 18-21 (I am 26 now and thankfully pulled myself out of that quagmire) who fell down the ''Anti-sjw rabbit hole'' as Three Arrows put it would have fallen in with the Shapiro crowd would have loved a youtuber like yourself back when I started to fall down that hole.

And though I'm still attracted to him to some extent (though not so much anymore), I can't and won't be attracted to his genitalia, the penis is a large part of what I'd like in my sex life, I'm disgusted by vaginas and also it would make me so dysphoric to go out with someone who's also trans so lmao People should be with whoever they want and wish to be. :)"
"If you showed specifically this video to enough non-redpilled fairly empathetic straight cis-men, bars and a lot of other public spaces might actually become safe places for trans-folk.

'The babe by its mother         Lies bathed in joy; Glide its hours uncounted,--         The sun is its toy; Shines the peace of all being,         Without cloud, in its eyes; And the sum of the world         In soft miniature lies.

Damn right, nothing more manly than proclaiming your love of girl dick from the roof tops!(if thats what your into;)  That being said, body parts are just not negotiable for some people. I have been attracted to men in my life, but I just couldn't get past the dick, no matter how hard I tried. And thats OK to, sex and attraction are weird messy things.  And after seeing my daughter born, yes, I do view vagina's as sacred passages, and I do think we need to hold a special place in our culture for the literal source of all human life, call me crazy."

"I'm trans. I typically refer to myself as a trap because today people associate 'trans' with 'evil SJW Tumblrinas' and other fun bogeymen. Meanwhile Trap is just a meme. I for one don't find it anymore offensive than women calling each other bitch, gay men calling themselves fags, or any other culture with offensive slurs that have been re-appropriated to make it their own. Maybe there is some kind of vaguely defined offense to be taken with the word Trap, but it's not as if I can't take the word and make it mine.  On a lighter note. I've honestly struggled so much with accepting myself as a woman. Contrapoints you've helped me so much with that, explaining things from every angle possible to make the best possible argument for us. I really respect that. Thank you."

"Traps aren't gay, but is OP always a f**?"
"I can't quite get my head around the 'feminine penis' thing.  Pun intended.  I think the reason is that you're essentializing your own experiences.  There's a lot of trans dicks out there, and they don't all follow your rules.  I've encountered transwomen who would probably be offended by you even arguing for such rules.  So trying to draw an essential distinction between feminine and masculine penis, I think that's your weakest argument here.  Everything else was compelling with one caveat.  That being, of course, that there's a pretty big difference between how the term 'trap' is used by general internet shitposters, and how it's used by otaku.  Otaku don't generally categorize transwomen as traps, traps, to them, are a category of anime characters (and a few sparse real life examples) that are more like drag queens or sissy fetishists.  They don't see themselves as women, and they don't want to transition.  Deliberately tricking other characters and making them uncomfortable about their own sexuality on purpose is often a part of their personality and/or a sexual fetish for them.  Anime was a mistake.  But they still need the word to talk about a type of anime character, and in that context I don't think it's fair to treat it as a slur, or as being about transwomen."
"there's no way little ben shapiro would survive watching this video."
"Fuck it, I'm absolutely certain this will get buried but WHATEVER - as a trans-attracted guy who knew what he liked since he was 15, this video is EVERYTHING.

Seriously Natalie, you just...you're amazing. I feel like you just answered the question of my existence. LONG LIVE CONTRAPOINTS!"

"great stuff, and sure to be a hit. it's a bit long, but I appreciate that you used the opportunity to have the 'are traps gay' crowd watching you to talk about penis tucking and the like. xD"
"5:12 Nice bit of dishonesty there. Count Dankula was targeted by Scotland's overreaching hate speech laws that disregarded context. He was mocking Nazis, not endorsing them. His jokes were in poor taste but they were still jokes.   Using 'convict' like it has any bearing on someone's character is, again, dishonest. It's interesting that people will derive their moral high ground from the justice system when and as it suits them."
"Another amazing video!"
"I am a woman, and I am a bi who can find trans women sexually attractive. So in my case, if I'm dating a trans woman, it is indeed gay.  Obviously I'm cis, so it's not like I can say this from the perspective of someone who is *not* cis, but I don't see the concept of 'trap' bad in itself. Often, cross-dressing characters in anime are not trans, and do not want to live as the opposite gender, but have some other goal in mind.  Example: Haruhi Fujioka is a trap, and pretends to be a straight cis guy to pay off dept.  I think 'trap' is insulting in regards to actual trans people, those who need to live as how they feel.  Someone like Haruhi Fujioka? Definitive 'trap.' She purposely deceives people to pay off debt, for comedic value.  Robin Williams as Mrs Doubtfire? 'Trap.'  Trans people are not that. Robin Williams dressed as a woman temporarily to achieve some other goal? 'Trap.'"

"I'd consider myself enby and I still learned a lot from this video. Going from being raised in homophobic culture and then getting lost in the anti-sjw movement it's been a difficult journey of accepting myself and being a little less of a casually polite liberal about things because before the transition I had just about every privilege and I still struggle to not let myself get bad takes over my whiteness. Anyways thank you for helping me see a different side of things and I definitely found some interesting material in this video."
"AGP legend"
"I mean, for the most part, I think the distinctions made in this video are irrelevant. If you're attracted to someone and you know what you find pleasurable, does it matter whether it can be classified as straight or gay? I think everyone is on a spectrum; we're not all going to have the same preferences and boundaries. It's fine if people want to describe their sexual orientations with the best clarity, but the only reason that it seems important is to correct a kind of cognitive dissonance people feel with the ways they identify and what they're attracted to. Is it straight or gay? If it's one instead of the other, does that mean you like it any less? Does it make you identify differently as a result? What is the actual difference?"

"Lenora, you need a better cigar. Look at my (admittedly less than impressive) profile pic. That bitter little lancero is insufficient for the Queen of Digital Decadence. When it comes to cigars, size DOES matter. Girth, specifically, since it allows blending of more complex flavors, and larger cigars provide cooler smoke and better draw. It probably wouldn't be smart for you to provide an address where people can send you stuff, I shudder to think what some folks might send. So I'm heading over to Patreon to send a lifestyle intervention sufficient to provide you with a proper smoke. I recommend a Churchill, at a minimum. The Brickhouse Mighty Mighty Maduro is a great stick, at the price of a good cocktail. My wife watches your vids, too, and she recommends a Man-O-War Ruination. With either of these, dark rum is a compatible tipple.  I know how important mouthfeel is to you. You work hard at these videos. You deserve it."
"You really make me think and that‚Äôs hot. Thank you.  (and you‚Äôre hot and that really makes me think ... so thanks again)"
"So I think you kind of nailed it in a video a little ways back; being passable is a huge factor in whether an individual is accepted as a woman. If you look like a woman, odds are I am attracted to you on some basic level. But then we run into the issue of men's ideas of femininity determining what it means to be a woman, which is a legitimate problem. You look like a woman; therefore I consider you a woman. Katelyn Jenner however looks unfortunately like a man in a dress, and therefore I consider him a man. This is a problematic worldview; but it's my instinct."

If a person is UNABLE to make this choice (to NOT be offended by WORDS), perhaps the right therapies would help them make this possible (as it should be possible (and desirable) in ANY and ALL mentally healthy humans.  Free speech is a fundamental pillar of western civilization and prerequisite to a healthy society.  Any 'harm' caused by words pales in comparison to the real harm done to society by any restriction on FREE SPEECH."

"Honestly watching this channel grow has been one of the most rewarding interesting things. The building up of the world and characters, how references in the past will be brought back and expanded on so it makes watching older videos more rewarding, the editing costuming and lighting.

I‚Äôm a bi man, and have always struggled with my sexuality because of social stigma and, I really don‚Äôt want to admit it, but, suppressed and internalized homophobia, and this video really spoke to me.  I need to stop caring about what gender people are, and just go off how attracted to them I am. Thanks for making this!"
"bitch u spelled VICTROY wrong"
"Wonderful video. I thought I was going to make a comment about 'Men having sex with traps are a little gay and it's fine' but you cleared that point up too. It reinforces a stigma to dating trans women.  Because I, a cis straight man, don't personally see being gay as a bad thing, I thought that saying 'well it's a little gay' was harmless. In a perfect tolerable world it would be. But I'm really saying, 'don't let people know your dating a trans woman because they may freak out and look at you weird even though I don't care.' So I'm still telling them to be a little afraid of some backlash.... is that a bad thing that I'm being honest?... even if my intentions were good I'm just reinforcing a stigma which is bad.   But I love the whole video. But FYI, I know a lot of cis women and TERFs who would clown a man for being even a little gay. It's hard to date as a straight guy for a lot of guys. It's even harder to date as straight guy who admits to some sexual experimentation. And if your black on top of that, look out because a lot of women will look at you some monster   Also FYI, I legit think vaginas are beautiful."
"Why would i give a fuck about the social validation by another guy of my sexuality - as long as i dont want to fuck him that is, his opinions and sexuality are really of not consequence to me at all."

"#notall lesbians are TERFs... in fact some TERFs are straight and just choose celibacy because they hate men so much, not so different from MGTOWs. A lot of bi women and lesbians hate TERFs and wouldn't mind dating transwomen. I feel like TERFs are emphasized by conservatives who want there to be division and strife between different liberal groups... There are not that many of them, they're not that important, and not many people take their views seriously. They're mostly a dying breed of sad second-wave-feminist, gender essentialist cat ladies."

"LOVED IT!  The only question I have is with the concept of 'chasers'.  Why is a guy a 'chaser' if accepts his attraction to trans women and enjoys or even desires all that she has to offer?  Why can't he be someone who is simply completely open to all aspects of his and her sexuality?  I used to moderate a Yahoo group of men attracted to trans women and many had the same conflicting feelings and thoughts expressed by the homophobes mentioned in your video.  Others were fine with whatever the woman came with,  while others like being penetrated by a trans woman.   Now this distinction was made clear to me in discussions with several of the members.   They were clear that they did not seek or want sex with men.  Pegging by a woman wasn't the same because the woman cannot actually feel what she's doing.  The liked sharing sex with trans women because it was authentic and felt right to them.  It was the only way they felt comfortable being topped.  Don't get me wrong,  there were 'true chasers' in the group.  To me, this is the group of men who wanted to share sex with a trans woman but would never date one publically and only saw them as 'useful for sex' (much like many men who like sex with heavier women or across racial lines but shun actual public relationships).  These men are partly concerned about what others think and are partly affected by their warped sense of entitlement. I haven't seen if you've done it yet but I would love to see this topic explored a bit more. Thanks again for such a great production.  I will be referencing it for my human sexuality class."

"Of those groups mentioned around 26:00, I think I'm somewhere between group 1 and group 2. I've never been with a trans-woman, but if I found them attractive as a woman, the dick would possibly not be as much of an issue as it would be normally. I'd have to find myself in that situation to know for sure. Not that there are no trans-women I find attractive (see the owner of this channel). I just have never been with a trans-woman."

"I loved the 'well I guess I'm just more of a man than you are'. I imagined the supa-hot-fire 'ohhhhhhhhh' level mic drop because it's true! Men love to feign toughness but when the chips are down they reveal that they are huge babies. And that's okay but don't talk the talk when the walk isn't there and won't ever be there.   I have an early transition trans female friend who still refers to herself as 'trap' and thinks to herself 'are these guys gay?' when she gets positive attention from guys and it's heartbreaking. I hope I can break her out of that sooner than later.   Also: as a fun aside, she revealed she was interested in me (a poet) but unfortunately is still dating a girl atm who's not the most open minded when it comes to the whole trans thing and still sees her as a man as far as I can tell. So hopefully when they eventually break up, I can put my mouth where my mouth is and show her ,to.use a cliche, 'how God intended for a man to make love to a trans woman'. üòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé  Wish me/us luck, folks"
"And here I thought the 'Traps are gay' meme referred to SJWs cruelly baiting people into saying something which _could_ be portrayed as bigoted, as a means of destroying the person's reputation. Ie. It is a judgement of the tactic, as it were, with the assumption that SJWs believe it to be a legitimate manner of finding bigots, and anti-SJWs finding the tactic of creating a virtue trap of sorts 'gay'."

"towards the end of this video when you were talking about straight men who date trans women having to shoulder some of the queer experience, i was reminded show the murder of barry winchell, and how in the years following his death, all the legislation and debate surrounding his murder as a hate crime was based on the assumption that he was gay for having dated calpernia addams. truthfully, will never know winchell's mentality or sexuality, and it's in a lot of ways irrelevant to the fact that no, a man dating a trans woman isn't gay. like you said it's the toxic transphobic and homophobic mentalities (and those who hold them) that lead to these murders, especially the murders of trans women of color, that are the real culprits here.  i really appreciate of your confidence and determination to shed light on these really harmful issues. i'm a cis bisexual woman, and lately i've been thinking a lot about what my gender means to me and how we all navigate such a strict binarist society. it's led to me questioning my own gender at points. a big part of the problem with gender stereotypes and the gender binary is mainstream media wanting to push a narrative  that all trans women 'knew they were women' because they liked playing with barbies and wearing dresses. not only does this stigmatize trans women and force them to present in hyper-feminine feminine ways in order to be taken seriously but it also reinforces the gender binary as it pertains to cis women. the implication there is that if you're not presenting and/or feeling hyper-feminine at all times you're not a 'real woman.' and no woman, cis, trans, or nb, looks or feels completely 100% uber-feminine at all times. though i'll never come close to knowing what it's like to be trans, i do know what it like to feel 'not woman enough', or like a 'fake woman' (i'm visibly physically disabled), and having to navigate queer spaces in a way that constantly tells you your orientation is 'fake' and 'slutty'  (@ radfems, biphobes and terfs, fuck off). i think it's imperative that we as queer people stand at the front lines in terms of amplifying the voices of our trans siblings, and i *thank you, natalie* , for continuing to help educate us all on things that are in no way easy to talk about."
"One thing I can't help but think about when the topic of offense at the term is brought up is how absolute the claim is that the offense is definitely being had, that 'of course any who are associated with a term like 'trap' are offended by it.' Even you kind of take that tone, but it isn't hard to find trans people using that term to describe themselves with a level of pride or joy.  r/traps is one big example that comes to mind yesimsubbeddontjudgeme  I don't bring it up as an excuse to use that label for others whom I don't know for sure would like it, I guess I kind of treat it with the 'that's our word' rules. I just thought it an aspect of the topic that was lacking."

"I think the idea of staying in your lane creates the wrong visual metaphor. I liken it more to a venn diagram. Violence against trans women of color isn't something I'll ever be a victim of or can speak about with authority, but the source of much of the violence (male ideas of entitlement to feminity they find sexually desirable) is something that affects all women. So it's like sharing a ward with someone in the hospital - maybe you don't know the exact problems of the guy two beds over, but you DO know the problems of being in that specific ward together - from the shitty out of tune TV to the garbo food. So people who aren't having the exact same problem can still have valuable insights, as long as they aren't speaking FOR other people.  Also the idea of traps, imo, would in an ideal world be very separate from trans women. Speaking as someone who writes erotica and therefore pays attention to consumption trends in fetish work, the people who like the idea of being 'tricked' by a girlish boy and those who like 'true' trans women are not really the same groups. For the former, it's a sort of soft taboo. The opportunity to indulge in (sometimes spiteful or abusive) sex with a male, who gives you the excuse by luring you in with their 'fake' feminity. The latter, however, tend to crave not sex with a male - but /penetration/. Hence the related dickgirls/futanari. It's...I would guess (again, based on my observations) a way to avoid the perceived gayness of penetration by attaching the penis to a feminine woman. Naturally, this isn't gonna cover 100% of cases, but overall the people who like the 'trick' aspect in a sexual context are not gonna ALSO be the ones who are straight men who explicitly want a female presenting, female acting, female passing trans woman. Those men of the second group who don't have an interest in being penetrated don't even consume trans centric porn. It makes sense if you think about it - if the one thing you could want, as a straight man, from a preop trans woman isn't even your fetish, literally nothing sets apart your interest in trans women from non trans women. You...you just like women."

She's never called my ass pretty, and without oversharing I am pretty sure she thought I was attractive."

If the roles were reverse, a cis woman would absolutely NOT kill a transman. Why is the response always murder?  Men do shit like that, other men justify it, and then men as a whole are like ????? when other groups hate and fear them. No shit they do, I'd be afraid to if one person of a group known to kill people in my group started getting hostile with me for any reason."

"Fuck, guess I'm a chaser. Bleh, I'd heard the word before and tried to rationalize what I liked and how it didn't make me a chaser, but I don't  think it stands up anymore.   I don't know if it is possible for me to feel differently. I like cis ladies, I also like some cis dudes, but mostly I like dudes with 'female' genitals and ladies with 'male' genitals. I also like people who are explicitly non-binary. I don't know why but I find myself more attracted to individuals who don't match with 'traditional' gender norms. Maybe it's a paraphilia and I ought to try and decrease my use of fantasy or porn featuring non-op trans or gender nontraditional people, but I also feel like I should be free to like what I do without being shamed.   I don't know if I am poly or monogamous yet, but if I do wind up marrying just one person I would prefer that their genitals stayed the same, whoever it was, because I'd only marry to someone whose body had a combo of bits that turned me on, and satisfied me completely. Maybe it's stupid, but I worry changing things would run the risk of my attraction lowering, and the affection I feel towards my spouse dwindling.   Of course, at the end of the day, it is their body, their desicion, and their right. I don't have a say, which is as it should be, and will have either learn to accept their new bits or leave because I couldn't.   :/    I'm super confused, and could use some advice on how to not be shitty, so if anyone has any I would greatly appreciate it."

"I have to be honest, this video is amazing.  You put out unbelievable content, and it's so fucking good, it's clever, and you have the ability to see through bullshit and argue at such an amazing level that combines with your filming and visuals.  But, I do kind of want to make the following points:  1.) I don't know if it's such a good thing to frame some of the arguments you made here the way that you did.  Like I'm not sure that you arguing that men needing to basically toughen up and be better men to defend their partners is really ultimately wise.  Like sure, as a rhetorical bludgeon, it works for the point you're trying to make.  It's just that arguing against traditional genders role by confirming traditional gender roles isn't likely to have the intended effect.  I feel like woke people have his habit of just throwing 'you need to be a manly man' shit at men's feet with the hopes that any of this is somehow good or useful --'You know people who call others gay?  _They're_ secretly the one's who're gay.  So you definitely shouldn't be like that.'  I just don't think you ultimately gain anything by inflating energy into the very thing you want to let die.  2.) I want 2019 to be a better year for us Leftists, so in the interest of trying to make that reality, I've decided to start being more honest with SJW/woke people.  'But I do want to shame men for [doing X]'  This sentence should have been 'But I do want to shame men _who_ [are doing X].'  I'm sorry, but you can't be both pedantic about the terms that other people use (and condemn their use of words) _and_ sloppily stating that you want to shame _all_ men for behavior that only some of them do. This video is very, very far from thw worst offender, but I'm sorry this language just grates on my nerves.  After listening to reading woke hot take after woke hot take on my Facebook stream about how all men are fucking assholes, how all men are to blame for rape culture and sexual assaults, and all of the other cringey woke hot-takes...  Honestly, I've started to unironically laugh when I hear JBP attack SJW's, and that's deeply not good and I am pretty sure that is not the intended effect of the authors who refer to men/white people/etc in this manner.  Talking like this is alienating, so please stop."

"It feels a bit like this topic has been done to death. I toally get why transpeople would consider traps a slur. In fact my own gf (mtf) dislikes it. But she and I both understand and agree that context matters and not everyone who uses the word is a transphobe. Just my 2 cents."
"Not knowing there is a penis/attracted to the feminine aspects only = not gay Being attracted to dickgirls *because* there‚Äôs a penis = Probably bisexual  Edit: Changed ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù to ‚Äúdickgirl‚Äù  Also the fact that straight men think butt stuff is somehow gay even when a woman is doing it to them is pretty weird. *I think it‚Äôs actually because they‚Äôre afraid of taking on a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù role*  Edit 2: I think you have to be at least a 1.5 on the Kinsey scale to enjoy a feminine penis, as it‚Äôs an idea that cannot be boxed in as ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù but instead exists on the spectrum between. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a 1.5 on the Kinsey scale."
"Great video as always but kinda wished it focused on crossdressers(/guys that identify as guys but look like girls) rather than trans women. I understand that the 'trap' label is used as a slur for trans people but it's also a term for a lot of people and anime characters that's just synonymous with crossdresser. Most pics of characters used in the vid were that sort of person, including one of Hideyoshi Kinoshita - whom I steal my internet name from. I know the entire question is a shitpost anyways and you did briefly mention crossdressers in part 8 but I don't like that the term's meaning has been changed by transphobes and how most trans people just accepted it as a slur and declared it entirely bad. Maybe I've just been called 'trans but didn't know it/want to admit it' too many times to see their point of view though. Like I said, great video - but it was really about the question 'Are Trans Women Gay' and I think even some of the right-wing and/or closed-minded people that talked about the question acknowledged that it was about crossdressers and not trans."
"This is amazing and I love you"

"Trans women aren't women, obviously, but they aren't simply 'men' either, and I don't think a man being into trans women makes them gay. It's a particular niche attraction. It's all good but this whole 'trans women are women and men who are into them are exactly the same as straight men' is nonsense. Gender critical feminists' view on gender is definitely the most logical view."

A lot of the arguments for liking/being with transwomen and feminine dick just kinda falls flat for me. Sexuality is mad complicated and the Kenzie Scale doesn't even start to cover it."

"The murder of Gwen Araujo and Islan Nettles, as I learn more about them through newspapers and review articles, reminds me of a phenomenon I've noticed in my home country a long time ago. I would like to tag it as a 'degraded honor culture': while the highly codified and complex honor cultures that are based on group allegiance, faith credentials, status, vendetta based cultures, etc., degrade, the remaining elements of it become especially toxic and violent. Because of this, even a suspicion of being considered gay, a snitch, a traitor, or a mere (often only perceived) implication of being laughed at or considered inferior often trigger the most insanely violent responses. Considering that the honor based cultures in US Latino, Black, and Soviet crime-related communities alike had been decaying for decades for good, it keeps me wondering whether those minimal remainders can be eliminated at all."

"My answer is simple: if the free market knows traps aren't gay, then they're not gay.   Straight porn companies make trans women porn, gay porn companies do not. Why? Because they are marketing towards their demographics, the people who will buy it. Gay men dont like trans porn, and companies make monetary decisions based on that FACT. It's blatantly obvious from that perspective, imo, that traps are not gay. End of discussion.  But of course, that's not the end of the discussion.

"question: If a guy has a thing for being penetrated by his girl, like with a strap on (pegging) etc., and he is with a trans woman, would that be a sensitive ask? Like, let‚Äôs say she‚Äôs chosen to have the surgery (if it makes a difference to my question. I‚Äôm asking in some ignorance, here). If he then wanted to see about adding some occasional strap-on play to their sex life, could that be a touchy subject?  (On her end, I mean. It can be a touchy subject to bring up to some cis-women for a guy already).  Thanks.   PS If I said anything in any way upsetting or incorrect, I‚Äôd happily and humbly take correction.

"As a publicly sexually ambiguous and self identified bi sexual man the discussion about traps being gay has always been a hurtful one. I‚Äôve always had the opinion that if someone feels like a woman they‚Äôre a woman and if they feel like a man they‚Äôre a man. I‚Äôve had many a discussion with straight men who have posed the question are traps gay? And every time I‚Äôve had this discussion I came out of it changing the persons opinion or being called gay and ending the discussion. I feel it will be a long time before the term ‚Äútrap‚Äù will stop being used as a slur against trans women."
"I've been anticipating this video for what feels like weeks, and I must say that you've outdone yourself with this one. Well done Natalie, Encore!"

"My high school psych teacher spent a whole day teaching us about trans people one time and, although she never specifically said the word tr*p, she did mention that ‚Äúa man dating a trans woman is a homosexual‚Äù verbatim. She was trying to be helpful and I appreciated her trying to help people learn but it made me cringe so much. During the whole presentation there was a group of guys behind me who kept making transphobic jokes and generally causing a disturbance, the teacher never acknowledged this. The whole day just totally soured my mood and I got weirdly depressed afterwards.   I‚Äôm kind of tempted to send this video to her under some burner email, but I‚Äôm afraid that knowing she might suspect me will make it harder for me to face her. And I could wait until the end of the year to do it but I‚Äôve got ten other reasons to be anxious about it.   Anyhow, I hope that future generations are a lot less transphobic than those kids who were sitting behind me. People like Natalie help make people more conscious about these things and so I‚Äôm optimistic."

"If a woman with a penis has a feminine penis, then a man with breasts has masculine breasts.  (But how does a woman grow a penis? Not currently possible.)  Anyway, that means you can‚Äôt use your breasts as evidence of your femininity, since you were a man when you grew them, hence they are masculine breasts.

I'm not exactly educated on gender/sex theory, but I do know that it doesn't really matter if you're gay or not.

"I feel like we need to get to the point where we no longer feel the need to label everything.  If everyone just accepted that sexuality and gender are gradients on a spectrum and trying to label every single 'shade' of them is utterly futile, then we might actually be able to shed a lot of the insecurities and disparities between us.  Why does gender or biological sex even need to come into the picture when we talk about what we're attracted to?  90% of the time we're with our partners, we're not interacting on any level with their genitals.    So, it follows, that what we're really into is everything else.  And while some people might claim that femininity is attractive to them, what they REALLY mean is that they are attracted to traits which have been labeled as feminine, such as soft skin, a higher voice ect. ect.  But, even then, once a relationship has begun, it's not those outward superficial traits that make us fall in love with another person.  No one stays with someone whose personality is a total turn off, just because they have very nice skin.  What really makes people fall in love is that person's personality, their essence and spirit - for lack of a better term.  That's why there are many women and men who find themselves in relationships with people who are of the opposite or same sex unexpectedly, even though they have identified as gay or straight their whole lives.  (I'm leaving bisexuals and pansexuals out here for the sake of making the point.)  The fact is, we're all just looking for the person we want to spend the rest of our lives with (obviously that's a broad generalization, but again...making a point here.)  When we imagine that person, we might automatically assign a gender to them, but what we're really dreaming of are their non-physical traits...like a kind heart, good sense of humor, adventurous nature or what have you.    My thought is that if we could stop forcing a gendered narrative onto attraction, then people might stop feeling so constricted to find their 'true love' only in the gender group they feel is 'appropriate' for their sexuality.

"Wonderful! I love the very candid discussion of the very nitty gritty aspects of sex with trans women that most people shy away from. It's this lack of knowledge that fosters the bigotry. I'm a cis lesbian and I have experience with having sex with men and with trans women. The sex with men was so... unfulfilling and awful because I was a lesbian all along and didn't realize it until later. I never felt like less of a lesbian for having sex with trans women because it's just NOT AT ALL the same as sex with men! I'm not sure I can put it into plain words like Natalie does, but the idea of a feminine penis feeling and performing differently than a male penis is 100% true! I understand why Natalie didn't really go into the issue of TERF lesbians in this video, but it's another facet of this whole discussion that is also very contentious despite so much evidence pointing to the fact that lesbians like trans women!"
"PREACH!!!"

But the reality is that, as he says, ‚Äúhe loves me.‚Äù I really wish we could completely just erase the concept of ‚Äúorientation.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs more of an inhibitor to people‚Äôs freedom than a liberator. You like what you like.  It may also surprise many to hear that I‚Äôm actually a Christian as well.

"I was under the assumption that a ‚Äútrap‚Äù was a crossdressing male that wants to attract a man to fuck them. So this whole vid just kinda confused me because I wouldn‚Äôt have classified 90% of the people Contra was talking about as traps. Lmao great presentation tho even if you kinda looked down on a guy that was making fun of nazis, called attention to child grooming gangs and the garbage the UK and the EU. Dankula is a good dude at heart and is just uniformed."
"MOUTHFEEL is back"
"I'm totally blown away. This is the first time I've watched one of your videos where I wasn't pretty much on your side from the beginning. To be honest I am a straight man and I think I'm exactly the type of liberal you were addressing. I would never deny a Trans woman her woman hood and I would never use the word trap, but I've definitely always taken the position that I would never date a Trans woman and I've always thought that a trans woman should be upfront about the fact that they are trans if they become involved with a cis person. This video has me reevaluating my whole perspective and I couldn't be more thankful."
"Really great essay. The last time I interacted with this subject was when I heard about the dude that got kicked out of a gaming convention because he jokingly asked in a meme-ish manner 'Are traps gay?'. I was honestly pretty disgusted by the event manager's decision to kick him out, especially after reading his following tweets and such. It seemed pretty much like virtual signaling BS to me. I still think it was a bit of an overreaction, but this video definitely gave a lot more context to the 'trap question'. I'm usually far away from supporting PC culture and such, but I've been following this channel for some time, and I must say it is my favorite to-go one when I feel like challenging and/or broaden my perspectives on this sort of topics. Gotta love that mixture between artistic expression and well-constructed arguments. This one really did give more depth to my current perspectives, as well as broadening my understanding of sexuality. Even my own, as a straight cis dude. Great job Contra, keep 'em coming!"
"I thought traps refereed to men dressed as women convincingly, like some cosplay or something, not trans women themselves. That's why, for me, the discussion was more based on the presentation of sexuality vs. the execution."
"Saline?"
"Little off topic but here I go: Growing up around widespread homophobia, I buried any homosexual feelings I had. When I got to high school, I dated women, because it turned out I liked them too, and it was more acceptable. I didn't want to 'other-ize' myself at the time by being honest about having urges for men too. I am now out as a pansexual, but it took me over a decade to get to that point.   I think it's ok to admit we've played along with homophobic environments. We can't go forward without recognizing and admitting our past. It's a step towards making future situations better."
"'They're either grossed out by it or they're trying to climb inside' Quite possibly the most Freudian thing I've ever heard and I've had psychoanalysis introduced to me in just about 5 classes."
"I feel like this is the most genuine Natalie video yet, I love it."
"....Ok, great video, but what about the male crossdressers and cosplayers that also get grouped into/use the word to identify themselves?  Are we not gonna talk about that part?"
"11:12 ‚Äúbecause what you are doing when you call transwomen traps is you showing you think of ua the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us (..) trans women are justifiable ofended by the word trap‚Äù"
"You cannot conclude that because someone uses the word trap it means that he/she thinks the same way as a transphobic person does. I in one hand was introduce to the word trap by the anime comunnity as a meme, and I don‚Äôt tink you can argue that when these weeabos meme about traps they want to deliver the message that trans people are disgusting, as a transphobic person will do. Sure you can argue that some of them may do, but still you cannot conclude anything. And even if some of them do, when it is use as a meme I can argue the same way that most of them don¬¥t."
"But you may say to this that while it is true that there is some people that will say trap as a mere meme, most people don‚Äôt use it as a meme, and because of that the word trap is not a meme but a trasnsphobic slur."
"The question here comes to determine what makes a word to be a slur. Some people argue that is as put above, the common use of it. But I don‚Äôt agree with this. I don‚Äôt agree in saying that ‚Äúif it is most commonly use as a slur, it is a slur‚Äù. Or that the most common use of a word determinates its conotation or meaning, and you may agree with me in this one."
"A slur is a phrase wich main propouse is to denigrate someone or an attempt to offend someone. So, following the logic above, If I call one of my friends idiot ‚Äì word that is most commonly used as an attempt to offend - then I was without any doubt trying to offend him, but this is not correct because I can call my friend idiot without trying to offend him, without the intent to attack him, and here is the key word, ‚Äúintent‚Äù, ‚Äúintention‚Äù. The intention is what defines a word. While I can call my ‚Äúsuppose‚Äù friend an idiot with the most common intention behind that word ‚Äì offending, attacking- I also can call my friend idiot with any harm intention. The intention behind saying the word nigger for example may be to refer to an African American or dark skin color person, or to offend a person because you know that this word has history and you know he/she will get offended if you call him/her as that. It is all about the intentions. The question we have to ask is not ‚Äúis this word a slur?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúis this person calling me this because he is trying to denigrate me, to attack me, or he is just my hommie?"
"So the word trap is not intrinsicly a transphobic slur, actually any word is intrinsicly anything, we give meaning to words and that meaning depends on the intention. Thus transwomen don‚Äôt have justification to be offendend, unless of course if it is clear that there are harmfull intentions behind it."
"I knew she was going to do it at some point, boy am I glad to see this video finally here."
"Two dicks in the same hole? Gay or not?  I say not. Penis in the vagina cannot be gay. . .  Joking aside, I think there were some topics that you missed.  1) In my opinion this is the most obvious question: reproduction. Sure, there might be able to be some genesplicing and some 'men' have had fetuses  implanted into their abdomen, but I think that's a legitimate concern for anyone. Now, you might say that cis heterosexual couples can be sterile, and that's absolutely true . . . but--in my opinion--its kind of a deal breaker if a woman were to tell me she had her tubes tied. And honestly, even if it wasn't her choice it would still be a deal breaker. That might be harsh, but I don't think anyone should be shamed for not wanting to date transwomen on this basis. 2) You say quite a bit about it 'not being gay' to have oral sex with a woman with a penis. But what if a man doesn't want to do things with another penis. Yes, I know you mentioned the surgery, and that's a different case, but what if the trans person doesn't want to have the surgery? Like you go into, its not exactly a thing to take lightly and there are many legitimate reasons not to do it. I'm left unconvinced that wanting your partner to have desired genitalia should mean that men should be 'shamed.' 3) You mention it, but you kind of gloss over it, the fact that these identities are socially constructed (i.e. gay, masculine, feminine, ect). But I really don't think you've adequately addressed this in this video, or previous other videos. For example if you would have tried to explain the concept of 'gay' to Socrates, he would have been quite confused. He wouldn't have even understood the term bisexual. This is due to a lot of reasons and things he would probably say, but it does boil down to cultural attitudes toward sex (and cudos for bringing up Jonathan Haidt's ethical concept of moral purity). I think this is really the heart of the issue because the masks we all wear (as you put it in a previous video) are social constructions and aesthetics--things we play ('act') out. But the glaring fact does remain that there does seem to be some biological tendencies (even across cultures) to these masks. This is a complicated issue, and that's the reason why I think its wrong to shame men for dating anyone--just as its wrong to shame trans people for being trans.  At that comes down to the heart of the issue. Believe me when I say I totally get where you're coming from. Its really hard for me not to be incredibly brutish and pray that the people I don't like get 'what's coming to them' for the things that I don't like. But at the end of the day, that hasn't worked well for me, and its put me in a really bad place in life.  You don't know me, so you can't tell that I'm a pot calling the kettle black, but I really think that's something we should work on in our political discourse. I do think we should stop fighting fire with fire, and maybe its not even possible to stop that. But I know first hand that this reasoning isn't a path upward. I think we're tearing ourselves down.  But I do want to say, that even though I disagree with you intellectually, I can't help but sympathize with the point you're making emotionally. To paraphrase Augustine, knowing the right thing and doing the right thing isn't the same.  As expected, excellent video."

"I really liked the video and agreed in many of your points, but I think that you took the premise of 'are traps gay?' way out of anime/manga since it is were the term is used the most and instead just made it into a transexual thing. Which is not precisely incorect, but I believe that you cannot argue about the 'traps' without diving into some 'trap representation' in manga/anime. Cartoons are different from real people, and for my money, you kinda missed the point. Regardless nice aestethics."
"What is this liberal bullshit, a trans women talking about trans issues? No thanks. When it comes to trans issues I rather listen to a guy who wrote a whole book about porn.

"I believe that one of the problems is that male homosexuality is being talked about in our society like this dark side of the force. Like you have to be extremely careful about always being as straight as possible, because once you kiss a guy or enjoy a Lady Gaga song too much, boy, you are on a slippery slope that inevitably leads to being gay and once you're there, there's no coming. I wish I didn't have this stupid, obviously wrong and deeply irrational fear inside me (being an effeminate crossdresser, very open about my love for pride walks and queer culture in general, that most people think is gay anyway, not much would change for me socially if I dated a guy), but I still do..."

"The title triggered the hell out of me. ...Then I was quickly distracted by the level of her ever-evolving drag game.  I'm really glad to see more and more people following her work since she does something I find very rare and important. The 'Is it gay ?' game that she talked about reminds me of the 'What would you do ?' questions that we used to ask each other as kids when I was in middle school/high school. It was things like : - What would you do if a gay man approached you and started to flirt with you ? - What would you do if your son told you he was gay ? - What would you do if you realized that you flirted with a crossdresser ?  To be clear, the goal of these interactions was to be extremely homophobic/transphobic. And of course, we used awful words instead of gay and crossdresser. The answer just couldn't be cruel enough ! And, weirdly enough, it always centered around 'good boys having to defend their precious masculinity by any means necessary'. The most violent means would only be a proof of how manly they are. So when I hear people talking about intolerance to social progress as something instinctive, as a rational answer (S h a p i r o) OR even as a lack of information, I remember these absurd questions. Intolerance definitely relies on a lack of information. But I feel like people who grew up in the same kind of environment I grew up in, are over-educated more than anything else. Educated on how to be awful to non-heteronormative (and heteronormative) people and how to pressure each other into obeying this propagandist mindstate. It basically was homophobia & transphobia HOMEWORKS that we gave to each other...  These shameful f***ed up memories are the reason why I recognize the insidious threat behind those stupid memes. It feels sadly familiar. And that's also the reason why Natalie is doing some real goddess work in my opinion. As cishet men, we put a lot of work into poisoning our mind without even aknowledging it. So it generally takes more dedication and more patience than a quick twitter thread to even make someone question themself about it."

"There is a distinction that should be made between traps and trans people. For starters, the origin can also be traced to fictional male cis anime shitters who simply crossdress. I HIGHLY doubt that ANY trans women would ever fit the definition of what people think traps are. While I wholely agree with your video, and I think your point are valid and fair, there are people like myself who are able to distinguish that calling trans women traps is just a shitty thing to do and should not be condoned. Joking about traps is fine, their existance is fine, but they are NOT the same as trans women."

"Traps are not gay, because inanimate objects do not have a sexuality.  Now, good points on the topic if men being attracted to trans girls are gay or not!  I'm pre-everything medically speaking, trying to work my voice and 'presenting' basically full time. God I hate the word 'presenting'. I don't 'presenting', I just wear what I find looks good and makes me comfortable. If that happens to be a dress, a pair of sweatpants and hoodie or a cardboard box doesn't matter. CIA girls can walk around in a cardboard box and still be seen as girls, I don't understand why I have this responsibility to 'prove' that I'm a girl by conforming to the strictest of gender norms whereas cis girls do not. I mean I do like dolling myself up in a dress that highlights what little features I have in a feminine way, but it takes away a bit of the experience knowing that it's a requirement for my validity in the eyes of society.  It makes me sad for those girls who want to go around in cargo shorts and a T-shirt, not getting any help with medically transitioning because they don't have any 'real life experience'. What kind of 'real life experience' are they even looking for? I fully look like man in a dress, I have no curves, my fat distribution is unmistakably masculine and that's supposed to give me 'real life experience'? Bull fucking shit. It's a system designed to make me put on display to the world that 'I AM WEIRD' to discourage me to go trough with it. Well guess what? I'm more comfortable looking like a man in a dress than I am looking like a man in a suit so fuck you and give me hormones already!

"I'm personally very nervous about dating bi men, I'm a fresh trans gay man and I get why dating bi people might be easier for me but then again. The fear of them not being attracted to me as a man comes crawling back, I fear bi men liking and embracing my female parts aka breast, curves, and the cavern. I want men to like me and I believe I pass pretty well as a some-what attractive man, though being viewed as feminine sexually and in the broader sense is something that scares me. Maybe my fear is irrational, but it's to a point where my trust of bi men is blurred, I do wish I could be comfortable being with them, but I don't know how to get over my fear."
"Oh, come on. Count Dankula is an alright guy. Regardless, keep on being you Contra."
"Whenever someone makes the argument that a straight cis guy dating and or sleeping with a trans woman is gay because said trans woman has or once had a penis, challenge them on their consistency. Based on their logic, a straight cis man dating or sleeping with a trans man is a heterosexual act because at one point in their life they were the owner of a vagina. Ask them , as a straight guy, if they'd rather sleep with a trans woman or a trans man. If they don't reshape their perspective on sexuality at least a little bit after having this idea challenged, prepare for some epic mental gymnastics."

"I freaked out a little when I saw this pop up on my home screen, I'm always so excited when you make new videos <3 As always you handle the subject thoroughly with extensive detail, persuasion, and humor.  I've heard at least one trans woman say it's transphobic to not date trans people, and in the context of not dating them for the simple fact that they are trans, that is true. I think, however, the argument about attraction to specific genitalia is the only legitimate reason (in direct correlation to them being transgender) not to date them. My best friend since 2007 is trans and he's asked me before if I'd date a trans man. My answer was tentative at first, because a personal requirement for me to be in a relationship with someone is the ability to have sex with them, and while I'm attracted to men I'm not attracted to vaginas. He then showed me some pics of post-op dicks and then I was like 'okay, yeah totally.'"

I understand if you don't really think that's your lane or anything like that, i just think it would be interesting to hear your opinions and ideas on the topic  either way, I thought the video was amazing and I love the effort you put into all your works.

"I agree that the whole debate is really about fragile straight masculinity. I‚Äôm a gay guy, and the first time a trans man started hitting on me, a total hunk, it really made me think hard about my own sexuality. But after some thought and self-reflection, I concluded that it was the beard and chest hair I was into, and the different genitals were just a cool bonus.

"I think this fear of attraction to trans people 'invalidating' a person's sexuality and the toxicity it breeds goes beyond straight cis men, and their attraction to trans women.¬†  In the past, I also experienced that anxiety as a cis lesbian, that if I found a trans woman attractive that was 'straight,' and that my exclusively gay sexual orientation wasn't valid. For cis gay people, this would be the feeling that you're being invalidated about something you've had to fight for and your right to exist, especially for those who've experienced a lot of marginalization/oppression/condemnation/rejected for being sexually attracted to the same sex, so it's different from straight people being afraid it's 'gay' to be attracted to trans people.  In my case, even though deep down I knew I could find trans women attractive, and wouldn't be turned off by being in a sexual relationship with a post-op trans woman, I still felt like admitting that to myself threatened my very identity (that I had experienced a lot of condemnation for because of by my Evangelical upbringing), and I felt sort of antagonistic about trans women because of that. I wasn't a TERF or against trans rights, and I didn't see trans women as predators or anything like that so my attitude was much more similar to transphobic straight cis men than TERF cis lesbians. And I was surrounded by Evangelicals who are against same-sex marriage and don't think trans people are valid so I feared if they knew I would be open to dating or marrying post-op trans women (as well as cis women) they would consider me a confused straight girl, and ask why I couldn't be attracted to cis men if I was attracted to trans women, which obviously makes no sense. Now my fears seem so silly, and I feel bad about having had those toxic thoughts about trans women."

I think that the higher murder rate in colored trans women is heavily linked to the violence and homophobia in those communities. A black guy who‚Äôs conscious is definitely okay with killing a colored trap would probably be evenly willing to kill a white trap it‚Äôs just that the economic separation of those communities means that he is never ‚Äútrapped‚Äù by a white trans woman.

I'd be pretty pissed if a girl whipped a dick out after making out for 5 minutes. But most men arent gonna kill you over that, only the ones who already have a predisposition to care so much about Thier status. Maybe just don't take a chance with that, you don't have to lead with the dick but make sure they know prior to getting in bed. Otherwise that definitely sounds like a 'trap'"

"I know you like the mental masturbation (as do I tbh), but I feel like your argument mostly revolved around a redefinition of straight.  I don't mind being considered straight, but I've always viewed fully straight as being attracted exclusively to a person with both primary and secondary sex characteristics of the opposite sex (not gender).  So, if you are a male attracted to exclusively trans-men, you'd be mostly gay, but not entirely because you don't want the 'd'.  Anyway,  What I'm trying to say is: I don't entirely agree with one of your premises.  Anyway, my answer to the title question is usually: 'Fuck off.'"

So i define it that way, however, not everybody is so focused on just one thing though, so your definition so far (I'm paused at 29:12), is relevant to, I'd think, many many straight men who, without all the stigma, probably wouldn't actually mind a dick there. As much as people say 'eww' to genitals, i don't think a majority actually have serious genital repulsion like they might act like they have"

I still make the distinction of woman and trans-woman though... cuz, it helps myself to label confusing things. I get from their perspective, that they'd rather I not... but without the experience to join those up, I can't help it.  It does leave a quandary, what to do with those where knowledge itself creates discomfort. Some people really have trouble allowing any blury interface between male and female. I'd say live and let live, but, I do avoid any socially awkward situations which potentially includes dating trans women. Meh. I'll take life as it's thrown at me and see what happens."

Sexuality isn't just a thing that can be forced on a person. People try all the time and it doesn't take."
"Contra, as a non-binary person, I am very curious to know why you no longer identify as non-binary.

It sort of fucks with the flow that you had down in earlier videos. I get where the need comes from, and this is probably my cis male privilege talking, but I don't understand why other trans people and non-binary people have a hard time grasping the personal dimension to these things. That focusing on an issue from your own unique perspective and experience doesn't automatically cloud or deligimize anybody else's. As far as I'm concerned, it comes with the territory of doing something so fresh and distinct that makes this channel what it is, as opposed to some more flat or academically-styled presentation or commentary."

"You know, Contra, I like you. I really do, and I agree with you on the vast majority of this. But I want to call you out on calling Count Dankula 'a hate crime convict'. Yes, this is true, and yes he's an alt-righter. But what he did, objectively, was make a dumb video where he taught his pug Nazi salutes and said 'gas the jews' a few times. This is not a man the criminal justice system should do anything to. But the Scottish courts convicted him. It's a dumb law, and even if it weren't dumb, this particular application of it is definitely too broad. It's misleading to call him a hate crime convict and I think you know this. So why are you doing it?"
"The understanding I've always had is that trans-women are women, but 'traps' are explicitly men cross dressing trying to look as feminine as possible. Like Sneaky, the pro-gamer who frequently cosplays as girl characters, to the point many don't believe it's actually a guy. Different from a typical drag queen that typically go over the top with their appearance, a trap just tries to look like a girl. Similar to a 'femboy'. So, yes, traps are gay, because that's a guy, not a girl."

"This video is going to trigger Ben Shapiro.  His feelings don't care about the facts.  The facts are: - trans women are women. - trans women deserve human dignity, as do all folks in the LGBT community. - AND turning the discussion about trans people deserving rights and human dignity into an obstructive discussion about trans people not being who they are and referring to them as mentally ill or a danger to society makes you a piece of shit.  You'd have to be a very shitty person to do that. You'd have to do stuff like say... - allow a racist video to be posted on your website about how pre-Colombian America was inhabited by cannibalistic savages. - refer to Arabs as terrorists who live in open sewage. - say that Title 2, that outlaws discrimination at public accommodations, & Title 7, that outlaws employment discrimination, in the Civil Rights Act were mistakes, because that's 'big government'.  You'd have to be a very shitty person, indeed.  - V"
"Ok, I usually like your videos but when you look at the subject of transvestites being murdered you're saying: 'It shouldn't be something to be told by white women' or something like that. I disagree. The only reason why you shouldn't talk about it is if either if A) You're not confident in your knowledge in it. B) You don't think you can add anything to the conversation. C) You don't have time to talk about the subject. or D) You don't want to talk about it.  It sounds like you're opting into A but being white doesn't mean that you automatically don't have knowledge in the subject. You might not be able to talk about it in detail and the nuances but you can still give an overview of the issue. You can even go the academic approach and cite the experiences of other people and talk about how you interpret it.  I don't get why groups have to have topics sacred to them. For instance you could argue that I'm disabled, but that doesn't mean that I don't think that people who aren't disabled can discuss issues concerning disability. Having a person with the knowledge of a situation but not being invested in it can be a way to reach more valuable conclusions than a person who is invested in a situation. You can more objectively present the issue in a way you can't do than the people who are invested in it. In fact; the fact that they are personally invested in the situation makes their opinions less valuable because they will willfully ignore how changing their situation can negatively affect other groups in society.  This has happened during a conversation I had with a woman once where I argued for prostitution in the sense that it could help people with disabilities since it could be a way for disabled people to experience intimacy and I believe that is important but she didn't care at all about my opinion here, basically saying that the needs of women are more important than the needs of the disabled. She's assuming that the needs of women (whatever they may be in her mind) and all prostitutes are perfectly aligned, which in reality they're not as women (and especially feminists) effectively blocks prostitutes from trying to unionize which is something prostitutes have been pushing for in a very long time. On the subject of prostitutes, what they seem to want the most isn't to have some well meaning feminists makes their work illegal, as the prostitutes understand that working illegally makes them less safe and most prostitutes want a safe working environment.  Now I've never paid for sex, but if I were to do it I'd also want a bit of security when doing so because the people who pay for sex can also put themselves at risk of the prostitutes as partaking in this intimate moment makes you vulnerable and clouds your judgement. I don't honestly don't understand how people can think that making an activity less safe is a good idea, even when it's illegal. I understand why they want to, but I don't understand why they're allowed to get away with making the world an unsafer place for both prostitutes and clients but mostly for prostitutes. Now I don't want human trafficking but that's the very reason why I think it's a good idea to legalize prostitution since that way it can be regulated in the organisations that spring up around i, these organisations can actually be held accountable and the criminals who avoid forming organisations can be much more easily targeted.  But feminists are against all forms of porn as well. I understand being against the poor practices in the porn industry but then I saw that feminists were against gonewild on reddit too, but that's isn't even tied to the porn industry. It's amateur porn!  So there I discussed a topic I'm not part of."

"People are gonna judge this video based on the title aren‚Äôt they?"
"I feel like there's some discrepancy in the fact that I would assume that there is a large number of people like myself had never seen transgendered individuals labeled as traps, only transvestites (unless they specifically labeled themself so as some do on /r/traps and so on). For the past couple years or so that it has been a meme, basically everyone I have ever talked to has drawn a distinction between simple cross-dressing and transgenderism when it comes to traps, (for heavens sakes I've even met transphobic people who like traps and crossdressing) and I feel like that's why the term 'trap' being a slur for transgender people regaining popularity is such a hard sell some people, regardless of their actual believes on trans rights."
"As a straight white fella who laughed and moved on from the it‚Äôs a trap thing, this video was very informative... when I discovered this channel I binged, love the lighting and attention to detail, too! Anyway, the takeaway is that you have a broad reach!"
"My perception of the phase 'are traps gay?' is that it is largely a self deprecating joke. It is a nonsense question because sexuality is extremely complex and that's the point. The asker is sort of admitting how confused they (or possibly society) is on the matter.  I think anyone who is seriously trying to answer the question is either the butt of the joke, or is using it as a spring board for further discussion, which is why the meme took. Sometimes stupidity is thought provoking. You might notice that even many 'transphobe' personalities will chuckle and ponder the absurdity of the question."

The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, in my case.  And, really, I think that straight people often feel like we're so interested in dick because they're not and, if our sexuality is the reverse of theirs, then what they find gross must be hot to us, which isn't the case at all. Judging by how focused straight people are on dick, they seem WAY more interested in it than any of us gay guys will ever be!"

"Okay, okay. Good video about transvestites, but it didn't answer the question. 'Are traps gay?'  If I bring home a tiny coy Japanese boy who dresses like a woman. Is it gay!?"
"Shit posting our way to the Moral high ground! Now that's a battle cry"
"Trans womens should tell what is their genital if they are dating a heterosexual male. Everything other than that is basicly forcing a heterosexual male into a homosexual relationship without his consent. Which in the end is no different from conversion therapy.   Actually conversion therapy is even better. At least they are telling you what are you going to do next. In trans women thing it is completely a trap."
"Who needs sleep if you are here"
"Please, please, does anyone know what is that electronic version of Bach's passacaglia in c minor that plays during the opening ?"
"how does she get prettier every video?"
"Great presentation. And very educational, thank you. I may not agree with everything, but I understand much better, and for that, I'm grateful."
"Thank you contrapoints!"
"sometimes i worry that i'm guilty of the performative wokeness you described. i'm a straight cis man, and i just don't see how sex with a trans woman would work. funny thing is though, i have zero sexual experience. in reality, i'm not even sure how sex with a cis woman would work. the only information i have is that it's not like porn, which doesn't narrow it down very much. is kitchenware involved? a car chase sequence? what happens if you need to sneeze?  so why am i completely confident that i'm into cis women, but not sure whether i could be into trans women? maybe i'm so throbbingly heterosexual that i can just intuit how the feminine penis‚Äîwhich i learned about less than a year ago‚Äîwould make me feel. or maybe i've been socialised all my life to view that mysterious, sacred lady-passage as the only correct place to shove my wang. my objections are all theoretical, but my treatment of trans people isn't. it's a challenging overlap between fantasy and empathy.  anyhow, just thought i'd offer a perspective for your collection. thanks for another excellent video!"
"'dick umami' is such a powerful phrase."
"But, I mean, like 'trap' is literally in the name of your channel.  Edit: btw, I love your channel and all the work you do! I really hope this video intercepts people searching for this title."
"MOUTHFEEL!!"
"Thought a Trap was a crossdressing twink. :/"
"If you got into the back of my taxi, I'd say, 'I'm a fan, and so this ride's on the house, Ms. Wynn.'  Then I'd add, 'I'm not gay, I'm obviously not a minority, so I'm not going to kill you, so please don't be paranoid!'  Hopefully you'd be reassured, most people respond well to that line or reasoning. Hugs and kisses."
"omg this video is so good what a bad bitch üëèüëèüëè"
"fellas is it gay to kiss your homies before bed at night"
"You are the best, there is no one better.  Thank you for being awesome!"
"Looking fabulous as always, Natalie :)"
"What was that laugh at the end ü§£"
"Finally someone is talking about the mouthfeel"
"Is it wrong that I always assumed 'are traps gay' was a hypothetical question that having nice trapezoidal muscles was a sign that you were gay. I guess I live a very sheltered life"
"Yeah, sexuality is better understood as a pattern of attraction. We create these categories based on generalised groups because everyone's sexuality is unique to them.   The whole 'gay men love dick' thing is incredibly annoying to me, like sure some gay men love dick but some gay men hate dick to the extent that they put 'I don't wanna see your gross dick' on their Grindr profiles. For me I can appreciate a dick but I don't require one and I actually don't think I'd have any trouble at all dating a guy who didn't have one. It's as you say, how am I any less gay for not specifically caring about genitals or chromosomes or whatever. I am only interested in men, I have never had any romantic or sexual feelings towards a woman.   It's weird on the one hand society labels a guy gay for the tiniest interest in experimenting but on the other acts like sexuality is this black and white, set in stone unchanging thing."
"By the logic of people that consider a man being attracted to trans women ‚Äúgay‚Äù then being attracted to trans men would be ‚Äústraight‚Äù."
"ALSO as a bi man I appreciate you acknowledging that we exist."
"Not sure if this affects other people, but I'm concerned that some of your title cards between the segments flashing lights really quickly might be problematic for people with epilepsy.  Maybe put a warning in the description just in case?"
"21:30 it‚Äôs true and you should say it"
"yikes it fucking sucks that idiot terfs scared you away from the lesbian community as a whole. I know I can't atone for the actions of my whole community but I, as a single lesbian, sincerely apologize my macabre queen"
"If a cis man is attracted to women, including trans women, and is not attracted to other cis men or trans men, that means he is straight, but being attracted to any trans or gender non-conforming person does count as queer. A cis het male who likes to wear nail polish counts as queer. A cis het female who likes to have short hair counts as queer. Most people are queer and don't even know it, but if you've ever been picked on for pretty much anything, you might be queer, at least a little bit. The reason trans people get so much shit is we dont conform to the rigid expectations society imposes onto everyone. The less 'normal' you are, the more shit you get. The truth is, there is no such thing as 'normal', we're just told a lot of lies by a lot of idiots who never learned to think for themselves."
"You look like a young Ann coulter, but I don't mean that as an insult."
"'You are having a heterosexual moment, my dude'"
"Latinx doesn't exist in the Spanish language! PLEASE, just stop..."
"It's not even possible to clock your makeup because it's ON POINT."
"i just dont think most men want women who are trans because at one point you were a man, and to them it comes off as still being attracted another man despite however attractive they may find your current femininity to be because if said trans woman still appeared to be a man most straight guys know they would never even consider that person sexually or in any manner similar simply because they WERE a man, therefor the question is usually automatically out the window regardless of whether or not they consider them to be a woman in the first place, which in my opinion is a fair distinction. and i think you can owe the significance of that distinction to societal conditioning but it doesnt change the fact that its still there. besides the fact that some people just dont like particular genitals."
"You do good work, and I appreciate it because I learn a lotüíñ"
"With respect to the part about the lady penis, is it fair to summarize the argument to 'it's a matter of perception' whether or not you view it as masculine or feminine? If so how does one change their perception from masculine to feminine? Especially since, as you point out, there are people (like Ben and Jordan) that view a penis as inherently masculine, which would indicate that they believe that a feminine penis is impossible. Even following your guide of picturing a perfectly feminine lady and then adding a dick, I imagine this would remove the perfectly feminine qualifier for Ben and Jordan. So, I guess what I'm saying is that if you already hold on to the notion that gender is unchangeable and non-fluid, and inherently tied to whatever version of biology they think its tied to, then you cannot fundamentally accept a feminine penis. So the goal here is to first convince them that gender is fluid, changing, and do away with the old line of thinking, before bringing them around on the penis issue. I wonder if it is possible for someone like that, to ever truly 180 on their sexual theory; and then learn to accept the feminine penis."
"oh my goddess... Natalie, you are so flawless, every time, I feel that I have to say this: I grew up intelectually admiring people like Daniel dennett, Bertrand Russell, von Neumann, Goethe and Dostoievski... and now you are by far the greatest role model in my life, and not just intelectually, but in every way! I really mean it. You are a giant. Your humanity and your mind are so beautiful, so inspiring... Thank you so, so much."
"Contrapoints you are very brave. This is why we love you."
"thank you so much - i didnt say or think this but i also really didnt understand a lot of things and i am glad to be met where im at in terms of ignorance - you are smart and i am thankful"
"3:15. I didn't understand that cross dresser dig there."
"anyone else thought the thumbnail looked like bella thorne??"
"Tbh im vision impaired and legally blind and can't get glasses, treatment or surgery to fix my condition. I have had irrational fears of my eyesight getting too bad to tell if a woman is trans or not. Honestly in recent years I have come to the conclusion that if it did happen that it would not be that big of a deal. At worst there might be an akward social interaction and at best maybe im bi sexual or kinked anyways so i might have a good time. I'm happy enough to admit that my previous transphobia seems to ahve gone away on at least  a concious level. I think a good point to add to this whole discussion is that most people tend to conform in order to be accepted within society. People also don't want to be lonely. Because of this many people will go along with stuff that they don't agree with or don't enjoy so they don't get rejected by society. It's probably why you see or hear about all these men being affraid of being called gay. It's quite sad really. Personally I think that I have experienced social stigma because of my disability in different ways and even though its not the same I feel like societies and cultures have problems accepting what is considered different up until its absorbed into the mainstream thought process."
"Where is the line where we recognize someone else`s offense? Traps is a slur that most of the world has not heard of. Compared to certain racial epithets, it`s kind of low on the Offense Totem pole. Like if I were to call an Otherkin a skinjob, would the world sit up and take notice the same way if I called a black person the N word?  Doubtful. In fact, most of us would think that Otherkin are just dumb kids (which they are). So any insults directed towards them are not shocking to the whole.   Trans people are going to have a more difficult time convincing the rest of the world that their condition is that of homosexuals, where they were born that way. They`re in the middle between homosexuals and Otherkin; born that way and choosing to express themselves. I do not envy their plight."
"As a bisexual guy who's recently coming to terms with himself, I first realized my attraction to men thanks to the help of a trap I met in early highschool (great story I would love to tell to anyone given the chance by the way) It was confusing for sure. Going from 'yeah i'd fuck this and that girl' to the next day wondering whether or not I should beat my meat to someone of the same sex just because they cosplayed in their past time was a strange one for me. I'm still honestly confused about the whole thing. I did a lot of research back then, learned about sexual triggers (if that's even legit, can't say it was years ago) and tried to sort out the question at hand; am I the big gay or is this just a phase? Fast forward 3 years and my first experience was with a guy. Guess that answers that question."
"Damn contra you‚Äôre looking fiercer in every video"
"I loved the video! Despite this, initially coming into this I was thinking it would cover the hostility towards 'the other' within nerd circles (anime, gaming, etc.), notably homosexuality and transgender identity. But I learned a lot. I was also hoping it would cover the differences between crossdressers and trans people more for the people in the back. Although I do think the portion explaining that 'The identity never comes off' might have been good enough. Wonderful work as always, Natalie! I'm extremely glad to see you making mainstream publications (newyorker, theverge, economist, and the Atlantic)"
"Fuck yeah another video from the queen herself!!"
"2:41 - *Ahem* YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS-AH!! You better serve them fresh out the MAC counter realness!!!!   Ps... You look great, Doll!"
"I found your mention of Dankula pretty unfair, the 'hate-crime' he committed was making a joke about a serious topic, that it was a joke was obvious by the fact he literally made a pug do it. I often don't agree with your conclusions yet still find your views on things interesting, however misrepresenting Dankula like that just doesn't sit right with me"
"Not convinced. Attraction is not purely physical. If a cis-man is attracted to a trans woman without knowing that she is trans, then he is straight. But if he finds her(trans woman) attractive while being aware of her being trans, then he is neither straight nor gay. Just like a third gender, there must also be a third category of attraction, which goes beyond straight, gay and bi. I agree, some trans women are as attractive to cis-men, but if a man is turned off by her gender identity, it doesn't imply that he is doing it to protect his ''manhood''. As I said, sexual attraction is not purely physical. Just because our 5 senses cannot differentiate b/w a beautiful trans woman and a beautiful woman, it doesn't justify that all trans woman be treated like cis-woman in heterosexual relationships."
"Another libtard rekt. Thanks Contrapoints, very cool!"
"YOU POP, BABY"
"My first thought to 'Are traps gay?' was 'Why does it even matter?' You can't control what you're attracted to."
"What is a trap?!?  A miserable pile of secrets! But enough talk, have at you!"
"I love the way you explain things and your personality in general. 40 minutes fly like 40 seconds!"
"Good video but I feel like it covers points that you‚Äôve covered elsewhere better. Specifically with the are traps gay thing. I feel like you‚Äôre Tiffany tumbles video do way better job illustrating why it‚Äôs a reductive view. I also think you could‚Äôve leaned into what makes trans women women other than attraction. But still the video was pretty good."
"I want to watch this again."
"I love how deep you go into things.  You refuse to give the easy answer, you always go deeper, and I love it. By the way, have you done a video on why 'tranny' is offensive?  If not, can you recommend one?"
"Ayyye Buuut the phrase 'Are traps Gay ?' Kind of just flows well off the tounge so... YOu could make a 10 hour film explaining this but fact is most people just dont give a shit cause thats as deep as it ever will be ."
"As a esoteric anarco-transhumanist robotsexual male living form, I empathy with some of the struggles and flaws of their physiological and mental design, for I too suffer from the illnesses of the flesh, but I hope that one day we all get to live in a society of cyborgs with sexy autonomous robots (with rights equal to ours) and finally be free from this mandated prison of flesh designed by that flawed bitch of Mother Nature, where the Great Machine Mother will take us into and industrial paradise (or biological engineered one or whatever, I don't care as long as I can play videogames and chill with my cute robot catgirl girlfriend)."
"'God damn it,' Natalie says, while pouring herself a drink.   Big mood, Ms. Wynn.   I watched this with some cis friends, and they were laughing at some of the jokes in the first chapter. I couldn't. I saw Paris Is Burning. I remember how I felt first watching it. I imagined my trans friends getting killed. It colored the whole video in a way that made my stomach churn.   I can relate to a lot of trans women's experiences, but damn am I grateful I don't have to worry about straight guys.   I never took too much offense at the word trap, but I am FTM. I nervously joked along with my cis DnD group about it to fit in early on in my transition. Most of them are outwardly accepting, but I *knew* that when their heads hit the pillow, they wondered if us *~transes~* were fraudulent. I suspect some of them even believe it. I was just hungry for acceptance as a man, by men. And that meant objectification, mysogyny, and homophobia, however ironic it may have been.   There's a lot of pressure in the cult of masculinity to conform. So I understand the guys who have been comfortably cishet their whole lives suddenly having a crisis when their social status is questioned. But it's no excuse.   And I have been complicit.   God fucking damn it."
"I'll be thinking about the phrase 'fundamental dick umami' forever now. Thanks, Contrapoints."
"K, I have a couple thoughts;¬†  1. I'm actually subbed to both Dankula and Contra, I think they both have genuinely interesting things to say and the platform is better off having both of them on here.  2. Count Dankula didn't commit a hate crime. Nothing he did was out of any actual hate for anyone, Jewish or otherwise.    3. Why do people insist on using 'LatinX' not only is that not how Spanish grammar works, we could just as easily say 'Latin' and everyone would still get the intended demographic.  4. Sucking another man's dick, just to try it might not be gay, but it's at the bare minimum bicurious, similarly to pegging and while there's, of course, nothing wrong with it, those generally aren't things that would appeal to a heterosexual. A lot of your examples seem to be men who claim to be straight but clearly exhibit the traits associated with a bisexual man. Again, there's nothing for them to be ashamed of,  but it seems like all the men you used as examples are simply bisexual (at least to some degree) men who had yet to experiment. If anything they're simply men who fall into the sectors 1-3  of the Kinsey scale."
"You are just getting prettier and prettier"
"This is all very well and nice but HOLY SHIT YOU LOOK GOOD!!"
"Not sure why you can't discuss statistics. I get that it's 'respectful' but following that reasoning the only people who should discuss minority trans murders are reanimated corpses. Your first example of a trans person being killed was even a white person albeit presumably lower class if you want to tack on SES to the crossroad of masculinity and race for trans murders.  I feel like as long as the opinion's informed you should be able to at least discuss it. An insider perspective is important but it goes both ways and the outsider perspective exists as well and you can serve as the tour guide to fellow outsiders who have yet to realize exactly what they're missing on the topic."
"off topic but that ending music fucking SLAPS. choice as always"
"I have to admit, I started off as a pretty faux-progressive/skeptic sort who never really considered Trans people. I supported them, but I will admit I never wanted to deal with them, and worried a lot about my sexuality and being attracted to them, as well as partaking the Trap Debate. I think your content has helped me not only come to accept being a sexual degenerate and all, but to accept other people."
"I'm enjoying watching Natalie talk about penis for a half hour."
"I'm gay and I work at a hardware store with a bunch of straight dudes, most of my friends are straight dudes too, and I am always trying to get them to address the rigid rules of toxic masculinity! Not as an SJW screaming at them, but as a friend I like to ask 'but WHY would that make you gay? Why is that bad? WHY do you feel women are like that. No that's not really ' It's very hard to change peoples minds, and it has be taken in stages, but it's always good to make people question those beliefs."
"The one thing I often wondered about this term is if it has any relationship to the term 'trap' from rap. Like, hip hop trap seems to predate this term by a good 5+ years. Or did the terms develop entirely independently?"
"i'm crying you're so gorgeous? the content of this video is fucking exquisite and ur beauty is at the same level ILY"
"this is it chief"
"Anybody know the first song that plays in the background, that piano one?"
"Thank god you made a video about it. The  exact reason I clicked on this was exactly the reason you pointed out. Who else is actually gonna explain if traps ARE gay? Definitely not entitled men"
"Natalie, I want a prop room or wig room tour. No way all your shit fits in one bed room"
"Queeeeeeeeen this was such a good video ugh."
"Your natural hair is so beautiful. I love you"
"very eloquent and beautifully prepared essay. Professional, comedic, informative and very entertaining. I have nothing against people who don't identify within sexual/gender norms however many of those I have met I have been apprehensive of. Yes this is probably the prevailing negative associations in our culture buried in my subconscious but also because many people I meet who are trans/nonbinary or both have very outlandish beliefs, lifestyles, and behaviors. While this may just be them putting their weirdest foot forward to get the worst out of the way it is very nice to see someone like Contra  who can explain the perspectives and in doing so let me form positive associates with people different than me as a whole :) ---ps also this from a stupid fucking meme JEEZE"
"I feel like the term trap is thrown around for actual cross dressers. 'Is it gay to like a man dressed as a woman who takes his woman clothes off later?' could be a valid question, lol"
"'This type of masculinity is hurting ciswomen.' Good. 'Transwomen.' Omg yes good. She's gonna say it - she's gonna say it! I'm so incredibly excited this is the first time she's acknowledged us. She already acknowledged the male clitoris Natalie is gon-- 'And Gay people.'  :') -weeps in transman tears-"
"‚ÄòWho‚Äôs we?‚Äô This is the question that is the most confounding to me, second only to ‚Äòwho‚Äôs they?‚Äô"
"Incredible work here. I've become a massive fan. Thank you."
"thank you for the vid comrade. very educational.  <3"
"You‚Äôre fantastic, thank you"
"You pop!"
"Traps are transvestites or solely just male crossdressers that have the intention of making cishets question they're sexuality. A queer person who identifies as transvestite and a trap is not offensive. However, referring to a transgender folk as a trap IS offensive. Is it gay? Well, if you like a trap, it is gay. If you like a  transfolk, not really. Done."
"men shouldn't be allowed to watch anime. anime is for girls only."
"natalie will u b my online gf"
"THANK YOU for specifying that the murder issue is specific to minorities. It cannot be said often enough."
"Did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again? Haha!! <3"
"I love your videos, I look forward to them every time I see a new one."
"Great video! Concerning the part of the video that challenged black and white thinking, I like to think of reality as an assortment of complex systems in the form of a multiplicity of branching spectra. Our systems of categorization have failed to accurately account for all aspects of being as well as other types of phenomena."
"the fact that you both  A: Recognize that Trans Panic mainly affects Trans WOC, and B: Know that you shouldn‚Äôt speak on an experience that isn‚Äôt yours  sadly makes you the woman that people most likely will listen to.  then again, as a Cis WOC, I probably don‚Äôt have the experience necessary to speak on this either.  The Ally Paradox‚Ñ¢Ô∏è continues to consume us all!"
"Your makeup is on point as always"
"36:00 so basically, you're saying that you've conviced and manipulated some men or 'incel homophobic transphobic buzz word' in the past to doing this shit and you're now justifying it with your own opinions of the matter"
"This was a very good video, one of your best in my opinion. I understand your trepidation in discussing this topic, but for what it‚Äôs worth, I think the result is very informative."
"The following is just something interesting that occurred to me with regards to the ‚Äúfeminine penis‚Äù."
"There seems to be some comportance with the terms ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù and ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù as they are used in this video and how they are used by Jordan Peterson. Dr. Peterson often gets the following question with regards to his book, Maps of Meaning: ‚ÄúWhy is order male and chaos female?‚Äù He usually corrects the question and claims that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmale and female‚Äù but ‚Äúmasculine and feminine‚Äù, and points to the difference being that the latter are categories of metaphoric grouping, and not statements about the physical world. Early on in Maps of Meaning, Dr. Peterson points out the distinction between the world as a ‚Äúplace of things‚Äù and as a ‚Äúforum for action‚Äù, with science being a method of the former world, and story/metaphor being a method of the latter. Since Dr. Peterson claims that ‚Äúmasculine and feminine‚Äù are metaphoric categories, he would likely agree that they are aspects of the ‚Äúforum for action‚Äù. By extension, ‚Äúmale and female‚Äù would be categories of the ‚Äúplace of things‚Äù."
"Given the importance that Dr. Peterson places on the ‚Äúforum for action‚Äù way of looking at the world, his philosophy could be used to justify the ‚Äúfeminine penis‚Äù by aligning with the first two factors brought up with regards to it in this video: context and usage. Both of these factors are prevalent within the ‚Äúforum for action‚Äù, and so could be used to validate the concept from that angle."
"An additional point: I‚Äôm not sure that the ‚Äúfeminine penis‚Äù is comprehensive enough of a concept, since as far as I can tell, if a trans-woman is a woman, then the penis that she would have wouldn‚Äôt just be ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù but ‚Äúfemale‚Äù (I‚Äôm not trying to deny the claim by phrasing it as a hypothetical). Would this be an accurate categorization, or am I misunderstanding something?"
"Also, your costume quality keeps getting better and better, so well done with regards to that."
"Natalie you are so beautiful and smart and funny. And you are just the best! I love you"
"That collar is fucking hot."
"‚ÄùIt's a multicolored acid trip. It‚Äôs centaur Donna Summers charging at you with a spanking paddle.‚Äù  Damn Girl! What your connection‚Äôs phone number because I want hit of that!"
"Please don't say triggered. Say 'they're getting mad'. I mean I don't care really just a tip."
"I think with the way you described them, I might be some kind of chaser? I‚Äôm a bi cis dude and generally switch. But for trans women am interested in bottom. Does that make me a chaser? I would still be attracted to post op but not sure if it would be a different kind of attraction. Thx for clearing some stuff up tho that I hadn‚Äôt wrapped my head around. All your videos are hilarious and incredibly written"
"I've always admired your bravery in being a trans woman that is willing to go on youtube dot com and talk talk about such issues as Incels and the Alt-Right, but to have you talk about This issue is on a whole other level. Natalie, you are a brave woman and I deeply appreciate the work that you do in helping the world to understand us a little better. p.s. I am in complete agreement on the mouth feel."
"5:14 Wasn't a hate crime, it was the Scottish judicial system labeling a silly joke as hate speech when it was clearly just a joke. They don't have freedom of speech over there and can throw you in prison for comedy."
"You look so beautiful in this video!!"
"WHERE üëè ARE üëè MY üëè SPANISH üëè SUBTITLES üëè?"
"Lmao I love ur videos so much üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèª"
"I'm not particularly woke, but I hope I'm open minded enough to examine my prejudices.  I don't know if you've covered it before, but I'd be interested in you doing a video on trans women in sports, as it seems to attract quite a lot of controversy and generally can be seen as quite negative by non-trans women. Trans-women keep dominating in areas such as weight-lifting and other such physically demanding sports. Do years of prior male hormones constitute an unfair advantage?"
"You're so verbose and I love it. This is a great video, I'm a cis girl and I notice so much transmisogyny on the internet and in real life :("
"I loved the pedantic romantics video essays before the traps video. All early hipster jokes aside, bless this video and bless you for blessing that video! An alliance of deep philosophical YouTube queendoms"
"seriously, what ISN'T Gay these days?"
"We need more Laura Levay"
"Love that Zo√´ Blade/Ann Bailey theme."
"Oh my god, for weeks, I have been playing nothing by Schubert's piano trio no. 2 on loop, waiting desperately for Contrapoints' next video, and then -- 0:56 -- there it is!  What is going on?!"
"finally someone‚Äôs got the answer"
"thank you for your videos, Natalie. I always look forward to when you upload. you give me a little shot of sanity, and I appreciate you unpacking your thoughts and experience, and I really appreciate the humor you weave into it all. and your theatrics are always so wonderfully done and beautiful. but I've been struggling, and your videos are always like a ray of light in a storm. so thank you for your hard work, and for sharing."
"Natalie please please please make   m o u t h f e e l   t-shirts  so we can show  our support. Ill buy 5 I promise!"
"Referring to Count Dankula as a hate crime convict without context seems mildly disingenuous."
"OMG you're poly, do a video about it <3"
"I feel like this channel is just a showcase for your increasingly elaborate pseudo drag-queen degeneracy.     Please continue."
"The description of the mouth feel is wholesome"
"i wonder if Alex Jones will watch this"
"I think* the We are being killed in the streets is a good thing to KEEP and your right mabey not have a White spokes person but*** why not have both together   If one trans female is killed I take it as an attack on femininity !!!   I feel trans Men have experienced being female and decided to leave  And the Females are now as far as I am concerned females   And I defend BOTH   I have had Trans ladies crying in the bathroom at a nightclub because their ride ditched them and they are even scare to get in a car with me *And she had a Concealed weapon* and that's a white girl who passes   Shes scared of walking like 8 blocks in a LBT friendly trans friendly city    Well THAT is okay   >It is OKAY to be afraid< Its healthy to have reasonable fear and its Smart to take reasonable precautions.   And your designer vagina will be Beautiful >I am sure<   And as all my friends say  PiCS or it didnt happen"
"Contra, you are absolutely brilliant and I‚Äôm in awe of your incisive approach. Thank you for educating us!"
"I love the way you explain things in your videos. This subject seemed like such a passive thing from my perspective. You deliver an easy to understand means of empathizing with things that I personally couldn't grasp on my own. I can't wait to see more videos covering things like this."
"God damn. Absolutely fantastic. Thank you Natalie!"
"I have the advantage of being gay/pan so i find people sexy, and not greatly concerned with the equipment."
"Ye gods I love your style, madam. You're both a gorgeous lady and intellectually delectable. My genderqueer (lady presenting due to biology) ass is in love with all of your videos and my brain is too. You combine style and substance beautifully and I covet your skull headdress. Rock on you beautiful bitch‚Äîrock on."
"thumbs way up for getting the word out about that Mouthfeel tho. it's important."
"'Dick u-mami' Ok, we get it. Mami has a penis."
"It's not a vagina, it's an open womb. Also there's no such thing as a feminine penis. This video is full of gross jokes with hardly any arguments."
"YOU POP CONTRAPOINTS"
"Really glad that this is currently the first thing that comes up if you Google ‚Äúare traps gay?‚Äù"
"I think this is your best video yet tbh.  However, I want to say something about the programmer trans women you mentioned earlier. I grew up in a relatively economically depressed situation, best way to describe my life back then was 'The richest poor family' for example, I was born at home which was a trailer, I had both middle class, and poor friends and I suffered every type of abuse you can experience as a child. Although I've been on hormones for 9 months now, I am still not out to everyone and present as male when I go to work etc.  I was only able to go to college because I started at community before transferring to Uni, and I had to take on all the debt I possibly could in order to get my CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) degree. It is true that being black would raise my chances of being murdered for being trans, but because I was raised in a really toxic environment I know that the potential to be murdered is still there, so I don't think its necessarily fair to lump all 'computer programmers' which is a part of my job, into the same category. I don't know if this was intended, but I just wanted to let you know that there are some, although I am the only one I know of, who grew up economically depressed currently in my field I am sure I am not the only one to manage to claw her way out of it."

"Count Dankula is only a 'hate crime convict' because of a joke (he taught his pug to do the Hitler salute). His actual politics are not even remotely alt-right and he has made that clear on several occasions. Ranking him with Richard Spencer and Milo is incredibly misleading, to say the least. It's disappointing too, I used to think you were more honest than this. I'm not saying things like liberals calling jokes 'hate crimes' excuse the rise of social conservatism, but people like you sure love making it harder for us to look like the sane and credible. Granted, I haven't finished the video yet, so the whole damn thing could be an overreaction to a meme."

"I can think of like 20 people who ceaselessly gave me shit for happily and proudly dating a trans girl that need to watch this video. Those troglodytes never managed to make me feel ashamed but it drove me nuts that me being happy in a way they deemed unconventional confused them to a point where they felt the need comment on it all the time."
"I dont mind watching some hot chick with a dick getting her dick sucked by some hot porn star. Its better than watching that pornstar suck some dudes dick. Traps are totally gay. THey are men dressed like women but suck and fuck male penis."
"i'm transmasculine (pre-T), my bf is also trans (on T). we're both poly and we've done stuff w trans friends before but yeh,,, the prospect of getting involved w a cis person is daunting. especially a man. my experience with men is, if they're halfway decent, they don't see me as a masculine person and are definitely not willing to treat me as such so i'm not sure if my fragile little ego could take it. plus men scary. scary men. scare."

There's a go fund me project if I've ever heard one."
"Well done, the angle at which you chose to attack the topic was truly well thought out and it's hard to see another alternative then: You are changing the world for the better. Looking down the path, I can easily see this kind of exposure creating (over time) a general spike in curiosity, experimentation and then it will be widely acceptable in society... Thank you. On a personal note: When you look at the brain as the only part 'worthy of scrutiny' and separate any attraction to someone as your own little box that only you control, the world becomes very... Liberating..."

"The most immature straight men seem to have homoerotic aspirations to everything they do, meaning everything they do is to be validated through envy or praise from another man or group of men. Women are a tool to induce envy but not anything that matter in the way of intrinsically increasing their sense of self-worth, i.e. 'I want to have sex with a lot of hot women' BUT if no man could hear me brag about it, it's not worth it.   I don't know nothing about the rest but you tried so hard and I appreciate your esthetics as well."

"Granted, Im only 5 mins in, but I think you've slandered Dankula to at least some degree. Both putting Richard Spencer and Milo next to him and calling him a 'Scottish hate crime convict' is very unfair. Surely you aren't as petty to say his joke was actually worthy of him being convicted."

"Why are we still doing metaphysics?"
"How dare you talk about the feminine penis without mentioning the m o u t h f e-, oh never mind, I just reached chapter seven"
"I haven't finished the video yet so please forgive me if you mention this, but I didn't want to forget. :)  One thing that bugs me very much, as a biological woman, is very much, from my perspective, the flip side of the coin you're dealing with (and I'm so sorry about that bar you mentioned you can't go into; a friend and I were having a quiet drink at the neighbourhood pub once, when this random guy came over and politely asked us if we wanted to dance, and so we, also politely, said, 'No, thank you,' and then the shithole literally *ranted* at us for several minutes for turning him down! We were both scared silly! And we were in a booth and couldn't get past him, and no one else around did ANYTHING. Not his friends, not any random bystanders, not even the staff. It was like we'd turned invisible. Just suddenly trapped in this horribly tiny world with a crazy man yelling at us and somehow no one doing anything to help us. TL;DR: I've been there and it's fucking terrifying and I'm sorry you've had to experience that too and that you don't think the jerks in that bar would help if it did)-- anyways, yeah, the guys who think the final determination of whether or not someone they're attracted to should or should not have sex with them is something as stupid and basic and immaterial as their gender.  Like, if you're attracted to each other and both into it, what the hell is the issue? But also, these assholes think that because you're (by default, they assume) straight, that means that you *must* *have* to have sex with them. Because they're a guy. And you're attracted to guys. So you must be attracted to *them*. So you therefore owe them either sex, or an explanation. Q.E.D.  So I guess they're also going, 'I am a straight guy but I'm not positive that this woman I'm attracted to who seems like a woman to me (because otherwise I wouldn't be attracted to her) actually fully *counts* as a woman somehow so that might mean I'm *actually* attracted to a man which would mean I am *actually* gay OH NOES.' And then they behave like complete assholes, or worse.  Like, does sexual attraction really, honestly work like that for guys? Doesn't matter how amazing and fantastic or awful and gross a person is, in the end, it all just comes down to, 'How many holes are there okay let's go!'? Because if so, that's fucking depressing on a hell of a lot of levels. I mean, women will sometimes joke (well, they used to) about 'Mr. Right' and 'Mr. Right Now'; but we are still usually looking for *something* more than an ambulatory penis. I mean, toys are less stress and effort, you know? Is that truly all guys (or some guys, at least) are looking for, just something wetter and warmer than their hand, and *that's all*? So they think we should think the same way, and are offended because we don't?  Does it mean that, despite us regarding ourselves as actual, you know, *people*, with personalities and talents and flaws and hopes and dreams and all of the rest of it, all we really, actually are is a convenient vagina? (or not, and how dare you cheat me of the vagina I was so sure I was about to get, raaaagh?)  Fuck, I made myself sad. Well, you warned me.  Fuck misogynists. And I'm sorry, but if you are provoked to anger (let alone violence!) against a woman because of the way her genitalia looks, be it because you don't like the shape of her labia or how much she does or doesn't shave or whether her dick is cut or uncut or whatever the hell, you are a misogynist. And an asshole. Get over yourself."

"I can't explain how many times I've had to explain this exact point with people, and hopefully your eloquence can help me next time. Been on HRT for about 6, 7 years now (MtF), and the looks and stares I STILL get to this day make that anxiety flare up like I'm back in grade school, getting the shit kicked out of me in a bathroom for being 'gay'. Happened twice a week for 3 years, and I'm still nervous about bathrooms to this day. It's shit like that which makes me have panic attacks in public and in public bathrooms. Let's just say we were not exactly middle class.  Ever since my wife and I saw your videos a year or two back we've been stunned by your production quality and expressive nature, coupled with the weird shit you put in there. Keep doing what you're doing, Nat! Love ya!"
"I'm a cishet man who pretty well fit into the description of shallow acceptance. It was kind of a weird stance where I wanted to do the right thing, but couldn't really mentally justify some of the thoughts I had. I kind of was just doing what I was told to without really knowing why I was doing it. The point being that I found that the video illuminating in both helping me understand the topic, and helping me act like a better person in the future, actually believing what I say and act on. Thanks for making the video, hope it gets a lot of traction."
"Semmemlier.  I'm dying."
"Finally, someone is talking about the feminine penis"
"A big part of the nuance, in my eyes, is that 'trap' is used to refer to more than one type of person.  Hell, not only do people refer to crossdressers IRL as 'traps', as well as trans women, but on top of that, even fictional crossdressers have the term slapped on their forehead to label them, so when the question is crudely simplified to 'are traps gay', it lumps all of those people together, and as much as I adore Felix from RE:Zero, and Tatsukichi in 'MM!', being equated to a crossdresser, fictional or otherwise, isn't an apt juxtaposition to make, imo.  So for me the question 'Are Traps Gay?' should be met with '1) What are you referring to?  Crossdressers or trans women?  Because the two aren't the same thing, and 2) Why do you even care?  If you're into it, just be into it.  If your friends give you shit, tell them to go suck a dick.  Preferably a girldick.  There's a good chance they might like the mouthfeel.'"
"Yo Dankula isn't that bad cmon. I guess it really falls on your stance on the whole hate speech thing"
"At the start of this...   I am mostly Gay  But I Like D  So would I date someone prettier then me - Duh   That said People assume I an Entitled Cis etc etc and so I get to go GOODIE   Anyway - supporting the channel by engaging in the comments   I hear emojis help supposedly üé≤üíÖüòÅ"
"The bit where Natalie metaphorically says she's more of a man than men concerned about their heteronormativity kinda reinforces some bad notions of gender. There's a toxic form of womanhood associated with the idea that women can't 'man up', and we presumably all want to live in a world where womanhood isn't connected with the qualities of submissiveness and weakness of the will, so that bit could've been stated better.  Of course she used those statements to (ideally) help decouple men's sense of manhood from their perceived and 'actual' sexual orientations, but something should be said about the coupling of womanhood and timidity.  Great video on the whole though!"
"I never even knew anyone included trans people when talking about traps, I thought the whole gag was shotas can pass as lolis. The idea that anyone would include futa, or actual trans people into the discussion is so crazy to me. I can see why people are so offended by the term I guess."
"Bravo!"
"‚ÄúA Scottish hate crime convict‚Äù that feels a biiiiit misleading for Count Dankula"
"Dick girls are like being a legendary Pokemon classic af"
"I never really got why people like surrounding themselves with friends that try to mock them for their life choices.  I suspect people want all these social rules because they like having some kind of structure to their lives. 'Don't rape, and everything else is permissible.' Is too open ended so they have to obsess over whether they're still straight or whether their sex life is socially acceptable and whatever."
"I take major issue with part 9. I think the motivation causing straight men to call female 'traps' gay it the same as what causes gay men to fervently reject trans men as 'straight', therefore, it isn't about just 'gay bad'.  Both are trying to enforce the purity of their 'masculinity'  as well as their superiority over trans people. You really need to consider ALL trans people in your arguments.  There are many times when only the female perspective is relevant, but at times like this, forgetting the rest of trans people can leave major holes in your argument. Trying to make your content more accessible can sacrifice it's accuracy. Additionally, mocking the 'I was always born a women, and the men I dated could sense my feminine energy' people isn't very nice, even if they are wrong. Love your work and love you as always. I actually began my transition the very same month you did, so I almost feel like I went through this journey with you."

"Transbians are gay tho"
"As a bisexual woman who feels attraction differently between genders, who's been attracted to trans women and men, for me they've always triggered the correct feelings. When I've looked at a trans woman I like I think 'I'm so gay. I want to do the gay things. All of them fuck my gay ass up. I'm a vers I don't care what the gay thing is but I want it' and when I've looked at a trans guy I like I think ' wow he's hotüî•. I would like to do so many things'. And this is sometimes even pre medical transistion but post social transistion. I see a trans woman not on hormones who is pretty and think 'wow I'm gay'.  And this doesnt happen with my attraction towards gender benders like Frank-n-furter and Brad Majors in RHPS or yungblud. I still don't feel like that's gay for me to want. It's a bit queer because cross dressing isn't a super accepted part of cis hetero culture and especially when it goes into the bedroom and It would essentially be a kaikai but I wouldn't feel gay because I'd be with a man. I've seen a trans guy play brad in RHPS and still had a similar reaction to every other time I've seen it but it wasn't gay because I knew it was a man. I think the psychology behind it plays a big role. If you don't see trans women as women you're going to be worried it's not straight if you're a man and not gay if your a lesbian. If you're a big queer like me who believes trans women are women you're still going to feel gay/queer and if your an educated straight man you feel straight.  Your perception affects your reaction. So in an ideal world trans women would never be made to feel as though sleeping with them is a trap to get people to go against their sexuality but so long as their feminity is debatable their will be people who see them as such and proving their womanhood is legitimate is the first step. In an ideal world this wouldn't be necessary but this world isn't a perfect world."
"Thanks for this! I have questions but don't know how to ask them and your videos really help. Hell, you answer questions I never knew I had and help me understand my own queerness and identity.  I especially love watching your own discovery of your own identity through your older videos until now because it makes me feel like questioning who you are and what you like sexually in ways that no one talks about is totally normal. So thank you for sharing and educating!"

A s  a  l e s b i a n  the comment about terfs hit me kinda hard. I honestly don't blame you. I've seen a lot of cis lesbians be really shitty to trans women on the internet (and I've almost fallen for it a couple of times had it not been for watching trans youtubers such as yourself). It's gotten to the point where I don't even like calling myself a lesbian as much because I'm worried folks will assume I'm a terf. Hopefully more of us will start calling that shit out."

"I'm a gay cis male so I thought I'd offer my thoughts on sexuality when it comes to gender.  I'm not attracted to women and I'm not attracted to trans women (usually, depending on the transition). I AM very attracted to male crossdressers. I think the reason why is twofold:  1. Male crossdressers are (usually) very much male. You can usually tell by their masculine body, body language, facial features, etc. I say usually because there are exceptions to every rule. Gender identity/expression is not black and white.  2. I like the idea of boys who wear skirts and leggings. Women who wear skirts are just women. Trans women who wear skirts are women. It's difficult to explain, but something in the back of my mind gets excited when I know it's a guy in a skirt.  ---------  I wish Contra had covered the different uses of the word 'trap'. It definitely is a slur when referring to trans women. It's totally disgusting for all the reasons mentioned in the video. But in my experience there IS another use.   I'm into yaoi and in that context a trap is never a trans woman. A trap always refers to a male crossdresser and his encounter with another male. The 'trap' always describes himself as a male and has male body language.  Perhaps a better term would be 'effeminate crossdresser' but that's 7 syllables compared to trap's 1 syllable and when I'm searching for porn time is of the essence."

"I'm a gay woman who doesn't really view labels as a big deal, so I've kind of just rolled my eyes at the 'are tr*ps gay?' thing & thought, well why does it matter anyway? I don't think it's gay, but if you feel gay you should follow your heart, not bury it. But I can see that taking the 'why does it matter? have sex with who you want to' approach can be hurtful, since trans people's identities can be dismissed as invalid using that line of thinking. So, it's not gay to have sex with a trans woman (who may or may not have a penis, depending on her circumstances) but the cishet men who get caught up in society's toxic masculinity bullshit should do everyone a favor and get themselves untangled from it. Realizing I was gay and that I never had to have a compulsive hetero relationship ever again was one of the happiest and most treasured moments of my childhood. I want that feeling of self-acceptance for everyone, even the obnoxious cis guys who might not be as het as they think they are."
"ANYWAY sorry for wording so much in your comments, I love your videos and always look forward to your insight <3"
"Thank you so much for doin' this vidder, yeh :3 I'm personally kinda offended by the phrase, 'cause... well, like that one scenario, where the woman was just walking down the street - she didn't do anything, it was her aggressor's own insecurities... buh anyhoo. I'm not upset at you doin' this, I was pretty sure you'd know how t'tackle this :3 An' oooooh, you pop :D"
"First thing I wanna say is FUCK NATALIE UR STUNNING I‚Äôm shook"
"I really enjoyed The Half Queens make up and costume."
"This channel is amazing. Philosophical trans humor is so rare, and you just nail it. Also I've gotten so tired of explaining trans theory to the most ignorant people, its incredibly refreshing to hear from someone without feeling obligated to explain to them why they're wrong and offensive. I'm actually learning from you, and that's so great."
".......okay, how many takes did the 'Mouthfeel' section take? I would've been corpsing like crazy :D."
""
"The main thing about human sexuality more people need to understand is that it's a mess wrapped in a blanket of chaos strapped into a straight-jacket of confusion and spanked by Cthulhu dressed as a cheerleader. We put out labels to try to define our attractions and interests and, yes, revulsions (Vore: Fun for some, very much not for others!), but anyone that says they know for certain exactly what they want and are interested in is either deluded or lying."
""
"I'll admit, I am curious what exactly the, erm, process for revealing one's trans-ness to a potential partner is... but that's not exactly part of the scope of this video. It's just something that does occasionally plink at my mind."
"love the hair, you look stunning :D"
"Thank you for making this. I wasted a whole night binge watching 'are traps gay' debates on youtube just to make myself angry. And yeah, I'm in the age demographic you mentioned at the start of your video. They were all videos made by straight weebs, so of course it always ends with 'lolol traps are gay lol'. Trans women are women, so I've always just thought what? Why is there a debate on this? (Also your hair. I need your hair)"
"Really? You're on the side of the British fascist police-state in the Count Dankula-case?"
"Trappin  straight men is rape attempt. End of story. It's as rotten as tricking kids into sex. Fuck that noise."
"Natalie - love you, love everything about you, thinking of being you for Halloween but - why are you ripping on Count Dankula for the nazi pug crap? Like, feel FREE to call him out on being an ignorant cis white male joking about shit that's hurtful to people (I assume, I haven't seen that video yet, I'll go educate myself after finishing yours) but don't use the hate crime conviction to put him down - it was BULLSHIT, and if you follow the situation, I really would've thought you'd agree. Yes, it was a bad taste Nazi joke but it was very clearly a JOKE and what's disgusting, despicable and a perfect example of what's actually going on in the UK to people from outside of it is that he was convicted of a hate crime where none exists. His video was clearly framed as a joke and it did not encourage anti-semitism or neo-nazi ideals - it did not break the law and he should not have been convicted. As a Jewish woman (only one but it still counts), the only offence I took from that video was that he was prosecuted for comedy. I find that highly fucking offensive - jokes about nazi pugs, not so much. Right, back to the video an the topic at hand, because I'm deeply interested. If you disagree about CD's hate crime conviction, please please please elucidate because I'd love to understand! I'm clearly engaged by your opinions."
"I never considered the trans side of that phrase. Honestly every time I heard 'trap' I thought about girlish looking men in women's clothing, particularly in short gifs on 4chan that end with a dick reveal. Somehow I thought that it was helping tear down a bit of    t o x i c  m a s c u l i n i t y    to watch cishet men trick each other with this and help them understand why some men would be attracted to other men, or at least how or why a man would like to emulate femininity (whatever that means).   I've always been jealous of how women can grab a guys attention as viscerally as they do, and I've always wanted men to treat me like that. (Obviously discounting the toxic and chauvinist parts). I've always said if I could just push a button and become a girl I'd do it. I want guys to want me, most men want women, it's math. I would love the male attention. I would love, LOVE to have the body of the people in those videos and, even if just for a minute, have a man's complete eye and desire.   Does that make me Trans? I don't think it does. Does it make me a trap? Nope, cause I can't pull that shit off. Does it make me gay?   HELL YES.   Back on point, while I knew about the more infamous cases of violence against trans women, somehow I never put the two in the same boat. I put trans women and traps in two different boxes. I just never thought about it from a trans perspective.    There's a trans woman who works at a starbux near me, we'll call her Coraline. Coraline is beautiful, very feminine, very fashionable and great with her make up. Still, I can tell she is trans, but maybe other people can't. Maybe they view her as a 'trap.' and maybe one day in this super red state someone's gonna take offense to that. One day I'm gonna go to that starbux and maybe she won't be there, possibly because its her day off or possibly because she got another job or moved to a different state, but I'm still gonna worry about her.   Huh.   Anyway, thanks for making this video."

"2:42 üî•üî•üî•oof, such hotness!"
"Not wanting to detract from the point, but I think something really interesting about this is the light it shines on how stigmatised being gay still is. Men don't want to be 'gay' because they presumably have this idea of being gay as a bad thing. Anyway though, great video contra."
"yeah! fuck social liberals who are shallow!!!"
"Pink eye or lighting?"
"great video Natalie! I always enjoy them. One video i would love to see in the future from this channel is something i''ve been seeing around the internet that i'm not quite sure how i feel about: is the trans identity going to overtake the 'need' for or  undermine the population of gay people? People have sited popular stories of kids coming home saying they like the same gender, the parents being distressed, the child quickly rationalizing it with the fact that they're straight, just trans, and the parents being fully supportive. I think that this theory is exaggerated at best and horse shit at worst but i would like to see research done."

"2 step plan for attraction and sexuality. Okay bout to fix this whole thing.  1.Are you attracted to anything? Yes: move to step 2. No: All done, you good. 2.Is what you are attracted to, able to consent and is of age? Yes: You good. No: Stop. Seek help.  You like what you like. You don't shame yourself for eating pineapple pizza, just cause people say it's wrong. So why should you shame yourself for liking strap on's and nipple clamps."
"Natalie, you're doing God's work.  Most trans arguments are appeals to emotion, which I think are mostly unconvincing to the public at large and where most of the backlash against 'sjw's is rooted.  You're the first person I've seen make a logically rooted persuasive rebuttal.  Also,  your set designs and costumes are on point."
"wouldn't it be kind of better if your vagina sucks tho?"
"I've been watching your channel since you had 12k subs and its seriously educational for a cishet guy who grew up in a small Texas city. Seriously, you answer so many question I've been curious about but really don't feel like I should ask my one trans friend who already has a really tough time without me bugging her about her life experiences.  Also, its been really cool watching your channel explode the past couple years. And you finally went on Chapo."
"33:55 -- Is V I C T R O Y what happens when your opponent thinks they've won but then you gift them a beautiful wooden horse* ?     *Said horse is hollow and packed with fearsome warriors who will destroy your opponent when they don't expect it. THAT's an ACTUAL trap."
"She should write a book"
"When you said you are poly and queer... HEAVY SWOON! *CRUSH INTENSIFIES*"
"honestly i think the fact that you confront the lines of thinking that a lot of (especially younger) people invested in social justice avoid (usually out of fear of sounding like they support those lines of thinking), is what makes your arguments so effective. fully understanding a harmful societal view and the people that hold them isn't the same as supporting them and i really, really wish more people knew that!! anyways as usual, amazing video! pls tell me where you get all your cool lighting setups from"
"I think it's perception, so if you are a man and you think you are fucking a man then it's gay at least from his PoV. And men can have a 'straight relationship' with a another born as a man identifying as woman if they see it as such. But like getting to the point where all men just have to accept what you identify as and want to be in that kind of sex/relationship is dismissive of how men feel about it. The more good interactions there is between people that identify as the other gender and shows people it's not a meme the better for that cause. Give it time and cultural norms will change if more people get into it the idea."

"Maybe I'm an out of touch old school weeb but I've only ever heard the term used in the community to decribe a young boy or a deceptively androgenous person who looks like a young girl. I'm not aware of any explicitly trans traps.   Regardless I think the anime community should be able to keep the term trap for their make believe waifu bed pillows."
"Contra Points is literally my favourite channel on YouTube atm"
"natalie the video is amazing but can we just talk about how hot you are"
"I really appreciate you being so open with so many things most people would find TMI. its obviously super personal stuff but i really feel like your videos answer questions and provide information that isnt readily available anywhere else (for someone with no first hand experience). basically thank you for talking about the mouthfeel"
"In my point of view it's perfectly acceptable if someone doesn't want to date a trans woman, it's, form my perspective and my own experiences with trans women, a matter of preference and not discrimination. I've had sex with multiple trans women being myself heterosexual, i just have a preference over trans women with penises over trans men with vaginas. I feel attracted to the entirety of trans women while the only thing i am 'attracted' to in a trans woman pre-op is the vagina, but because it is on a man's body i can't be attracted to them. It's a physical attraction to a specific thing (penis) in a body which i find attractive (female). Same can be said about black women, many people are not attracted to black women not by discrimination or racial bias but simply because they don't find the skin tone or overall general features of an ethnic group very attractive. In general black women have wide noses, larger brows and have a wide body build. On top of things like different scents, textures etc there's a whole lot of things to consider. Just as i have the right to not want to date any group of people because i don't find them attractive for any number of factors, the most obvious thing about a trans woman is the penis, which most straight men are not interested in. If i made any mistakes or false statements please correct me"
"Thank you for making this video Contra. You've definitly made an impact on mine and my fianc√©'s life. I know you've done the same for others. Keep it up. üòÅ --Cliff and Adam (CLAD)"
"I've been in the weeb community for so long that I've actually witnessed the rise of the 'are traps gay' meme from basically the beginnings in 4chan...it actually warms my heart to see these deep dives into why the meme is edgy garbage nonsense from Contra and Pedantic. Plus, everyone knows that the 'are traps gey' memes are so early 2000 weeb nonsense and men of culture who can appreciate good girl dick are the rulers of today's weeb degeneracy...."
"I come for the commentary and stay for the lewks lol"
"I don't comment at all but I have to say I enjoy your work. It's quite entertaining and learns me up on some stuff I may not have much knowledge on."
"I'd date the fuck out of you."
"15:00, clearly someone has never been to Cincinnati because that is my entire reaction to finding out a friend dates someone from MOST of Ohio, rural Indiana, and ALL of Kentucky."
"I have a habit of calling people 'guy,' 'dude,' and 'man,' even to cis women. The only people I feel uncomfortable doing that with are trans women, since it feels awful close to being a chromosome crusading asshat, even though that's not the intent of the phrase. Is that a justified anxiety that I should continue to follow, or is it all cool my dude?"
"Here before a billion views"
"I'm a straight cis dude. I'm also a dirty commie leftist, so I've always considered myself an LGBTQ ally because I care about equal rights and marriage, and I've had trans friends that I've worried about in a largely hostile society. But there was so much I didn't know, didn't understand, and didn't know that I didn't understand about trans people. There were questions that I didn't know were even questions, and also questions that, in hindsight, I realize that I probably didn't want to think about because they were outside of my comfort zone.  I've learned more about trans people in the two days since discovering your channel than in a lifetime of supposedly being an ally. I feel like what I've learned from you will actually make me a better person, and that's something that I honestly can't say has ever happened on youtube. So thank you for doing this, and I hope you keep it up.  PS: your production values are incredible, and I think you are the most consistently funny essayist I watch"
"Did you buy a literal gong for that 2 second bit LMAO"
"Holy crap I am dumb, I had only encountered the term used to categorize porn mangas where a twinkie guy is made to dress in women's clothing to have sex.  I made the dumbest assumption that the name was just a Japanese misspelling of trans (short for tranvestite in this context).  I mean, it is obviously a slur now that I consider the possibility for a second.  Ah, the glory of privilege I suppose, I can totally miss the bigotry right in front of me."

"5:12 uh... to be fair, Count Dankula was convicted for hate crime - but the hate crime was making a video of his girlfriend's dog doing the nazi salute, which he had taught the dog behind her back. It was supposedly meant to be funny. Make of that what you will, but i don't think calling him a hate crime convict is completely fair, while it is technically correct.  disclaimer - i'm not a right winger"

"Vaginas smell bad"
"Me (a bi) and my bi nb friend were laughing at a stand up routine with the word 'faggot' in it and our straight cis dude boss came up and started unpromptedly ranting about how he should be allowed to say 'faggot' because 'he likes traps and that makes him at least a little gay' That's the moment I realized that people who aren't affected by slurs should not be allowed to dictate whether or not it's appropriate to use said slur"
"I like how you point out how it's not the 'deception' factor that puts trans women at risk but cishet guy's fear of being perceived as gay. I think this trap dilemma also involves anxiety about sexual partners. It's still freaking ridiculous. If anyone is having casual sex, the chances that their partner in the act would have a secret or unknown trait is very likely.  If a guy complains, 'Aaahh I slept with a trap!' it's his fault for being a horny mofo.  If you're gonna have preferences, be keen about it."
"See I was gonna watch this video but because there's anime in it, I'm not so sure anymore."

"This made me feel better. Thanks Contra."
"Oh come on, you know you think count dankula is funny."
"So I'm a fan of both you and Count Dankula. I think it's unfair to bring up the conviction, given how much of a horrific rights violation that whole thing was. I also think he agrees with you more than you might guess, but hey, what do I know?"

"As a man dating a trans woman, I can't help but think just how fucking low a bar other men are setting that I'm basically the 'ideal' that Nat talks about in the video.

Per Nat's advice here though, I'll treat her extra specially :) She deserves it for being the best gf I could ever hope to have."

"Thank you so much Natalie! You really helped me feel more confident in my understanding of gender and sexuality! I'm 16 years old, the first time I learned about gender being a social construct (about 13/14 from a teacher) I was like 'huh, yeah makes sense.' and since then I feel that I identify much more as gender ambiguous though I use she and her pronouns for the convince of those around me. I've never been able to fully shake the definition of gender and sexuality and feel confident that it doesn't matter to me, thus meaning I was never as understanding as I wanted to be of anyone else who identified as anything else other than their birth gender. Your thorough explanation of the fragility of the definitions society has given both gender and sexual orientation helped me to be able to not only find myself valid but everyone else as well. Thank you, now I can stop feeling like I'm a hypocrite monster for yelling at un-empathetic homophobes while still being super confused and just to righteous to admit it. I know you probably won't read this since as of currently there's 1,940 comments waiting to be read but I feel really relieved and grateful."

"So I'm a cis lesbian (with potentially a very /very/ slight attraction to men. But hey aren't we all a little straight?) and one of those people who by day tries to do their best to respect and understand transgendered people but by night will admit to herself that she's still a bit confused and has doubts and honestly would be quite anxious about some aspects of dating a transwoman. It's not something I'd like to admit but for the sake of self improvement you have to confess to yourself that it's there. I just wanted to say that you have helped me so much in realising this and becoming more open minded and understanding of people with a different experience to my own. I appreciate immensely the raw honesty and the effort you put into these videos and really respect you for your bravery.   The message you've given to cis hetero men at the end of the video is definitely one that I can apply to myself. In fact I think it's one that can apply to a lot of people. We could all do better to stand up for trans-people."

"There is a different between gender and sex... and homoSEXual would mean fucking of the same sex, so...."
"'Are (is liking) Traps gay?'  A little, if we're talking about the original context of the phrase (which isn't the use this video is addressing, so this is a digression). The term is an anime trope rather than some accurate representation of some gender niche. The few deeply regrettable animes I've watched that have featured 'traps' have had characters that identified as male and their 'appeal' hinged upon then presenting as female while still being men. I think there's a destinction there. If I'm only attracted to a person because they present as a woman but are in fact (in both self-identity and their physical bodies) men... well you're at the very least blurring a line. I'd almost compare it to people that seek out 'shemale' porn, if part of the thrill is in what gentalia someone has then that's different than just being accepting of their bodies - they've turned physical-maleness (as well as their actual identity, in the case of weird animes) into part of a kink.  The meme is shitty though, and gets applied to actual trans people (or characters). There's nothing 'gay' about being attracted to people without regard to their birth biology. But if you're attracted to someone that lives as the same sex but just looks a bit like the opposite sex... and that's the reason you're attracted... again, not exactly 'straight'. But who cares? Be attracted to whatever you want. As Contra sort of said, being attracted to someone that falls outside of what you consider your sexuality doesn't suddenly commit you to reworking your identity."
"I had a very intense conversation with an √ºber driver a couple of months ago. Long story short, I was saying that no one can become gay, because that is part of your nature and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with environment, your parents being a same sex couple or your school talking about sexuality. We argued about books that no one could prove even exist, and then he started telling me his experiences with ‚Äúhomosexuality‚Äù and steroids. He and all the other users he knew eventually experienced some level of attraction towards men, to the point that there would be constant fighting and stigmatization even though everyone was hitting on their bro. One men had to move out of town because a video of him sucking a dick was shown in the big screen of a bar and the driver almost killed his brother during a fight about him being ‚Äúgay‚Äù. He told me about how the constant testosterone high turned him into a psycho horn dog wanting to kill and have sex almost everyone. To this day I‚Äôm still filled with doubts about what the heck was going on there, but it was pretty clear is that he accumulated hatred towards gay people because of his negative past experiences, and today he has some twisted view on how sexuality works."

"This video is awesome.  Marvelous mouthfeel. 10/10"
"Can we pause for a second on the man who found out he might be gay, so he decided to beat the guy to death. Like, trans or not, you beat a human to death, the trial ends here"
"Thank you for expanding my mind with your art."
"Finally, someone tells me about the damn mouthfeel! Seriously, though, I'm always glad when I see one of your videos, so thank you."
"Some men are so weird...like really weird... they have to straight up kill a woman because she has a d**k 'cause they can't be gay? Why not? What's so wrong about being gay, I mean by logic if you accidentally f**k a man that doesn't make you gay, it makes you bisexual, what's wrong with being bisexual? There are 2 situations from my point of view and neither bother me, one, I like Natalie, would date her, that would make me by definition a lesbian or rather a bisexual as I usually like men, that don't bother me in the least, two, if I'm going out with a guy and I found he doesn't have the right equipment I won't be bothered, at least not  gotta-kill-you-now bothered. A good anime example is Integra Hellsing whom I thought was a guy until proven otherwise, still my favourite character. So what is the problem men?"
"Im honestly so glad you talk openly about trans sex. We need more openness about sex in general, but yeah thank"
"Keep up the good work ContraPoints. YouTube needs you!"
"Another fantastic video!"
"You're my absolute idol, ContraPoints. I love your videos!"
"I checked out 13 minutes in because your schtick is getting old and can't hold my attention for 45 minutes so I'm just gonna go on thinking traps are gay, which is okay because I'm not a homophobe."

"The whole TwoFace makeup is really messing with my eyeballs!"
"Love you, Natalie. Thank you for tackling these harmful stereotypes. But maybe think about striking 'either gender' from your scripts in the future? I am a bisexual of no gender."
"This probably isn't the piece of this video you expected that many people to fixate on, but can I just say, as someone who has felt zero dysphoria about her genitals, it actually really does mean a lot to see someone come forward and say so confidently that a woman with a penis is still a woman? I dunno, maybe I'll feel different about my body whenever I properly leave the closet, guns blazing, rather than 'this is my name and pronouns in private company' but as it stands now, in a bizarre way that's probably the only thing I haven't felt dysphoria over, and it's also been a huge red flag in my mind about 'not being real' because of it, so a very upfront 'Women with penises are still women' on such a large platform was... Really comforting to hear. Great vid in general. Title had me worried, but I love the respect you brought to this risky discussion. Keep up the good work."

"Natalie! Nice to meet you!"
"I drop everything for your beautiful voice and intelligent banter."
"Natalie, you had me whooping aloud and clapping. It feels like you leave no stone unturned here as points bleed into other points which raise points about the points you already made and lead to new points and arguments (gosh, it's almost like your channel should be called ContraPoints or something‚Äî but I'm just spit-balling here). I've been craving a new video upload from this channel, and this eloquent and masterful piece did not disappoint. Thanks for serving tea today.  ü¶á ‚òï"
"I lowkey had a somewhat close-minded view of trans people back when I was still an angsty teen, but since finding your channel, and seeing you transition through the years, I've shifted my entire perspective (regarding both trans issues and everything else to do with gender/race/sexuality). Shit, I think it even awakened my pansexuality."
"You look good :)"
"Might not agree on every point but ille be damed if the visuals amezing keep it upp"
"I always exit full screen a few minutes into a Contra video to hit that like"
"you are beautiful hun"
"your characters are amazing omg"
"Good video, Natalie. But I'm gonna bring up a fear I've mentioned before: The whole 'sacred passage' thing wasn't just invented as a stigma around 'real vaginas' to exclude trans women. It was a hard-won title to get straight men to STOP treating our fuckholes as unholy and cursed. Because as you pointed out, A LOT OF STRAIGHT DUDES ARE STILL VERY FREAKED OUT BY MENSTRUATION.  And I want trans women to be successful in all their romantic adventures. And I appreciate how conforming to straight men ideals of femininity is necessary for that to happen. BUT! If not approached delicately, trans women are going to create a situation where neckbeards are decrying cis women as 'not woman enough' compared to trans women. Because a woman who doth not bleed is already their unrealistic fantasy, and now you're giving them an excuse to act like it's not unrealistic.  Again. Love who you love. End the murder of sex workers. Maybe just tone it down with the throwing shade at cis women. We've made some mistakes, but criticizing TERFs  can way too easily turn misogynistic in and of itself. At the end of the day, we're still more your allies than straight guys ever will be. And if you let straight men think they can have a work-around to having sex with women, while not needing to be accepting of our blood and other feminine bodily functions, you're not being an ally to US."
"I've always thought of traps and trans people as two different types. I always considered that a trans woman was someone that mentally and physically wanted to be a woman completely. While a trap, is a person who wants to feel like a woman, but keep that part of the body for their own reason.. I don't know exactly how to explain it... but in the category of porn, chicks with dicks. I don't mean to offend anyone or mislabeled anyone by any means, I just always thought of them as two different types of people. I am biologically a female, but say that I wanted to be a female that happens to have a penis because I have my own reasons, or maybe it's more sexually appealing? Ehhh.. I don't know.."
"Short answer: no Long answer: a little bit"
"love you alot"
"Aside from the brilliant substance of your videos, I really do enjoy going back and looking through all the background details. That's A E S T H E T I C baby."
"Great video, I love the nuanced perspective that you give. Just wanted to say that as a straight cis man I actually felt the opposite to the 'being gay is bad' , I at one point felt ashamed for being straight. Firstly in a kind of white guilt senses, I felt terrified to show attraction to women as I thought it was somehow chauvinistic and that being a straight male was a damaging force. I also felt boring and wanted to be proud to be part of a community. I think it also came from a similar place that I felt annoyed that I didn't feel comfortable to experiment with my sexuality, in the way that a lot of straight women do my age do"
"Yay! A new video. I hope some of the men who play the 'is it gay?' game watch this. So much of what you discuss here is self-evident to us homos, but straight guys fret nonetheless.  You just want to grab them by the shoulders and scream, 'IT'S NOT GAY EVEN IF THE BALLS TOUCH!'"
"Brilliant British pronunciation of Ackbar, very good accent work!"
"9:55 Why shouldn't it be lead by a white woman? I do think that phrasing it as 'We're getting murdered' while having an unspecific group and one that you may not fit into as 'we' is pretty dumb, but the mere discussion of it doesn't seem wrong to me. Anything can be discussed by anyone free of prejudice is how I view it. But, well, that also leads me to the fact that I'm quite situationally insensitive with regards to other people's feelings and I often don't care about 'offending' them and I don't think it's in my duty to not offend anyone, unless not doing it aids me in achieving something I want (getting into a social group, for example, so I am often offensive and careless when dealing with people that don't matter much to me, often online, which is something you can honestly be disgusted by and I won't blame you for. Won't stop me from doing it though, since YouTube comments have an expiration date)"
"YOURE MAKEUP IS SO ON POINT! YASSS! FIERCE!"
"In my many years of unhealthy experience on 4chan before the nazi memes started getting unironic, the correct use of the word trap refers to a crossdressing dude by definition 'cause it's funnier on omegle. Trans women just don't make strangers feel quite as gay for jerking off to them, and the correct answer to the question 'are traps gay' has always been 'shut up fag'"
"I never thought about how rich in truffle notes dick taste was until now"
"I have a hypothesis for why some men are so oddly obsessed with policing their own sexuality and that of other men rather than just condoning the philosophy of 'if it feels good, do it!'  There's a certain practical, economic logic to the policing of sexual roles in certain circumstances.  For example, let's say that you live in a bronze-age tribe that is constantly at risk of being conquered and enslaved.  In that circumstance, you want the men of your tribe to be devoting their undivided attention and economic resources to those who will bear children for them and their tribe, so that your Spartan tribe may enlarge the ranks of its soldiers and farmers in the next generation.  So the message goes out:  'All hands on deck!  We don't care if you don't care for cumming in fertile vaginas.  That's what you are going to do, for the perpetuation of the tribe!'  And note:  in a lot of pre-modern societies, infertile women (and men) often faced a lot of stigma and weren't really seen as being 'real' women or men at all for that exact reason:  those genders roles were socially-constructed (because of the perceived economic imperative) such that you weren't a 'real' man or woman until you birthed a new generation (and adoption didn't count as the same!)  I think what has happened is, some men still have this mentality subconsciously, partly out of cultural inertia (preserved by certain religious authorities, no doubt!), and partly because, if you notice, the same men who want to police male sexuality also tend to be the same men who worry that 'Western Civilization' or the 'White Race' aren't having enough babies.  So it's the same damn thing still going on!  But whereas their response might have made a certain amount of sense in a context of bare survival and possible enslavement, now in the modern world of automation, luxury, and if anything, overpopulation, it has no practical benefit at all, and we really can afford to finally 'do whatever feels good.'  It's one of the achievements of modern civilization that we can climb out of that Hobbesian rat race and dispense with its associated sexual policing!"
"Another cishet dude here to say this video was amazing. I love how blunt and straightforward you are with realities you experience. I've certainly been attracted to transwomen and I've had a couple of gay experiences in my life but...honestly vagina's too enticing. The mouthfeel you described isn't repulsive by any means but, I'm just too big of a fan."

"I had to pause a few mins in to say I appreciate that you started such a sensitive video with an introduction to the topic as yourself <3 I know this is not the normal procedure in your work; but it adds a lot of sincerity that is hopefully appreciated by anyone who might find the mere discussion of the topic to be too much.  Back to the video~"
"I've recently become a fan. Initially I was one of those super 'free thinkers' that were fans of Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. Mainly because of the stable structure and support I got from Jordan advice to young men, since a lot of my growing up journey involved chaos and crazy acid trips that just made the process a lot more confusing so being told things that seem right and logical was reassuring.   But after then I came across your channel, which at first I passed off as some SJW bullshit. However I stayed for the aesthetic visuals and I'm sure glad I did. It sure opened me up to whole new way of thinking and made me realize how stupid I was for thinking I had understood reality and mostly importantly myself. After I watched your video 'why I quit academia' it really made me think and reevaluate why I was so into philosophy in the first place. I guess i felt that some truth and guidance was given to me by reading Nietzsche and Satre, and when you're a teen in high school it means everything to you. As I now I am just a few months from graduating high school, I'm thankful that I found this channel and was introduced to these kind of ideas and concepts. I feel like these video really have helped me prepare in way for the real world, or at least a better understanding that I shouldn't label myself to just one side because ideas can change and it's always good to be open minded of other people.  Anyway, I'm glad I stayed I stayed for the aesthetics and would like to thank you for making these video and for simply existing. I know how tough just plainly being a human is, so opening yourself to the world being the kind of person you are is what I find to be true courge.  Hope to see more amazing long and well put together videos like these. You always look flawless in all your video btw"
"Imagine being so homophobic you live in mortal fear of being gay."
"are you ever gonna stop getting prettier and sexier and smarter ? as usual the video is great, perfectly shows the contradictory nature of the concept of virility/manhood and clariffies a lot of things about trans people and gender - was expecting a comment or a joke on old man Tiresias - now i'll go back planning how me, my flatmate and his girlfriend can get a date with the most gorgeous lobster queen of the internet"
"Thank you, I learned a lot from this."
"I mean, to be fair, it was upon finding out that I was attracted to you, where I realized that there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman as far as my sexuality goes. So it may be you."
"Your eye shadow is beautiful."
"Love the Ben Shapiro cameos! üòÇ"
"Great vid!  The thing that also annoys me about this topic is that traps, as in those characters in anime, are actual traps. They are characters whose purpose is to be a goof or a way to fool the protagonist and the viewer, for laughs or sexual embarrassment/repression. It's really cheap, dumb and just ends up being hurtful to people who are more insecure about their sexuality. But it also led to this video being made, so I guess it's a good thing? Anyway, love your work, and love the sexy two-face look.  Batman villains but youtubers is the next big trend"

"Your videos are always so incredible, each one is honestly a masterpiece!  This one, in particular, is now making me think A LOT about how lesbians fall into the same thinking as straight men when it comes to trans women. I feel like there's so much to unpack there."
"This video was so badass, and I laughed so hard, but like, saying liking trans women makes men gay is very upsetting to me not just because it‚Äôs wrong and terrible, but also because I‚Äôm a very gay girl and I‚Äôm so attracted to you and literally every trans woman out there, so that would mean I was straight?? And I never want to go back to that hellhole. If I ever have the luck to have a trans woman like me, I will treat her like a goddess because that‚Äôs what y‚Äôall deserve."
"This is a complicated topic that challenges many norms of gender, sexuality and society. I'm a straight dude who found your videos, you've opened my eyes to the trans community. Illustrating a modern movement and enabling me to change my views and more deeply understand it as a whole. This video contains many points of interest that can't be fully absorbed in one viewing. needless to say i'll watch it a few more times to better formulate my opinions. Thank you ContraPoints, also I don't jerk it to traps but i do see it around a lot."
"Dot"
"Thank you for making such a thought provoking video and addressing how trans women of color are being murdered at extremely high numbers. I wasn‚Äôt aware of how high the number was before.

"I'll just wait for Olly's thirsty comment"
"Harshness towards all men is deserved?!  Yes, because apparently the entire gender of men is one hive mind that all thinks that way.  Apparently now suddenly isn‚Äôt sexist to pigeon hole an entire gender who knew?  And I hope you know with that statement, with the very terms you defined in this video, you are including trans men in that statement, making the statement kinda transmanphobic as well."
"great video !!!... first time I hear that term used in that way but ..very informative !!! thanks"
"Ah Natalie I love your content so much. I love the personality you put into your art, I love your visual taste, I love your opinions and your pragmatic style of making a point. And on a more personal note, I've been going through some difficult sexuality stuff that sometimes makes me feel like nobody is in the same situation. Even though I'm not trans, your content has lightened some of that burden and made me feel a little less alone. Love from me to you :)"
"Too much. Can't handle. Send help."
"Before I watch the video I will say this. Traps, to me, are not usually trans. They are, well, to go with the AMVs, 'Dude who look like a lady'. In Anime it seems like the bulk of the 'Traps' are men who so happen look like a woman (or someone who has feminine features). Baka and Test has a character who is a 'trap'. He just looks feminine. The show goes to length to recognize him as something different from men or women, but it is still the joke of his character. Deidara in Naruto, also counts, I guess. A recent anime, Zombie Land Sage, has a trans character.  The first pokes fun at the idea, in a relatively safe way. The next doesn't address it at all, the character is just drawn as such, they aren't intended to fill the role of 'trap'. While the last doesn't make the character a joke. It address them as a transwoman, and ends with the affirmation that, they are in fact a woman, not a man.  This doesn't have really anything to do with the actually video. I'm not disagreeing with anything in it. I'm sure I'll agree with Natalie. Just throwing in my two cents about the anime sliver, that will exist in the video."

"Hi Natalie. Tbh I feel like you've really prioritized a transitioned transgender body and won't go out of your way to defend pre-transitioned transgender people. I really wish you'd address pre-transitioned trans people (especially those who don't have access to hormones) with more empathy -- even your pre-transitioned body. You criticize philosophy for being overly impractical but you should consider how your videos and your own obsession with your -- privileged compared to other trans people's -- body effects others. I'm not trying to be #offended, as you seem to want to accuse your transgender defectors of. I just want you to reevaluate."
"To me, it doesn't even matter if it's gay or not because it's fine either way. I mean I understand the issue, but people should feel comfortable with people they are genuinely attracted to. Defining it one way or another just detracts from the love. Love you!"
"FINALLY I can breathe again. <3"
"Disappointed about the absence of Adria Finley."
"Although this was a great video, I HIGHLY recommend that everyone (esp anime fans) also watch ThePedanticRomantic's video on this topic. It's linked in the description, and it covers some important territory that Contra doesn't go into. I was previously in the ''trap' is okay if it is only used to mean 'anime male crossdressers'' camp, but TPR's video persuaded me that even this limited use of the term is ill-advised."
"I like the idea of Lenora LaVey (did I spell that right?) being the regular 'host' for videos from now on. Can we keep her?!"

Even as edgy teenagers you'd get a lot of looks if you called someone a f*****( well expect in cases when you'd use it with gay friends who'd almost sort of reclaimed it) From what I've seen though there hasn't been a comparable shift in view when it comes to trans people. Lot of the 'Are traps gay?' 'jokes' back when the meme was popular which peak edge me would also indulge in and a lot of 'I don't mind gay people but... followed by bigotry about trans people. I feel a lot of teenage boys especially feel it to be an attack on their perceived view on masculinity they've grown up with and are supposedly should follow while they transition (if you will) into adults, as they deal with hormones and other teenager shit, which certainly doesnt help there situation."

"The kind of man with deep-set sexual issues described in this video--the shitty type who will beat you up once he finds out about your girldick--is also a man who will get disowned by his mother and beat up by his uncle for dating a trans woman. He's not going to be helped by a 44 minute video that wants to, as you say, 'shame' him for his fucked up sexuality.   I'm not excusing these men. They're directly responsible for some of the shittiest things done to trans people out there. But I don't want to excuse you either. The target audience of this video isn't men with fucked up sexuality, it's the progressives deriding them and the 'le dark internet intellectuals' who attempt to intellectualize their behavior. The former don't need you to convince them, and the latter aren't going to be convinced. This video isn't a 'contra'point, it's unempathetic circlejerking.  Sorry for being harsh. I'm subscribed to you and adore you (and I'm going to get shit on by your fans for saying this). But I feel like your 'Incel' video did what you were trying to achieve with this video far better."

"I have no connection to the trans community except for my boyfriend (FtM) but this was pretty great, lookin forward to more"

"Contra, I love your videos and I do adore you. Hell, you are on my top list of 3 people on youtube I would drop everything to meet on saying hello (I would say date but I know that would be too much as a joke saying that). But I am already doing an awful, awful thing by only watching the first 4 - 5 minutes of the video and pausing it. Just stop watching it. I kept thinking that you were going to point out right away that traps =/= transwomen. Because it really is. Traps is just an English term version of the Japanese phrase saying 'otoko no ko' which many people from that culture and even some have pointed out if a character is trans then they are trans. I say this as most crossdressing male characters are usually my favourite characters. It's just that people saying how they are transwomen is a nerv ending annoyance that I constantly want to remind and say to everyone that TRAPS =/= TRANS. Forgive me on using caps.   Like I said, I only watched the beginning of the video as reading the definition and said made me annoyed. I wish it didn't but it did. I'm not gonna stop watching your videos or say how awful you are. Just not exactly happy on the video. But if someone comments about if you do say this later in the video and how I was overreacting then yeah. I was pretty wrong. But I so desperately wish I could watch this whole video as it's a hug pet peeve in the beginning. Plus, the term was from a different culture so we are we to judge if we aren't from that culture and not hear from their point of view. Again, if I am wrong and overreacting of you soon saying that the term trap didn't even have the definition of transwomen then I'd be happy to say I was wrong.   Someday I'll /try really hard/ to finish the video but just...not now...."
"This video is a fucking masterpiece, and it made me realize how hurtful I must have been to the people in my life, even without intending to be. I think that that is the single greatest quality of this channel's content, that it uses an emotional appeal, but backs it up with facts, and that tone is instrumental in supplying much-needed shifts in perspective. I used to be a huge fan of TF00t and Milo and all the other members of the anti-feminist/GG cabal, but over the last few years of my life, I have undergone a complete change of heart. This channel, as well as hbomberguy and a few others, have helped me to see the flimsy reasoning and outright fallacy which underpin the alt-right worldview. In short, you saved me from becoming an asshole, and that means a lot."
"One thing in reference to anime is those traps identify as male. I think that's why they're considered 'traps', because they appear, act and sound like women but openly identify as men. Basically anime 'traps' are cross dressers, so I guess audiences should use this word instead. I really don't agree with using this term for trans women though, they appear, act, sound AND identify as women. There is no trap, she's a woman."

"Contra with a vagina...mmmmm."
"I'm gay, and no! I have a pretty broad scope of attraction, and none of it includes women, cis or trans, nor does it include crossdressers. I feel like I know what I'm talking about, considering the whole fact that I know that I'm gay is _because_ I know what I'm attracted to in a way that's too strong and clear to deny. Trans men, on the other hand..."
"As a trans person myself I think the word trap is our word"
"Lost basically all respect and lost any interest after your unnecessary dig at Count Dankula."
"Traps CAN be gay. Being attracted to a trans woman or a crossdresser who passes as female and who you perceive as female is not gay. Being attracted to a trans woman who doesn‚Äôt pass but who you perceive as female is still not gay. Being attracted to a trans woman or crossdresser who does not pass and who you don‚Äôt percieve as female is gay. Being attracted to a crossdresser who passes as female but who you know is male is gay.... basically, your perception of their gender matters more than what they actually are. Also 100% trans women are women and traps are crossdressing men and these two are only linked in their feminine attributes."

"holy shit she had the word trap in her name the whole time"
"Natalie...you fucking pop! üòç"
"I do always like your videos and appreciate your points which I usually agree with, but I feel your simple characterization of Count Dankula as a hate crime convict belies the controversy around his conviction- a conclusion which most people (that I have seen) deemed to be unjust. While of course the statement that he is a hate crime convict isn't false, to an unaware viewer that characterization could be interpreted and extrapolated to mean something more assuredly vile and without controversy."

It makes me scared for him, Straight men are very scary."
"So is the term ''trap'' bad or not? I see people identify as one but probably just ignorance."
"I'm so happy you made this video and finally talked about girl dick. It really targeted that lingering bigotry i didn't know i had, and furthers the conversation about sexuality and identity."

"it's been years ago when i was still a high school girl that i realize 'trap meme'' is actually bad. What make me change my mind is just simple, i got to know a trans woman and it wasn't her who change my mind directly, telling me calling trans people trap is bad (the identity thing was not popular that time either) but the fact that not being seen as a woman as she should be is really hurt. She told me  about her experience living in the closet, people were not accepting her as a woman and how she tried her best to be woman, and how that what she want the most, that's her dream. That was heart breaking to me, and well, when we get to know someone, we start seeing them as a real human being with feeling and as friend, we don't want our friend to get hurt. That moment, i just realized the message of 'trap meme', it basically said no matter what you did, how feminine looking you are, we will still see you as men which is a slap to my friend's dream and hope. So to me, simple as that, i don't want people to get hurt, cis people has a whole genre of inspiration movie in hollywood about how they were bullied for their dream and proved their dream are valid. Well, people can change their dream but my friend's identity does not!  I can't thank you enough for making this video, really.  Btw you looked stunning in that ombre silky hair, seriously, and that make up (i still think you look the best without make up) , you are prettier each video. I mean, i wasn't sure i'm into chick before watching your video, why can't people just understand that not every human is attracted to genital."

"Count Dankula isn't bad. His conviction is stupid, he wanted to annoy his girlfriend by teaching her pug to lift up his paw, like a nazi salute. The whole reason he thought it was funny was because it IS terrible, stupid and would rightfully annoy his girlfriend. Being convicted for something so stupid is ridiculous. He's just a normal Scottish boy."

"4 second answer to Are Traps Gay: Its gay if you as a male are attracted to her while having solely male characteristics. As a cismale I'm not straight because im attracted to the holy love tunnel that is the vagina. I'm attracted to tits, large butt-to-waist ratios, and cute noses. Though I specifically want to fuck people with holes not poles the presence of a pole can't retroactively make me gay."

Mangina rocks.   On a side note, I'm aware of how we homosexuals take cover of most of what people understand about queerness and the LGBT for good and bad, and I'm so sorry that violence towards trans people comes from a fear of homosexuality and a complete misunderstanding of what being trans really means."

"I have a question but I'm not sure how to ask it in a way that won't come across the wrong way: is she directing her arguments at any men who romantically and/or sexually prefer biological women, or just men who are so insecure about their sexuality that they are paranoid about doing anything that might be considered gay?"
"MOM"
"I allways felt that 'traps' meaning cd¬¥s, trans woman and others were 'a bit gay' like on a percantage scale, some more than others. And i felt that was a good thing, because, let¬¥s be honest, straight men need a lot more gay in their lifes. And i don¬¥t mean 'gay' in a binary self- identifying way (wich i wholeheartedly support), but in some (maybe imaginary) other sense of the word, as one end of a spectrum. So nobody is a 100% straight and nobody is a 100% gay, because everybody has other preferences than going through their lifes only thinking about vaginas and boobs or only dicks.  Buuut... your video gave me a bunch to think about, maybe i should go down on some girl-dick and think about the meaning of life.... or about mouthfeel....oooooohhh...the mouthfeel"
"A bit of feedback (which you may or may not agree with): At points during this video, you refer to 'men' as if they were a collective whole. I'm not entirely sure that I am ok with this. In short:  ¬†‚Ä¢ Its Alienating:  If you state that 'men' think a certain thing, and a man is watching, and doesn't think that thing, it makes the rest of the things that you say carry less credibility. Since for said man, the things you just claimed are untrue to them.  ¬†‚Ä¢ Its Kinda Derogatory:  At the end of the video you state that you want to shame men for x,y, and z. But if someone who identifies as a man is watching, and that man thinks that men who do those things are knobheads, its not a stretch to imagine why that man may assume that you are calling him a knobhead. This also circles back around to the alienation thing. *  ¬†‚Ä¢ Victim Card:  You are quite literally handing people who don't like you (or your ideologies) a victim card.     *As a slight aside, at 40mins into the video, how many of the men who believe/do those things do you think are still watching? Obviously its impossible for me to substantiate that, so hopefully I am wrong on that matter, but I'm not optimistic."
"Yes, they are gay."

"I think the biggest problem with this argument is your lack of understanding on anime. These characters who are labeled in the West as ‚Äútraps‚Äù outright tell people that they are men, and consider themselves to be men, but their appearances make people believe that they are a woman at first because of their beauty. It‚Äôs a very popular character trope. Anybody who labels people other than that as ‚Äútraps‚Äù like you‚Äôve shown, is either misinformed (as a lot of people who casually watch anime and cycle these memes are), or are just straight assholes. So for this one I say blame it on the people who flanderize the term but maybe not the term itself"
"Thank you, this video was AMAZING and worth the wait! *clinks champagne glass and toasts to 2019 with contrapoints*"
"You repeat a claim I often hear: trans people are murdered at a higher rate than average. How do you know this? What is your source? Just doing some napkin math, if 29 trans people were murdered last year, that means the homicide rate for them would be around 1 per 100,000 (assuming 1% of the population is trans). Now, the national homicide rate for the general population in 2017 was 5.3 per 100,000. According to that math, that means the average person has a homicide rate 5 times higher than trans people."
"So glad I'm a transbian and get to ignore the cismale opinions of sex."

"35:30 I gotta say, even though the red is coming from the light, you look great as a redhead."
"Amazing and well executed video as always. However of all the many well made points you made over this long video there are 2 things I think you should have included. 1. The stigma of general sexwork in the US and the laws around it. I understand you brought up some stories about trans sex workers but didn't go deep into the topics of the general dangers of independent sex work and the legality of it. I know it was to point out the dangers of fragile masculinity but it would've been good to give some background on those initial dangers.  2. Men who date for the purpose of starting a family.  Yes it's lame and yes it's traditional and not really a 2019 thing. But I know so many men that want to get into relationships only to pass down their own genetics. I find this is very prominent in the incel community, where they feel it is a duty as humans to pass down their genetics rather than just getting their dick wet.  This is also quite common in the male homosexual community, when a man feels that his sexuality is getting in the way of his instinct of starting a family.   Maybe these have or can be covered in other videos and maybe you were pointing out things purely from your own experience. However, I believe these are quite important and should be looked at.   OR maybe these were pointed out and I missed them because of my dyslexia.   ALSO, if you think I'm misunderstanding anything I'm spitting out onto this comment, please educate me on the matter. I'm very open minded. :)  P.s. my english sucks. #biracialissues"

"To me, this this whole argument around ‚Äòtraps‚Äô unintentionally cements the idea that our whole labeling system of ‚Äògay‚Äô, ‚Äòstraight‚Äô, ‚Äòbi‚Äô, and etcetera is just sectarian arbitrationism without any basis in rigid or rational definition. Our culture‚Äôs litany of literally millions of fetishes, preferences, and sexual idiosyncrasies clearly puts us all on a spectrum of sexuality rather than into any system of delineated categorizies (like, how can I love being dominated by women while in good consciousness still put myself in the same category as macho pound-me-till-I-cry ‚Äòalpha‚Äô frat bros?)  Look, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to realize our current model of sexuality is just a holdover from our binary-loving, Jesus-watches-you-while-you-masturbate past of social and religious indoctrination. And I‚Äôm not saying that using popular labels should be looked down upon - hell, I‚Äôll keep calling myself straight because that‚Äôs just easier than monologuing philosophy to everyone I wanna bang - but I think a gradual shift away from these strict categories, at least in the way you visualize these things, will lead to better lives and sexual experiences for everyone. Or we could all just start calling ourselves pan, cus, aren‚Äôt we all really just attracted to whatever the hell we‚Äôre attracted to?"

"Love the video as always.   I want to say something regarding bisexuals as pretty safe to date in early transition, because they are more chill with body stuff. And while I completely understand the point here, I want to clarify (as a bi cis woman) that I'm not attracted to trans people because I'm bi.   Im met with this response often when talking about trans women as women, that it's only because I also like men that I can be attracted to trans women, or that it's because I don't care about gender or sex at all.   And that's fucking bull.   I am attracted to trans women /as/ women, not because I'm just 'attracted to any body or anybody' but because they are women.  Just like a lesbian would or a straight man would (obviously sexual orientation and gender often plays into how you're attracted to people but that's not important in this context) or vice versa with straight women and gay men.   I hate that both the hypothetical trans people I could be with are reduced to being 'others' that only a certain type of person can be attracted to, and that my sexuality is being simplified into this nonchalant 'whatever I'll take anything' category that does no justice to me or my sexual partners.   It's a nuanced topic about sexual orientation and attraction that I'm just jotting down in the middle of the night and there are aspects I can't cover in a youtube comment (like for example, yes I am probably more likely than a cishet person to not freak out about what genital attraction means for my whole identity because I'm kind of by default not tied up in the normative understanding of sexual and gender orientations and relationships) but I do hope I made my point.   English is my second language so sorry in advance for any mistakes"
"Hey, I know you probably won't see this comment but the progressive liberal who was superficially woke until their child came out as trans is a really relatable experience for me. My mum was extremely supportive of trans people when they just existed as a theoretical other or a person at work. But when I came out as a woman, she became very critical. Basically kept asking if I was doing it out of a kink and saying things like 'you know, wearing dresses doesn't make you a woman' or 'are you going to Montreal in drag?' It's very easy to support people you don't have to deal with every day. It's very easy to support someone when doing so means words instead of actions."
"I know it was only a brief comment, but I just wanna thank you for mentioning the masculine clitoris. I've never heard someone call it that before (even other trans guys seem to prefer to call it their dick, which is fine, but it's never really felt right to me) so it was nice to hear the phrase.

I had heard that this was hurtful to trans women, but I did it anyway because I was insensitive and ignorant. I wish I had seen a video like this years ago, so I would have known why it was wrong before I even started. Now I try to make art that includes healthy, thoughtful representations of trans people.

"Ok, as a straight white man this video cleared up so much for me. I was woefully ignorant of what a transperson is and what it means for them to be trans sexually or what it means for a person to have sex with a trasperson. I really can not put into words how much this was able to shift the broken and wrong framework in my mind I had in place. I could not get something to click in my head that when a transperson say they are a girl and that she is 100% a girl no matter what genitals she has. If I'm being very rude please tell me how I can better talk on this subject. Like I said I am still pretty ignorant with a good deal of how to approach this other than 'just treat her like a woman' and the extremely valuable information I obtained from this video."
"I find that getting rid of fragile heterosexuality could address a lot of this. If your sexual self image is a barrier to respecting LGBTQ+ people, just get over it.

As an artist and educator, I commend you for your honesty, thoughtfulness, frankness and, of course, for your fantastic wit when explaining specific topics.  When issues arise in my college courses (my students started talking about incels the other day) - I direct them to your videos.  You've taught me a great deal about current, personal ideologies and you've managed to 'correct' a few of my students who, frankly, had no friggin idea what they were talking about....So, thank you."
"I know this video was intended for mostly cishet guys. But as a lesbian your videos have really changed my views on dating trans women. I've always been respectful of pronouns and 'woke'.  However personally I was unwilling to date a trans woman. Through your videos and seeing you transition. I realized how wrong I was. I was obviously attracted to trans women because they are women and many trans women are insanely beautiful. I just felt like if I told people they would doubt my sexuality. Being worried about how others would perceive me was ridiculous and I have since changed my views. Thank you! Your videos have really opened my eyes to the realities of trans women."
"thank you so much for making this video. i'm a cis lesbian currently in a relationship with a trans girl, and when (usually straight) people find out that she's trans they immediately come for my sexuality; 'are you bi now? are you straight? you're definitely not a lesbian.' i always give them the same sort of spiel- she is on female hormones, so i perceive her as female, so she IS female and the penis is just another female part of her. to any outsider we are just a cis lesbian couple, but once she gets clocked then we're suddenly straight. perception is a huge factor.  anyways, it's pretty lame. my explanation tends to help open straight people's minds a bit, but i do wish i could force them all to watch this video... we need to get them talking about the mouthfeel! nobody ever wants to discuss mouthfeel!!"

"Holy shit, thank you for this."
"I'm always excited when your next project is just around the corner, and this was well worth the wait. You put so much thought into your points, and your quality of editing makes it clear that you're serious and should be taken seriously. Your 'meeting them where they are' approach is something I think more on the left should aspire to. We win nothing if people feel attacked or demeaned and click 'Don't show me more from ContraPoints'."
"I've always viewed the joke 'Are traps gay?' as something that is inherently anti-homophobic/transphobic, because the only men who will joke about such things are men who are confident in their sexuality and do not feel threatened by those who are of a different sexuality. Obviously I was somewhat wrong as you showed the alt-right joke about it but I still think my thinking holds true for the majority of people. Among those I know  who've said it in my personal life,  it's not meant as an insult against trans people but rather those who are transphobic. It's very similar to, say, Blazing Saddles where the movie makes a ton of racist jokes, but it's all carefully done so that you are laughing at the racists, not with them. Thus, when someone says 'Are traps gay?' they are making fun of the absurdity of some guy worrying about his manliness when attracted to a transwoman."
"The big 'NO' on the fan.  Classic."
"thanks for the interesting video! hopefully this is read as a good faith q: what if u decide to stop wearing all the makeup one day? (it seems like a lot of daily effort!) wouldnt that be ‚Äútrapping‚Äù someone in a sense? cis women who wear appearance altering makeup would have the same problem, albeit their identities arent at stake so much as aesthetic. ugh def dont want o come across as ‚Äúmakeup is lying‚Äù or anything. just some thoughts spurred by the middle part of this video."

I've always sort of feared being open about my attractions out of fear of being labeled a 'chaser', but I have for a while now been drawn to trans-women who pass decently but no perfectly.  I've been with many cis-women and a couple of cis-dudes but I've always had a low-key thing for trans-women.  I'm not ashamed of this fact wish I could be more open about it with my friends of all genders."

"I'm sorry, but the argument leading the fourth section ('Four') is just completely idiotic.  You're arguing completely futile points.  Someone being trans*gender* isn't relevant to someone being hetero*sexual*; their sex has not changed.  The reality is that 'straight' or 'gay' is simply a false binary and leaves us unequipped to properly describe the taxonomy, but instead of developing more sophisticated language, people are just trying to pretend the tools we've already been using are still fine.  When people say 'gay', they mean 'homosexual', and so a heterosexual man having sex with a male-to-female transperson is 'gay'.  A heterosexual man may find someone attractive with their clothes on and may even enjoy flirting with them or making out with them.  That doesn't mean they'd enjoy having sex with them, and there's nothing wrong with that.  People can be attracted to any number of things aesthetically (which is really what we're talking about before it gets to sex), and they can have a different set of attractions for sex.  You generally have to meet both for someone to want to have sex with you, and that's completely normal and fine.  You aren't entitled to sex because you checked half the boxes.  This is some incel-tier reasoning.  Edit:  Still haven't finished the video, but you provide an example of a heterosexual guy only having sex with cis women, having sex with you, then going back to only cis women, and ask (paraphrasing) 'In what world is that anything other than straight?', my response to which is basically above, but I want to make sure the response is direct:  stop trying to describe these situations with language from a binary you're trying to dismantle.  The guy is attracted to both cis and trans women is what you showed.  That isn't the same as being attracted to only cis women.  What would you say if a cis/het guy who's always had sex with cis women had sex with a trans man?  Is your view on this really so narrow as to be regulated by whether or not they perceive the trans person as passing?  You can be attracted to a huge spectrum of things in terms of sex, some of which depends on anatomy.  It can be completely detached from what people expect that to correlate with for gender (or not).  You're just fueling senseless pigeon-holing instead of actually progressing the discussion.  Being attracted to someone feminine is different than being attracted to someone masculine.  Wanting to play with dicks in bed is different than wanting to play with vaginas in bed.  They are decoupled.  Edit 2:  You finally got to it.  '[...]but isn't male homosexuality usually understood as attraction to men and not merely penises[...]'.  No, it isn't.  At all.  I've never met a gay man who wasn't attracted to penises, and I've never met a straight man that wasn't attracted to vaginas.  I've never even heard anyone posit anything contrary.  You live in a different reality.  Edit 3:  You further go on to talk about 'the feminine penis' (which I'm familiar with from other videos of yours), but the presence of a penis at all isn't the issue so much as the lack of a vagina.  Your taxonomy of groups 1/2/3 speaks on this.  Assuming most heterosexual men fall into group 1 (I would be incredibly surprised if anything else was true), then that basically regulates the situation to them giving you anal or you giving them head (or manual, I guess), which is... exactly the set up of cis gay men but with fewer options.  Edit 4:  Continuing to misrepresent views in the 'Being Straight Is Pretty Gay' segment.  The common understanding of heterosexuality is *not* sex between two people of the same gender, as you claim.  It's sex between two people of the same sex.  As soon as you acknowledge that, why some people might call a girl pegging a guy gay becomes clear:  in that scenario, a guy is having his ass fucked by a (prosthetic) dick.  If you've read the rest of my comment up to this point, though, then you can probably guess that calling this 'gay' is just another case of pigeonholing in my book.  Sounds to me like the guy in this scenario wants a feminine person with a dick.  To pretend this is the same as a guy wanting a feminine person with a vagina or a a masculine person with a dick just further harms the discussion.  To place this beside the other example (a guy having his nipples played with) just does even more harm.  That's a pretty transparent case of someone just being really insecure with their sexuality (and probably super fucking boring in bed).  Like whatever you like.  Trying to redefine or expand the definition of a term like 'gay', the overwhelming usage of which exists for an entirely cisgender community, just hurts your ability to get cis people to understand and accept you.  You're fighting the wrong battle.  Being a trans woman isn't the same as being a cis woman.  It's this very nature that gets people to not use the term 'woman' for you in the first place.  The overwhelming majority of people have never even knowingly encountered a trans person.  When you tell them that words they've used their entire life mean something other than what they have used them to mean for literally years, you're just begging to get a cold shoulder.  Stop trying to reappropriate language and instead be a leader for establishing new language to talk about these undeniably distinct concepts."
"I like you and Dankula!"
"As the multi-color acid-trip of sexuality becomes more understood and accepted, I think that categorizing lover-combinations (gay? straight?) might be de-emphasized in favor of focusing on the individual identity of each lover.  With so many genders, sexual orientations, and romantic alignments to hail from, keeping the combinations straight (no pun intended) would become not worth the hassle.  Relationships would be two or more individuals in love (and/or fucking), and any labeling or identifying would be focused more on the individual participants.  Thoughts?"

Please understand we are NOT all homophobic, transphobic people who sit around debating whether ‚ÄúAre traps gay?‚Äù  I think a lot of the anime community is actually very left-leaning and progressive.  Some of us are trans ourselves.  Some of us are gay.  I think the meme originated in the anime community just because there is a HUGE amount of homosexual and transsexual portrayal in anime ‚Äî which is NOT always negative.  Literally every season there is an avalanche of manga and anime that is yaoi (boys love, aimed at straight women), yuri (girls love, aimed at straight men), bara (men‚Äôs love aimed at homosexual men), etc.  And yaoi / yuri shows in particular have been getting extremely popular.  Some of it is good, some of it is admittedly awful, and some of it is ignorant or stupid but not malicious.  The visibility of it gets attention.   I think the fact that trans characters appear in SO many seasonal anime just invites attention and a few bad apples.  But please don‚Äôt think that we, as an entire anime/otaku community hate trans people.  Because I think that is definitely not true."

You even could have used Richard Spencer, an actually terrible, actually racist person, as opposed to a shitposter who made an edgy joke *at the expense of* nazis, and was found guilty by a judge who seems to not understand the basic principles of comedy, a la, taking a subject (a cute dog) and inverting the expectations about it (make it something disgusting, like a nazi.)  This seems like a really shallow and uninformed insult to be coming from this channel, and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not disappointed."
"I prefer your content Contrapoints and think you could do amazing things but I am 'Here's your shekels' 'Thanks Israel.' and Contrapoints, the Count of Dankula is not racist like at all. He prefaced his video with that. I actually prefer All Transwomen over the Women in my Area as would-be romantic partners. I love Transwomen. If Traps are Gay then I'm as LGBTQueer as a $3 Bill. I miss you Contra, yes you can talk about it. Nothing matters. You're not a idealistic sophist utopian (utopian = No Such Place in Philology while Eutopia is Perfect Place) like Immanuel Kant and Keep Karl Marx away from Factories and he's a Golden God! Karl Marx's Conflict Theory is Wonderbar. My Sociology Professors all called me Young Marx and my Philosophy Professors called me Young Nietzsche. Google Zenarchism my Muse who is keeping me from taking my Clandestine Government Beretta M9 on my right and my Colt 1911 on my left from Boondock Saint'ing myself who if anything happened to you, I would issue a State Mandate and then avenge you on a level never seen before. WHO THE FUCK AM I KIDDING, I'M DRUNK AS ALL HELL and I ACTUALLY GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU. SO MANY FUCKS. #ToxicMasculinity Fuck It. Anyway, I have two globally sold paperback novels sold worldwide as a science fiction series of 'Revolution of Consciousness' with the first book being 'Indigo Sky Revolution of Consciousness' series and my collection of poetry that is 'The Good News of Music and Other Poems' which Contra. I could have said these few words about how I feel about Traps and Transwomen being: 'I don't care, I love it!!!'"
"I feel so ashamed of myself while watching Contra videos sometimes. While she's breaking down serious shit with acerbic wit and lazer guided logic bombs I drift off into thoughts of 'f*ck, how can one person pull off a production of this scale?'."

"Can we just appreciate Pterosaurs and how underrated and awesome they are?  'We've done the maths. Recreating an Age of Reptiles is more than 30% pterosaur, 30% more, in fact, than the entire collected works of Austen, Dickens, and Shakespeare. And their work is really good without pterosaurs. Imagine Hamlet with Quetzalcoatlus. Holy crap, that's an awesome idea right there. But Recreating an Age of Reptiles already has Pterosaurs. It's 30% pterosaurs. So it's already got the edge on 'Hamlet + Pterosaurs', which we agreed was great. So Recreating an Age of Reptiles is, therefore, statistically one of the best bits of literature, ever.'

"When you have a detector in your pants that reliably points at attractive women this video seems like a rather long answer to a rather stupid question, but I am certainly not complaining.

"OMG GIIIIIRL, that hair gives me life 2:42"
"But is watching a video that asks 'are traps gay' gay?"
"This was a really good video, and honestly inspiring."
"Let's just talk about the fact that the question 'are traps gay?' Is looking at it from the assumption that being gay is a negative. This whole conversation is coming from a place of prejudice."
"All well and good but what about being a queer girl dating a trans girl being accused of being secretly straight ? there was a brief mention of TERFs but you cant be a terf when youre not a feminist so this is an issue outside of comment by TERFs."

"Wow! 4 HEAD!"
"I don't know why, but I always imagine watching your videos from the perspective of so many people I know who don't really ponder much about this stuff and passively absorb all the cultural norms they, mostly middle class american white ppl, are exposed to. And it's like, they're good people, and they're smart and educated and all that jazz. I always think of how persuasive and seductive your videos are and how radically you can change their views in, like, less than an hour, because they would be receptive. But all the actual attempts I've made to share you with them in my two years of watching you haven't really worked out. Idk that makes me sad. So I've been keeping you to myself because separate from your moves to expand your audience, you've built a great rapport with your core audience with all the in-jokes you allude to. Hopefully some of these ppl will have the gall to google 'are traps gay' and this video shows up and they watch the entire thing and maybe appreciate you like I do. Maybe they have to become a lil bit more online first, who knows. But it's really without question that your vids are powerful as well as informative. Anyway, enough rambling, thank u and such :)"

Shemale, tranny and variations. My best friend is a trans gay guy, and we are terrified that he will get killed in the streets by a random lunatic. And with the president we have this is even more possible. A good subject for a video would be Bolsonaro, Brazil's president. There are a lot of Brazilian youtubers and American journalists that can be of use to you :) even if not for a video, he is definitely an interesting phenomenon"

"Oh jeez, not the 'we can't directly sensorily perceive chromosomes, therefore there's no such thing as monosexuality' thing again. That's a logical fallacy and I expected better from you, Natalie.  Just because something is not directly the object of sense perception, doesn't mean it can't be intuited, perceived, or responded to authentically, including in the context of sexuality. Additionally, it is not the chromosomes that matter, but the person's entire sex, which is not just about superficial appearance but is a property of the organism that people can be attuned to. There is an irreducible being to every type of thing, and cognizing beings (humans and many other animals) are often attuned to the truth and reality of the things around them, not merely slaves to appearances. This is not even getting into the fact that even the most cis-passing trans women is still detectable, even sensorily, as a trans woman.  Consider the fact that I am only attracted to Pakistani women (don't ask why: I neither have an explanation nor am I obligated to provide one). There isn't even a chromosome of Pakistaniness, and yet, somehow, my attraction tracks, with complete accuracy, the nationality and ethnicity of such individuals. It tracks it even in the absence of my surface mind having the knowledge of the person's nationality and ethnicity. Similarly, I'm attracted to women and not trans women (and no I don't consider trans women to be women. If anyone wants to have a fit about that, I ask that they do it somewhere else because I'm not interested and I'm not going to bother responding), even when my surface mind doesn't know who is what. E.g. I once saw a cis-passing trans woman who was conventionally attractive, assumed she was a cis woman, yet felt no attraction whatsoever. I even wondered why I didn't feel attraction and started to question if I still had a sexuality. I then found out she was a trans woman and immediately understood why I wasn't attracted. This is just one example that illustrates how it is the reality of what people are, and not merely their superficial appearance, that influences our attitudes and responses of various kinds toward them, including attraction.  People are also often only attracted to people of a certain age group (e.g. around the same age as themselves), almost always non-attracted to members of their own family, some trans people are only attracted to other trans people, some gay people are only attracted to other gay people, etc. There is no chromosomal/genetic difference between people of different age groups, and so on, except in the case of family membership. Yet I assume you recognize all these as facts about people's sexualities and even orientations in some cases, and in the case of incest-aversion your argument about how you can't smell chromosomes so it can't matter also applies, so you ought to hold that people are simply lying when they say they're not attracted to family members. Or, maybe, just maybe, people's attraction can be influenced by things other than superficial appearance??"

"It is a bit off the ‚Äútrans women topic‚Äù, but kind of related to the trap thingy: I reckon it is interesting why straight men often fear losing their self-identity if they sleep with a ‚Äúguy‚Äù. Notice that most straight women are not very attracted to openly bisexual men (even if it is just behavioural). However, I think most women would be surprised how many straight guys have occasional sex with men... they just keep it secret (ask bottoms who are specefically into straight trade... pretty much almost every bottom)"

"YAY, New Contra video!"
"You're true. I'm a gay man and I would sex with men-with-vagina rather than women-with-penis."
"Wow. This is a masterpiece, I kinda feel sorry for its length because I want soooo many people to watch it and I'm afraid many of them will be scared by a 45 minutes video, but every single fuckin' second is worth. Wow, wow, wow.  Also I was thinking about it today (because yeah I spent these last 3 days watching 31 videos of yours), after watching another video of yours talking about the feminine penis (it was the first time I stumbled on the concept). It's just that I thought about it, and, well, I am a cis gay guy and I'm attracted to d***s more than I would be willing to admit in a public comment... and yet I really don't feel like doing anything with a penis on a female body. Because you know, that's a female. I wouldn't be attracted, I wouldn't be comfortable. D***s do not exist outside a context. And then I thought, what about female to male people? And yeah I already knew that obviously I can be attracted to them (they're men in all respects that matter for being viscerally attracted).   But then I realized for the first time that yeah, if I were to have sex with a person who is ftM and whom I am attracted to, I would feel like exploring our bodies and his 'masculine vagina' aswell (provided that he wants, of course). I kinda feel dumb and embarassed for this useless and pretty personal comment, but it's that I just really internalized it - that the body and its expression is what matters for physical attraction, and that genitals' role in this is secundary and interchangeable.  Thank you  PS: Sorry for the mistakes I might have made, I am italian."

"On the topic of sexuality being more about how we perceive other people's presentation, I remember once I saw what I thought was a beautiful tomboy girl with short hair but it turned out to be a trans dude. At first I felt sort of bad because I accidentally misgendered him amd then I thought fuck I thought I liked a dude. I'm a lesbian but that little moment of thinking I liked a girl who's actually a boy didn't make me str8"

"'White middle class trans women don't get murdered in this country' is EXTREMELY irresponsible for you to say. You can make the point that trans women of color experience disproportionate levels of violence without ERASING violence against white trans people. This is absolutely gross, Natalie. And dangerous. You just told countless trans women who watch your videos to let their guard down because it 'wont happen to them'. The next time a white, middle class trans woman is murdered, I hope you feel that your rhetoric, and the rhetoric of people who agree with your statements - is stained in blood. Because it will be."

"I'm really curious about the use of lighting in this video. Was the (normal) yellow light used as some sort of signifier of truth or unhiddeness, or was it used in relation to straightness. I'll have to watch it again at some point and try to figure out which, cause clearly there was something going on between the usual queerly coloured light and the daylight-like light that appeared and reappeared in this video"
"Should I be watching a contra video at 3am? probably not.  Will I do just that? Absolutely!"

"WE'RE FINALLY TALKING ABOUT THE MOUTHFEEL"
"I've identified as gay for a long time because of my dick fetish. This video has been enlightening. Though I think I still straddle the line between straight and bi, (mostly because I'm not adverse to having homoerotic experiences with bros like jacking off together or frotting), but also because generally I prefer femboys, (or men who preform feminine but identify as men), over trans women mostly because the former intends to keep their penis where the latter may not. I think I'm in what you would consider group 3, (though I'm adverse to taking anything up my ass, I'm just interested in cock worship using my mouth). Though basically in all other respects I'm straight."
"Natalie. I love you so much, you have no idea. Another amazing video. The wait is always worth it. There's so many people I need to show this too.  You've just made my night!"
"PLEASE BLINK AT LEAST ONCE"
"I get petrified being around men. I am so scared of one finding out I'm trans. I don't want someone to hurt me just because I was born this way. If some men don't want to date trans women, fine. But, at least let them live and be happy. Don't be so insecure and childish."
"Holy cow, that was one of the best things I ever saw. As a cis straight men I never had to ask any of the questions answered in this video, I am just so glad hat content creators like you exist to frame these topics in a honest, empirical and frankly entertaining way, otherwise who knows what false truths I could be believing. Thank you so much for your work."
"20:15 SIS! You cracked the code with this one. The language you use sums that nefarious shit up perfectly! Thanks for being the best tran you can be by looking out for us with your contrarian points <3"
"Another beautiful video - this time about a not so pressing issue in our cultural mileau. FWW, as a young gay man I had to confront the converse of this question. Many years ago, I had a partner who decided to transition. This created the question of is a gay man dating a trans woman straight? I thought about it, but didn't arrive at an answer I cared about. My partner decided that continuing to date me (a gay man) was not straight - so, she left. The labels we use, gay/straight/bi, etc. only have value if they serve a descriptive function; once they become prescriptive they become prisons which regulate our behaviors. It seems human being are naturally taxonomic - needing to name and classify everything - much to our detriment."
"GODBLESSSSS i was just telling people about 'Traps' Don't Exist And Here's Why from  ThePedanticRomantic like 2 days ago and you come out with this wow i love you"

"I think it's incredibly nice of you to try to make these unintelligent men understand why being called a trap is fucking wrong but to what end? 80% of the case these men won't care that you're completely right cause they already have it settled in their heads that trans women are not women. Trying to educate ignorant people is a very hard job that we shouldn't have to do"
"All these self-imposed rules about gender and sexuality is why i don't date :)"
"My last big, serious (now ex) girlfriend is trans. Loved her to bits. This video really got me thinking about the mouthfeel.   More importantly, it made me think about how I needed to stand up to a bigoted uncle of mine who kept making snide, passive-aggressive comments in her direction when she wasn't around.   Don't be like me, people. Don't be cowardly."
"So... I‚Äôm a cishet guy... and I‚Äôve never been with a trans woman and I‚Äôm kinda guilty of being that guy who is outwardly woke but in the dark of night had less than woke impulses about what being with Trans women would be like and what implications it would have for my identity- while knowing intellectually what the right action and right beliefs would be re: gender and sexuality-  I‚Äôm very thankful for this video because my head is kinda swimming with a lot of different thoughts and impulses about gender right now but I‚Äôm pretty sure that once I‚Äôve worked through these arguments and the attendant emotions that go with them I‚Äôm gonna be a better human and I have Natalie to thank."
"This entire video is such a huge blessing for me. The statements you make, especially towards the end (not putting the cart before the horse in terms of sexual orientation), are a dialogue I have been wanting to put out there for so long. You managed to capture all of it and I'm so happy. Thank you for continuing to be one of the best channels on YouTube."
"That was incredible."
"The only sexy trap is the bear trap"
"I love that the answer is in the thumbnail."
"Yeees. Men should try getting pegged once in their life at least. Some straight men like getting pegged. And I get it. It's different, and they do get pleasure out of it, so why not try? Also, most men I have been with enjoy getting their nipples sucked. I do not. So that is supposedly gay. Though most guys enjoy it"
"Well... solving prejudices I didn‚Äôt even knew I had, feeling more comfortable with my own body insecurities, falling in love with Natalie‚Äôs gorgeous face and realizing I‚Äôm almost definitely not straight... Overall a productive day!"

If only people could understand these things. I don't get offended by many words, but TRAP is like the worse. This video and all of your videos make me feel generally better, and honestly make me feel better than anything else i watch here on youtube."

"@ContraPoints What would be your views on a transman calling himself a trap because he likes to dress up as a woman and 'pass' as a woman (or sometimes just wear 'girly' clothing [and cosplays Astolfo]) but would never call or think of a transwoman (or NB, gender fluid, genderqueer people) a trap? Like for myself I like identifying as a trap but I don't want to hurt any queer people by doing such, but I also don't really know what else i identify with.. it's confusing."
"'cishet men can't handle one fraction of what queer people go through all the time' is the take of the goddamn year thank you so much"
"Great video, as usual :) Cheers from Chile!"
"I remember my first boyfriend before I transitioned hadn't had a relationship before he left his wife of almost 10 years. He's definitely gay and had slept with men before, but he told me that having sex with me confused him because it was like having sex with a woman LOL. Both a breakup and the most touching words I'd ever heard."
"Thank you for existing"
"Fucking phenomenal. I can physically feel my brain expanding every time I watch your videos. You've really swayed me on the idea of 'girl dick'. <3"
"dammit, so many puns about 'triggering' have to be thrown away now."
"I haven't watched all of the video yet, but I have to say that the word 'trap' doesn't refer to a trans woman... It refers to someone who identifies as a man but dresses more feminine or flat out as a woman."
"we are finally talking about the feminine penis"
"also FWIW I'm proud you actually went through with this video with this title"
"as a queer but hetero male and non-trans-porn-consumer i m puzzled by the amount of 'step-sibling/step-parent' porn that i see being pushed on people even though it is just a title to evoke such fantasy in the consumer looking for it. but: where does the demand come from or is the demand being created? who promotes the breaking of the taboo of incest and why is this not being debated...

"A male fucking another male is heterosexual. Maybe it's not gay in all circumstances, but it is certainly heterosexual."

"ConTRAPpoints"
"If you fap to the fact that the person looks like a girl, that it's not gay. It's only gay if you continue fapping after you find out that there's a dick involved."
"So I'm posting this mostly due to my internet being bad and having to wait for the video to load so I'm sorry if it's not entirely on topic of the video. So I want to give my personal experience with the subject of straight men liking transwomen. So I'm a straight man in his early 20 who likes punkish girls and in the past dated girls who have been more masculine than me. I Recently meet a Trans girl (MTF) a few weeks ago and I really thought she was cute and fun to talk to. I didn't know she was trans untill she told me and... I didn't care at the time so I been kind of thinking about this kind of questions a lot, not are Traps gay but is it gay to like transwomen. What I've come up with in my whiskey and box wine month is, it's not gay to like a trans girl but you might want to think about your sexuality some. I consider myself straight but have been debating experimenting some due to serious thinking about this women, I've made out with dudes in the past but never went further than that. But having seriously thought about my sexuality I have questions and want to know what I am comfortable with, now I don't want to come off like Jake Paul I'm not trying to be gay for attention this is just some curiosity I have and I want to know if I may not be as straight as I thought. Another thing I came up with is, thinking someone is hot who look female and finding out they are not or were not born that way isn't gay. If I see a hot red head with big titties I think that's hot and because I'll probably never seen her naked for all I know she could have a dick, Schrodinger trans she both has and not have a dick till proven otherwise. Thinking a guy who dress in drag (a man who dress like a women not a transwomen) is hot and is not gay, wanting to fuck him or get fucked by him is a little. Tldr I don't think liking transwomen is gay. This idea started for me because one who is making me think about about heterosexuality and my sexuality, and I hope she likes my shitty puns and dad jokes and I need to get into shape really bad. Also love your videos Contrapoints I hope you notice my comment.  Update: made it to the end and a lot of the points I made were made in the video if done better and more fabulously."
"the COSTUMES"
"This was incredible. Some of my favorite parts of this video, and past videos, is really how open you are to candidly talking about sexual experiences. Especially Queer sexual experiences. It's just not something I hear about a lot and it's nice to get some uh...insider info about that xD I'm a sex-positive asexual so all of it is confusing and I want to know more, but don't want to have the experiences themselves, so it's super interesting to me."
"One thing i noticed in the anime community is, people are completely fine with a 'trap' characters being a girl and Convincing themselves they are a girl but the minute it's a trans person, they just deny they are trans and don't respect their gender. But the boy who dresses up as a girl, is a girl and thats completely fine but not the trans girl????? . Just something I wanted to point out. Cus why?"
"Con-TraP-oints...  I see what you did there."
"yanno I don't think I have the qualifications to say this because Im not cis, but as a lesbian.... I'm sorry about all the shitbag terfs"
"I feel that it's unfair to describe Count Dankula as a hate crime convict. Most, probably the vast majority of, Americans would NOT consider what he did worthy of being illegal. At least not in America."

I almost lost friends over that debate lmao, if you‚Äôre a man attracted to someone who looks like a woman you‚Äôre STRAIGHT it‚Äôs not based on biology OR identity fight me"
"I understand your argument but trap doesn't refer to trans women, at least in anime. Traps are always men who identify as male (again at least all the traps I've seen) that enjoy dressing and acting feminine. That's why the meme asks are traps gay? Because if you like a trap your really just into a feminine guy. Doesn't really have anything to do with trans women. Now traps outside of an anime context okay then I see your argument but since are traps gay is largely an anime meme most people probably agree it's not about trans women"

"It's amazing that you used Pedantic's video! I think I suggested it to you in one of your videos, or I might have just thought about suggesting it, I don't remember. Anyway, great video as always, my Goddess!"
"You and your videos are national treasures. <3"

"Natalie, I want to thank you for helping me understand so many aspects of the trans process and community. Your videos have helped me more than I could ever express."

"Has pressing PhD work to get done today. Oh look, new ContraPoints. *makes coffee, sits and watches immediately*."
"This is a great video (as always), but I've only ever seen trap be used in reference to men dressed as women (straight guys that like to dress and look female as a hobby), not trans women as often mentioned. Maybe I'm misinformed on the topic (straight white guy, etc.) but that's what I've heard"

"Wow you look gorgeous contra! And thanks for convincing me that trans people, are human too and deserve the same respect as everyone else! I was very close minded :/"
"1) Your makeup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3  2) I know it's an incredibly challenging topic already, but the dynamics of non-binary-ness--as an identity, and as a thing folks are attracted to--did not get REMOTELY enough airtime here.  It is core to this topic.  Like. . . really, really central.  3) But still, you know. . .You are gorgeous and amazing and thank you for making this shit."
"This upload just saved my week"
"You are beautiful and amazing!"
"Every video Natalie makes is so well thought out and brilliant, I'm shook every time :)))"
"Goddamn it I love this woman, best channel on YouTube! Im a straight cis man and I did not feel you were harsh toward me in the least. It's something some borderline homophobic men need to hear. I've been thinking for years that saying 'It's gay but it's ok to be gay' is the most subtly homophobic thing to say. If somebody likes spicy brown mustard on their grilled cheese nobody says 'Well it's not really a cheese sandwich but it's ok to eat something that's not a cheese sandwich.' They either say 'Aw hell yeah, mustard all the way!' or 'I like a plain old grilled cheese, no mustard for me, thanks.' Or, as a third option, 'Really? Hm, I've never had a grilled cheese with mustard, give me a little on the side so I can try it.'   ...Now I want a grilled cheese with some feminine penis on the side"
"don't forget to spay and neuter your kids"
"This has been a fun conversation and learning experience with my kids. Thank you hon so much. My son was shocked when he learned you had a penis. He thought because you are a women You WERE parted out like me. I may have left some gaps in the conversation with my explanations to him.  However You are covering them quiet well for me here. THANK YOU FOR THIS, More mothers need to sit down and watch you with their kids. So kids can see and understand things from the point of view of someone who lives your life."
"Ugh, anime..."
"Thanks for being so real. A lot of trans spaces are very one dimensional, 'all trans men/women are real men/women, all nonbinary identities are valid, and you should feel great about who you are inside'. Which of course is great, we all need validation and reassurance in this shithole world. But your ability to critically examine your experiences, and then share them with the world, is incredibly liberating, and at least for me gives me greater security. Just another reason you are the Lobster QUEEN, all hail"
"AHH YOU‚ÄôRE SO PRETTY"
"good video! i don't have much to say but i felt i should mention how much your content has helped me as a trans guy, because that's not something ive seen very many people say. the way you discuss trans issues generally is highly effective, and the focus on trans women's issues is necessary. i've been able to change or start to change a few people's minds because of strategies or ideas i learned about in your videos, and that is really comforting. often times, they can be used to defend my right to exist as a guy in a way i was completely incapable of doing before i started watching you. so thank you, and keep doing what you do. goodness knows the world needs more of it."
"Do you like women? Do you love anal but hate that not many women are into it? Do you hate periods? Do you hate how most women can't seem to understand the male mind? ...and you won't date a trans woman, because...? Haters are going to hate...you get out of bed, they are hating you already. Haters are too busy hating to enjoy life.  Fuck haters.  Enjoy life."

"When you're a kid you get taught that boys have penises and girls have vaginas. But when you grow up and become an adult you should probably think more critically and not just be like 'hurr penis equals gay haha gay is bad me man I have penis that makes me man'. Also as a person with weird  intersex chromosomal quirks I didn't even know existed until late in life I find this whole 'but chromosomes' thing really stupid too. I don't even consider myself trans, would they? Or am I the ultimate trap?"

"Woah I'd forgotten about Dankula. Dunno the guy but his hate crime accusations seemed pretty baseless to me. Tasteless? Sure. Unnecessary? Of course. Dumb? Absolutely, but not a hate crime."
"Woah you changed your profile picture looks good!"
"Plot twist: traps were pan all along."
"This is all very well and good but what about Life? I‚Äôm a 30-year-old gay man in a long-term relationship living in China but I started to have a shift in my desire away from just expressing sexuality, where ever that may have led me, towards forming a nuclear family. This argument tackles violence and the sexuality angle in a way that explores the nuances of the situation however have responded want to form a life of meaning and substance when we start this difficult path‚Äôs of atypical relationships. As a gay biological family aspect is of course ruled out pretty much from the get go but if I were heterosexual I think this would be my biggest concern. Anyway very much enjoy your videos although I don‚Äôt always agree with you on everything that still fabulously presented."

"So, while I know that I wasn't necessarily the target of this video, being a gay man and all, it still helped a lot. I've recently started seeing someone who identifies as bigender and as silly as it is, that kind of made me question my own identity. Hearing how you walked through every aspect of this issue really helped me come to terms with the fact that I'm some senses, the social construction of 'gay' isn't particularly useful and that I really shouldn't let this amazing person slip by just because of my own silly sense of cultivated identity."
"I learned a lot of stuff today. Thanks for the video."
"Queen~"
"Hey, bisexual guy here, but feeling really guilty about falling into the type one category of guys who wanna date trans girls. I feel like because I‚Äôm bi I should fall into type 2 but I just don‚Äôt and I feel really bad about it. I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve never been with anyone with a penis which makes the idea kinda scary and I think that makes it really hard for me to not associate penises with masculinity. And I feel like as a bi guy I should be at a better starting point for any potential trans girls I date and I‚Äôm just not and I feel like a shitty person. Any advice/support here?"
"Thank you."
"Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel"
"When I thought of traps I always thought of Hideyoshi Kinoshita of 'Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu'. Dude's a cis-male who other dudes push feminity upon. From his perspective he probably percieved male attraction to him as gay. The dudes that saw him had a heterosxual attraction to him. But, I see your point. I never used the term trap as part of my speech and I'll continue to not do so."

A lot of people in this situation are labeled chasers and other derogatory terms even if we don't fit that stereotype. I also know many cross dressers and trans women who use the term, so I don't think it's a word that should go away. If someone doesn't want me to call them a trap, I wouldn't. Plain and simple. People who yell at me saying that I should be sexually attracted to women as well, all I have to say is genital preference exists."
"Paris is Burning is great. Everyone should watch it."

"Hello Natalie, I'm new to your channel, it popped up in my suggested videos and I started watching you throughout this past week. Just wanted to tell you that you're doing a great job - you're intelligent and well read, you're funny and witty and you look absolutely beautiful. I first saw your video on Incels and loved that final reflection you did about your own insecurities as a trans woman. Having watched some of your older videos, it is clear that your transitioning is taking effect, each time I see a video of yours you're more and more feminine and sophisticated and funny, damn, even your makeup skills are better than mine! Anyways, just wanted to tell you how awesome I think you are, and what a breath of fresh air I received to have found you."
"Since you brought up anime, who's the best Eva girl?"

"not enough anime, dislike"
"You're actually such a star and a legend I love this so much thank you Natalie"
"I‚Äôm only 16 minutes in and I‚Äôm already blown away. I love how hard you‚Äôre going in on the topic. Thank you for making this <3"
"This might be my favorite video of yours so far, and I've watched almost all of them, and some of them multiple times. Loved it!"
"this video is so powerful whoa thanks natalie <3"
"I love you and you bring such a good voice to our community! üíñüíñ I love you and expect a new patreon once I get money because I'm really poor but the first thing I'll do is get a patreon just to support you!! üíñüíñ"

"Oh my gosh love the pedantic romantic shout out!"
"Yes, a new ContraPoints video!"
"Am I bad person for choosing not to date a trans person for the selfish desire to procreate?   Like I know I could adopt if I found a trans person who liked kids but it‚Äôs like even though I am leftist, I still hold socially antiquated cultural values."

"I'd just like to point out that Meechan (Count Dankula) was convicted under the 2003 Communications act for broadcasting obscene/grossly offensive material, and not any hate crime laws, so calling him a hate crime convict is false and (arguably) a bit misleading. Other than that, great video as always. I'm here to hear arguments and opinions that I might or might not agree with, but the aesthetic and language of your presentation always make it much more of pleasure than it already is. Thank you for uploading."
"Yyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy i love you i love you i love you i love you"
"Damn I thought traps are where you go to get drugs"
"So I'm a gay man and I dont know any gay men that have dated trans women. I once explained this to someone and they responded 'well then why do gay men like drag queens?' It was utterly shocking to me that these people have so little understanding of queers generally they think gay men are sexually turned on by drag shows."

"M O U T H F E E L Shirts. Seriously."
"I know this is not the intended message but I have a strong urge to hound alt rights on whether traps are gay and just have them debate that until the cows come home. I just want to listen to Jordan Peterson try to answer this for 45 minutes and use that to fall asleep every night."
"Let the fires begin."

"Nice way to cap off tonights contra binge. üòç"
"Okay... So. why don't transpeople just say they are trans. Like all the time. I know they wanna be 'real' women/men, but let's be honest. The only reason not to say you are trans, is because you want to hide it. Therein lies the deception. I don't wanna say aggression against trans people wouldn't exist if that were the case, because that's not true.  Why does the definition of 'women' need to change (bc as you said, in most minds that's how it is), if there is a perfectly good word that describes the situation perfectly. You probably don't wanna be with anyone who is not okay with trans people in general. So why not say it outright? It's not like hiding it will result in a better reaction later. It just doesn't make sense.   Let's do pascal's wager.                                                                   Telling them.                             Not telling them. If they are okay with sex with trans:  It's fine :)                                   It's fine, but you get anxious about it If they are not:                                       They leave. It's fine                 They might get angry and confused."
"So me personally I am attarcted to the idea of a girl with a penis but if a trans woman wouldnt want to engage in such things then I would respect her wishes and would not pressure her into doing anything she wouldn't want to. I would also respect if she wouldnt want to be with me because of my preference because I do recognize that that can be offputting but ultimately i cant control why or what I am attracted too"
"generally, (for people who arent assholes) the term 'trap' doesnt (and shouldnt) apply to trans people. it should only be used in the context of a male crossdresser who is specifically trying to make other people believe that they are a woman (when they dont identify as a woman)   people who use the term as a slur are assholes."

"Thank you for talking about this. I'm not trans, but I still have heard a lot about this. And I find it offensive that some men think trans women are 'traps' as if they were women just for them. Just to fool someone. Trans women are women. No matter if men feel attracted to them or not.  If men have a problem with their attraction to a trans woman, then they are insecure about their own sexuality. Which has nothing to do with trans women."

"People think about how they are attracted to others the wrong way because it's traditionally been intrinsically tied to gender. People are mostly attracted, not to men and woman, but to masculinity and femininity, which is a spectrum. 'Traps':  androgynous individuals, cross dressers and trans people aren't 'gay' because they're very much on the feminine side of the spectrum. (I obviously don't use this phrase and understand it's stupid)"

The way you present information isn‚Äôt only entertaining and engaging but genuinely balanced and I think I really need more of that. I was wondering, would you ever consider making a video on transphobia within the LGBTQ+ community? I‚Äôve chosen to do this as a research study at uni and I catch myself looking at statistics and thinking, hmm now how would contrapoints look at this? Much love x"

"Man am I glad i'm pan because that just makes everything so easy. I can be into ANYONE and never have to question my sexuality and as a result my identity.

"Thank you for helping me clear out some things in my head. As a cis gendered heterosexual male or 'cissy' I had always viewed myself as a true ally of the transgender community. However, you are right I would always say that it wasn't for me to date a trans gender person and within that same breath claim to believe that trans women were legitimately women. I believe that they still are and that the deficit lies somewhere within my own psyche. Thank you for opening my eyes up to this, I probably should've figured it out sooner but it's good either way. ‚ù§"

"I think calling Count Dankula a hate crime convict is a bit disingenuous. That definitely lost some points for me. :/ Like sure that might be technically true in the most technical, technical sense, but really...?"
"It's a trap. Okay that means that there is a fear of homosexuality in an accusation of a harm (deceiving) another. It's a homosexual? Well that depicts homophobia itself as someone who wasn't afraid of homosexuality would probably not even look twice at a completely normal homosexual.  So where did the homophobia come from?  I'll admit that when I see a homosexual or a discussion about it, I don't see this as perfectly normal(!) but this is because I'm aware that where there is homosexuality, abuse and violence usually follows. So I'm subconsciously wondering, where's the bat coming from? Who is going to be homobashing today? And there is always one insecure person in tow. You can usually identify them when they start nitpicking my use of words because it doesn't look as fabulous as they do.  Unravelling this also comes with bonus content dude. 'What if a man likes me but I don't like them back? Am I going to have to apologize for being homophobic if I reject them and tell them their dream cock awaits?'  That's the nice stuff anyway, the more serious questioning that makes you wonder just how bad life gets is coming from investigating the fear of homosexuality, and it isn't homosexuality itself that causes a problem so much as mate dominance. No-one minds homosexuals, they mind weakness, and more importantly their own weakness. If homosexuality is associated to a weak character, this repulses people who want to protect themselves by appearing strong. The sad truth is that the world encourages strength because strong people survive in nature.  Whilst it is truly not my job to handle these boys who go 'ew homostuff' and bully others, and even attempt to bite into me upon seeing this very part of my comment, I still have to. You don't usually want to have to police the world like that, but hard work is necessary. And in the absence of their stronger father, the spank comes from somewhere else."

"Thank you Contra, you couldn't have explained it better. I was at my university's art club when one of my upperclassman explained to my friends why it's offensive to call some anime characters 'traps' and how that is offensive to the trans community. I have to admit I use the word 'trap' many times before to describe male anime characters who appear very feminine, but after hearing what my upperclassman said I felt very ashamed and sorry. Of course I don't have the guts to call my friends out when they say the word 'trap' out of fear being called a triggered sjw, but I really appreciate your effort. Maybe one day they will stumble across this video and sit through it. Thank you for covering such a hard topic."
"I love you.   Just a note, Latinx is often considered offensive to Latinos, as in spanish it implies you‚Äôre ‚Äúex-Latin,‚Äù and lots of people have been forced to leave Latin America due to the military governments instated by the United States government, so being called Ex-Latinos is extremely hurtful.  Instead of Latinx, using Latino, Latine or Latini (really anything else) is preferred."

I thought you were a woman? Yuck!'. That was also TEN years ago and I rememeber that moment like it was last week. I'm still a cis-man though. No argument against unlearning this dangerous assumption though."

They were doing the vogue and other dances before Madona did it. The slang is mainstream now like they were saying shade about 35 years ago. Before you heard it on TV. Just a couple of examples.

"I didn't really know the actual relationship between trap and transwomen until like 6 months ago and with this I do feel wrong for saying trap, but I originally thought that traps were specifically gay men cross dressing to get sex. So In my use of the word it isn't in relation to transwomen but there is still the subtext and coding in it despite the context of its use. So I am rather kinda stuck because I find it funny, sometimes, within my context of them only being gay men, but I'm not nor wish to be perceived as transphobic."

"If I could pay you to do asmr I would in a heartbeat"
"Good for you for making this video. You made a great point about being a part of a conversation that is happening with or without you. That said, I have memed about this among my friends, who I believed to all be perfectly comfortable with transgender people. I've seen many trans women who are extremely attractive, and I'm not gay. So I jokingly tell my friends, 'I solved it. Traps aren't gay.' But it was then that I could tell that while many of them were tolerant of trans people, it was because it was never close to home for them. We don't know trans people. Not because we've avoided them. We simply haven't met any. When I announced that there are 'fine AF traps', some people got uncomfortable, so I've been leaning into it to challenge their discomfort by making temporary screen names like TrapsRFineAF, etc. I feel like it serves a dual purpose of being a dog whistle to identify dogs, and a meme to agree on the absurdity of transphobia. I do believe that humor happens when you put absurdity on display.  All this said, I'm only six minutes in. I'll continue watching. Perhaps, if it's your point to do so, I'll stop making the joke, if I find that it is more harmful than funny. I'll keep an open mind."
"Interesting what you pointed out about privilege. I have noticed a lot of bourgeois white techy people (not just trans!) saying how in danger they constantly feel .  I mean perhaps on a social level things may get uncomfortable for them from time to time but in all honesty you are right, the people you spoke of are the ones in most danger. I mean, the ladies who directed the matrix I highly doubt are getting murdered any time soon."

"The use of trap as a slur against trans people is appropriation of anime culture by normies. I won't stand for this."
"The existence of traps as a crossover description for anyone with a knob that looks like a girl regardless of gender identity self evidently exposes the limitations of the idea of 'gay', and brings us one step closer to a glorious graph based approach to expressing sexuality. An in between we could start using words that are more concerned with ÔΩÅÔΩÖÔΩìÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩâÔΩÉ than identity."

Could you please point out the fact that these people exist in some way? my soapbox is not as high as yours."

"It's not only men who view trans people this way: they're just more likely to lash out physically because men are generally more willing to get into physical confrontations and perpetrate physical violence than women. It's not the case that women don't ever view trans women's existence as 'a kind of trickery', e.g. consider the way some transphobic radical feminists talk about trans women. So, your focus on men in this way comes across as gender essentialist and prejudiced against men.  Also what you called 'trans panic' is also gay panic. Homophobia, not merely transphobia, is the issue, but you didn't name it at any point."

"I would say that while it's not as vastly high as for trans women of colour, the murder rate even for white trans women is still significantly higher than average, or other sections of the LGBT community. I don't think it's unreasonable to have a fear of violence at all - it does happen. Part of the issue is that acknowledging that when there's another group several more times likely AGAIN to be murdered, it's often mindblowing just comprehending that, and the degree to which PoC form an underclass in the US. i.e. it's not that you're not at risk of violence(though it is less than those boogie white T-girls might believe), it's that the rate for TWoC is so high.   There's also a reason why the likes of Blair White can get away with being Blair White and not fear for her life the minute her contemporaries turn on her. Also, the reason why the murder rate is so insanely high for trans women of colour has a lot to do with how institutional racism traditionally forces vulnerable & poor people of colour into the most vulnerable forms of sex work. Morgan Page's One From The Vaults podcast is super highly recommended and covered this to a degree esp. in terms of colonisation over-riding or erasing the roles of first nation two-spirit/'third gender' people.  In other words there's a strong overlap between whiteness and colonial gender roles(obviously) which is why Nazi McPunchedface hopes there won't be transsexuals in his ethnostate. We're seen part of the mechanism that attacks the Western World, while contradictingly being seen as an artifact of it vs. the global south, esp. the Muslim global South who obviously want to kill us, so you know, vote republican or at least Tulsi Gabbard(the Blair Whites of the world buy this). There's almost this unconscious cultural memory of the idea that other ethnic groups challenge our '2 GENDERS LOL' model of everything and that's why trans people are particularly targets of white surpemacists and their ilk(''''classical liberals'''') - it's at least partly colonial violence."

So here's my thing. 'Trap' to me, and everyone I know that is aware of the term, has never meant a trans person. To me a trap has always been a man that dresses not as a woman, but rather in an overly fem style. It's really never been linked to identity to me and is more of a subculture I guess?  I can see why people get upset by the word 'trap' though, people still say that gay people getting beaten for hitting on a straight person is fine, and I get that it's a part of that whole thing.  I think that anger should be directed at the 'sissy' community; the things those people do is pretty gross even to me and I have 12 tabs of NTR mindbreak fat ugly man trap  hentai open right now and forever.

It was penile dilation measurements from gays, straights and men who like transwomen.  Gays respond positively to men but not to women or transwomen. Straights don't respond to men but do respond to women  and transwomen. Men who like transwomen respond normally to normal women but more so to transwomen and not to men.  There it was, the answer, summarized neatly in one little bar graph. Traps aren't gay, just degenerate."

"I want a say...   I'm pan. Also, I think traps are a little gay because trans women are feminized men who present and act as women. While that makes them essentially women in many ways, there's still a subtle difference between a biological woman and a socially perceived and performative female. But here's the deal - that's okay! Most people are a little gay ...and I'm extremely stuck in the middle. I like andreogeny and several studies agree that the majority of people do too. Seriously... look it up. SO IT DOESNT MATTER IF TRAPS ARE GAY!  Andreogeny is present in all of the great grecoroman art to at least some extent (which is hilarious because people like the golden one aspire to BE living grecoroman art). Femininity is what men are usually attracted to, not necessarily women. That's why this question exists to some extent. It's so sad...  Also... yum anal... giving and receiving."

"the way i see it, liking traps is the equivalent to being an enlightened centrist - able to see and appreciate *bOtH sIdEs* , but obviously there are some features that are objectively better  I'll leave you guys to figure out what that is. in the meantime, how 'bout the idea of video games getting dick physics, eh? üòè"
"jfc you look AMAZING in this video!"
"Imagine being so straight you had to make an itemized list of what you can and can't do because it might make you gay."
"Yaay new ContraPoints! My favorite day of the month!"

"Best channel on YouTube."
"Nataly gets hotter every video it is simply unfair"
"i haven't watched the full video yet, so i have nothing constructive to say, but i feel the greatest urge to comment how stunning Natalie looks here"
"Did Natalie get that facial feminization surgery they have talked about? I feel like she looks different in this video."
"‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you getting T R I G G E R E D about? It‚Äôs not like referring to you, your body, your identity, and your way of life as inherently duplicitous and untrustworthy is offensive or anything!‚Äú"
"5:40 ‚Äú...the conversation that straight men have about us.‚Äù The absolute disgust on your face that manifested in the moment you spoke ‚Äúus‚Äù is the definition of the Sublime‚Ñ¢, and it‚Äôs been reserved by the Divine Feminine."

"-Best video yet brother."
"FINALLY"
"I don't know, I haven't been on 4chan in a while due to it going full Kekistan, but my personal opinion is that 'trap' is not an offensive term. Back in the day men used to dress as females at anime conventions, and there was nothing derisive about being a 'trap'. That's the way I remember it."

"I was on a PhilosophyTube/Lindsay Ellis binge watch when this uploaded. Thanks mommy."
"Hhhhmmmm......I wonder if I will have mix feelings for this one like I did for the Aesthetics video. I am preparing for that.  I think the best response to Contrapoints' Aesthetics video is Gwen_No_Fear's video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shJbSiplYZQ"
"Yaaaaasss Contra video!!  Edit: Yes, trans women are women. Literally, the fact that straight men like Trans women in their porn but won‚Äôt give them rights is honestly super indicative of existing as a woman at least in America."
"Never have I clicked so quickly. Thank you Mother."
"I love you girl!!"
"To the men who meme."
"My goddess how I missed you"
"I've been waiting for a video like this for ages! ü§© I am so frigging happy right now! üòÉ If I EVER meet you, I'm buying you an ice-cream! ^___^"

"I think this is the earliest I have ever been to a ContraPoints video and I'm still nearly 4k views late lmao"
"i do enjoy sadness and tea, thank you mrs. points. seriously though, these dumbass ‚Äúmemes‚Äù need to have more attention drawn to how harmful they are. there are a bunch of people i know that are actually kinda decent but don‚Äôt realize how damaging their bullshit is. i think they‚Äôd probably stop if they really knew what they were doing. thanks for this."

"popular anituber makes a video about traps, calls it satire: deffinetly gonna skip  contra makes a video about the same thing on the same day: OWO?!?"
"Our Dark Mother has *RETURNED* and I am so happy"
"yesss"
"I LOVE YOU"
"NEVER CLICKED FASTER ON A NOTIFICATION!"
"Oh my god Natalie your so cool"
"It'd be amazing if you could Collab in some way with John McLean, he's talked about femininity being perceived as a way of 'trapping' men before too üíï"
"You look SOOO beautiful omg"
"I learned a phrase called gynosexual which basically means you are attracted to femininity regardless of biological sex. So, no they arent also they arent the stereotype straight either."

"‚ÄúAre traps gay?‚Äù I don‚Äôt see how traps can be gay. Here‚Äôs the definition of the word trap: a device or enclosure designed to catch and retain animals, typically by allowing entry but not exit or by catching hold of a part of the body. So you see, a trap can‚Äôt have a sexuality thus makes you wrong...       Okey?"

"YES, I CAN'T BELIEVE A MEME IS UP FOR DEBATE BUT I LOVE ITüòÇüòÇüòÇ  Oh... Oh this video was way more serious than I thought it was gonna be in the beggining, I genuinely thought it was just gonna be about the anime crossdressing trend. Still a very interesting and informative video"

"Ooooooo. This is gonna be soo good"
"This ought to be interesting."
"EDUCATE ME OH DARK MOTHER!"
"45 minutes oh myyyy"
"We've come full circle!  I guess I'm that weird unicorn amongst (nominally) cis het men where it is the natural womanly equipment that I am very attracted to and I can't stand what I've got. I have a positive attitude towards menstruation (even though blood usually makes me nauseous in general), I am always happy to give without needing to recieve in terms of southward travels. And while I prefer a feminine shape and aesthetic, if you've got that down there all that matters before I'll be willing to give it good attention is whether or not you're a good person who likes me.  It's so funny that the titular T term came up in a discussion I had recently where someone was defending it as an anime term and I was like 'isn't it a transphobic slur tho?' So I laughed aloud when this vid randomly shows up in my notifications.  Nat, you're amazing. üíú"
