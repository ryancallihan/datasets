"That fact that schools are funded by property taxes rather than on a per-student basis is indefensible. This means there are massive disparities on the quality of education not only between students in the same city, but within each state and even between entire states. Bad funding leads to high teacher turnover, not enough funds for scholarships, not enough funds to pay for sports, etc. White suburban schools get access to all kinds of extra resources that continue to stack and fortify their advantages. The kids who need help the least get the most help because their districts can afford more teachers for smaller class sizes, can afford those academic and athletic scholarships, can afford more frequent field trips, can afford better facilities, etc. Not only are inner-city minority schools completely crushed by this system (and also dealing with the plague that is charter schools), white, mostly Republican rural schools are also disadvantaged by this system (often having to consolidate all K-12 students across an entire county into a single school with inadequate funding). All of this snowballs into getting attending college, getting better jobs, not falling into crime, eating better, the ability to afford medical care and prevention, ensuring their kids get those same advantages or even more, etc. This results in generational poverty and generational unearned privilege. The game is unbelievably unequal. And this is just the education angle."

"Isn't it kinda racist to treat people with dark skin as though they are void of any agency and  therefore shouldn't be expected to be responsible for their actions?  People with dark skin aren't a monolithic group they are all different people with different backgrounds just like EVERY OTHER HUMAN so how are they magically different because of something as arbitrary as the color of their skin?  You have to be half retarded to see individual humans in this way and full retarded to try and convince other humans of this asinine idea.   Oh and spouting off a list of shitty things that happened especially decades in the past is not an argument for uh, muh racism or whatever your trying to prove here.  You do realize all this is happening to this day all over the world to all types of people, luckily this is the USA where we actually have protections that's no one else in the world enjoys.

"Regarding the whole 'It is not my job to educate you' that is not leftist being a bitch or lazy to change the views of others. It's just that, after literal years of trying to explain yourself and why you deserve to be treated in a humane manner you get so dam  tired of the futility of it all. All that happens is a) they come with dumb counter arguments maintaining that all who is to blame is the victim themselves or b) You get told that you are being abusive and totalitarian and aren't allowing the insight of those with other opinions... And yea I'm not. Because there shouldn't be another 'opinion' on whether or not people should get treated humanely or not but I digress. The thing is it is rare to someone from a non-marginalised group come into a debate with the openness to change of heart and re-education. All that happens is incessant jabs at historical wounds masked as debate and any retaliation is leftists being 'dramatic'. And when you are POC it is much more infuriating because this has been your *entire* life, unlike people of the LGBT who often only have to deal with the stigma later on in life. Black people, even black children, have to constantly establish themselves as equals with their white counterparts. So yea, after a few years it's boring and seemingly redundant. Us minorities (POCs , LGBT etc) should inevitably be a bit stronger in faith but if we're not, it's not because we are cold or rude, it's just we are tired of playing the game 'Let's speak to brick walls and hope they'll listen'"

I individually have more money than my entire living family combined due to my hard work not some kind of white privilege. I earned my opportunities my white family didn't work for them.   Of course you think white privilege is real. This is because you have class privilege, never have known poverty, and happen to be white.

"In Brazil, 'the most advanced r.a.c.i.a.l d.e.m.o.c.r.a.c.y in the world', is worst. Black people living segregate in 'favelas' and the military police and now, in this current facist governement (thanks to the American intervention in the elections) the brazilian army shoot black people. A black musician and his family was backing to his house in his car, and the military forces shoot him with 80 762' riffle shoots.  And this is only one case. Brazil has a 'contempt of authorities low' - basically, one brazilian 'citzen' (in fact, brazilian 'subject') can not denounces abuses of autorithy, because he is arrested by 'contempt'.  Since the Brazilian army was called to guarantee 'law and order', the cases of summary executions carried out by them and the military police increases. But this is not the most terrifying.  There have been reports that the Brazilian army is detaining inhabtants of favelas and taking them to a military basis and arresting them in a red room where they are subjected to beatings, torture with electric shocks and are forced to eat paper sprayed with pepper spray.  Moreover it is not uncommon for police battles to enter prisons during rebellions by blazing fire summarily against all prisoners (see google on 'carandiru massacre').  In addition there are militias and death squads, made up of whites and time-out police who claim 'self-defense.' These people are implementing a regime of terror against the black people of Brazil, and the current fascist government wants to release the arms possession especially for them, who financed their campaign. And there are links between the president's family and the death row that murdered the councilwoman Marielle Franco.  There is also now a policy of compulsory hospitalization of crack users (mostly ... black people) who are taken to 'recovery houses' maintained by neo-Pentecostal churches that receive public money and laundered money where they are subjected to compulsory religious indoctrination , to slave labor and to electric shocks (the obsession of the Brazilian extreme right).  Meanwhile, white middle-class Brazilians who have a standard of living similar to southern European countries, celebrate with their yellow soccer t shirts while idolizing the image of 'captain lawfare,' the minister of justice who Intercept's website Glen Greenwald leaked that he openly manipulated legal proceedings against the former Labor Party president to make the current fascist win the election. 'Captain Lawfare' now has a bill to fully authorize the use of lethal force by military police if they are alleged to be 'under strong emotion.'  This is the portrait of Brazil, a 'Racial Democracy', land of soccer and caranaval.  As a brazilian rapper says: 'the human being is disposable in Brazil'."

I was with my black roommate and despite me being at the wheel in the car we smoked in, he was the one approached and searched. I knew that he would get fucked by the law if he were arrested so I took the blame. 2 years later I‚Äôve completed probation and paid all the fines and fees. It‚Äôs nearly impossible for me to get a job now. Companies like Rover, a dog waking service have denied me employment due to my record. Even Walmart where I worked previously, denied me based on my record. 4 apartment complexes denied me. I was so desperate I nearly turned to selling weed myself. Even had a hookup and everything before I was talked out of it. And I‚Äôm white. I can‚Äôt imagine the hell my roommate would‚Äôve gone through had I let him take the blame.

"Of course racism exists it will always exist. It's ridiculous to assume that racism can be completely wiped out and at the same Tim it's ridiculous to assume that america is still heavily racist. I agree that the effects of racism from years ago are still affecting communities today but I feel this is not a federal issue any more, the nation has given people of color equal opportunity and rights under law and there really isn't anymore you can do at the federal level at this point. This becomes a state issue where it is up to the state to help black neighborhoods. This is not a national issue anymore and more of state issue as their are some states where segregation and police stops aren't as racist as Baltimore. You focused on Baltimore and act like it shows America's racist nature but if you look at Chicago's racial dot map now it is no where near as segregated. You showed the redline map yeah and I compared it to Chicagos current racial dot map and it is actually in incredibly diverse in the areas where more white people should live according to the red line map. But this racial dot map that I look at includes every race and not just black and white and you can see that in Chicago they have a great mix of Asian and Hispanic communities and that white people are actually a minority in Chicago. You point to one city and one instance to prove that America is still super racist but you fail to give other examples outside of that. Black people do commit more crimes than white people in America and it's is mostly due to their situations but to act like that's an excuse to give these people who commit crimes a pass is idiotic. States and cities like Baltimore need to be the ones under fire and pressured to make changes rather than the whole country. More educational funding in black neighborhoods, investigation in police officers in certain cities, and even redoing some black homes for free if they still have lead on the walls. I agree that racism still exists and it always will but it's not a national issue and black lives matter wants to treat as such and we start to divide the nation rather than unite it."

"This video is very inaccurate. For your first point, you use Freddie Gray as an example of societal racism today, but that is only one example and not indicative of a population of over 300+ million people. You then use that to connect with your second point about housing discrimination, in which you show that separate races tend not to live in the same areas. You explain this with housing discrimination policies such as redlining, though those have been banned. You show no evidence other than disparate OUTCOMES that this type of housing discrimination happenss today, and disparate outcomes is not necessarily indicative of discrimantory housing policies in america TODAY. The lack of race mixing overall could very well be caused by the historical racism, which everybody agrees that America has had a long history of, and even you cite this as a case, stating how 100 years ago (and, even 50 years ago), housing policies were discriminatory. Nobody disagrees that America was once a very racist country, people like me argue that America NOW is not racist, and you did not provide any evidence to counter that, even though the point of your video was to try and provide evidence and show that America is racist still to this day, though you do cite policies such as restrictive covenants and redlining as examples of societal racism in America IN THE PAST (which again, very, very, very few people disagree with). The way you try to connect that with societal racism today is by saying 'even though the segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains uredressed', and again, very, very few people disagree with that. Obviously there are problems with social mobility in America; if you are trapped in a dilapidated inner city with no money, you are likely to sell drugs, and your kids will likely be put in the same situation, continuing the cycle from which few break. However, this is not a problem with racism, as you your self had said the racist policies (segregation) had ended. The effects of HISTORICAL RACISM are not, itself racism, but rather problems with social mobility and the cycle of poverty. Whether African Americans should gain some sort of 'reparations' for HISTORICAL injustice to try and redress the HISTORICAL injustice is a seperate conversation from whether societal injustice still exists today in america. Finally, you at least try to make a point supporting your case by stating that the aforementioned discriminatory policies still exist to this day, but then you go on by showing the effetcs of PAST redlining policies, and then stating that the effects of racism have not totally been mitigated. Again, nobody disagrees with this, obviously racism in the law only ended in the 1960's, and racism in overall society continued even past that, making this phenomenon relatavely recent. But, again, this doesn't support your point that societal discrimination exists today in america, rather you are just repeating that there are still effects of historical racism (which again, almost nobody disagrees with), therefore you again are not even supporting your own point. You also cite the increase in police stops as an example of current day societal racism, but disparity in outcome doesn't automatically equate to racism. You make no effort to control for other factors, such as the respective crime rates for each neighborhood (police would obviously patrol areas and make more stops in places with higher crime rates, which would not be racist), making the same fallacy as people who attempt to push the myth of the gender wage gap. Again, you talk about the reason African Americans commit more crime is because of poverty caused by HISTORICAL racism, but agian this doesn't support your point that America has, to this day, a problem with societal racism. And while telling African Americans to not commit more crime obviously won't solve all problems, there is nothing wrong with saying that commiting crimes will not take you out of poverty, but rather continue the cycle of poverty for generations to come, yet you frame this as if it is some sort of horrible, racist thing to say. You then move on into your section about mass incarceration. You start of by showing the statistics that African Americans make up a disporportionate amount of people in prison, and while this is true, a disparity in outcome does not neccessarily mean racism. You then state what I think is still the strongest point for your case in this video (which is still very weak). Yes it is true that even after controlling for the rate of use for African American communties, you find that African Americans are still disproportionately arrested on drug-related charges, but there are many other race-neutral factors that you haven't taken into account (such as cops policing communities with higher OVERALL crime rates, which tend to be disporportianately African Americans because of HISTORICAL racism), and the fact that you haven't taken into account ANY other factors other than the rate of use means your analysis that this is evidence of current day societal racism is invalid. You then continue throughout the rest of the video strawmaning your opponents saying that they hand-wave away the effects of historical racism (which not only isn't true, but also has nothing to do with proving the existence of current day societal racism). Also, you continue to misrepresent your opponents by saying many people on the opposite side of the spectrum of the issue (E.X. Ben Shapiro, which you used in the video as an example) get angry when African Americans 'take a stand against this' which is also wrong, as your opponents don't get angry over them taking a stand, they get angry that what they are taking a stand against is not supported by facts or evidence and that what these African Americans are 'taking a stand' against is used as a basis for ACTUAL discriminatory policies such as repararations for slavery and affirmative action. You state that there is a lot of talk about how 'evil' or ''authoritarian' black lives matter is, and while your opponents outline their valid reasons for why they think this, you don't even bother to address their arguments about why BLM is considered in their eyes, 'evil', and 'authoritarian'. Again you CONTINUE to misrepresent your detractors by saying they are getting angry at people utilizing their freedom of speech, but that is not true. What your detractors are getting enraged about are 2-fold: that BLM protests do turn into riots sometimes, leading to a rash of crime encouraged by the leaders of the protest, and that the ideo that BLM is protesting against, that there is still societal wide racial discrimination in America, is ill-founded and not supported by statistics. You then go on to say that 'don't deny oppressive circumstances exist', but that statement assumes that opressive circumstances in america today DO exist, which is simply not supported any real evidence, as I have shown by debunking all your 'evidence' in this comment."
"Just one thing: I'm German, no one ever told me to care about skin colour. When the thing with H&M happened, most people thought it is racist to tell a kid he can't wear a shirt for some reason he might not even be able to understand. When I first started watching YouTube, I was baffled. I never even knew people people cared about skin colour.  It's still hard for me how racist the USA really is. I don't want to say no German is racist, I just want to say that most people don't care about skin colour and many kids never learned about anything close to that. (And then there are Americans saying I should be thankful for them destroying Hitlers' regime. Yes, the people fighting in the war are and were  great people. They really helped us out, but you don't have to demand that I'm thankful for something the person didn't even do. I don't have to make myself responsible for something my 80 year old grandma didn't even quite experience anymore. It's my responsibility to make sure this doesn't happen again. But I want to ask the Americans saying this one thing: How can you demand that I be thankful, while your country has one of the biggest amounts of Nazis and racists. How can you demand me being thankful, when your country doesn't even do anything against the KKK?)"

I don't have white guilt in the same way that I don't have white pride. For me racism is just a matter of fact issue that's hurting millions of people and needs to be resolved, there's no emotional strings attached to it other than empathy for your fellow man. The people that call themselves skeptics, or God forbid identitarians, are just frankly annoying assholes that stand in the way of justice."

"Jim Crow laws were enforced in southern US states until 1965. This means there are black grandmothers and grandfathers who were alive during the days of segregation who can pass on stories to their children and grandchildren about a country which claimed it held 'these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,' and yet told them they weren't good enough to even shit in the same toilet as white people. We're not talking about the days before the abolition of slavery, these events are still in living memory."
"White people smoke more pot. Get jailed less xD Fuck Racism"
"Thank you for talking about this, and I apologise for making this an impromptu therapy session. Race has always been an uncomfortable topic for me. I'm mixed race, and it has been a source of stress for my entire life. Things really took off when my grandmother told my mother and myself that she had hidden the fact that my mother's biological father was Mexican, and that there was Romani on my grandmother's side (in addition to the Native American and Irish that she never hid) to protect my mother from her racist, literal sociopath stepfather. He's dead now, thank God. Then I made the mistake of telling who I thought was my best friend, who then told the entire school. Things...got bad, to say the least. Since then, this has been a contributing factor to my identity and self esteem issues. I have never felt like I fit in in any community except my time in the military, regardless of the political make up of the area that I'm in. Even within my own extended family. For the eighteen years after my grandmother opened up, I've struggled with 'what am I' until my wife told me that I'm me, and she loves me because I'm me. But, there is a silver lining to my experiences, truth be told. It taught me one thing above all else: treat each person that I meet with the dignity and respect that they deserve rather than lumping them in with some group that can lead to alienation and othering. Sorry if I'm rambling, just a little emotional. It's nice to have a place where I can open up."
"I wish Contra had addressed one of the main arguments that conservatives use to explain the high incarceration rates of blacks,  ECONOMIC STATUS. Regardless of your race, low income people commit more crime. I know that America has done many things to keep blacks poor (as highlighted in this video) therefore keeping the cycle going but would love to see the incarceration rates of low income whites vs. middle&upper income whites."

"HOW TO BECOME A RACIST: http://www.harbornet.com/folks/theedrich/JP_Rushton/Race.htm some comments about the book: Acclaim for J. Philippe Rushton's"
"Race, Evolution, and Behavior"
"'(An) incendiary thesis....that separate races of human beings evolved different reproductive strategies to cope with different environments and that these strategies led to physical differences in brain size and hence in intelligence. Human beings who evolved in the warm but highly unpredictable environment of Africa adopted a strategy of high reproduction, while human beings who migrated to the hostile cold of Europe and northern Asia took to producing fewer children but nurturing them more carefully.'"
"---Malcolm W. Browne, New York Times Book Review"
"'Rushton is a serious scholar who has assembled serious data. Consider just one example: brain size. The empirical reality, verified by numerous modern studies, including several based on magnetic resonance imaging, is that a significant and substantial relationship does exist between brain size and measured intelligence after body size is taken into account and that the races do have different distributions of brain size.'"
"---Charles Murray, Afterword to The Bell Curve."
"'Describes hundreds of studies worldwide that show a consistent pattern of human racial differences in such characteristics as intelligence, brain size, genital size, strength of sex drive, reproductive potency, industriousness, sociability, and rule following. On each of these variables, the groups are aligned in the order: Orientals, Caucasians, Blacks.'"
"---Mark Snyderman, National Review"
"'Rushton's Race, Evolution, and Behavior ...is an attempt to understand [race] differences in terms of life-history evolution....Perhaps there ultimately will be some serious contribution from the traditional smoke-and-mirrors social science treatment of IQ, but for now Rushton's framework is essentially the only game in town.'"
"---Henry Harpending, Evolutionary Anthropology."
"'This brilliant book is the most impressive theory-based study...of the psychological and behavioral differences between the major racial groups that I have encountered in the world literature on this subject.'"
"---Arthur R. Jensen, University of California, Berkeley."
"'The only acceptable explanation of race differences in behavior allowed in public discourse is an entirely environmental one...Professor Rushton deserves our gratitude for having the courage to declare that `this emperor has no clothes,' and that a more satisfactory explanation must be sought.'"
"---Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., University of Minnesota."
"'The remarkable resistance to racial science in our times has led to comparisons with the inquisition of Rome, active during the Renaissance.... Astronomy and the physical sciences had their Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo a few centuries ago; society and the welfare of humanity is the better for it today. In a directly analogous fashion, psychology and the social sciences today have their Darwin, Galton, and Rushton.'"
"---Glayde Whitney, Contemporary Psychology"
"'The data are startling to the uninitiated.... Race, Evolution, and Behavior confronts us as few books have with the dilemmas wrought in a democratic society by individual and group differences in key human traits.'"
"---Linda Gottfredson, Politics and the Life Sciences"
"'Professor Rushton is widely known and respected for the unusual combination of rigour and originality in his work....Few concerned with understanding the problems associated with race can afford to disregard this storehouse of well-integrated information which gives rise to a remarkable synthesis.'"

"I just always assumed it's a bit of column A and a bit of column B like most debates.  As you said, take responsibility and don't make excuses - that's for the people who know better and have options, even if only minimally so. There are those who do look at the overall situation and take the piss out of it just because that's easier than being responsible. So we need to hold them accountable and avoid simply waving off individuals who take advantage of victimhood.  ...Pretty sure most of the kids in colleges and universities arguing they're victims are anything but victims and they're hurting the discourse. One thing to argue for other disenfranchised peoples but don't lump yourself in with them when you've clearly got opportunity.  However, I also always agreed that incarceration rates were way too high and that drug laws did disproportionality target minorities; hence why I'm not a big fan of them and that's before we get into the 'war' surrounding drugs on a global scale. There are many laws, forms of taxation, and ways we do business that unfairly target (at least in my opinion) lower-classed citizens and therefore minorities regardless of racial intent - all of which could likely use some form of reformation or abolishment entirely.  I mean, I'm surprised here in Texas no one looks at vehicle registration and inspection as a bit of a steep cost for a place where owning your own car is damn near mandatory for survival and having to pay extra money you don't really have in the first place kind of shit considering you already pay for your gas, oil, upkeep, and the vehicle itself... all of which are generally exploitative industries in of themselves.  Truth be told, I think all sides have some valid points and some questionable points. One thing I won't tolerate though is being yelled down at by people who are more privileged (regardless of race) than myself explaining how my ancestors brought this all about, even though my ancestors were likely toiling in coal mines, building the first train tracks, and dying of famine and disease overseas despite being 'white'.   Being poor sucks - period. You lose most sense of representation and are always the last to get rights properly invoked on your behalf. Minorities unfortunately fall into the bracket in much greater numbers. I think we're better off trying to raise up everyone rather than specific peoples as a result. Focusing on the disenfranchised and the forgotten in effort to level things out. But until we begin to turn against the almighty grasp of capital I don't think that can happen. Not on a spiritual nor practical level.  Note: That's not me handwaving clear racially-biased discrimination of the past. It's simply saying that minorities aren't the only ones who have suffered but of course, they have in disproportionate numbers. However if we were to take care of our lower-classed citizens as a WHOLE by looking at the factors that matter such as living situation, opportunity for education and employment, income, etc rather than focusing on race I think more could be done. No one has to feel guilty for that which has happened in the past when they had no involvement in such events in the first place. They should feel guilty however for the state of the present."

Very few people other than far-righters truly believe that racism is dead, and those people really should see this video. However, I also feel like the issue with some people 'not-caring' is just that they just don't know anything that they can do.

Also, on average, black people have a higher IQ than any other race - e.g. they organised the Moon trips, because White people simply could not do the Maths. Also, look at the ancient civilisations: Rome, Greece, Sumeria  - black.  This has been proven.  Of course, the sterling example of blackness is Ancient Egypt, which actually featured early gliders and hot-air balloons.  Meanwhile, it is well-known that there are secret groups of cops who are dedicated to shooting black people.  These cops will risk their careers, their freedom, even their lives, for the sake of killing black people.  It's all they think about.  And that gets to the heart of the matter. Everyone is always thinking about black people. Why?  Jealousy. That's why.  If you are a hater, please redirect your hate elsewhere.  I do not wish to hear psychotic criticism of black people. Remember, they built America.  Think about that, next time you're in a building . . ."

Much of black hiphop is about how poc are stereotyped and discriminated against, as well as, how an economic short hand can (and often) lead to petty career/gang crime. I've also noticed also noticed a considerable portion of popular contemporary (white(gentrified?)) hiphop is focused around getting mashed on a combination of prescription meds and alcohol...   Obviously I've never really experienced racism, and I dont know how it really feels or anything, but the music has taught me how systematic racism works and to understand I've definitely got some privileged..."

"anti racism is the narrative of the establishment. you turn on the television and every ad features an interracial couple. very strange for a racist culture. you only called race science pseudo because it isn‚Äôt sponsored by the government. if the system is really dedicated to white supremacy then it would be doing something about whites becoming minorities in europe, australia and north america. instead it actively shames any white person who says that this is a problem, and ensures that those white people can never be employed."

"You should sing more often"
"I found this video for the first time around 10 months ago. At that time I was a huge Dave Rubin fan and slowly drifting towards a more Ben Shapiro style conservative outlook. I watched it and at the time as a young middle class white male, I was still in denial about a lot of very real issues that black people still face in society. I tried to dismiss but found I couldn‚Äôt.   I came back the next day and watched it again, trying to find holes to pick in it to better fit my worldview. I failed. Frustrated but recognising the value that it held, I added created a YouTube playlist where I slowly began to store various left wing videos that I came across online. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was still fairly right wing (though laughably thought of myself as a liberal) but I listened and engaged with other points of view, more out of principle than any true belief.   However, I slowly began to find myself agreeing more and more with the leftists I‚Äôd find and listen to and began discovering and realising the flaws with those I‚Äôd previously worshipped (e.g. helping me break out of my Jordan Peterson stage) This video was the first crack in my beliefs that led me to evolve as a person and become who I am today.  Thank you Contrapoints for turning me away from a dark path. This video was invaluable to me in that journey and I hope it‚Äôll do the same for others."

"But the answer to the disporportionate drug busts is not to release black Americans who have been incarcerated due to drug busts, as I see many people activating. The answer is to revise the racist system we have so that black people are getting more resources, less lead poisoning, less racism pervading their lives and stealing opportunities. The answer is not to let people who have been busted selling weed on the streets, because it was illegal at the time, distributed more easily to minors, and had several chemicals which made it more addicting, cheaper to make, and more importantly, more dangerous. I'll post links to articles I found in the replies to this comment, but the point is that these people, although part of an unjust system, have STILL been incarcerated due to very real crimes. The answer is not to release them, as I said, but to build a more fair system that'll incarcerate ANYONE that does these crimes. And I'm not saying 'oh, black people are more likely to because they're black'. I understand the circumstances, understand that black people are so very, very rarely given the same opportunities as us. And yes, while it is unfair that so many black people are imprisoned over something they felt they needed to fo to survive, the fact is that these people still endangered others with what they were doing. The blame of them getting into that situation falls on white people, and so does the responsibility of helping them get out (since white people, unfortunately, still have all the power). I am in no way excusing racism, I am in no way suggesting our system not change, all I am saying is that we shouldn't let people who endanger others, regardless of circumstances, off the hook just because the system was against them. Instead, we should change the system, to make black people in these situations have the same opportunities as everyone else."

It's difficult to see clearly about something when you are being labeled by a snarky, whiny, new age 20-something who might be right about something...but completely by accident. I'm glad I found your channel. I have no problem with empathy...except maybe I have too much. My problem is with people around me constantly resorting to anecdotal or vague evidence (feelings) for their claims. Everyone has stories. But, the world (and population) is large in scale. 100 people don't tip the scales, especially when people of the world are so easily led to their conclusions via emotional hijacking. So, you are providing a very useful service. I hope you keep sharpening your skills and strengthening your arguments, and above all...settling only for the truth."

'Why *do* I feel such pressing urges to smack down even the most non-committal, waffle-hearted pronounciamentos of the latter, and bat nary an eyelash at the former's hateful antics?'  In that part of themselves they don't discuss online, they mistakenly reckon that just because Fascism doesn't challenge them, doesn't ask anything radical of them now, that it never will, even once established. They think that the Fascist Regime, USA, Inc. will allow them to persevere with their cringey vlogging or whatever. There's something that is both highly humorous and highly macabre about this mistaken analysis of a provisional future."

"It's simple. Black people are the only group that are immune to the historical principle that the past affects the present.   Also, the vilification of the black panthers in the media is one of the worst crimes in american history."
"Yes. Let‚Äôs blame black people for the endemic racism of a society that is barely two centuries away from regarding people of color as sub-human (see Three-Fifths Compromise). Two centuries of racial inequality and barely 50 years outside of legislation that begrudgingly desegregated an entire socio-political system (i.e. ‚ÄúThe South‚Äù and remember the Army had to be called up to ensure the safety of American citizens from other American citizens) have created this epidemic cycle of spiraling poverty, violence and incarceration in predominantly black neighborhoods (the creation of these neighborhoods is detailed quite succinctly in Natalie's video). To ignore the correlation between the recent meteoric rise of 'conservatism' (i.e. the GOP) in the bastions of the previously mentioned southern U.S., where the tradition of the 'Southern Democrat' died off just as the Democratic party adopted more socially progressive policies, is especially stark when one considers the former dividing line of the slave-holding C.S.A. from their largely non-slave holding neighbors. But hey, the Alt-Right wants you to forget our reprehensible history of slavery (sorry folks, no 'white guilt' here, just a historical record filled with misdeeds done to people of color largely to the benefit of white people) and instead replace it with the promise of some bullshit straight, White utopia in their much-hoped for 'ehtno-state'. Racism and the Alt-Right movement are inextricably bound. And if you‚Äôre a centrist whom embraces those Alt-Right talking points; then may I humbly suggest a fair bit of soul searching, some historical perspective and a healthy dose of these ContraPoints videos."
"I have tried having this conversation with conservative members of my family. I get 'Stop making everything about race. What about black on black crime. We can't be racist. We had a black president'. They never offer any data. Just opinion and personal attacks. I don't bother any more. Life is too short. They've made up their minds, and they choose to be ignorant in the information age. Nothing I say will make any difference."

"I think we can also see that in Baltimore and New York historical segregation is not being tipped out as Schelling's segregation model proves racial groups do. Why? That is where the real heart of this is. I am not afraid of models. Many a hood has been the product of a gradual tipping point that has tipped out another racial group. Ethnic and racial groups do in fact tend to follow individuals of their group into new territory. Why haven't some historically segregated places been tipped out? Where do these people have to go and why don't or can't they leave? Why isn't another group tipping out black areas of Baltimore? What is stopping the tipping points?"

"4:55 maybe illegal? oh my"
"1:18 god damn you fail again by trying to remove the responsibilities of people making bad choices. This is why the left wing will never win a debate. When you have no arguments you resort to some system of oppression because the idea of black people generally making a bad choice is higher. That shit does not compute in your mind because you want to shape the world with your mind. if I was a black man who didn't make such choice I'd be pissed with you since you just removed merit for my feat."
"Such a good video."
"Sorry but youre still a fucking piece of shit and you deserve justice if you kill people and steal shit."
"I accept, to various degrees, most leftwing explanations of black criminality. However, what they always lack is a real solution. I grew up in a large, poor, mostly black city and you're basically besieged by black crime. Don't go through that neighborhood, don't go out after a certain time, watch out for groups of black teens- they're all life lessons anyone (including blacks as well) living in Philly, Blatimore, Chicago, Detroit, etc learn at a really young age. I went to public school in my city, which was basically a nightmare- more fucked up then I have space to explain on a youtube comment. I accept that horrible things have been done to the black community by whites, I even accept that the police target them for abuse- but I can't ignore that their behavior is disproportionately dangerous. I can't ignore it because if I did I'd be putting myself at physical risk. Flagellating yourself with white guilt, even if it's warranted, doesn't change the fact that that I have to watch my back when I walk home from the el late at night. And I'm a pretty robust man, my sister, a small female, is basically a hostage in her apartment after a certain time of night. So even if you absolve blacks of responsibility for their behavior the behavior itself still exists. It's very frustrating for blue collar urban whites, who generally live closer to dangerous black areas, to be told how bad white people are by white academics. We're the ones that have to deal with black criminality on a personal level, whereas academics and media elites generally live in safe neighborhoods far away from 'diversity'. Again, this doesn't mean I don't recognize white culpability in creating the situation, but if you're literally just trying to get home at night without getting mugged it's difficult to be lectured to. Also: all the OTHER people, that aren't white OR black have to deal with black crime too. Hispanics and Asians have nothing to do with the current state of black society, but they're probably more affected by black criminality then even blue collar whites."
"Du sprichst deutsch?"
"Racism isnt real. Unless your talking about blacks who fantasize that whites are born with tails and smell like dogs and literally stole invention ideas out of their heads."
"Contrapoints just made the primary error of SJWs: Guilt as reparation.  She's correct on how past racist practices have an effect to this day.  But what is to be done about those effects?  Monetary reparations had little effect--at least in the case of Freddie Gray's lead-poisoning payments, they seemed to just make predatory scumbags richer. The only prescription she offers is for whites to wag their fingers at themselves.  But what else can you do when the obvious answer--desegregation--would require massive wealth redistribution.  How do you integrate formerly red-lined and non-red-lined neighborhoods without taking from some to give to others?  Even applying Peterson advice to 'clean your room,' i.e., for poor people to get better jobs, wouldn't work because they'd have to make enough money to gentrify their own neighborhoods for themselves.   I don't know what the solution is--and neither does Contrapoints--but it isn't one you can merely throw money at."

"Thank you for this. I'm not American and struggle to understand all this black vs  white stuff. This made me have a better understanding of the whole thing. But still, to me privilege and oppression aren't about race. One can be white but born in a poor family or have abusive parents. Or have no family at all and is raised by the system. Or is disabled. His race doesn't make him privileged in any way. One can also be black but born in a rich family, gotten the best education and inherited his father's company. This person is not oppressed just because he's black. There is no white privilege or male privilege, it's just privilege. Some have it, some don't. Sure, the average black person is less privileged than the average white person and this is a problem that American society must solve. But saying that all white people have 'white privilege' doesn't do you any good."

"You will never be able to thought police people out of being racist unless we homogenize everyone. which is just untenable in practice. Trying to erase racism is like trying to brainwash us out of our natural inclination to notice patterns; and shaming people will not keep people from noticing things like the trend of ghetto blacks committing a disproportionate amount of crimes, and acting like dim savages who can't even speak correctly the one language the white man taught them with their 'finnas', 'nigga' this, and 'ax' that, because talking like an Ebonics spewing low IQ person is cool in their Hip Hop culture; #notall is completely moot when, despite #notall, there still is a trend of culturally present behaviors amongst virtually all racial groups, which are in part genetic and in part their culture, and every time someone sees one of these patterns of racially specific behaviors, it serves as confirmation bias for their racism towards that group.   You would have to effectively lobotomize people to not think in this way that notices racial patterns of behavior because, unless someone acts contrary to their racial stereotype to where they transcend it, they will only perpetuate said stereotype themselves with no help needed from evil raycis whypipo who apparently are just evil for noticing racial patterns of behavior. It's the racial groups themselves who propagate racism against themselves when they manifest trends of behaviors; it's not evil to simply honestly acknowledge these trends so long as you maintain compassion for said group in your heart, which a lot of people seem to think either view is mutually exclusive, as if you can racist or compassionate, but certainly not both.  We're going about racism all wrong with these shaming tactics, as if, despite being as old as time, it's now suddenly the most taboo thing ever to notice negative or positive trends amongst different racial groups, and point out these obvious trends like 'Asians are typically smart and studious', 'Blacks tend to be more inclined to crime', or 'Mexicans make better burritos than John from Minnesota', ect. We need to encourage the desensitization of racism to render it powerless to hurt feelings, and showcase more positive archetypes of all races, instead of this POCs being shown as aggravating harpies and always bitching about the white man and demanding gibs from him as atonement for his great great great grandfather's supposed sins, maybe promote the blacks that don't subscribe to this negative 'gibs me that white boi' caricature? I think the latter would make way more of a positive impact than giving attention to people of who behave in a way a that enforces the perception of negative racial stereotypes.  Or because we're naturally always going to anyway to much of a degree, we need to segregate (optionally) and it should be completely acceptable because freedom of association is a natural human right and preference. There is nothing wrong with optional segregation; in fact, most people would be happy to say go to school with people more like them culturally and per appearance. Like what is actually wrong with blacks going to an all black school, or Mexicans to an all Mexican school, or Whites an all White school if they so choose? There can still exist non-segregated places, which can be just as valid, but why not so choose to segregate if this isn't hurting anyone anyway?   Everybody is to some degree racist if you give them a reason to see patterns of human behavior among groups; denying this within ourselves yet projecting it onto others as if it's a great evil is some serious mind-fuckery gaslit upon us as a subversive tactics to try to make us all the same, just one big slop, the melting pot, which IMO is some evil shit that tries to erase many cultural identities, and for what exactly?? Back in the day, shows like Howard Stern would make boldly racist statements and nobody reacted so absurdly as they do now, but now if you so much as speak to a black person the 'wrong' way, they can claim racism and everyone automatically believes them. Like I heard a colored man call an old 85 year old woman 'racist' for telling him to move out of her way on a subway the other day; this is the neurosis POCs have been brainwashed into by our jewish neo-marxist social engineers that actually encourage the spread of racism by constantly forcing it down our throats as an issue, as if it's a boogey man hiding under every rock, most notably under every white rock. Needless to say, that old woman said nothing about that man's race, but he still perceived her 'rudeness' as racism rather than an old person just being grumpy trying to pass by him on a crowded train."

"Thanks for another great video.  I've been watching far right youtube vids lately to get a feel for their perspective, and it's very alarming to see their coldhearted denial of systemic racism and other modern forms of inequality.  They use sparse 'data' and pseudo-science to justify their arguments, but you use a great deal of valid evidence that clearly proves their perspective wrong.  Keep up the good work! :)"
"I think that the terms 'hate speech' and 'racism' are used as a psyop to divide the country. They are not real, and neither are Nazis. Sorry, but the boogeymen in this world are far worse than 'right wingers'. There is evil in this world and it's very real and it's very dangerous."

"It's fucked up the policies that were implemented in the 1900s regarding with black people owning homes. If you notice in the different areas, towns, and cities in the United States it is segregated for many reasons. One of the major reasons is because people like to live with their own. Asian, Hispanics, Jewish, and other cultures tend to have their own community. I use to live in Miami where Cubans are the majority. It is extremely click'y' and they make sure that the Cubans community has the majority of the benefits. Now, living in NJ. I tend to see Asians doing the same thing. I wish we can live in a world where judgement is based on the individual."

"I don‚Äôt get how some people(whites) think racism isn‚Äôt going on. Not only the points you made but, going along the lines of safety for people of color, I can see how they could constantly feel on edge whether or not they are going to get harassed. I‚Äôm white and my husband is East Indian. When we lived in the Midwest, I hated him going out of our college town to get research participants for his studies for school. I would often go with him to make sure he was ok because the moment we would leave the town we lived, it was a different world. Every place we would stroll into, all white eyes would slowly turn their gaze at my husband. There have been many instances where I got the feeling that if we didn‚Äôt leave immediately, there would be a physical threat towards him. There also was one time where we went to eat at a damn subway in Minnesota, and these group of male construction workers were eyeing him like ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU SIT WITH A WHITE WOMAN‚Äù that was the most scared I‚Äôve ever been for my husband‚Äôs life because it looked like it took every ounce of his strength to not say do anything. He‚Äôs also been refused a drivers license because of his ethnicity. Even the other coworkers were disgusted with the person working with my husband."

"I was about to watch this and I was like, 'wait...I already know the systematic reasons why black people still dont have the same opportunities even today and that people are still ignorant about those reasons and believe everyone 'can just pull themselves up by their bootstraps, Bc dude, my family doesn't even have the money to afford boots, nonetheless straps, and neither did my grandparents or great grandparents or my great-grand parents.' And I know there are tons of black people just like me who were behind the starting line compared to white people pertaining to wealth and advancement opportunities, I was born behind the line, and so were the people before me, I live this shit. My mom was the first college graduate of my aunts and uncles and grandmother and her own aunts and uncles. I am only a second generation college student along with my cousin. But honestly I just wanted to give ContraPoints the view haha. It's good to know that even if it's not coming from the mouth of a black person (bc tbh less ppl listen when it's a black person  bc they say we're complaining) ppl will be able to learn about the problems. xx"

But now I‚Äôm not only not really sure about statistics in general bc I have a statistics class in university but I also get why they commit crimes. First, migrants of all sorts commit more crimes. It was always like that but they won‚Äôt be migrants forever. But migrants also tend to be poor more often. And poor people commit more crimes and I totally get that. Especially because refugees aren‚Äôt allowed to work. I think the frustration with their situation gets way too strong."

"Don't you just love it when people explain your life experience to you?  I've learned to keep my mouth shut regarding racism, because sheesh it's exhausting lol. After banging my head against that wall for over a decade it has taught me two crucial points on how racism is veiwed. 1. A lot of people define racism by the fringe, by the alt-right. To them it means someone proudly says 'Yes, I hate all minorities and I wish them harm'. That way it can be seen as a only bad people hold racist beliefs. As long as we stick with that narrative, then little crap like clutching your purse when I pass by or crossing the street to avoid me entirely isn't viewed as racist. 2. In my experience people that say 'Prove that racism exists' are totally not walking into a  debate with any plans of having a different perspective when it's finished. After those talks, you feel angry, exhausted, and frustrated. People say 'Well black people are bringing on themselves by being criminals. Since I was 16, i've been stopped by police 9 times, with 4 of those times at gunpoint. Number of crimes i've committed in my life: 0. If you want to say 'I don't like black people, I don't trust black people, and I don't like being in the company of black people' I would absolutely love it. With an overt racist, you know exactly where you stand. As opposed to this brigade of people telling you that it doesn't happen to them, so obviously i'm doing something wrong."

"Red-lining and predatory/discriminatory mortgages chopped up Denver into discrete white & non-white neighborhoods from the late 1890s all the way through the 1960s. And now that Denver's in the middle of an insane housing boom, those old neighborhoods that nobody gave a shit about for decades are suddenly prime real estate. And the people who've lived there for those decades are getting priced right out of their homes. It's amazing, given how far we've come, how little has actually changed."

"If america is a white supremacy, why is the mainstream media pushing so hard for less white people everywhere? Why is it so much easier to get a job or get into college as a person who isn't white (or asian)? Why is the school system basically telling kids exactly what you're saying here? Dunno how to word it but all the double standards with racist speech on twitter over the years, very clearly skewed against white people in every situation. It seems to me a good portion of white people are trying their hardest to fuck themselves over and are mad that some white people aren't as willing as them to do it.   Also, why is it ok for you to say black people have lower IQ? That's a tremendously racist thing to say, in any context.   there isn't a lot of 'contra' stuff here, you're quite literally supporting the current status quo."

"You start this off with an example that broke a serious law, weapon concealment. & you're surprised someone caught concealing a weapon with a long ass wrap sheet goes down fighting cops....  a warped public opinion of a dirty job that they dont like has to be done.   In English: you're not a cop you're a blogger who's probably never even been in a life threatening situation just cause some irrational prick doesnt want to cooperate. You dont know what it's like to have the wieght of both dying, having to potentially kill, and being judged/criminally punished for simply doing your job is like. They live with that 24/7 unlike these helpless babies who got affirmative action handing them jobs, scholarships, and positions for their skin tone ( which in itself is racist). A cop has a similar stress level to the soldiers in Iraq the only difference is we recognize they face threats and we like to pretend cops dont and have this cushy life we could all do.   Btw my mother lost 2 different state job opportunities to higher class Hispanic women due to affirmative action & I personally have been denied opportunities in policing for being a man alone even though I have both the intellectual & physical superiority (nvm the experience)...so excuse me if I'm not too fond of the victim card any point after the 60s.   Should I also point out that the problems that these poor black people suffer from are issues they perpetrate themselves? What the fuck am I suppose to do if some kid from Compton slings dope cause he doesnt wanna bust his ass and go to school? & I'd like to see it somehow get pinned on the whites when they go murdering each other over a fuckin colored rag hanging over their mouth....  A society is only as good as the individuals in it & if those individuals can accept shootings dealing & prostitution then its gonna hang around.   Which brings me back to my previous point that these cops are going through shitty ass neighborhoods I wouldn't wanna walk through if I had an 85lb MOLLE vest on a regular basis they're not having these incidents in like quiet ass places because the city is where the crime happens & it just so happens that's where the most blacks live. You're falling for a media decoy of fear & letting it control you. No different than emporer palpatine talking shit about the jedi to Anakin till he falls for it. Same shit different day.

"I have a legitimate question. If all legal inequalities have been smashed (and I will remain skeptical on that point for the purpose of this inquiry), then where does modern racism come from? Without intentionally organized, structural elements of society creating the oppression of a group, how are groups still being oppressed and how can you possibly hope to deal with the oppressive elements of society when the modern claimed responsible party is an untouchable monster like 'patriarchy' which is merely a byproduct of the male variation effect. If you truely want to completely eliminate forces like patriarchy, you have to genetically reengineer humanity. Are you planni g on implementing legal policies and altering social trends with media control that lead to differing reproductive behavior to accomplish this effect? Make people they believe they chose to have someone's children because they wanted to but really they were just brainwashed into it? Serious question... because people seem pretty skeptical of GMOs and I'm sure few people really want to enact the kinds of eugenics necessary to create to change of the sort that would be needed to accomplish the goals of dismantling the ghost in the machine."

It seems reasonable to me to think that people prefer being around people of their own race, and that's neither cultural nor pathological.  I imagine that racism is a perfectly natural extension of tribalism.  To my thinking the problem with saying that is that the obsessive hatred of other races demonstrated by the KKK or neo-Nazis isn't natural.  It is both cultural and pathological."

"When I find a new channel on YouTube I try and find videos that treat points I disagree with as quickly as possible, and then listen more and to stuff I disagree with while I already respect the speaker. Doing this changed my views on so many different topics and generally enriched with more information as to why I hold that view point, simultaneously shifting and strengthening my position each time moving in smaller increments. However I can't seem to find such a thing with this channel, maybe because it doesn't treat viewpoints as much as it treats a heck ton of information, blasting me with more and more to be curious about, and with this it's changing my views on the causes fought by sjws, about which I used to say 'damn these people are crazy, I get that there is oppression but that's way to far', while now they seem more reasonable causes, it also has a great response to the accusation of playing victim inflicted upon anyone taking these cause seriously by opposing intellectuals; overall it has achieve what sjw try to achieve, getting you to care about social inequality while taking a much more moderate route. And at the same time it's gone beyond my method to grow my viewpoints by presenting me with logic I would already agree with instead of points I'm severely against, so I doubt I'll ever be able to apply my own learning method to this channel. I'm very glad to have found this channel and look forward to avidly watch every past video and keep myself updated, thank you so much for your work"

"The reason why people say, 'I don't have time to explain racism to you' is because life experience has shown me it never works. After I give up days of my life trying to convince some white person that Black Lives Matter isn't a terrorist organization it always ends with, 'Well, I kinda need to believe I got everything I have because I deserve it and you got everything you have because the world feels bad for black people, so I'm just going to ignore the mountain of evidence to the contrary and continue on guiltlessly buying into white supremacy.' Every.single.time. Why? Because when a white person /really/ wants to know about racial injustice they'll Google that shit. Wasting my time typing out essays pleading for my humanity to be recognized just highlights my utter powerlessness in this context and makes me depressed. Black people have neither the ability nor the responsibility to stop white supremacy. So keep fighting the good fight. I believe in you."

"1) police killings of black people  (note: 'extrajudicial execution' is an unjustified, hyperbolic term)  2) black neighborhoods are subject to more poverty, crime, more aggressive policing  3) black neighborhoods in worse structural shape, e.g. higher amount of lead paint --> link between lead exposure and low IQ, also link to criminality --> predatory lawyers for lead poisoning victims (which are, as mentioned, disproportionately black)  (link to next point: this is actually part of 'structural racism', because it's the result of racial segregation)  4) Baltimore still largely segregated now --> lasting effects of past racial discrimination:       a) FHA gave loans for mortgages, facilitated home ownership --> in effect, excluded blacks in several ways           i) restrictive covenants prevent selling/renting to blacks           ii) redlining, refusing to ensure mortgages in black neighborhoods           iii) (ii) led to predatory lending, led to overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods           iv) blockbusting, sell houses to blacks at extortionate rates      b) result: black families trapped in structurally decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, low opportunity, high poverty and crime, and aggressive and discriminatory policing       c) injustice not redressed: no reparations payed to black families denied opportunities for home ownership/wealth accumulation due to past government-sanctioned racist practices      d) segregation ongoing (cites gentrification as an example) (note: this claim is unsupported, and does not account for the effects of self-segregating practices among all races, plus the merely apparent segregationist effects of wealth inequality - disproportionately few blacks are middle class, neighborhood becomes middle class, therefore disproportionately few blacks in this neighborhood --> this is not segregation because it's not an intentional effort to separate the races, it's a system-level effect that looks like segregation because the end result is that the races are separate --- these are not meaningless distinctions, it matters if the races are separate because (i) they tend to group together in different neighborhoods, plus neighborhoods are separated by wealth, and there is a pre-existing racial inequality in wealth, vs (ii) government policies target black people and keep them segregated from whites - one of these involves government-sanctioned racism, the other does not)      e) this effect exists in many major US cities, not just Baltimore      f) Overall, effects of past racist policies still exist, and the injustices towards black families still impacted by racist policies (which took place in their own lifetime) have not been addressed  5) lasting effects of segregation result in higher poverty and crime rates --> leads to increased policing of black neighborhoods  (note: because they are poor and crime-riddled, not because they are black --> even if the fact that they are black neighborhoods and past segregationist policies is what led to these neighborhoods being poor and crime-riddled - and thus highly policed - it is still NOT the case that the reason why those neighborhoods are being policed at a higher rate is BECAUSE they are black neighborhoods --> these are not meaningless distinctions, it matters if these neighborhoods are highly policed because they're full of crime and poverty vs because they're full of black people: one is a racist policy, the other is not)  6) blacks are disproportionately incarcerated (e.g. for marijuana possession, which is becoming legalized and monetized by white entrepreneurs)  Conclusion: 'oppressive circumstances' exist for black people, caused by 'unjust conditions' that haven't been addressed (note: not scare-quotes, actually quoting Contra here)    * Now, let's analyse the argument. *  First off, Contra is trying to prove that America is still racist. As someone who studied philosophy, Contra should have realized that the argument is logically invalid - that is, even if we accept every single on of the premises above, it does not follow that there exists even a single racist policy in the USA today, nor that American society is oppressing black people.   She's convincingly argued that past racist policies in the past have led to inequalities between blacks and whites (blacks and whites remain largely separated into different neighborhoods in major cities; greater poverty, crime, lack of socioeconomic opportunity, incarceration, and high police presence are worse in black neighborhoods than white neighborhoods). But she has not demonstrated that these inequalities are the result of current racist policies, that America is still racist, that systemic racism exists in the US, nor that black people are currently being oppressed by American society.   In fact, from her argument, the only correct conclusion to draw is that PAST racist policies led to the present racial inequalities, not that PRESENT racist policies exist. Racial inequalities exist, yes, but they are not the result of ongoing oppression of black people - they are the result of past oppression. These problems must be addressed, make no mistake, and I think that there is very good case to made that black families influenced by government-sanctioned racist policies (e.g. redlining) should be compensated. But these problems are the lingering effects of past systemic racism - they are not the continuation of systemic racism. If America focuses on the problems existing today and instead of people crying 'racism' at a social system which is struggling mightily to overcome its recent history of racism, but which is NOT racist anymore, then maybe Americans could actually quit it with the polarized Liberal/Republican politics and get stuff done. Centrism is the way forward."

"Women like to have a large variety of choice when it comes to genes, so they have no problems with men of other races. And men raised by single mothers are educated this way. But for ''true men'', it's the complete opposite. The presence of men of different races on their territory is a threat to them, they represent a competition for ressources and women. Leftism, which is mainly a female thing, is pro migrants, cosmopoliticism and multiculturalism. And alt right, which is mainly a male thing, is against all of that. But men are the ones who build civilizations, and they are the ones who will have the last word. Women will just follow the winners (who ever they are) and bear their children, as they always did."
"Is it okay to believe that institutional racism exists AND that black people sometimes just do bad things?"
"Fabulous. Utterly fabulous.  The lead theory passed under my radar.  Knew redlining, didn't see the maps before or the whole progression. That thing about 4% population and 22% incarceration is SAD, hugely sad, in the Land of the Free, particularly with the vast majority non-white.  SOMETIMES Black incarceration is Black crime, but sometimes it's lead and sometimes it is just ... systemic.  I need to mention some .. contra .. points as well. A woman named Carol Swain running for Mayor of i think Memphis, her professorship job is under assault.  She is a Black woman from a poor family -- unsurprisingly now battling racists -- who eventually obtained a Law Degree -- insanely difficult struggles, much stacked against her, far beyond my capacity --- who apparently has some moderately unorthodox views on Muslims and on Black race issues.  So apparently minority BLACK STUDENTS and WHITE LIBERALS ALLIES HAVE A PETITION TO GET THIS BLACK WOMAN SUSPENDED OR FIRED FROM TEACHING LAW AT PRINCETON for having non-conformist views, although she did not seem to be doing any seriously-provocative trolling.  Such as Jesse 'do you love white people' Peterson.  Speaking of near the end of the video, I just watched Coleman Hughes, a former flat-out Black social justice warrior teen from an upper class mostly white school system.  He was speaking with a respectful Evergreen College alumni Benjamin Boyce.  He writes for Quillette.  No links, just search if you want.  Very keen 'inside' insights.  Coleman Hughes rejects the argument that the #1 Black problem in America today is Whites or the White system.  (The points Contra raises contradict his views to some extent, how much I can't say.  I don't have a right to tell this Black man how wrong he is about Black issues.)  One of his points is that Black girls in upper class schools performed better than White girls in college and careers and income, so it seems non-obvious that racism plays much of a role in those circumstances, yet Black boys in the same upper class schools end up performing in school and career and crime as poorly as lowest class Whites.  (Coleman Hughes does not deny the existence of White racism, unlike other right wing Black spokesmen.)  His personal observation of his own childhood peers is what amounts to a Black Male machismo 'game' coupled with hostility to 'acting White' and 'status-seeking' among a dozen or two dozen 'woke' peers contributes to these poor statistics, and that *community leaders and liberals won't talk about that at all* .  His mother removed him (but not his sister) from that mixed public school environment when she recognized these 'social problems' among Black male kids, and placed him in a private school where status-seeking of a 'White-mode' was more appropriate.  This led to better adult outcomes in a professional culture shaped by past White culture rather than Black nationalism or gangsta culture.  Jewish immigrants had to rise up out of that Purple Gang shit too.  SORRY.  It hurts my feels to say this.  It feels rotten, bad, and mean like I'm WHITE SCUM infected by Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor.  I'm actually an Ashkenazi Jew who Spencer would demand be deported to Israel.  Spencer's .. uh .. fans? ... comrades? .. haters for not being rad enough? ... would sooner feed me into the ovens.  30 foot high ovens built by Trump. All Views Matter so I think Coleman Hughes balanced view deserves attention as well as the UTTERLY APPALLING racism revelations presented by Contra."

"I understand that racism is a thing and it's awful and I've been on the receiving end of it as a Jew. (Yes, Jews are also an ethnic group, not just a religious one.) I understand that black people have it especially bad and always have. What I don't understand is what I'm supposed to do about it. I don't have money to donate to causes, and I don't have time or energy to volunteer due to chronic illnesses. I would love to help, but I don't know how. I keep hearing about these issues and I'm not trying to dismiss them, I just don't know what you want me to do about it. And hearing it this often means I can't help but feel you want me to do something, but no one tells me what that is."
"Videos like this put me at sanity's edge. I can't think rationally and frankly I get thoughts worth censoring more than racial slurs. I'm really that disgusted...  That said, take care of yourself.

As you adopt a self-preserving way of life, hopefully you'll help those around you and that wellness will eventually spread to the areas that need it most."

"Freddie Gray also had arrest records for burglary and assault. So not just a struggling dealer trying to escape the ghetto. Gray thrived in the ghetto. Robbing, beating people and dealing narcotics. He's not forced into these things, he engaged in them because he wanted to get ahead of people and was happy to wrong them to do so.  Also resisting arrest is never ever ever ever ever going to work. That's not how cops work. When will blacks fucking realize this?"
"I think the problem here is widespread lack of empathy. These idiots who think black people have no reason to complain clearly have no idea what it's like to grow up black in America, nor do they seem to care. To privileged white people, they exist merely for them to point at and say, 'Why can't you people be great like me? Why can't you just pull yourselves out of the gutter like I never had to?'"
"'Black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and are subject to more aggressive policing.' Look at that statement. Did you ever think maybe just maybe black neighborhood are more policed because as you said they have more crime. That's just common sense."

"(Slightly?) off topic, about the 'deserved to die' expression. People living in the countries where's a death sentence seem to have this worldview of certain people deserving to die (mafia mentality, western movies mentality; revenge as justice). Those who are convinced that a death sentence is the way to a better, more peaceful, or more responsible society (this is bullshit reasoning) should remember that it is only their cultural, collective skewed logic. There are millions of people representing an opposite poin of view. For instance: I live in an insignificant post-communist country that, flawed as it may be, doesn't kill its citizens in the name of the law. And even better: it doesn't kill innocent people sentenced to death by mistake."
"nobody can never do anything about their situation, all the time...unless you're a vegetable. on the same hand, you also can't do everything about your situation...all the time.   how is this a discussion?  conservatives are right. black people dropping out of school at higher rates than other races...does them a huge disservice in getting a leg up in the economy. like no fucking duh. anyone that does that might have the same issue...unless you drop out because you're a rare genius and already have the resources to start up some major company. rare.  And children with only one parent DO fair worse and people who have children sooner than they're financially able to....DO WORSE in the economy. this isn't alt-right conspiracy it's fact.  Liberals are also right that poverty can be cyclical...if your poor nutrition or other poverty induced conditions leads to health problems that leads to inability to do well in school or get employed....which can lead to high crime.   I wish politics didn't include so many false dichotomies. like everyone shut up you're both pretty much right.    But I didn't know this stuff about lead paint disproportionately effecting poor blacks! that's some very good new info! thanks for that :)"
"I do agree we have a moral responsibility as a collective to fight injustice. HOWEVER, from what I've witnessed, I do not believe the way the collective is fighting the injustice is as effective as it could be. I will admit that I could very well be wrong, by the way, because my experience with these protesters is fairly limited to online discourse...  You touch on individualism and how people need to better themselves the best they can despite oppressive circumstances. I think this is the best part of the video and I wish the collective would touch on this topic more. Doing so isnt victim blaming the people who are unable to achieve success, its encouragement for the people who are able to achieve success. People need to understand and put emphasis on the fact that the most productive way to change racism in this country isn't to convince others that racism exists. Racists gonna race, killers gonna kill, and rapists gonna rape. You may convince some people to stop being racist, but in the end people still need to get out of poverty. You aren't gonna have a big wig, cigar smoking racist say 'Ive realized the error of my ways, heres money to get out of the ghetto and move into our white neighborhood. Have fun!' The most you can hope for is that police treat them more fairly, but unfortunately it often has the opposite effect and scares the police officers into being more aggressive. Whoops.  (Edit: You might could also hope for policy change, but I never hear about that and it never seems to be something that is focused on by protesters? That or news outlets and internet users are horrible at informing me of these things)  Its not realistic. Its not a solution. The solution has always been that people in ghetto communities need to take advantage of whatever systems are in place, work hard, and move to a new community (or even better, improve the community you're in). This isn't just a solution for minorities either, there are rural redneck white communities that I'd give the same advice to. If you want to better the community, a big part of that is focusing on yourself first. Like the Michael Jackson song says, 'I'm starting with the man in the mirror.' My only request is that before yelling into the loud speaker do the internal introspection to ensure its not just a bunch of white noise that results in no change, or worsens, the circumstance."
"You are officially my favourite YouTube channel. I have migrated from the whiskey-swilling dens of Peterson and Rogan, and graduated to the  heroin of Contrapoints.  Maybe one day I‚Äôll be able to break all the bad habits. Well, one at a time.  I‚Äôve realised something in the course of your videos.

I can‚Äôt seem to perpetually bear other people‚Äôs concerns in mind, like I would ideally want to. Something else always gets in the way, like; ‚Äúhow am I going to be more successful?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I being creative enough?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can I learn to eat less?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is the next fuck going to come from?‚Äù It‚Äôs difficult to stay interested in other people, because my own self seems like such a fucking emergency all the time.

In other terms, just because you suddenly call out on every racist act of yours and others, the roots of racism will still persist. Superficial solutions will inevitably lead to ignorance of the real people of subject. This is why I loved the movie 'Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri'. That movie didn't try to shove some lazy leftist agenda down your throat; instead it showed the deep, personal insight of all these issues and brought attention to the always personal growth of humans which can finally lead to change."

People are required to enforce law. When people ignore the law, apply it in an inequitable manner, or find loopholes that allow them to skirt the law, then the law is useless to those it was meant to protect. These small-minded xenophobic apes never seem to recognize this. Hmm... I wonder why..."

People are just hungry or poor or you name it. I looked at your map and I felt overwhelmingly angry, and stupid, because of the parallels that I would mention and the clear lines on the map matched. I will be so much more cognizant when I try to explain my city to my friends from outside of the area from now on. You educated me a lot on a city i'm proud to be in and have graduated from. I'm an alumn from VERY close to north avenue, and I graduated 2 weeks after the riots had us bunkered down in dorms even if you were a commuter like me. Even then i was proud to be considered a baltimoron, and i intend to be a better one from now on."

"Your channel is so unique, I'm obsessed üòÇ educational and WACK This video is great btw, i just wanna get this thought out there as I'm kinda thinking about this a lot lately after shitty stuff has happened - I don't feel responsible for the actions of historical white people, though I recognise I benefit from their actions. The reason I don't feel responsible is actually nothing to do with race, more to do with the fact that there are cunts of every sort and I don't think aligning the behaviour of dickheads with an entire race makes any sense. Anyone of any race can and will be a cunt. There's historical examples of africans enslaving eachother long before westerners arrived, that doesn't affect my view on whether today's African people are good people or responsible for that fact. I do think we need to do our bit to level the playing field, but the fact is it IS a common thing to just get called racist, not for expressing any particular opinion (because having been best friends with a black girl who became increasingly extreme in her views about what I owed her as a white person, I kept mine to myself for years anyway until I snapped) but simply for agreeing with a different opinion or requesting to voice one. There's a very loud portion of the sjw movement made up of usually financially and advantageously privileged people, many of them white but not all so, who while following a very homogenous set of 'values' also somehow have a very individualistic stance on topics - in short, you can agree with their version but not the version of someone else who is literally someone of colour and therefore their opinion is just as valid (if not more, depending on who you're arguing with)."

"I have a bit of a deal with white shame that is actually pretty racist, both against myself and against others.  Now I don't know what my comment here would actually achieve. It is not the search for a discussion or even really a very reasoned thought, just an emotion. I gosh darnit hope nobody can link this to the real me so here goes. I am a white man, like the kind that would have been wasp were I to be an American. Europeans/north Americans what have you have been decently busy conquering the world and subverting other people and generally being racist. While I do not discount entirely the ability of other groups that they 'could' have done such a thing were they as powerful (a bit of self defense) I am merely stating the obvious that it was the group that I can be counted among did these horrible things. Social and economic penalties imposed on certain groups still carry large amounts of effect on said groups and I must recognize that I can have an easier time because of that, not even mentioning unaware racism. Basically whatever I do that makes me successful is in my mind largely the product of a sort of always  existing bias that benefits me. There are less non-whites that are ceo's and whatnot, there are less rich black Europeans that are successful, our nations are richer. But it feels stifling, not that good at all, it feels very much as if I did not deserve my succes and that I cannot be proud of everything I achieve since I have taken a chance from someone else that had to overcome more struggles. But I also feel less proud because I never really had those struggles. Others can look back on what they had to do to get there and can be celebrated for them overcoming the hinderings. But when I get into a group of successful students or such I am 'too much'.  That all sounds greatly jealous and not actually coming from the mind of one that is looking to better the lives of minorities for their sake but more for the sake of my own mental comfort that what I achieved is my own. I do care about their plight because I cannot say I am jealous of their actual surroundings and worse life situations.   But I guess here comes the kicker,  it affects who I want to date. I exclude one race of women from my dating pool, white women. Were I to date another white women not only would I have to deal with white guilt my kid would as well be fully white. Dating with an Asian girl is not an option either because white men benefit from privilege in dating those severely. No, better to date a black woman and spare my children from being white. I could raise them in the same circumstances and financial security as whites but they would not be white. They can be proud of what they achieve because everyone will see them as black, they will suffer bias in looking for jobs but whatever they achieve in life (maybe added by the help of a privileged dad) they can be more proud of since they achieved it themselves. Basically I just swipe left to each white girl hoping to grab that black mama that can help me, but of course she must never find this out.  Basically I am just a friggin selfish prick that wants his kids to grow up not having to hate themselves and being proud of what they achieved. I cannot save myself but I can at least have kids that can, maybe their skin will help them achieve less but less with more pride. But in order to achieve that I will just racisty have to pick up a girl who must not realize my goals and I just hate it all. I have no clue why I feel this way and it makes very little sense and if anyone even worries to read this I will get much hate for it."
"I really appreciate all the care and research you put into your pieces, both in the content and the delivery. You unpack things so well, and so fairly. I literally learn important things every time I watch one of your videos. Thank you. <3"

"Then why people self-segregate in London? Are all of them racist? People want to live among people that have a similar amount of money and have similar habits. I find that completely normal."
"I love your videos. Despite this i must say there are alot of things that require a better degree of nuance. I've lost alot of my patience when it comes to arguing about these things. I love the way you show multiple points of view even if they're hyperbolic and sometimes are borderline strawmen like, but its still very apreciated. I've been binging your videos and some of them, including this one have opened my eyes in relation to a few things but i still feel like a lot of bias is involved and alot of the things you say are contradictory, a few times hypocritical and slightly misinformed. But in this information age its easy to find things that aren't true, because soome people just want to believe them really hard.  Great videos all around though, i have subscribed."
"It's funny how you say at this point you'll stop taking about Alt-Right stuff so much.  I just now started watching your videos, like, my first video was your Incel video kind of new watcher.  Since then I've been trying to burn through your back catalog (this here is a repeat watch), but I've found myself getting less and less interested as I go back because it's all just arguments against and responses to Alt-Right shit.  It's... kind of boring now in 2018, now that that shit so damn played out.  So yes, I'm going to say I agree and hope your continued videos are about more varied topics as they have been going back about a year."
"I'm 29 like you and yeah, you nail all of these topics. So so good."
"Smart and plays the piano!! Wowzers you ROCK!"
"9:06 - I'm curious as to how Hawkins bought the house in the first place. I'd figure the real-estate folks back then would also be just as racist, or was buying a house handled through different protocols back then?

"I really think you should have a discussion with Tommy... Tommy Sotomayor."
"WTF? So you make your spiel about racism in America and then you make this racist point about the white guy's business of selling weed being 'gentrification of marijuana' (which I guess you see as part of black culture)? The lack of self-awareness..."
"1 issue with the video: you seem to frame redlining as if the policy itself is a past phenomenon that has only shaped current racial divisions in cities when modern paired testing continues to show that lending/insurance institutions and rental property owners are still using the policy and to a widespread degree to maintain these divisions.  Otherwise, another excellent video, I'm loving your work and I'm really happy to have found your channel recently (as well as Three Arrows, Shaun, Lindsay Ellis, Rational Disconnect, hbomberguy, and Knowing Better), at a time when my faith in youtube as a whole had reached an all time low thanks to people like the armored skeptic, sargon, etc."
"Here‚Äôs my argument for race debates,  Some person (insert random memory name here) : ‚Äúblah blah blah racism is bad‚Äù Me : ‚Äútrue‚Äù Same person : ‚Äúwhy do people think it doesn‚Äôt exist?‚Äù  Me : ‚Äú don‚Äôt know‚Äù Person who just can‚Äôt read me being unwilling : ‚Äúwe should do something about it‚Äù Me : ‚Äú I‚Äôm good‚Äù Person who‚Äôs name still isn‚Äôt know : ‚Äú do you not believe in racism???‚Äù Me : sigh ‚Äú I believe it‚Äôs still around and actually does cause harm, but I‚Äôm sitting here typing this out past midnight cause I can barely handle myself and actually stick to a proper sleep schedule, so before I go trying to save people I‚Äôm gonna work on myself so that I‚Äôm good first‚Äù"
"So you were willing to acknowledge the weed arrest stat but not the other stats which explain black people‚Äôs riskier buying habits, most of those arrest being in high crime areas (aka more cops walking around), and such. Then you point to a guy getting rich selling weed in which I can only assume he practices in a state like California or Colorado which legalized the practice.  I get the lead paint thing and that‚Äôs awful, it‚Äôs probably something the state should fix with upmost scrutiny but are you really not to going to acknowledge the whole deadbeat dads, not graduating highschool, and inability to get into a healthy marriage as valid reasons why black people (who tend to practice and normalize these behaviors) tend to stay in low-income communities?   There have been all kinds of attempts to correct the housing wrong, but the reality is that the only long-lasting solution is to educate young folks in those areas on the risks of irresponsible behavior and really give them a fair shot at living a better life than their parents which they completely have if they are willing to get out of the mindset of ‚Äúthe world is against me‚Äù. All teens go through it, but I think we all agree it‚Äôs entirely unproductive"

Also Hail Satan and his main man AronRa for letting me know. ;D"
"White America: Enslave black people for 200 years, emancipate them when you have no choice but make them second class citizens. Make polices to keep a race of people in the shittiest neightbourhoods, with the shittiest schools so they can't get a decent education and therefore work. Pump lead in their water to give them health problems and make it more likely that crime occurs. Disproprtionaltely punish them for crimes that whites also comit.  Also White America: Well obviously it's all their fault, why don't they just tighten their pants and work harder?"
"I think the issues of race are more complex than people on right and some people on left  want to admit . The Fred gray issue the police acted way to harsh. I get Freddie Gray wasn't a saint but that's not excuse to kill someone"
"'I don't care about the continued meteoric paced growth of far-right extremists gathering their forces beyond their failed public leaders to be on pace of forming a formidable political militant force so I'll just rage about these non-threatening religious zealots and normie Trump supporters instead'  'So then where will you be when civil war returns to America?'  'Probably face down in the f@g ditch with the rest of the g@ys because first they came for the communists to be thrown from helicopters, but I didn't speak out because I wasn't a dirty red commie....'  'Oh....yeah, that'll do it.'    Like...‚Ä¶.what THE FUCK? No really though, why are *any* of the white nationalist 'leaders' in America *still* alive? Also why are their credible threats and continued generational influence still ignored so heavily to the point that some Mormons wearing fairytale underwear beneath their coordinated suits coming to your door are still more threatening of a force to be reckoned with, eh? Besides ContraPoints, HBomberguy and Shaun, I maybe know at least 4 other debunkers of religious zealotry for each person taking their time to follow the rise and prominence of far-right domestic terrorism almost exclusively.   Seriously guys, if we are to defeat the institution of fascist capitalism, then we need to treat these far-right white nationalists for the serious threat they truly are."
"17:10"
"1:50 I just realized what an amazing video/show it would be to compile all the 'friends/roommates' sections of videos into one. So you have one woman trying to do these videos, and she keeps getting interrupted by the communist cat girl, the nazi girl, etc. it would be amazing to see as a compilation."
"They did similar things to jewish people in europe. They were forbidden from owning land and basically coerced into moneylending due to the catholic restriction on usury for christians. Then when times got tough and they couldn't repay their loans, or just didn't want to, they fabricated some bullshit so they could slaughter them. This pattern cemented them as the perennial scapegoat for anything and everything."
"A n o t h e r interview with Richard Spencer"

"Just for some honest nuance, take a look at that Chicago map. Most of the redlined areas are NOT black neighborhoods. Even the far south side is not redlined. Some of the most famous and historical black areas in the US are not redlined on that map.  There were clearly racist policies, but redlining was a mixed bag, having more to to with urban decay and poverty than race."

"I love your channel. I consider myself a classical liberal and you have done an excellent job at making me think about some of the pre conceived notions I've had after I graduated LAW SCHOOOOOoooolllllll....But in this instance I do have to say that the issue we should be discussing isn't the targeting of minorities by police, but rather the extra judicial latitude given to police in this country to roll the dice on probable cause and initiate an arrest with a citizen. Though I do agree that there is a healthy disparity in the number of arrests made against people of color, I think the real question we have to grapple with is, what is the role of the police in this country, in a democracy, that continues to have a dichotomous conversation on the importance of security (personal firearms, militarization of police, war on drugs) visa vi the importance of maintaining personal liberties. Perhaps its time for the government to trust its citizens a little more and give up some of the monopoly of violence."
"Oh, golly, this video brought out the chuds. More often than not, they're like 'this is all very illogical, white privilege, feh!'. then 'incidentally, race realism is totally logical, and white men are really being discriminated against the most'. so, uh, mix of idiots and shitposters. I should not be touching this poop. but oh boy do I like a good poop-touchin'. Some other Contra videos seem to have more coherent haters, or at least haters where the mask hasn't completely slipped. but mention racism, and it brings people out of the woodwork that think they can successfully argue racism isn't a thing while themselves saying pretty racist stuff, or having a username/avatar referencing intense racist stuff."
"I feel like I need to listen to your statement at 18:13 every morning."
"It‚Äôs so obvious that from the moment of birth everyone is inundated with a myriad of seemingly insuperable environmental influences that this cult of personal responsibility takes a religious tone.

"Not to ignore all the great points you brought up in this video but *holy shit your German is so good?* Fuck that caught me off guard"
"This is the fault of the system and the state. If you want to help black people, target the state. Stop force feeding white people complaints about how privileged we are via social media. It's not gonna inspire white people to help because most people aren't even AWARE and you cannot generate awareness by means of listing complaints about white people to white people's faces. That should be obvious and if you have some excuse in your head as to why white people would sit there and listen to an angry bitter monologue about how terrible we are, then you're just downright stupid. Black people definitely wouldn't even stand for it. You want help, ask for a hand up, but don't bite the hand that lifts you."
"I found this channel last night at 2:30 after 2.5 hours of stomach aches and nausea and I honestly believe your videos healed me lmao, I was entertained and happy and distracted and watched several videos even after the pain had faded away..

They know much of this information, especially the bit about racism not ending with the end of Jim Crow law. They've chosen to ignore it; Hearing it again doesn't invalidate the information, but they are thinking 'oh shit, this again lmao, fucking leftists'. These modern nazis are so mentally far gone I'm struggling with if there is even a way for them to be turned away from those toxic points of view.  It's not *actually* a problem with the video, but the people it is adressing.  Echoes, bubbles. Echo chambers in a bubble of toxic ideas. Can you fight it? I don't know...  *I DON'T KNOW!*"
"Contrapoints: you have a refreshing talent which somehow is beyond definition, hence quite unique, singular, beguiling even."
"its not that i don't care about black people. it's just i don't care about any people i feel like a solution for that house thing is the government should be forced to pay 25% of a black persons home as retribution. Im sure the whites won't like that so throw a incentive for them to move into homes in red lined areas. Which would increase the value of them ares because you know... white people love renovating houses and then the black people still living there can sell there houses for a better value and live in nicer houses. I don't know, thats my suggestion I don't live in your country and in general Americans seem so winy... But i like your videos , you are funny lady and although i don't entirely agree with your views i understand where your coming from."

"Yes. Everything and everyone is 'ist' something all the time. Should anyone deny that they are an 'ist' of some sort (some sort of stupid, chauvinistic, Ill read hateful bigot) they are lying. Or they are unconscious. They will stubbornly refuse to admit to witchcraft no matter how insistent you are...so what to do with these white supremacists? What to with white supremacists who are NOT white. It seems that ist and ism is STRUCTURAL. It is everywhere. It is invisible, undetectable, like the universal aetheric substance of phlogiston and the four humours. It is like magic. It is the cause and the effect of everything. It is everyone and everything. The solution is to hate everyone and everything with your purest and most righteous hatred. Above all NEVER read any economics or history books because they are full of ist and ism ideas that might infect your mind with unclean ideas...ideas beyond hammers and nails...ideas beyond hatred and despair. Do NOT look up Tom Sowell on YouTube. He has ideas above his proper station that are treacherous and.......uppity."

"FBI: At least 29,437 whites were killed by blacks from 1976-2005 in USA.

"Tighten your belts and do less crimes"
"5:31 As someone who's not of the left, but also not an American, this is the thing about the rhetoric around US Police killings that I find most disturbing. If someone is committing a crime (though I have to question why possessing certain types of knife needs to be criminal) then that's a good reason to arrest them using the minimum necessary force. It's not a good reason to summarily execute them. If they run, maybe chase them (or if you know who they are, just come back and arrest them later, it's not like there's a ticking clock here). But the police should only kill people if there's an imminent danger that can be prevented by killing someone, and it concerns me that this opinion does not appear to be all that mainstream.  You have a great channel BTW, I came across it recently, and I've enjoyed hearing your perspective on different issues and you have a real flair for production."

Also what do you propose to fix racist America. Shouldn‚Äôt we should be fixing our school systems then blame it on racism. Look I don‚Äôt deny that racism exists but why is racism so readily used. I do believe what you say about the prison system is right. I hope the prison system is changed. I am glad you link your sources."
"Racist is a Hate word for Whites. Prove me Wrong."
"It's honestly common sense at this point right?

There would also be more police stops of white pedestrians in white neighbourhoods... of course there is still a big problem with police not going to white neighbourhoods to stop people at a similar rate... i guess this is probably what you were trying to say Just the wording of that is kinda misleading or is it just something i¬¥m missing? please tell me if i¬¥m wrong or i didn¬¥t get the point...."

"my parents are both white and had to steal toilet paper from the library because they were poor, i went to a large black school outside of chicago growing up, we lived in a black neighborhood.... its almost like it has to do with culture and not race.  Instead of working hard in school people in poverty would rather have ten kids at the age of 16 and do drugs, in the modern age if you fuck up in life it is 9/10 times your fault, no matter what race you are - i have poor white friends and rich black/ brown friends, its time to stop blaming white people and cops for all your problems, this victim mentality shit has got to go"
"they're right though, black men only make up 6% of the population but commit over 50% of crimes in america.. how is that institutional racism? 77% of black babies born in 2017 were from single black mothers, statistics show that a fatherless household leads to delinquency in the children, again how is that white people's fault? Maybe american black culture is the problem, not white people"

"I, as a True Progressive Left Democrat, am an active member and SINCERE SUPPORTER of Color Of Change, Black Lives Matter, John Lewis Civil Rights Leader and all other Antiracist and Pro-African American Organizations, TOOK EVERY SINGLE ACTION ASKED FROM THEM, including my donations when I could and of what tiny income I could when I was in America for nearly two full decades etc.... to the point that my email inbox is still clogged. Am not by birth American, am the Legal Permanent Resident of America 'cause I immigrated to America owing to HIAS from the Yugoslavian Wars back in 1997 which ruined, disabled and brutally stole my civilian teenage years, I barely survived the bush-cheney's era in America and I vowed if another repuKKKeblican ever becomes the president again, I'll leave America 'cause obviously it's a wrong country for me and that's what I did in 2016, now I'm in the DISSIDENT EXILE and in visit to my parents who stayed in my very city and country of origin, and again in existential jeopardy 'cause nothing indeed improved in countries of former Yugoslavia since monstrous nineties here . Am in constant touch with all American True Progressives. The thing is, however, that I hoped that the United Antiracist Americans in America would have carried the Progressive Revolution, and, I mean, the Progressive Revolution INCL. RIOTS, TOTAL CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, TOTAL RESISTANCE by now, exactly according to the  Martin Luther King's ContraPoints and Antiracists OF ALL RACES UNITED and African American Progressive Revolutionary Unity which should have been formed long ago, and this Progressive Revolution in America, if there has ever been a time to be carried out, it's been in this time of monstrous trump-pence the worsest repuKKKe's administration unprecedented in American history even incl. the American Civil War, since 2016 onwards. But, to my dismay, nothing really revolutionary has been done except these preachings to the choir like these YouTube Blogs and Channels, and constant countless and always the same petitions, signatures,..., and, of course, exhortations of money from us the very supporters who are making possible for the Antiracist organizations to exist, in the first place. So, long story short, enough of preaching and posing to the choir, get activated and you know what I mean, ACTIVATED EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF THE HOUR OF THE DAY YES EVERY SINGLE EFFING DAY, ESPECIALLY UNDER THIS EVIL TRUMP-PENCE REPUKKKE ADMINISTRATTION, IN EVERY PRODUCTIVELY PROGRESSIVE ANTIRACIST AND GENERALLY TRULY PROGRESSIVE WAYS to show that you walk the talk not just talk the talk."

I'll definitely donate my monies to your patreon account.  Weird question, what are your pronouns?  I keep telling people how much I love your videos but I'm always hesitant to declare she or him, so I typically use they/their.  A fellow fan linking a video would also suffice."
"I finally get why I put off listening to Contrapoints. I'm a brown skinned Bangladeshi, and I've grown up in either western countries or my homeland and experienced basically no racism. Listening to contra makes me feel petty and envious of white people. When I listen to say, Jordan Peterson I feel like I can put my life back together any second. When I listen to Ben Shapiro, I feel like I can achieve something if I'm honest and stick to my strengths. It's unfortunate Contrapoints, but you're not championing any good cause here, you're detrimental to people's development. On a side note, you're still hilarious and love the jokes and costumes."

How come a large part of this video explaining the circumstances of Freddie Gray's arrests and death was recycled from the Anatomy of an uprising video? Were you trying to refine an argument that you already made or are you being forced to reiterate your point several times?"
"Well this was a joke and waste of time"
"I am not arguing that racism does not exist, it absolutely does.  But when trying to use the Freddy Gray murder in conversation with right-wingers, how do you respond to the following:  1. 3 of the 6 cops that killed Freddy Gray were black.  2. Baltimore is ran by the Democrats with a black mayor, police chief, etc. etc.  So clearly the left is not doing anything to help any racist problems you think exist.  ?"

So the priest lost."

"I actually came back to hear you sing and play piano again. And I don't know if it's a good thing but you make me less uncomfortable now, I think.  Though now when I think about it, don't you feel stupid? I mean I'm sure you don't, but I know I would. I don't mind wearing women's clothing, but only for theatrical reasons. Maybe you do too, but from what I took away from your videos, you might walk around in these get ups all day. Yeah, I would feel dumb. Reminds me of the story of the ant and the tiger in the first act of Jade Empire, which is actually a great game. Story wise I mean. The fighting mechanics were weird. Anyway, you seem to enjoy your get ups and your subscribers don't seem to mind either, so good for you, I guess. I don't know. Your sets are well design though, and your videos aren't boring. The German is also okay. But none of that compares to you sitting on the piano and singing. I really enjoy that. More of that please."

"Love this !"
"I feel so ignorant, I knew this oppression was gonna on, but I didn't realize how big of an impact it was. It really breaks my heart to see my past self defending some talking points Racist make. I'm glad I kept most of this stuff in my head. Being black myself I always criticize my own community, because I want to see them get better. Stay after school to help them with their homework, always gave them discounts when I could at my job, forgave them when they attacked me for not really being 'black'. I really don't know why couldn't see my bigotry before. I want to give more then just sympathy or empathy, I want to give value again. Thank ya Contra"

"This is a good-ass video."
"I don‚Äôt think I heard a single mature or valid point."
"All your points on racism in my opinion only managed to point out injustice. Injustice is the crime. Racism is a possible motivation for that crime among many. And to 100% know the motivation for someone‚Äôs crime you‚Äôd need a mind reading device and you don‚Äôt have that.  Even when it seems pretty clear, almost indisputably so, that an injustice was motivated by racism, you still 100% can not know. So focus on the thing we can know 100%, which is the injustice and you might have better luck.   Also i hope I‚Äôm not the only one that sees the irony that you start the video laughing at a group of people (white people) who are afraid that they are being oppressed and that things are being run by a certain race(Jewish people), but then turn around and empathize with a different group of people(black people) who are also concerned about being oppressed by a race (white people)"

Of course there was some straw manning, made up accusations ('BLM is post-modern'... wtf says that?), but overall it was well informed and researched. Nice job."
"I just discovered your channel yesterday. You rock! Much love."
"People should know more about the era of Reconstruction. For a very sort period in U.S history black Americans were able to do well. It wasn't untill the Democrats and KKK started to disenfrchise African Americans that there began to be problems.

"So you started throwing in 'classical liberals' like Bill Maher in with Neo Nazis? Explain? No one on our side is saying police brutality isn't a huge problem in the US. We are saying that it isn't just Africian Americians who have to deal with it, and that BLM isn't constuctive in its approach. They don't engage in politics they Just yell at people and yell 'we want dead cops'. I don't see how for the life of me tryign to start a race war helps anyone.  Systemic problems need systemic solutions, instead they pull a 'tabby'and act like they are so clever.  Even as reasoned as you seem to be you do the thing where you pile everyone who has a disagreement with you into a 'basket of deplorables' and shut shut down real discussion.  You like talking at people, not with them.   Someone suggest having a Transparent public entity conduct inquiries on police brutality.  1: Take the investigations away form the Police.  2: Provide more officers with non-violent crisis intervention training. Giving police the tools to talk people down and acess threats before escalating to lethal violence.  3: Some level of counciling to officers after dealing with life threatning situations, as to bring shel shocked officers 'back down to earth'  This is a tennable 1st step that on its own stands to increase the likely hood of consequences for bad actors while overall recuding the total number of incidents."

"And if YOU want to have an honest discussion about it maybe YOU shouldn‚Äôt lie through your teeth.  There is ZERO statistical evidence you can point to that backs-up the claim that blacks are, in any way, unfairly targeted by the police.  Quite the contrary in fact.  They are the demographic the least likely to be shot in an encounter with the police.  Every study ever done, including the ones but infamous right-wing think tanks like Harvard and Washington State University (rolls eyes) confirm this.  There is one, any only one, reason more blacks are shot at a higher rate per capita‚Äîthey commit violent crimes at a frenetic rate compared to any other group.   That‚Äôs what happens when your culture glorifies violent criminals as heroes, ridicules education, and raises its children to see themselves as perpetual victims and does so in 75% fatherless households‚ÄîTHE NUMBER ONE PREDICTOR OF POVERTY AND CRIMINALITY WORLDWIDE.  Also unhelpful are trite, arrogant, hypocritical, bourgeoisie ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù who deliberately enable and encourage this nonsense to keep them in their place so as to position themselves as their magnanimous saviors and exploit them as a tame voting bloc.  On one point I will agree with you‚Äîracism in America IS growing at a disturbing rate.  I would say, however, that the REAL racism‚Äîthe dangerous and insidious kind that does actual harm as opposed to simply being ridiculous and without any social traction‚Äîcomes almost exclusively from the left.  It is back-handed, it wraps itself in mealy-mouthed claims of anti-racism, but is authentically racist in that ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù clearly think non-whites are inferior and need to be coddled like retarded children.  The left thinks non-whites can‚Äôt possibly do for themselves or compete on an equal footing with any hope of survival, let alone achievement.   You value these people too much as victims to want them to be anything else.  You are not these people‚Äôs friends.  You are manipulating and exploiting them for your own sense of self-righteousness and political gain.  Pretty fuckin‚Äô racist if you ask me‚Ä¶"

"Most liberals I come across I think are dumb and recite the same thing over and over again without facts. You though I kind of like listening to.

"Thanks for uploading this. Stevie Wonder sang a song that went: 'You might have the cash/but you can't cash in your face/we don't want you living in here'. As a black man, seeing so many things change and gentrification in my old neighborhood in Philly, it's becoming so real that racism and classism still exists.   Whether it's bumping up prices and taxes, buying people out of their homes or just the neighborhood deteriorating, the differences between how (for example) North Philly (minus the college area) and Center City (downtown) are being maintained is crazy. Philly is already a tough city, but you can tell where the cops are more present during certain times.  Racism has so many facets; housing is just one part. You would think by 2018 things would be better.   Not really.  Sometimes I ask, does America really want to change or does this country just love drama, ignorance and BS?"
"Wonderful. Intelligent. Researched. Thoughtful. Inclusive. Educational. Factual. Funny. These words accurately describe how I feel about every single video of yours I've seen.

"6:08  Conservative sources never suggested that Freddie had got what he deserved by suggesting he was no angel. Rather, it was in response to the media making him out to be an angel which he was not - so they provided his crime records"
"I agree with you about mass incarceration. No one should be in jail for non violent drug offenses. However, one thing that you didn't address is that a lot of times black activists, like members of blm for example, aren't asking for something reasonable like that. It really seems like 9 times out of 10, their 'solution' to the problem is that black people should get extra privileges under the law. Usually it's just simply 'give me money because I'm black'. Many people who you'd refer to as being part of 'right wing youtube' just simply do not agree with the idea of explicitly treating people differently under the law based on race. Some lean more to the left than the right, actually, but just simply do not agree with public social programs, for example, giving preference to people based on race rather than actual need. Urging people to change unjust laws, or work on their implicit bias is one thing, but advocating to change the law to explicitly benefit a particular race over another is taking it too far.   The problem with blm is that a lot of their members are actually unapologetic, hardcore race nationalists who have 0 principles and really do want the government to give them an unfair advantage over other people. Another huge problem that many reasonable centrists have with your average blm member is that that a lot of them completely reject civic nationalism (...like most hardcore ethno nationalists tend to do). I, and man other reasonable centrists, think that extreme ethno-nationalism is dangerous and will be the downfall of our country if it gets out of hand. However this also includes hardcore ethno-nationalism of non-white people. The problem here, I think, is that you're not actually going and asking blm members about their political views. You just assume the best.. because they're black probably lol. But meanwhile you get outraged at anyone who is in a protest that a white nationalist might happen to be at. You aren't being consistent. Try a thought exercise where you pretend that you aren't white. Maybe you're an alien who isn't a member of any race. And then take a look at humans and what they're doing, and try to evaluate it objectively."
"Hey, can I ask what song you have in the background, its really chill"
"You only have one argument which is good - quit the war on drugs (and jail for profit). One problem you need to deal with is that the majority of blacks themselves want to be segregated, it is not whites keeping blacks out (anymore).

"For an interesting alternative viewpoint (no pun intended): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrsNr-NGqE8"
"Drugs should be legal and regulated for adults. All drug related non violent criminals should be realesed from jail/prison. The reason black people are arrested more than whites for weed inspire of the data showing we all smoke weed at similar rates is because, 1. Black people do more crimes generally and their weed charges are auxiliary to the other charges. 2. I‚Äôm going out on a limb but I‚Äôd bet that even though whites and blacks SMOKE weed at similar rates, I‚Äôd bet blacks SELL+SMOKE weed at higher rates. The inclusion of possession with intent to sell is important, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be factored in. As well, pretty much every single metric of an event or pattern or happening that is used as evidence for systemic racism against blacks... can be flipped on its head and be used against Asians Arabs Jews and often African migrants against whites. Median income. Education rates. Drop out rates. Drug addiction. Arrest and imprisonment. Conviction rates. Teen pregnancy. Divorce. Business ownership. Name a fuckin thing that black Americans have worse than whites and I‚Äôd bet you thousands that you can find a different minority group that has that same thing BETTER than whites. It doesn‚Äôt sound like something that would happen in an outwardly pro white society and government and cultural structure. Same with the fact that over the last decade black Americans have been killing almost twice as many whites as vice versa. So... America‚Äôs racism. Jews Asians and Arabs earn more cash, are smarter, live long, dominating tech and medicine and the sciences, white male life expectancy is going down for the first time in peace time, the average Nigerian in America is better educated than the average white, the minority groups I mentioned are better educated, they have higher marriage rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, lower imprisonment rates, I‚Äôd bet they‚Äôre shot by cops disproportionately LESS than whites are, AND to top it all off, white people kill like 230 black over all while black people kill like 500. Oh and Muslim terrorists, if you include 9/11 or not, have killed more Americans than any other terrorist group in fewer attacks than the far right have attempted AND with a smaller total pool of Muslims in total. A list of things that in my mind... would never ever ever fuckin happen in a white supremacist system. And your lead paint appeal is weak as fuck. So is the poverty claim, which I used to appeal to. There‚Äôs more poor whites in total than there are poor blacks due to the pop ratio differences. Yet a larger pool of poor whites commit less violent crime than a smaller pool of poor blacks. As well, some of the absolutely poorest places in America don‚Äôt have crime rates even half as high as the worst black communities. Native American reservations. Appalachian shit holes. Desert dwelling trailer parks. Swamp fucks. Still don‚Äôt rob rape kill and fight like Baltimore or Chicago or DC. So, I don‚Äôt know. This comments too long as it is."
"Black incarceration is sort of a domino effect. Black people were treated bad by police, they have bad relations. They do more crime, they get locked up. Or shot. More bad relations and more crime and more shootings. Sucks. It is a war between two groups. (black people are also locked up more because police check them more and act more aggressive with them because of the domino effect)"
"America isn't a racist society."
"This was a great video. I don't agree with all of your points because you seriously try to down play individual choice. It seems there is a middle position between yours and those you mock in a very entertaining way.  I would definitely watch a debate on the scale of the effect these issues have had verses individual choice in the modern context of crime and race. I feel a civil debate from someone not completely against your position but not for it. Would generate a good discussion and bring 2 opposing sides closer to consensus."

"wow really struggling to make sense of your video due to you 'style' which kind of assumes I know what kind of shit revolves around in your head. 5 mins in and you give some example, yes it is a statistic of one which does not prove anything indeed often statistics of thousands have problems, such as black police officers are 3 times as likely to use their fire arms, conclusion? Black men are murderers. Is that logical? I mean they do commit much more murder than any other race.  Is that logical?"
"This is all great information. Really high production value. An interesting way of looking at things. I would like to have a civil discord with anyone who would afford me the same intent. Oh, I'm a Trump supporter. I'm going to go through the points made chronologically just to make a point here.   1910 - city blocks are segregated. Mayor at the time was Barry Mahool, a Democrat who signed the legislation into law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Barry_Mahool). Why wasn't that mentioned?  1934 - FHA backs home loans. It is mentioned that 'the next Baltimore mayor formalized this approach by forming an official Committee on Segregation' but the mayor's name or political party is not included. That mayor was James H Preston, a Democrat. It states in your article's citation, 'Preston was undaunted [...] he borrowed from Chicago a plan to keep Negros in their place' (http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&context=fac_pubs, p.791)  Since 1934 12 of the 14 mayors of Baltimore have been Democrats The last eight (and current) are all Democrats. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Baltimore).  You point out all these problems, yet the Democratic party has been in charge in Baltimore for the majority of the 100 years of which you address. If the Democratic party actually gave a fuck about lead paint and segregation, well, they've had 100 years of control in Baltimore to show their policies can make and enforce change. But they haven't.    The prison system is fucked. I'm with you on that. As far as black people being incarcerated at higher rates for weed, I would ask the question: is that the only reason these individuals were arrested? But that's something I'm too lazy to research right now. I think I've done enough research for one Youtube comment.    Go ahead, rail me as being a Nazi Fascist or whatever, but alongside the slander I would like to see some civil/rational discussion. Show me the Democratic party has members with a brain."

"Extra judicial executions shouldn't be a common thing? They aren't, that's why only a few instances per year in a nation of millions, and they're investigated and prosecuted. They also happen to white people like James Boyd. Freddie Gray's wasn't executed anyway, his spine was broken during arrest and he had no other injuries. Maybe the cop holding him down was too heavy or forceful, this shit happens, but they weren't trying to kill him or even hurt him when he died. In fact, the US incarceration rate is high because our execution rate is low compared to the amount of crimes being prosecuted. If you don't like so many crimes being prosecuted you should complain to the people who write so many laws (other leftists)."

"The majority of black people live in 'the hood' dangerous gang and drug infested areas in which poverty is the rule not the exception. Many a folk who live in these areas adjust to said life style in order to survive. That is why. partly. The other part is a perpetual motion machine in which black people are seen as dangerous. Thrown in jail. Inflating the number of 'black convicts' (just or unjust) making it more likely that black people are seen as dangerous in the first place. There are multiple factors to this and a lot of other issues."

About London that has now a murder rate equal to new york with the usual suspects, is that lead paint or bad housing schemes?."
"One of the hardest thing to explain is that right wingers aren‚Äôt always actively racist. I don‚Äôt think roaming millennial and her ilk are maliciously racist, although yes they are racist. And I know this because I used to use the same arguments. They just aren‚Äôt exposed to the counterpoints. Seeing larger context is hard, and reality and life is messy. They only know that they personally aren‚Äôt benefitted by being white, often because of economic reasons. So as they don‚Äôt see their own privilege and aren‚Äôt directly exposed to the reality of systemic racism they assume it‚Äôs not real.  But is it really any surprise America is still racist? De juro racial segregation isn‚Äôt that far removed in history. And in fact if you look at sentencing, arrest rates, etc, it seems it‚Äôs not over. So yeah, racism. Still a thing. And if you doubt that, watch the alt right stream of the Unite the Right rally. See how far you get without crying or throwing up."

"In the west there are no rules or laws written purely against those of a certain race any longer, however I am aware this by no means has a full affect on how some may view those of a different race. Parades, marches, Black Lives Matter etc are not helping sway racist minds. To be able to accept those of a different skin tone, origin, sex etc this means to relate to them as a HUMAN or recognize them as being NORMAL, and seeing them as YOUR people (seeing humans, not colours). Marching through the streets as one big group shouting, protesting and calling out racism in today's world will not allow people to see you as normal. This makes these minorities seem different, or a feeling of wanting to feel different is being brought into the equation. If all people of colour were living life and showing how they are like the rest of us and not just a part of the 'Black People' and instead part of 'Humanity' then racist people would have no reason to see them or treat them any different to how they'd treat one of the same skin tone. I and many others feel by using the terms 'White People' and 'Black People' and using these labels to hide behind as your own 'group/team' are ways of segregating yourself without realizing."

Ha, and it's exactly what it looks like! I'm realizing I've experienced the Black discussion ON TOP OF/INCLUDING the 'jewish question' so much these 2 years yet didn't realize the 'Jewish question' had actually been so prominent all my life. My mom's side is knee deep into the whole german thing, and it's nice when ppl get it. But every german knows what that's about & what that's like I guess.....? Especially the older generations. Young folks still struggle w/ how to express it but atleast there's modern day acceptance of fashion and music... Until twitter tweaks out speculating :-) Not rly sure if ppl think its weird how I always slide back n forth into these conversations so smoothly lol. *Ah, this crazy planet.*  Anyways I've seen both sides of diff. groups of people explain their arguments, from sensible to frivolous.

You seriously need to pull yourself by the 6 inch stilettos straps and shut up and walk among the human race. As it stands, you sit in the darkness behind a microphone and do nothing but blow your time in an effort l to align yourself with all of their alleged victims in our society.

"@ContraPoints      It doesn't appear that you have done enough research. Forced diversity within nations is why there is are never ending racial, cultural and religious conflicts. Racism for the most part is a anti-white propaganda bullshit word. Would you call someone a fatist if they had any unfavorable feelings of living around lots of fat people or dating fat people etc.? No. We all have preferences and we all discriminate because it is natural human behavior to do so. If we didn't we would never be able to choose the kind of environment we want to be in.

Your map showed that more than half of the redline area is now black in baltimore (good job defeating your point there?) and no, poverty isn't an excuse for crime. The description of BLM also seemed rather disingenous from what I've seen of their protests and rhetoric, and the description of the non-FHA loans is also emotionally manipulative. This is probably more of a class thing, I'm sure there's a history of poor non-blacks not benefiting. Anyway, as a non-American it was an interesting video."

"Very good video. You touch on a lot of great points. One thing I hope you do a future video on is some kind of overall game plan to address inequality in the US.

BUT just like every other person with your view on the issue, you haven't actually demonstrated that any kind of institutional racism operates today. It seems to me you're analysis is as simple as identifying that black people end up being less successful, and jumping straight to 'clearly there is racism.' Which laws are black people currently subject too that whites are not? Which rights aren't they today afforded? Specifically, where exactly is this institutional racism I've been hearing so much about, which policy, which law, which institution?

"0:55 - 1:00 That, or because of historical economic reasons, blacks/colored people are more likely to be in impoverished sectors due to Segregation, causing an increase in overall crime rate for the demographic, which, mixed in with Anti-authority Sentiment, could cause a cycle of self-destruction through the acts of criminal activity, causing a disproportionate amount of done by them due to their environment. Of course, who pays attention to history anyway? 1:44 Once again: *in the past* Segregation did cause a lot of blacks to lose a lot of financial opportunities. But guess what: We don't HAVE segregation anymore. 3:10 ...Well I am. Right here. Pretty sure this is going to get removed but.... yeah. 8:48 So.... how are we suppose to fix it or punish those who are actually responsible for that? I mean, I'm pretty sure the majority of those who enacted Jim Crow Laws or had slaves are now... well, dead. We can't punish those who enacted them, so what? We should punish people based off the actions of their ancestors? That seems highly, highly immoral. 12:36 - 12:49 And your point is? Sure, that are still effects of past events, but you aren't really giving a solution to the problem. Are we suppose to restore decaying, lead filled buildings? If so, then fine. Lets get people to work and pay them to actually do that. 13:58 - 14:00 Well, seeing how I don't include myself in your Collective mindset, I sleep just fine, for there are plenty of other problems, like poverty in general, that we *still* haven't solved even within our own skin tone. 15:03 Return back to my original point. 17:02 Huh, I wonder where we would get that idea... (All lives matter by the way. Equally.) 17:26 - 17:28 The complaints are aimed at what they are petitioning for, not for the act of petitioning. 18:25 ...No. 18:53 - 18:55 You didn't *prove* racism. You only proved that, due to historical factors, blacks are in improvised sectors of cities caused by *past* injustices. You haven't given any solutions, nor have you showed any modern evidence of mass racism on a large scale... other than for white people by saying we should question how can sleep at night for having poverty. 19:03 - 19:08 Wow... Racist."

"+ContraPoints I still think you're going to be losing people when you imply that they should be responsible for things their great grandparents did.  Or even further removed, for intance where does a recent immigrant to the US fit into this framework?  I think that this is the same tumbling block that sticks in people's throats when it comes to things like affirmative action and hiring quotas.  Benefitting from something doesn't make your responsible for it in my opinion, and I think the problems caused could be better addressed by broader programs that target socio-economic factors rather than race.    As you say, there are black people that have done well despite systemic racism, and their condition is no longer such where they would need a leg up.  At the same time, there are also white Americans that are currently in deplorable conditions and could also use a leg up.  Under the premise that black people's current socio-economic positions are to a large extent a consequence of systemic racism (which I'm not challenging by the way), then we would expect them to be helped more often by programs that help those in poor socio-economic positions without introducing a lot of feelings of injustice that are partially warranted in the sense that macro level systemic issues don't seem like a good excuse to a 'white trash' kid that can't land his/her first job.    I mean, fuck it, for example, as an Arab in the US you are 'Caucasian,' so they can happily be bigotts while knowing they won't be called on it because you're nominally 'White.'  Want an anecdote?  IBM hired a university classmate of mine from Ghana to work in 'Business Intelligence' that I know firsthand doesn't have the skills for that position and it took about 8 months after that for me to land my job, and it wasn't for a big American tech firm, not in the US at all.  This fellow always had bullshit stories about how he was a electronic wizard child in Ghana that rebuilt electronics to get buy.  It's all bullshit, he couldn't show you what part of the computer the RAM was.  I worked on a group project with him and he put in zero effort to learn the framework we agreed to use for it, I ended up doing the entire thing myself and trying to teach it to him despite his disinterest, and I myself had just learned it just for that project.  I can only imagine that many people see things like this and are a bit less convinced, the right wing mantra that white people are suffering discrimination starts to sound a whole lot more reasonable from that standpoint, but anecdotes aren't statistics.  He also tried to get me to join the Amway pyramid scheme (just an unrelated side note).    What it comes down to in the job market though, is that jobs are most often gained through connections rather than qualifications (once the base qualifications are met), and white people in America are far better connected in this in general.  Studies also show that they are more willing to recommend their friends (often also white) than minorities are, possibly because minorities are afraid that a hire on their recommendation that doesn't work out will reflect badly on themselves and their minority in the eyes of management.  A more recent immigrant is also less likely to have such connections.  I think that considering reparations is a bad route to go down that involves a lot of tricky subects.  For instance, it isn't only African Americans that were discriminated against in the US, before that it also happened to the Irish, no, not slavery, and to a lesser extent, but then should they also receive some, but lesser, reparations?  Native Americans (which do receive some benefits now, but many still have a very messy relation with the Federal government.....)?  Indentured servants?  The Chinese that worked on the railroads in California?  Personally I think it is both easier, and more correct, that we aid people based on where they are NOW and that should help work to even out past injustice without placing blame on those that honestly aren't responsible for what their grandparents did and not feeding the perception of ['reverse'] racism that the right likes to spread.  Don't get me wrong, they are certainly still responsible for their own racism if they are racist.    In short, I think that saying: 1) African Americans suffered greatly in the US and even now suffer ongoing systemic racism.  Is largely unchallenged by rational people.   2) That White Americans and other non-African American Americans have potentially benefitted greatly from this through their parents' actions etc... Is largely unchallenged for those whose lineage actually was in the US at the time.... 3) That because one benefitted due to past actions of OTHERS that one is responsible for fixing it or suffer for it even when one's own situation is quite bad.  This is the tipping point.    1+2 implies affirmative action (an example of 3) doesn't go over well with groups that feel these policies are slighting them on the basis of skin color when they themselves aren't doing so hot.   1+2 implies a program giving a better chance for the poor in general to be able to attend university seems like something with fewer contradictions, fewer perceived slights, and more universal appeal that still largely helps those it was meant to help, and I would argue that we should mean to help all the poor, not just the ones we think our grandparents got a leg up over.    Maybe I'm wrong and even recent joiners of a society should owe the debt on that society's backlog, but I'm just not seeing that link being established in your, nor other arguments.  Sorry to be so long winded.  I can see them paying that debt as a civic obligation, but not taking blame for borrowing it in the first place."

"I understand there may be a lot of racism left in the US, but a have a question about this whole situation. Is there a significant difference between the races in the US when you only use data about people in a state of poverty?  If the answer is no, than helping the black population would be giving an advantage to black people. This is would be racist by definition, since the hispanics , whites, asians... would be treated differently. You could argue that that's ok because of history, but I don't believe two wrongs make a right.  If the answer is yes, I would like to see someone make an argument for that. Convince how a poor black person has different chances in life than a poor white or asian in a sufficiently similar context.  The reasoning is that there is segregation of wealth everywhere. The similar income groups often live together because of thinks like house pricing. Ignoring why a large portion of the poor population in the US are black, just the fact that they are may just be the reason they live in worse conditions than most whites.  If my reasoning is true, a movement like BLM can be considered racist if they argue they want better living standards for poor blacks but ignore poor asians, whites and/or hispanics."

Success of black people is in their own hands no one is blocking us. But racism is real not just toward black but towards all races the most accepted is toward white people.  Nice Video.

"I agree with you, whoever denies racism still exists is clearly ignorant or simply doesn¬¥t care (same with sexism, homophobia, etc.) and the past still has repercussions in the present, it is what originated those problems in the first place.  However...I still think saying things like: WHITE PEOPLE SHOULD DIE!,  ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACISTS!!, WHITE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST!! Is not helping anyone and is wrong to be honest, regardless if you are 'venting'. If a man is abused by another man who happens to be gay and his way of venting is saying: GAY PEOPLE SHOULD DIE!! GAY PEOPLE ARE ALL RAPISTS!! It¬¥s wrong and simply...not a true statement. But back to the topic, yes white people should be aware of these circumstances that lead to injustice for other races, and I get that¬¥s what people mean with  the term 'white privilege'. But quite often that term is used to diminish a person¬¥s problems simply because they happen to be white and therefore their problems 'aren¬¥t important' or 'they don¬¥t have it as bad'.  Yes white people need to be educated on the issues of other races and listen to their problems, but would you really want to listen to the problems of people who tell you you suck for being white and how your problems will never be as big as theirs? White people need to become allies but people of color need to treat their allies with dignity."

How do you explain other communities that also had lead paint that didn't rise in violence past the 1990s.  Also a neighborhood not being able to afford replacing lead paint is not a byproduct of systematic racism but a byproduct of sub-government not being able to afford a city wide grant to replace home paint but relying on homeowners or landowners to repclace the paint themselves.  Also. The idea of redlining is hilarious because it relies on the idea that the reason black neighborhoods are poor because black people are unable to earn money because of the color of their fucking skin. Which is hilarious to insist."

Here illegal downloading stuff can bring you a longer prisontime then driving drunken in an illegal street race a pedestrian to death.  And since you bring up the same idea of today's white people being responsible for what their ancestors did (btw what is with whites whos ancestors came to the U.S. AFTER the Civil War or afterJim Crow? Are they responsible too? I mean look how italians and irish people were treated by the other white americans), can you explain why the black community in majority votes for the democratic party? The party that fought to KEEP them as slaves? Following that logic modern democrats are responsible for what the democrats centuries ago did.   Everywhere in the western world we see that liberty as a value is in decline. Feelings seem to matter more than facts and arguments will always be ended by swinging with the racism-club. And when minority people say things like 'Your argument has no value, because you are a cis white male!' how bigot is that to say, because they are *insert color/gender/xyz here* and cannot talk about being a cis white male either!

No one. Who among the leftist intelligentsia is telling black people to stop having out-of-wedlock kids, because that's a sure sure way to continue multi-generational poverty?   No one.   Black out-of-wedlock birthrate in America: approximately 70%. The black family unit is almost non-existent. Who's to blame?  Well . . . it's not exactly white conservatives going around telling black people to have kids out of wedlock, is it?  But don't worry. There's a solution. If we can just enact some sort of radical economic redistributionism, that'll fix the problem.  <sigh>"

You know, when fighting racism, you don't ACTUALLY have to think about the racism part all the time if it bothers you.  You don't HAVE to think about the fact that lead paint is statistically more likely to be in the walls of houses that black people live in.  You can just think about how some houses have lead paint, and that's bad, and let's do something about it.    That's ultimately what everything boils down to.  There's a thing that needs to be done.

"Look Contra, what do you want us whites to do? We can talk about policy positions which can help ALL Americans. We need to build jobs, reform the prison system, fix our broken schools and such but apart from this you're acting extremely unrealistic when you blame all of the problems of black Americans on white people and demand that white people fix all of the problems blacks have to deal with.  America is THE MOST equalized society on earth. There is absolutely nothing holding a black back from going to college apart from himself and his family. If a black kid is growing up in a shithole and acts like a gangster, why do you blame whites for this? What about his family which is supposed to be responsible for raising the child properly? Black men have the lowest rate of marital fidelity of all ethnic groups, whites didn't force them to do this. You're talking about a race problem, how about black men stop cheating on their wives and take responsibility for when they knock a girl up instead of leaving the woman on the streets?    Are you really so naive that you will blame whites for the ratio of black single mother households? Are you really so naive that you will blame whites for the fact that blacks have a lower overall IQ than whites? This is just nonsense.   If you really believe in 'equality of the races' then you have to allow blacks to fail as an entire ethnic group and hold them responsible for that failure as you would hold your own children responsible for their failings. Blacks aren't stupid, blacks hate ghetto trash just as much as white people do, let them be responsible for sorting out their own problems.   In other words, mind your own business and take care of the ones you cherish instead of blaming whites for every problem other ethnic groups have to deal with. There is nobody who takes pity on whites when we fail, why should you care about whether blacks fail?  It makes no sense."

"Ok people go to jail because they do something that attracts the attention of police, typically that's called committing a crime, it's why the police thing. You have to prove freddy was executed and if you can I suggest you take your evidence to the appropriate place and have these people charged, but oh wait all you have is hearsay and gossip fed by your white guilt.   Freddy did drugs because his employment prospects were eviscerated by hordes of illegal immigrants displacing black people from their traditional low skilled employment, yes the oligarchs love illegal immigration, and no freddy wasn't that bright as you explained otherwise he would have gone to college like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Thomas Sowell.   Freddy's problems aren't structural racism Freddy's problems are hipster dicks like you advocating the importation of unskilled poor and fighting the deportation of same without concern for your countries existing poor. Freddy was never going to be a rocket scientist all he needed like most people was work that gave him a sense purpose and belonging."

"(insert 'porque no los dos' meme) hi, libertarian here to say, maybe it's a mix of both racism and individuals doing stupid shit? so institutional racism and stuff like that, has reversed since the mid 1900s. now thanks to socialist type laws, we have anti-discrimination policies, college funds specific to women and certain races, etc.   but are there still issues on the individual level, and is it a subconscious bias or even a conscious bias that leads to racist actions? yes, these problems still due exist, and even the problems that existed back then had rippling effects that we are still struggling to correct modern day.   i do not think racism is as extreme as the far left say it is, at the same time, i do not think it's as casual of a matter as ignorant non-left people tend to have a dismissive attitude about it all.   the real question is, how do we move forward to progression? there's a lot of ways we can do it, through charity/fundraising, ending government and using private police who will have competition so if one company has bad cops, a community could hire a rival police force thus free market capitalism solving the racism problem.   okay, i slipped some ideals of Anarcho Capitalism in there, lol... but in all seriousness, what exactly should we do? i don't think stopping traffic and rioting is going to stop racist people from doing racist things. it's like setting your house on fire trying to exterminate roaches, it ain't helping, and the roaches will find a way to survive.   i think the main problem is with state police in general, they have their own subculture and they protect each other like gangster hiveminds. if the police had more accountability, they would take more care in how they conduct themselves.   fun fact, private police on average costs 4-8 times cheaper than the taxes that go to fund state police and due to the fear of losing money to competition, it's more likely that security officers and private police would be less trigger happy and abrasive.   sorry, i'm trying to be as neutral as possible, but my libertarianism keeps slipping in. but really, without resorting to replacing state police, what can we actually do? shitty police will always be shitty, they are shit as managing their own people, the state is useless at managing them, like, so, what do?   i think because this question is so hard to answer, we see that people resort to protests and rioting, because ending the state, or even just replacing state police with firms and private police would take a lot of time to transition to, and we want results now.   well certain neighborhoods are run down and have thug subcultures, drug cultures, and this attracts police who have chips on their shoulders. you realize this is a two-sided issue?   it's not enough to merely try to get better police, but we also need to find ways to rebuild these communities and steer them away from toxic subcultures of rape and gang violence, because even if the one off guy tackled by police wasn't a thug, if he lives in an area near thugs, then police seem to become retarded and deal with the situation like they just snorted meth, so, like violent idiots.   this will not be an easy solution, and it's not just a race thing either, though i admit race plays a part in a lot of these situations. how do we build up these broken communities and how do we get the police to stop being piece of shit fucktards? answer this, then we can finally advanced and improve life for all."

If During block busting, realtors were able to take homes bought cheaply from working class whites and sell them to blacks for exorbitant amount, where did cap blacks get those loans?  The answer is the federal government provided blacks with loan guarantees which there use by democrats to clear out working class white unreliable vote and exchange them for reliable black votes.   Baltimore is a black run city, that maintains segregation so they can keep their tax base and thus their jobs and income."

"To determine who is being oppressed and who is the oppressor just ask yourself, who is the group that wants to leave (white flight/white nationalists) and who is the group that wants to stay (blacks/black lives matter/hispanics). The group that wants to stay (blacks/hispanics) currently gets 300 billion in net wealth transfers from the other group - the group that wants to leave (whites). The group that wants to break off is legally prohibited from creating their own spaces, the group that wants to stay is militantly trying to use their influence on the government to get even more and to regularly bully any white who speaks out about this as he is some sort of heretic."

Interesting to see this redone with your new editing abilities. Congrats on how far you've come."
"A little frustrating. I usually find your videos extremely fair, even though very disagreeable to my opinions.  However, for whatever reason, when you talk about racism I think you strawman your opposition. For example, someone like Ben Shapiro would agrue that one of the biggest factors of Black children growing up in those circumstances as Freddy Gray is having children out of marriage. It does seem that having children out of marriage makes a very large contribution to the quality of life of the children.  And I'm sure that you could come back and say that there are all sorts of government incentives and hindrances to keep 'the blacks' from having children in marriage and staying married . . . and you'd be right. There's a hopelessly racist welfare state that we've created that no one on the left wants to talk about. And this is why I can't take you opinion on racism seriously. You people on the left need to come out against how the welfare state is carefully crafted to incentivize poor people to stay poor and incentivize single motherhood.   I'm not suggesting that there aren't other societal problems, and I'm not suggesting that we get rid of welfare. However, we desperately need to create a system for the poor so that we don't incentivize people to stay shitters all their life. I can speak about the welfare system, because I'm battling my way out of it right now, and man, I'm telling you its not easy knowing you're going to be working more and almost earning less just simply because you decide to go the extra mile and work overtime for a higher wage (which can negatively impact your medicaid, ebt/foodstamps, ect). I'm not trying to say I got it difficult, but I am saying that this is a fucked up system that we've created, and the left tends to lose their credibility when they disagree with someone like Thomas Sowell on this."
"I sleep alright, I don't think anyone should be held responsible for what their ancestors did, however, acknowledging that I'm privileged, and that I benefit from racism that still permeates America is important as well. It's not my fault, but I can see it's a problem, and want to help change it, if I can."
"absolutely true! and everyone really underestimates the effect of lead, i mean we've got essentially a case of mass poisoning, but of course these people conveniently forget about it when throwing black people under the bus is on the table. basically though i live in syracuse, ny and it's very much the same situation, same causes and effects exactly. only no riots... for the time being, but something really ought to be done before it gets that far."
"Ofcourse it's not a simple matter of better choices, but we need to talk about social attitudes aswell. The Sjw left totally ignores this. I get why it's a sensative topic and that these attitudes are part of the historical legacy of white supremacism. However preaching this gospel of victimhood has prevented some intercity blacks from looking inwards. Why can't we talk about all the factors that are contributing to the problem and think of a solutions. Invest more, stop the drug war, but also talk  personal responsibility!!"

"Oh. My. God...I just realized that (nearly) every channel I'm subscribed to is run by a white person (oh yeah, except TYT).  I've been living in a white YouTube bubble this whole fucking time, and I didn't even notice until you alluded to it. And here I was thinking I was some kind of enlightened progressive person who had gotten past all of this racial bias, unlike the ignorant mainstream right-wing.  It probably doesn't help that I started out my YouTube-watching 'journey' with 'skeptics' like Amazing Atheist and Thunderf00t (*cringe*)...there were even some specifically MRA/anti-feminist type channels that I frequented back then...so the YouTube algorithm likely still has some remnants of that predominately white, anti-left trend hiding deep within its profile of my tastes. I hardly ever even see black people in my recommended feed (unless it's a story about black people). Oh god, that's disgusting.  I wonder if it would be easier to just start over with a new account at this point. There are certainly some old comments on this profile that I'd rather forget about."

And we must never talk about the fact that  - slavery in Mexico went back all the way to the Aztecs - and that you can go buy child sex slaves in Libya Right. Now. - and that Mauritania didn't abolish slavery until *1981* , and it wasn't _criminalized_ until *2007* - and that it's estimated that there are almost 30 million slaves on the planet Right. Now.  ...and we mustn't mention Africans raping babies to cure AIDS, today or the widespread mutilation of the genitals of babies in Africa, or the Pakistani Grooming Gangs that have gotten away with raping literally THOUSANDS of young girls,  ...or the fact that word 'SLAVE' is derived from the word 'SLAV' because  _Slavs_ were taken as slaves by the  *MUSLIMS* of Spain  ...because if we talked about _those_ things...it might incite hatred for these groups of people.  Yeah, we know. ;)"
"+ContraPoints I really appreciate how blunt and unassuming you are in approaching sensitive topics such as race and gender.

It makes me want to learn about and explore these issues with as much open-mindedness as possible."

"Contra, you should do a series where you just talk about different political ideologies. Do communism."
"I hate when people who constantly complain about racism abstain from explaining why something is racist with the retort 'it's not my job to explain it to you.' The thing is, people don't know what they don't know, so if you can't explain how racism exists in America to a person who thinks that racism in America is nonexistent, they'll NEVER learn and the issue will persist. If racism is that big a deal, you should be more than ready to explain how and where it is festering."
"America is a country, a collective of 323.1M people which are not all racist but many are. Racism has gotten much worse since the Left started saying that you cant be racist towards whites. That has increased the mistrust and aggression between the races enormously.  Being discriminatory towards your own skin colour does not reduce the amount of racism, it simply increases the overall magnitude.  Moderates who respect their adversaries are the only voices that will have any success in this issue but since most Americans prefer to listen to snarky hate pundits on both sides there is currently no prospect of reconciliation."
"NO. WAY. Rasism is real??????? o.O"
"Or, maybe Baltimore still has a similar racial distribution because the average black IQ is 84, they don't have the ability to perform in well paying jobs by and large, and so they end up in the more undesireable areas, which were undesireable 100 years ago too likely for the same reasons."
"@ContraPoints  Richard Spencer has been on Warski live twice... you are making out as if they invite him on every week and through that we got to hear his ridiculous ideas like going back to inherited power, kings and queens and they opposed his ideas, i don't see how you can complain about that, other than the guilt by association.  I acknowledge fully that housing was racially segregated, black people got the rubbish areas and houses and police brutality and that lead poisoning may have some contributing factor BUT come on now Contra  blacks make up 14% of the population and obviously children and old people aren't murdering, so its actually more like 5% of the population is committing 50% of the murders, Chicago had more fatalities from gun crime than they had fatalities in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars during the same time period, that is fucking ridiculous.  Now I AM NOT saying its because they are black, nothing like that, part of it is historical injustices has left them in a dire state and also toxic culture, namely gang culture.  Incarceration was unfair in the past and there are still cases today that are unfair and it did impact the black community heavily and they were racially targeted, this contributed to the broken homes, single mother families and so their kids had much higher propensity to crime later in life, but IT IS NOT still the case that blacks are being locked up on petty weed charges, they are getting caught with weed but have previous and violent crimes in their previous very often, hence the harsher sentence than say a shoplifting white person who is caught with weed. The legal weed part was a bit disingenuous, 1 was people getting locked up for weed possession decades ago and 1 is legally selling weed in a legal way through an establishment in the present OR you are conflating the people who get caught with weed but have previous, with legally selling weed at a legal establishment.  I don't know a lot of the details on incarceration rates >>now<< but when a population is committing massively disproportionate amounts of crime for their population size, the incarceration rates appear to match the crime rates, as do the police stops and arrests. Blacks do get killed by the police, not more often than whites but disproportionately for their population size in the US but given the disproportionate crime (especially gun crime) from that population group its perfectly consistent. So to reiterate historical injustices do play a part in the dysfunction of the black community in the US but we can't undo the past, we can't just take money off some random white people now to give to some random black people for the crimes of the past, that is taking property or money off of random innocent people(who didn't do anything themselves).  Will there ever be a time in which Americans won't owe reparations, what is the cut off amount of time to recover reparations for stuff done to your ancestors?   Black lives matter is targeted because they are telling lies, the whole movement started on a lie, remember the whole hands up don't shoot narrative on the Mike Brown situation a supposedly gentle man who didn't do anything wrong, defending shitty people and claiming police brutality where there is none at times (Corin Gains another example), ignoring the crime statistics of their population group and so claiming police stops and incarceration rates are disproportionate or racist, ignoring the problems in their own communities and then destroying towns with riots, attacking people for being white and chanting for the death of police. Also many of their advocates are ignorant racial supremacists who support and praise convicted cop killers and excluding whites from their protests at times.  The US does appear to have a problem with police brutality, but its not racial, more whites are killed every year by police, but whites are also more numerous, whites do indeed get caught with at least cannabis more often, this is true maybe most drugs, but whites are 5-6 times more numerous after all but that is a low end crime and whites don't come close PROPORTIONALLY for the different population sizes to all the other crime statistics like murder, rape or other violent crimes. I don't want the U.S to have these problems, they are uncomfortable to talk about but the problems are not just historical racism, present day racism and police brutality, the black community has some real issues of its own also and blaming everything on specters like institutional racism today only feeds into a victim mentality and perpetuates more misery for their community. I am not certain where i stand politically anymore, i am not a progressive, i am not an alt-righter or conservative, i was left all my life and i still am but i have been pushed towards the center because the left went really far left(progressive). I may disagree with you on a few things here Contra and we might not see eye to eye on this but just wanted to add you are looking beautiful, even more so lately, that is a good look on you."

I'll take what you said at the end as a joke to be charitable. I also liked the idea of taking responsibility for your actions while still acknowledging that problems exist in America.   Over the years, I've changed my stance on the circumstances that black people face in America. I started off with an overwhelming right wing perspective but now it's deluded with a left wing perspective. There's just so much to take in and the solution isn't as simple as 'Stop committing crime, black people!' Life is just complex and there are multiple factors to consider. I think it's a good thing that things I've said in my old videos may not apply to me today."

"The argument about weed and... gentrification is kind of weird. White people in legal states are starting legal marijauna businesses. I agree that the astonishing disparity between white and black marijauna arrests is outrageous. However, that disparity only exists in states where you can be arrested for marijauna possession, right? I live in Atlanta and weed is 'decriminalized'. My understanding is that a city police officer can't arrest you, but a state officer can. I'd be more interested in these fringe situations where it's possible for this disparity to arise again. Reaching for a connection between legal and illegal states just seems like a stretch, assuming that one can't be arrested in a legal state for marijuana possession.   Also this is irrelevant but I'm interested on your opinion of the whole Evergreen college meltdown."

"Lead paint isn't racism. It's just a problem that might as well be unrelated to racism. I am not saying it isn't, because it clearly is if we are speaking in terms of causal determination. My point is that there is no benefit in linking it to racism. It is simply not relevant to the solution. Whatever the cause is the solution is loving your neighbour and effective social work and amelioration of poverty, which does not include full reparations by the way. Dumping a bunch on cash on aggressive lead poisoned people is a bad idea. Eye for an eye will make the whole world blind. Yes, it is fucked up but there are no easy solutions, so please stop pretending there are.  You are not helping anyone with the racism and identity politics rhetoric. If it does anything then it deters people who could help from helping because people don't like to be called racists. It is admittedly a bad excuse to neglect your social responsibility, but so is the excuse of violent criminality with lead paint or whatever other material or cultural circumstances. People are not perfect. And if the purpose of the identity politics is revenge then people have actually perfectly good reason to resist it even with violence, which is why identity politics games are so dangerous.  I also noticed a little contradiction in your attitude towards classical liberals. You are mocking because they want to have a discussion about current problems, even with racists, but then you make a video about racism, which seems to be targeted to people who don't believe racism exists, which probably include a lot of racists. So do you want to have a discussion about racism with racists or not? If someone like Richard Spencer made a video response would respond to him? It seems to me as if you are doing almost the same thing as people you criticise but it is veiled in sarcasm and achieved by playing characters instead of inviting guests."

"July 2, 1964 was a magical day. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law. Immediately, every single racist person in America said in unison, 'Well, he sure showed us. Let's all sing kumbaya and stop being racist.' Then everyone lived happily ever after.  Until one day, out of nowhere, President Obama just randomly started calling all white people racist. Then all the black people started looting and raping and shit, thinking they would get away with it.  Disappointed by the fact that laws still exist, the black people formed a racist organization called 'Black Lives Matter' (funded almost entirely by George Soros), dedicated to the principle that black people should do whatever the hell they want without any consequences. BLM was the black man's KKK, marking the beginning of white people being oppressed.  It was a terrible sight. White people were victims of new Jim Crow laws. They were segregated and prohibited from entering black safe spaces. They were barred from employment, because the black people took all the jobs. They were lynched left and right by mobs of angry black supremacists.  White people truly lived in dark times. But all hope was not lost, for they found their savior in God Emperor Trump, who stood up for white people and liberated them from their racist black oppressors. It was at this point that America became great again. The end.  #HistoryAccordingToRightWingers"

"What you call 'racial inequality' isn't inequality at all, but equality working against your favor. You assume that because there are more black  behind bars or in the ghetto that this is a sign of racism. No, equality means that if you screw up, you're going to be treated just the same as anyone else who screw up. You're not going to get a free pass just because of the color of your skin, one way or another. If you don't think black crime is a problem, head on down to Detroit or Chicago and check out the situation there. Live their neighbors, interact with their people, then say with an honest heart that there's no crime problem. No one can put a gun in your hand and force you to rob a liquor store, and white people are no exception. Also, choosing to live in the same city and neighborhood as your family and neighbors isn't 'environmental racism' either. My girlfriend's lived in the same city her entire life, and I currently live in a tiny town where you can walk from one side to the other in less than ten minutes, populated almost entirely with people who've lived here their whole lives. I say 'almost' because I'm an exception, as are my siblings who moved in a few years ago. They're the whole reason I'm here in this podunk town to begin with. Alas, but when black people decide on those same living conditions, it's apparently racism in your worldview.  Also, the drug mention is stupid. If you get arrested by the cops, possession is marked as a crime in addition to whatever else you had been arrested for. If you rob a convenience store like Michael Brown did, then fight back when the cops try to put you in handcuffs, then steal a car to try to get away, then they find weed in your pocket when they finally arrest you, that's four crimes: robbery, resisting arrest, grand theft auto and possession. Having a nonviolent drug crime on your sentence when you go to jail doesn't mean you went to jail because of that crime.  And on one final note: for all your diatribe against Richard Spencer, white nationalists and 'fascists', and your upholding of Black Lives Matter, I've never seen Spencer start riots, white nationalists burn down someone's neighborhood, or 'fascists' marching and calling for anyone's death the way BLM called for the execution of Darren Wilson. That's why people criticize BLM, not 'black students being too loud'.  If you don't know what you're talking about, please don't talk, m'kay? That's all I ask... opinions supported by facts."

We need to fight racism united as people (I know I am really cheesy but it's 00:17 in the morning and I'm really tired). Granted the racism in my country is very different to in yours as in the UK we are apparently more inclined to be less racist as.

That's, IMO, the starting point of the discussion.  From there you can then go into how racism gets involved.  And there is probably is some kind of subtle bias (racism) that keeps some minorities on the lower tiers and thus more succeptible to crime.  There has been centuries of European colonialism that more or less preached about bringing civilization to the non-white primitives.  A lot of the colonies only became independent in the early 1900's.  Slavery was only outlawed in the USA not too long before that, but that led into racist laws in the books until the Civil Rights era.  That itself was only 50 years ago and helped shaped the political landscape of today.  To say we've transcended and don't have any kind of biases (racism) in the society today is honestly kind of a happy fantasy."

"Honestly im tired of being generalized as a 'straight white male' that has 'male privilege' as well as being called an 'alt-right nazi'when in fact I'm bisexual and quite left leaning, and the stats show us that its pretty much 'female privilege' e.g. male suicide rates are tremendously higher than women, they lose child custody battles extremely more frequently than women, also the male death rate in the work place is drastically high in comparison to men. Some studies even suggest that men get harsher jail sentences than what women do. And also things like the 'wage gap, pint tax' as well as the '1 in 5 women get raped on college'/'1 in 5 women get raped' (im using both of these terms as some Feminists use the first statement and some Feminists use the second statement. However, either way this 'statistic' has been debunked so many times before. (In other words touching the knee counts as rape); 'wage gap' - on the basis of these statistics stating that women get 77¬¢ to the dollar it would seem pretty easy to assume things like sexism however, when you start to dig deep into how these statistics were actually done, then people start to get a grasp on how the statistics are false; for example the wage gap statistic doesn't take account into how much overtime men do compared to women or how women just generally don't do as many hours as men or how women decide to have children all of these things wasn't taken account into when doing these statistics. 'Pink tax' - debunking this was actually not hard to do as when it comes to things like 'similar products' for women and men (like shaving cream) women USUALLY like the more smooth, nicer smelling cream compared to the mens product; no company wants to lose money because people are suggesting that two different products should be the same price.

Just to be clear I don't hate BLM (I'm a communist, not to say that BLM is a communist movement).

"Hello Contrapoints. I'm French and we have in France same problem with Segregation. But instead of institutionnalised and spatial racism, the communities segregated themself in sort of 'spontaneous order'.  If you take the county 'Seine-Saint-Denis' in the nineties, there was african, arabs, portugese and french people. But today, the portugese and arabs have leave this county for better environnement (like 'white flight') because the africans are growing too fast. Today there's only africans and gypsies in Seine-Saint-Denis. The 'Office of HLM' (national provider of public housing) is obligated to separate each 'nationality' at their request to avoid conflict. I think that even without racist laws, the problem of segregation remains with the arrival of new and poorer immigrants. Institutionalized racism can not explain everything (see Schelling's model of residential segregation   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfihtGefxk"

"S O L I D A R I T Y   F O R E V E R"
"Im conflicted because while I agree with pretty much everything you say about black people in this video, there still an odor of fallacy here in regards to how you talk about white people, which I would argue in part, if unadressed, damages the argument, or at least the ability of it to persuade fence sitters.  Here's the thing - it's possible to be both white and completely unrelated in every conceivable way to the historical racism of the US. I'm an ethnic Norwegian. If I were to emigrate to the US, not only would I have to compete and build my life from scratch there, there would be no ancestrial crimes for which to take responsibility for on my part. Yet, as an individual I could and would easily find myself both being reprimanded and passed over by a society operating according to the views of the US liberal progressive wing and its constituency.  This is an issue, because in failing to take that into account and talking categorically about white people this and white people that, you end up looking like ur motivated more by resentment and your own racial biases to anyone not already leaning in favor of your argument.   I understand that racial inequality exists in the US, and understand that people are sore about it and want it addressed. However, if the arguments and propositions you make, make it sound like it would be reasonable to badger me for being white, or passing me over in a job interview on principle alone because of what other white people have done or do, you're not only losing my support, I can understand why you'd lose the support of others, even though they're not in my shoes, on the basis that they find the idea of trying to solve inequality through unfair treatment of others based on unreasonable crime of assocation via skincolor to be morally defunct.  Now don't get me wrong - I'm not making the argument that you did this to any meaningful extent, but I have seen many who do, and as much tact as you do, you still inadvertently forward the logic that inables it when you do things like question how 'white people' can sleep at night given what their great grandparents did.  Newsflash - not all white people's grandarents did jack shit to contribute to your issues, and can sleep just fine. And that would remain true for me even if I moved to the US tomorrow.  'Whites' are not a monolith regardless of what libprogs and alt righters like to believe. Personally, as a Norwegian, I feel as alien from US white people as I do from Indian or Mongolians.  You are not my people, and neither am I yours, especially not by virtue of something as fickle and unsubstantial as skin color.   Nevertheless, the fact that I am white, and how that relates to how racial tribalists in the US speak, and the fact that people like me unmistakably exist within your borders will always be an issue that paints your arguments in a bad light when out under scrutiny. While it certainly doesn't dismiss anything you said, it taints it with a faul odor that will always drive away people who might otherwise be standing next to you. This is why, while I'm perfectly fine defending many of the positions of libprogs, I would rather do it by myself than in your company more often than not.  I don't trust that black lives matter, regardless of whether their grievances are well founded or not,  are any less tribalistic and racial essentialist in thinking than the likes of Richard Spencer, and every time I hear the representatives of the moment screaming on camera I'm rebuffed in that commitment.   Inb4getting hounded for being a racist enabler or some crap. If you reading this feel inclined to reply with that crap, know I won't be replying to that nor reading it."
"I think you need to tackle head on the possibility that bad communities create bad kids. Maybe Freddie grey was an angel. I have no idea. But the real question is if society deserves guilt for the failure of certain communities. As a conservative I say that society may be culpable for not instilling the virtues of the society into deprived kids, but it is not responsible for the crimes they will commit. The decision to commit a crime is a crime against society that a person knowingly decides to do. Pocket knife or petty theft or anything. Police brutality is terrible but in the framework of a county of 350 million the incidents are shockingly... infrequent. Especially since the circumstantial evidence even then rarely matches up with the rh√©torique surann√©e of the standard liberal racial interpretation. These are the unanswered questions that let mediocre right wing channels like Roaming Millenial and No Bullshit thrive and invent heir own undermined presumptions.  thanks for reading.

Baiting aside, I'd've liked more information about recent racist policies or systemic racism on a federal level and less condescending bitching(which kinda is your thing, admittedly).Foregone Racist policies still affect the present, no shit, but overcompensating through reparation and affirmative action will only widen the racial devide. Blacks kinda have to hold out until entropy does its job and the gap closes over the next decades. If you're reaching for quicker conclusions through imposing solutions that favor one minority over the other not just through unforeseen consequences, but also by design, it will be considered as overreaching, provoking a unfavorable reaction at best and complete self-segregation at worst."

"'According to the best testimony now, the population of the earth--embracing Caucasians, Mongolians, Malays, Africans, and Americans--is about thirteen hundred millions, of whom only three hundred and seventy-five millions are 'white men,' or little less than one-fourth, so that, in claiming exclusive rights for 'white men,' you degrade nearly three-quarters of the Human Family, made in the 'image of God' and declared to be of 'one blood,' while you sanction a Caste offensive to religion, an Oligarchy inconsistent with Republican Government, and a Monopoly which has the whole world as its footstool.   Against this assumption I protest with mind, soul, and heart. It is false in religion, false in statesmanship, and false in economy. It is an extravagance, which, if enforced, is foolish tyranny. Show me a creature with erect countenance looking to heaven, made in the image of God, and I will show you a MAN who, of whatever country or race, whether darkened by the equatorial sun or blanched by northern cold, is with you a child of the heavenly father, and equal with you in title to all the rights of human nature.'   --Charles Sumner, Feb 5 1866, quoted in WEB Dubois, 'Black Reconstruction in America 1860-1880, pp197"

"People on the right are really good at taking an ahistorical approach to understanding the current conditions of groups in society. 'Past historical events have had no impact on the present!' they'll proclaim and lazily write off the negative effects of red-lining, the inter-generational effects of hereditary chattel slavery, predatory lending, racially restrictive covenants, deindustrialization (Detroit's economic decline immediately comes to mind), Jim Crow laws, and gentrification.  Steven Rose, Richard Lewontin, and Leon Kamin said it best in their book _Not in Our Genes,_ 'The political consequence is that, since the social institution is never questioned, no alteration in it is therefore contemplated; individuals are to be altered to fit the institutions or else sequestered to suffer in isolation the consequences of their defective biology.'"

"Coming here as a conservative I like the video for a new perspective that I haven't really heard. However I do think pointing it all back to racism is a bit silly when there are clearly many factors at play. There have been many left leaning 'structures' and policies put in place in these cities by mostly democratic local and state governments over the last 50 years yet we still see the same inequality among blacks and whites. If left wing policies and governments can't solve these problems then who can? To pretend that those on the right don't know or don't care about the serious statistical differences between blacks and whites is false. We do, we care, we just don't blame it all on racism."
"1) Hey, good trick pretending the legal segregation of Jim Crow is the same as self-segregation of the present. 2) WHO SAYS RACISM IS OVER? Sweet strawman you have. 3) Man, many of your problems seem to stem from government intrusion. Sounds kinda libertarian to me. 4) I would pay SO MUCH MONEY to hear a socialist address the lack of black fathers in all this. 5) They don't complain about people using free speech. They complain about them blocking traffic to do it. I can agree that you have the right to say something, shockingly, without agreeing with what you say. 6) Wondering if 4 articles and 1 book, all of which agree with each other, proves that you actually know what you're talking about here. But what do I know? I'm just a white bro who can't deal with his own racism.  Treat this stuff with at least a little respect, Honey."

"I loved your video, but the one thing you should be aware of is that the marijuana use stat is misleading. That was a self reported study, but when the researchers did a drug test, more black people used weed than white People, I can‚Äôt remember by exactly what percent but it may be worth looking into. (I‚Äôm also not trying to minimize any of the other stuff you talked abt or even that point as a whole, everything else was v good and intellectually honest"
"great video, you and your team are very talented at presenting the information. I think you have the potential to be as good as Rachel Maddow though I can do without your attempts humor. At this point, I have given up on trying to debate and trying to tap into the humanity of the people in question; maybe my communication skills are lacking but even in discussions with multiple voices putting forward my point of view, it is still talking to a brick of wall of apathy and defensiveness. So I have given up all attempts at dialog; now I talk at them not with them and hope that enough 3rd person white people who are ignorant and confused can take my point of view and see the humanity in minorities and especially black people. As a minority myself I understand that it has been black people at the bottom and everyone else having better chances to 'pass' as white. The conflict of recognizing the Uncle Tom line is a place that all minorities have to struggle with but especially black people because as Jay-Z says, 'always a N...'. Fox News Uncle Tom money is good money to the point that it has even been exported to the UK and the rest of Europe, with one example being Majjid Nawaz. He is feeding his family by being that piece of garbage Sam Harris' 'some of my best friends are Muslim and brown'. All the while speaking out of a million sides of his mouth and claiming that everyone is too stupid or intellectually dishonest to understand his 'nuance'. What I tried to put forward to his defenders is that, his nuance has a by product (which really is the main product) of white people hating Muslims and brown people who many times aren't even Muslims but Sikhs or other Eastern religions. I think that the loss sense or better stated the never had sense of responsibility of how, why, what, and from whom the 'facts' are placed in the 'market place of ideas' is at the heart of problem. Its easy for white people to see the problem of David Duke saying Hollywood is controlled by Jews while he is naming off the executives at the most powerful studios but they can't see the problem with Harris and his Middle East Surveys. To me it is clear, they pick their winners and losers; and those choices tend to have a specific color pattern."
"I think we need to consider reinventing the idea of white identity, it's been synonymous with racist and Nazi/fascist ideology for to long, I think I'd be in our best interest to try and establish a new 'left wing white identity' something akin to idea that 'feminism is for men too' I think the reason white people are attracted to the Alt right is a sense of alienation by the contemporary left, they feel like the Alt right, is something made for them that they can't get anywhere else. I've had this idea for a while and I'd like to know what some other people on the left think (contra if you see this and intend to delete this comment please don't I just want to see what some other people on the left think about this idea)"

We knew we couldn‚Äôt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

I've watched you for many years (back in the days of Nykytyne2, FactVsReligion [how I first found you] and when Thunderf00t hadn't yet assumed his true form. YouTube sure was a different place) and have followed along as your content improved and developed over the years. I guess everyone changes a lot over a ~10 year period, but overall all that time, your videos have never ceased to make me laugh, but also, more importantly, make me think.

I typically line up on the classical liberal side of politics and one of the reasons I like your content is because of how different it is from what I normally consume. You are able to examine issues from a more leftist view, while being honest in representing conflicting view... or at least you were.

Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin, which tells the experience of the author, a journalist, disguising themselves as a Black person in the deep South during Segregation. The section on Atlanta is particularly telling of how social institutions were developed to stifle Black success and keep them indebted to White banks."

"I am from a latin america country and I can't help to notice one thing: blacks were enslaved as indigenous people were. Both were abused, killed, oppressed, the whole 'whites to none whites' treatment. At present day, both 'communities' live in very difficult conditions and are completely neglected by the state. But there's a big difference between the indigenous communities and the black communities. Indigenous communities are extremely organized, there's rule of law (very strict and draconian in fact), very low crime rates, and want to be independent. They just basically want to be left alone. Meanwhile blacks are the opposite, high crime, high insecurity, violence, extreme unorganized, completely dependent of outside sources. Every black community throughout the country is the same."

This isn't evidence for racism per se, it's evidence for a consequence of racism, which makes it indirect evidence for racism.

"Oh, and how about you recommend some specific youtubers? Because colour is really not enough, is it?"
"I think I understand what you're trying to say, and this was a great video, but.... individual people of colour can be really stupid or mean or wrong or whatever. They're just humans like the rest of us and not necessarily a good source on anything by virtue of their skin colour. Not even on that itself. To value or devalue someone's opinion by race doesn't work on the small interpersonal, individual scale. It's the tendency to drag macro scale ideas into every god-damn situation and context that's really unhelpful ultimately. You do this so casually and then you get papers from people with PhDs about how man-bun wearing mayo people dehumanise Asians. Because samurais. That may be a really whack (but real-life, non-fiction) example but idk, maybe you get what I'm trying to say. 'You shouldn't only talk to white people' seems like such a fair point in theory but in reality it proves a bit tricky, because black people or any other group including white people are just not that monolithic and it is de facto racist to assume anything else. It's important to talk about these specifically black issues in a nuanced way, and the statistics, as you have done for the most part of the video. That was really cool. But don't add new seemingly harmless racist generalisations as what, a countraweight? You know it doesn't work. It's may just be the self-pleasing comedy leftists love but the 'other side' really doesn't get the joke. What do these macro big picture things mean for our personal interactions? is a question you cannot find a single answer to. Some are affected, some are not. Not 100% of black people are incarcerated and led-poisoned on top of that. Not all mayonnaise people are delicious (sorry I like actual mayo). And we don't all know or see the same or draw the same conclusions. So I'd stick to the issues and drop the rhetoric (although I'm sure it's fun, and I don't mean completely, just like try how it feels without it, all squishy, factual, and naked)"

How would the arrest statistics turn out if blacks tended to be illegal weed DEALERS at a higher rate than whites, who in turn tended to only buy smaller quantities for their own consumption? Of course dealers will get arrested more often than simple users."
"Housing segregation can be explained by Schelling's Tipping Point Model. Agents in the model decide to move from one area to another based on very simple decision rules, such as 'if there are X foreign neighbours right next to me, I move'. Computer simulations reveal patterns in housing segregation qualitatively similar to patterns such as the one in Balitimore. Hence, institutional racism may not be a necessary condition for these patterns to arise."

I wonder if it's worth the potential harm that engaging in debate with them brings to try and use the right's normalization tactics against them? Then again, the right doesn't have the same kind of 'I'm going to be open minded to everything' platform the left does that makes them susceptible to it I guess."

"How do the effects of racism lingering prove that America is systemically (or.. generally?) racist in 2018? So your country had an extremely racist viewpoint held by a significant number of people in the past, to the point the damage caused remains today. That's fine, I've actually yet to hear anyone dispute that claim. But how does that qualify as evidence for it still being racist? The effects may be there, problems that caused may exist, but people of this generation don't appear to be generally racist in your country. It actually isn't their fault their ancestors did shitty things (and not all of their ancestors did shitty things) and the problems of today remain.  Black people in America on average have probably been dealt a shit hand compared to white people. I wouldn't know if that's a fact, but I can totally get on board with the likelihood that this is the case. That sucks. So what now?  I'd like to add, I don't agree with Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson about everything, far from it. But I think in general they're pretty much saying what you said in this video (perhaps in a tone that's less clear than yours to a lot of people?) about 'who's this white bitch to tell me i'm a victim' etc. In my experience I've only really seen 'Take responsibility, drag yourself out of the ditch you're in.' No one's saying they don't have a worse deal, just that it doesn't take away their responsibility or agency as people and they can either do something about that or they can play victim.  This comment is horribly oversimplified and I can't be fucked with someone coming in lecturing me, so please don't. I'm happy to be wrong, I'm happy to be directed to something showing these people are actually worse than I think, I'm perfectly happen for the entire SJW shitstorm to be entirely right if you can just show me how. Albeit that the entire planet is not America.  Regardless, I enjoy your videos, I'm not actually expecting you (contrapoints) to read this or reply to it honestly, you certainly have a point in that there's often ignorance towards how the circumstances came to exist and how that disadvantages people. I'm on board with that, I feel the same even though I also enjoy listening to both Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson speak.  The part I don't get here is how this confirms racism. Also a good portion of this Left-Right argument about subjects like this seems to just be different uses of the same words. Both sides seem to agree on the same things, but when you use a word like Racism, people seem to assume you mean what they interpret the word to mean.  This comment is getting too long and I just cant be fucked. I have my own shit I have to deal with, but hopefully someone sees what I'm getting at when they read it."
"great video, this information needs to be known."
"you talk of about the pettiest levels of herders and stampeders ('demogroovers' movers with a degree of accuracy that distracts from their handlers remaining beyond your scope and ken (buiten schot = nontargetted) which raises a few suspicions about witting or unwitting collusions ... prolly the latter, .. especially since the next level seems to reach into and get factored by and escalation of/in obscurities and multiveilery ... peers x ancestors to the nth degree both for- and backwards, which, just to complicate matters worse, runs on some sort of underground payload (selfish securitization, sparing no expense), expressed in ways totally out of IQian makedopuzzle & legerdemaintainment's reach .. stuff like genetic telepathy mebbe .. fueled by the suppression of ugly emotions 'poorhopes'??

Then again he's the Captain Obvious of racism in America (in some ways, he seems to have big blind spot on Obama) so maybe that's the right choice since I think this is more aimed at whites who don't think about/are misinformed snout race, ravcism, and systemic marginalization."

"That German bit was not half bad"
"It actually took me embarrassingly long to watch your old Baltimore video. I guess mostly just because I kinda had no idea what it would be about? I mean I had heard of the Freddie Gray case and the protests but I'd already forgotten about it... my excuse is that I'm not American and sometimes I just have trouble keeping up with what happened in which city that I don't know anything about. So I honestly had no idea and so I was less interested in the video. But then after watching your entire backlog of videos I realised that hey I haven't watched this one, let's go for it. And it was indeed probably one of if not the best of your videos. I was pretty mad at myself for skipping it earlier.  So yeah, I do think it was a good idea to remake it even though there wasn't anything wrong with the original. This title should get more views and maybe the style appeals to more people too? Who knows. At least they might come for Tabby. ;) (and stay for the analysis)  I do get what people are saying about preferring the original but luckily the original is still up."

"You know, white people act like they need to be soothed of their ancestral guilt, but at the same time some of the more Fashy types seem like there's nothing that gets them jazzed up like a lineage narrative to compensate for their individual patheticness. What I think white allies should therefore do is create a movement of redefining white heritage, where we pull a Prince Zuko and base our identities off of the idea of honorably undoing our ancestors' mistakes. For example, I recently learned that one of my most famous relatives had a hand in inventing the strategy that helped the Republican Party become so malignant, so my bullshit magical destiny is therefore to invent a counter strategy.  White people keep getting told that they aren't responsible for the current state of the world. And at the end of the day, I don't think they can just accept that, not because they're racist (well, not JUST because they're racist), but because no one likes being told what they aren't. People want to be told who they are. That's what the Nazis are selling, and that's why they manage to recruit anyone into their nonsense."
"Contra, white and black residents where equally affected by lead contaminated houses when the realities of lead poisoning became known to the public, and whites families migrated out of the lead poisoned homes while blacks stayed and created children while they knew their homes where bad for their, and their offspring's health.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/baltimores-toxic-legacy-of-lead-paint/  'A national survey conducted in 1998-1999 found that an equal percentage of black and white families lived in homes with federally recognized risk for lead exposure. A follow-up study in 2006, the most recent national survey on housing hazards, found that, while there had been a significant drop in the percentage of white families who lived in homes with a serious lead-based paint hazard, the percentage of black families had actually increased from the previous survey [page 36].'"

"Hello Contra. Let me start by saying I truly do love your (along with others like Shaun and Hbomb) push towards addressing issues more rather than reacting to others.  I just started a channel, less than a hundred followers, so while it doesn't really behove me to give advice, I'd like to just bring something up if I may;  If the purpose of these videos is to educate and indeed change minds, it might be better for the cause if they weren't so front-loaded with esoteric humour.  You're a funny person and have talent for creating characters and engaging back-and-forth, however for a totally new viewer (especially one who's on the fence or inclined to not agree with you), three minutes of vaudville introduction might be a bit much before getting to the point of your video.  I enjoy it, and your fans do overall, but it's just food for thought. Please continue to be an inspiration to myself and many other potential creators out there."
"I would like to know where I can get my own tabby whistle."
"I'm concerned that after whites become more familiar with the story of Freddie Gray and those like him, lead poisoning is going to become the latest generation of rationale for subconscious presuppositions about how blacks are somehow inherently not as smart as us. I guess most wokeness has to come in baby steps, and going from inability to recognize humanity, to outright hatred, to self-satisfied apathy, to condescending pity, is better than nothing at all. But it would still be nice if we could all just skip directly to empathy. Instead, I get the sense that after this white nationalism plague dies out, there's going to be this period of racism where white people will be like 'Oops, sorry for poisoning you. But hey, since you're brain damaged, I guess we should make your decisions for you anyway'."
"One thing has really been bothering me almost since I started following left wing American youtubers. There is barely any mention of native americans, and not once have I seen someone actually addressing  the atrocious situation they are in today as an ethnic group. Only a few casual mentions about the European invasion. And at times some middle class teenager who's 10% native american feeling terribly stereotyped. This is a mockery when you consider the actual issues. Such as native americans being the ethnic group with the highest poverty rate, lowest employment rate, highest rate of youth suicide. Or the fact that non-Indians can commit crime against a native in a self-governed reservation and often get away unpunished.   It would not surprise me if they were shown to be the most disadvantage ethnic group in the USA, and surely the most overlooked. Please make a video about this Contra! Give this tremendous problem a little bit of the air time it deserves."
"Frankly, the left could use more prison abolitionism. Caging, especially over non-violent crimes, shouldn't be accepted but is done in part because it always has been. Putting someone in prison for mairjuana possession is particularly absurd. Some states are reforming/looking at reforms, if only because of the cost. There are more constructive, less oppressive ways to deal with people who commit crimes and aren't dangerous offenders."

Well, I suppose this is good because this video will probably reach a bigger audience than your original one... and hey I got to see my name in the credits... so I've got that going for me ..

"So racism is a still kinda thing... in America anyway... well... but how does that justify streghtening identity politics and undermining of right to free speech is till beyond me. Also while racist politics in America may have caused disproprtion in crimes commited between races, they are still crime. Crime is colorblind even if justice isn't. So you either arguing for (this time systematic) increased targeting of certain kind of people or mass pardoning of criminals based on their race... So I hope I'm forgiven to ask: 'Where has my class struggle gone?'"

"The graph you flashed up at 13:14 might not be the best illustration of the point you're making - it would be easy to make the case that 'of course there are more green dots in black neighbourhoods, there are more black people there. If you'd shown white people dots I bet it would be just as bad'. Obviously you did show white stops too, but without pausing the video specifically to find the white people dots then it's easy to get the wrong idea. Maybe clarify this with an annotation?"

Firsty i am white and irish, i do not see how i benefit from being white or how the color of my skin has changed anything about me or anyone i know. Ironicly i find it quite racist of you to assume all white people share your colonial background.  Second, while all the critisism in the video is fair  and i am delighted you made it. It is so easy to look back in hind sight at injustices and mistakes or disguiting behaviour of the past. Name me one country, race, religion, culture, football  team  or however you want to segregate people which has a sqeeky clean past. Granted the topic covered here is very recent /unpleasant. But there was bad things going on in rwanda in the 90's but i dont attribute that to black people. That would be stupid and Incredibly ignorant of me.

"I'm positive there's video evidence of you fleeing through a forest somewhere."
"I like that you focused on the existence of structural racism in this video, as opposed to implicit bias. Both are real and an important part of the problem, but a person who doesn't believe racism exists is probably extra-sensitive to accusations of being biased themselves. It's frustrating that people aren't even willing to hear the facts about implicit bias, and will immediately retreat to the 'I'm not a racist!' defense. I feel that these people are being willfully ignorant, and can easily grasp the notion of implicit bias; they just don't want to admit it to themselves.   But videos like yours give me hope. Getting people to understand structural racism is a good first step, and hopefully it opens up the much, much deeper conversation about racism in America."

"Of course America is still racist, but so is *literally every other country on this planet.* Racism is not something that can ever be destroyed. It should be hated by most decent people, obviously, but no matter how many times you say you hate racism your hatred for hatred won't solve a damn thing. In fact, it only makes everything worse.  Take the way the black community is acting these days. They're nearly there to voting back in segregation laws - they've already done so at a fair amount of colleges, stopping whites, Hispanics, and Asians from getting an education simply because they can't grow the Hell up. Their 'Thug' culture revolves around being worthless to society. Does that mean all black people are worthless to society? Hell no. There are so many that do wonders for the society, but those so many typically don't purposefully sell dope on weekends, rob gas stations, or force women to go into prostitution. They're intelligent enough to get away from that culture that their community promotes and praises, and actually does something with their lives, and rarely force anyone else out of the way for it. They believe in proper equality among the races.  Don't think only blacks can be called worthless, either. There are plenty whites who also promote illegal drug selling and average crime, too, because like many blacks they too were sucked into that culture. The 'Thug' culture invites all races, sexes, and genders to become worthless trash to our society. It doesn't discriminate. As long as you're literally retarded and want to do nothing good in your life, you can be a 'Thug.'  But the fact still remains is that the majority of young blacks today, specifically blacks, are targeting whites for no reason, and on college campuses of all places. If they want to point fingers at racism, they should be going after the older generations, not the younger generation who actually accept blacks as fellow human beings."

"It's a trap!"
"I'm afraid some of these arguments are false, misleading, or don't show the whole picture.  1 The lead paint argument is false, as most (if not everyone) lived in areas with lead paint, so are you saying that everyone else except black people had/have an immunity to the effects of lead? This argument also ignores the fact of blacks committing a disproportional amount of crime in other nations (ex: Australia, South Africa, etc.).  2. The argument of poor/ghetto-ized black people resorting to more crime (due to being more disadvantaged) is true, but the same is true for most (if not all) poor communities around the planet. When beings feel they have to struggle to survive, they are likely to resort to unsophisticated methods of acquiring resources. This is basic survival instincts. So the onus is still on the individuals to choose the less destructive methods of getting by, even if it's difficult.  3. Yes our incarceration rates are horrible and unjust, but just because it's unjust doesn't dismiss the fact the certain groups of people are more likely to be caught engaging in illegal acts. Even with similar usage rates - Black people are more likely to be arrested for drug offenses, because they are more public about it and covet illegal drugs more publicly, than other races. I have personally seen this (first hand), let alone all the rap/hip-hop music talking/encouraging/praising drug use, so much.  4. Yes racism still exists in the US. Blaming/shaming white people will win NO favors. Reparations are NOT the answer.   And finally: It was quite condescending to listen to a white trans woman message to black people about what they can do for themselves (near the end of the video) and must feel insulting to ONCE AGAIN have whites are coming to grant AID to the blacks. As if black people just can't help themselves. SMH!"

"A Note About Captions: I've noticed you're really good about getting captions up within the day for new videos, but I've noticed that a lot of the time, you have text onscreen that's covered up when using captions, for instance, in this video during the bit where you play clips from Roaming Millennial and No Bullshit. If someone's using captions and they want to see that text, they have to pause the video, turn off captions, read it, then turn captions back on every time there's new text and it's just very clunky. You can probably prevent this just by keeping in mind where the captions are during the editing process. I love your work and I thought you could benefit from the accessibility tip!"

"A few criticisms of your video.  1. Following the civil war, many blacks traveled far from their southern homes to seek economic opportunity elsewhere. Many of them became cowboys and laborers of many kinds. Why don't more blacks do this now instead of staying in these redlined districts? Various trade unions across the country provide an incredible opportunity for blacks to earn a good living away from the inner city.  2. Whatever the cause, it is a fact that blacks commit an absurdly higher proportion of violent crime than other racial groups. Very very often these perpetrators of violence are in possession of drugs. Drugs and violence among blacks in the inner city are closely related. Is it right to punish these acts of violence? Should we ignore that the two are connected and that so-called smart policing drastically reduces violent crime in these areas? Is it right to let these men stay on the streets and commit more violence, mostly against other blacks, to offset the alleged white supremacy inherent in America? That doesn't make any sense to me and you don't propose any other solutions on this point. Furthermore, this out of control crime is a relatively recent phenomenon for blacks in America. So obviously it can reverse.  3. Being poor and oppressed in itself doesn't necessarily equal a life of continued poverty and crime. My ancestors were Mormons. Multiple times they were forcefully dispossessed of their homes and most of their property. They were severely persecuted, hated, and violence was constantly perpetrated against them. Each time they rebuilt and thrived more than their persecutors. They finally moved out in the middle of nowhere and were the biggest force in settling the rocky mountains. I'm not saying the two situations are the same, but it proves that persecution and poverty is not necessarily the cause of all this.  4. Why do you ignore single parents? This is obviously a huge factor. The majority of blacks in America today are born to single mothers. Here's a link to pew research: http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/ It's quite clear that growing up in a single-parent home makes it VERY difficult for a child to succeed. Why did you leave this out of your video?  5. There is a mystic maxim that we hear constantly that is presented here in this video. We say 'you just can't ignore the effects of four-hundred years of slavery.' Presumably these are effects on the individual. What are these effects? Does the length of time that black slavery existed past four generations( the space of time it takes for the present generation to have no living person that remembers the event) have some sort of magnifying effect? Is slavery somehow worse or less bad for the descendants depending on how long it lasted? Do we have reincarnated memories from our ancestors that have a compounding effect the farther back they go? No, that's hokey and it doesn't belong in a video that is supposed to be about a rational discussion on race relations in America. Really the only difference the length of time makes is on the size of the population affected and a greater change in language. People will find that it brings more peace if we don't have the descendants of those who were wronged blaming the descendants of those who were perpetrators."

"The Marijuana thing pisses me off to no end. I wanted drug prohibition to end because the war on drugs in the US was done on purpose to target 'ni**ers and hippies' according to none other than Richard Nixon. Now what is happening in areas where drugs are legalized? Blacks aren't setting up marijuana dispensaries, it's the whites that are doing it. The same areas where blacks sold drugs to other blacks now have whites doing it to them. I don't know the details behind it, but I'm pretty sure there's something fucked up afoot.  The same thing has been happening with craft breweries. By and large, almost all craft brewing is done by white males, despite a fairly similar alcohol consumption rate among blacks. Is it because blacks aren't interested in making beer? Or is there something else going on?"

"Some food for thought: In spite of reactionary fear mongering about crime being an epidemic in this country, (thus justifying the need for militarized police and more private prisons) crime nationwide in the US has been on a consistent decline for over 40 years. Stop and Frisk according to numerous statistics, doesn't really work even when they disproportionately target POC. (and it's unconstitutional)  One thing that always bugged me about reactionaries on this matter (and some lefties) is when they cite FBI crime stats to push the notion that Black people disproportionately commit more crime while only making up 12-15% of the population. Granted they only expose their illiteracy when it comes to reading statistics and how the numbers were compiled. Aside from other variables, the stats don't indicate 'crimes committed' but people who were arrested (and not convicted/acquitted/plead out) for a crime. As you stated in the video, LEOs disproportionately target POC for Drug dealing/possession and factor in 'stop and frisk' tactics among other examples of Police bias against POCs and it is safe to assume that main reason why Black people are over represented in FBI stats is... The Police are biased against Black people and thus they disproportionately target them. My issue with Liberals and many Leftists (more so leftists) is that they seem to concede this point to white supremacists when their assertion doesn't really have merit. It's intellectually dishonest, shows that they don't understand statistics and they dog whistle to race 'realists'. Us lefties should have a better response to this deception."

A bigoted conservative can now hide something like transphobia behind not being alt right, so they're not so bad, right? It's the same thing Trump serves to the republicans, the fact he lowers the bar helps them even if they're not on his level of crazy. This is all just building to an epic 2020 election where the left is vastly more unified now that we've had a chance to really understand the enemy."

"Your red lining map of Philly doesn't make sense. For the last 40 years North Philly has become almost 100% black, when it was mixed german, irish, black, Italian, etc.. back in the 20s and 30s when my Grandfather lived in Olney. My dad 100% Italian was from Germantown. Again now almost all black. The red areas of South Philly and Center city are mixed but center city is predominantly white (gayborhood) or mixed, business districts with skyscrapers etc. And south Philly has a large Italian population. North Philly the area not 'Red lined' is  the area that is almost 100%  blacks.  Jewish people  live right outside the city border in the Mainline, Cheltenham/Jenkintown, which is lined with Gated mansions. So don't think your maps are the only  reason things happened like they did.  Bottom line is people have freedom of association and I am glad of it. You can't take poor people who don't know how  to live decently and behave and give them other people's money and put them in a good neighborhood, they would  treat it the same. I know this because I have seen towns who have slum lords move in, rent real cheap and people from the city move into town and next thing you know there are shootings, drugs, and trash everywhere. And I am not talking about a particular race, just  poor people from the city in general. Half of my town is like this because the factories left and slum lords landlords moved in...  renting out super cheap.  Also go look at a industrial area like Kennsington Philadelphia. It is the worst area of the city and it's a combo of white, black and peurto rican.  Its also the crack, heroin, and red light district. Place is scummy. It's  under the l-train but according to friends from Philly it used to be a great neighborhood back in the 70s early 80s until factories moved out.   That's what you are missing. Jobs left. Factories moved to China, plus the immigration act of 65' along with welfare push in the ultra poor to these areas. People with money, (black, white, etc...) don't want to live next to that if they can help it. I am sure some of that had an affect but it doesn't paint the whole picture."

"You are certainly no fool and I can understand why you would come up with some impressively nuanced rationalizations to deny ideas that would imply a rationalization for racism. After all i'm sure you fear what a fascist society would do to a person like you. But have you considered that the issue is in reality a feedback loop whereas blacks behave in ways that whites find distasteful which then results in said whites treating blacks in ways that are less than welcoming? The truth can be painful sometimes. I do hope we one day find a way cure and alleviate your suffering.  By the way you should know full well that blacks take more marijuana arrests due to living in black neighborhoods that do indeed have higher rates of far more serious crimes. I find it hard to believe you didn't consider this. As I said you do seem to be no fool"

"You don't ever address the single strongest argument against your position - the success of a multitude of non-white ethnic groups in American society (Chinese, Japanese, Indian etc.) above that of the white American majority (to say nothing of the success of Jewish whites in comparison to non-Jewish whites).  In a society build on 'white supremacy' why would this ever be tolerated?  The reality is in America those with a high IQ can be successful, irregardless of their skin color. Indeed, certain doors may be open to a high IQ well socialized POC that are not to a white person in the same position (e.g. Senator Barack Obama being elected to the presidency with 2 years of experience in the senate).  The reason why certain ethnicities don't perform as well is because those groups do not have those same qualities. Culture may play a role too, and there may be some low level of residual racism in certain specific areas of American society (though it's hard to see where, seeing as even silicone valley and wall street are both now heavily disproportionately Asian).  'Structural white supremacy' is the excuse used to justify the failure of progressive policies to fix their intended goals, first among those being raising black Americans collectively up to the same social level of white Americans.   If the black illegitimacy rate is nearly 50% higher today than it was in 1953 (23% vs 72%) the most inane explanation is that 'racism is responsible' since no sane person would suggest that racism has gotten more prevalent in the last 50 years. Nothing will improve in American society pursuing the same failed policies based on false assumptions, we have been doing this for more than 70 years now, it's time for something new...  P.S. 'All that stuff, it's very last season I am kindof over it.' No you're not. You bring up Charlottesville constantly, and will keep on doing so in the future."

"Using the term 'white supremacy' confuses the past attitude with the present legacy. I don't think the people you're aiming at believe that white people are inherently superior, and that as a result they should continue to dominate. Instead, they believe that the choices people make are independent of the circumstances in which those choices are made. So it doesn't matter if you're raised in a house with lead paint, in an area with poor economic opportunities, in a community that has negative relations with the police. All you have to do is decide to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and hey presto. The same thinking is used to justify cutting welfare to poor & disabled folk.  They're not racists. They're conservatives. And I don't think you'll convince any of them with this line of argumentation. They're just not open to the idea that the choices we make emerge partially from the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Great video as always, but I think you're preaching only to the choir here."

"Yeah I would love for these kind of things to stop in America. The problem is I don't think framing it as a race issue will fix it any faster. Americans sure do love not paying a lot of taxes. Its why all the cities and infrastructure crumble in a world where you have constantly evolving cities. My neighbourhood has changed drastically due to construction and I live on the outskirts of Edinburgh like within sheep distance. America rots while the rest of the world grows. Perhaps some sort of higher tax should solve this problem? Like maybe invest in community centred housing developments and associations that want to build a decent community with fixed prices but with inflation? Like my view on this whole thing summed up like this. 'Its not a race issue its an inefficiency issue.' letting those people be poor and destitute only costs YOU money. The idea that they would just look the other way as people are retarded due to negligence is fucking disgusting, you basically threw away a decent office worker there. How about you take some small military spending portion of the budget and massively improve rough areas? Like you can justify it by saying its like, strengthening the security of the country by decreasing crime or something. Americans don't seem to like the term 'class' so I'd say just don't use it. Like point to concrete things beyond social grouping categories. 'These children are becoming retarded due to their environment.' Well lets solve that. 'This housing complex isn't up to code.' Pay for the temporary accommodation and replace it with something new and not a human potential waster."

"Did you ever consider the people making those arguments you critique were actually coming from a good place (you know, benefit of the doubt) and could possibly have a point or some facts on their side?  You only think the cops kill black people more often because they do not report when white people are killed.  I'm not saying it's easy coming from poor urban community's but it is certainly possible, I know a few people who've gotten out, and we see other races accomplish moving up the class ladder even after coming here poor.  You imply that mentioning culture as a factor is racist, but culture shapes attitudes & worldview, and if black people all think about the history you talk about in this video as opposed to focusing on the future they will undermine their own ability to achieve.  It's not the whole story that's for sure, you are right about past policy's, but the conservatives are correct that family life & the culture have an influence as well.  There is truth in both sides and if we ignore one while favoring the other we will not grasp the full picture and our suggestions for policy will be that less potent/successful.  Unless B-More's segregation is enforced by law TODAY you have no case.  It is illegal today, people can sue, those covenants would be illegal and you are talking about pre civil rights actions, TODAY dude, how's it happening TODAY?  The segregation continues because poor people don't have the money to move out, you haven't listed any ways anyone could be blocked today?  Whites sleep at night because #NOTALL lol, you and your collective guilt would be labeled racism if you applied it to any other group dude.  Yes, even black people say don't commit the crime if you don't want to do the time, at least every black person I've known, a few who went to jail for it too, says that.  Your point about weed only works if they are arresting black people in states where it's legal and not arresting white people.  BLM is everything you think it's not, they end their cult chant with 'we have nothing to lose but our chains' from Marx, which is sad because if they think they have chains on they literally do, except they are their own chains, they are free to live as anyone else & EVERYONE would be on their side if they are mistreated.  Back to your original arguments: I bet the YouTuber's & people you hear making the arguments you critique at the start are getting them from people like Larry Elder & Thomas Sowell.  They are convincing arguments, they do not mean there is no racism or police brutality but they do point out the black community didn't have these problems prior to the welfare state, there were times black kids were more likely to grow up with two parents prior to the welfare state, that rate is now around 75% I think.  Even Obama said kids born to a single parent are far more likely to end up in jail, not graduate, etc. your likely part of the left that thinks more welfare & reparations will fix things, it's unlikely to help at all."
"Well the Nazis have come to the comment section, god damn"
"I think Contrapoints is right that historical discrimination drives disproportionate criminality and lower rates of economic success, but no one likes being called a racist; therefore it is very counter productive when minority rights advocates accuse those following race neutral policies which under such conditions will necessarily produce a disparate impact 'racists'.  Contrapoints' argument should be judged on its content and not the color of her skin, and while we should listen to minority perspectives the idea that those perspectives are superior merely because of the identity of the speaker is where those advocates cross the line into racism.  If some alt right clown said that Muslim immigrants can't understand French culture we call that person a bigot, and we should say the same to any minority who thinks white people can't understand their background.  IMO minority rights advocates should focus on things like criminal justice reform, drug legalization, education reform and similar issues instead of turning every disputed use of police force into a proxy trial for racism in America. But at least the police have power which they need to be held to account for, the treatment of non alt right run of the mill libertarians, centrists, and conservatives who don't fall 100% in line on college campuses is just inexcusable and only serves to drive people to Trump and the alt right."

I didn't even know who Spencer was till one of your antifags jumped up on him & your lamestream zoomed in on his hail trump idiocy. my point is the more you people engage in this identity politics crap the further you are going to divide the country.

"Isnt the basic narrative of black lives matter that there just many police officers that are explicitly racist and like to shoot black people? If you look at the statistics by police encounters, black people are not more likely to be shot than are white people and black officers are just as likely to shoot black people as white police officers are. That narrative doesnt really hold up.  The issue is police violence in the USA in general, if you compare the USA to other first world countries the police kills somewhere between a couple dozen to a hundred times more people per capita. The whole way police are taught places the life of an officer way higher than that of a potential perpetrator. It is apparently protocol to turn potentially innocent people into Swiss cheese instead of risking even the most unlikely chance to get hurt and then acquit the officers, like in the killing Daniel Shaver."

Usa has creates incentives for everyone to do better with amazing upward mobility.  Theure especially aimed at blacks and disporpotionaly hurt others. Whatever. Thats a non issue though. 52% of violent crimes. So increased police presence equals higher arrest rates for everything illegal including weed. There was that white kid killed for weed by a cop... whatever. Weird. Idk why i typed that up. Anyway. Is it a prison problem or an arrest win? Ok so is it fallacious to say usa is an extreme so the other end is no one in prison because no gets arrested? Sounds great. Murderers and robbers running free. Kinda likr the florida shooter thanks to the 'dont police our school kids to increase our grants funds' that turned out so freaking well! Maybe youre right though. Its not the welfare state that incentivizes crime life and destruction of the family unit. You said it yourself though. Collectively theyre victims. Individually theyre not. Hence the rights detest for collectivist politics(communism?). Weird."

"'Extrajudicial executions for nonviolent crimes shouldn't be a common thing in a civilized democracy.'  They're not.  Every metric will prove this.  Compare your extrajudicial executions for nonviolent crimes to the number of justifiable homicides where the suspect was wielding a lethal weapon before lumping them conveniently together.  As for how I'm sleeping as a 'fellow White person?'  Just fine. I spent 3 years teaching an HBCU and over 30 years living in a majority black town. My students were black.  My boss was black.  The person who bought the house I lived in for years (WHICH CONTAINED LEAD PAINT) was black.  Every person I saw or interacted with for weeks at a time was black.  I could tell you all the discrimination I got for being one of the only Whites at an all black school, or growing up in a Black neighborhood, or the litany of other casual racist stuff I had to endure, but hey: I get it - nothing, not even giving my life for black people will prove me 'not a racist.'  Christianity tried to pull the same thing on me, and the whole 'original sin' bit is getting old.  I could tell you a litany of stories and insight I gained in teaching black kids how to read and write for 3 years, but it's probably easier to just ignore this and make some sloppy correlations (that must equal causation!) about lead paint in houses -> violent crime -> raycism!  Let's not forget the evil drugs 'White People' are pushing now with that gentrified medicinal marijuana.  Want to know what country the vast majority of medicinal marijuana comes from?  I'll let you look that up on your own.  Hint: it's conveniently located in the Middle East, and the inhabitants are not White.  Also don't forget that saying marijuana is racist against Hispanics too.  $8000 for 20 minutes of this.

"I typically fall into the 'Classical Liberal' camp. However, I do recognize the lasting cycle of poverty & poor education. I've always acknowledged that individual instances of racism are ALWAYS going to exist being perpetrated by AND against ALL racial groups. There are always going to be shitty people of all kinds out there, determined to be shitty people in one form or another, racism being just one way.  I agree that the USA needs to focus on improving its education system, especially in the poorest neighbourhoods. I also agree that the USA needs to improve the way it addresses poverty. The poor health care system also likely contributes to these problems. I agree that a lot of criminals come from poverty & engage in crime out of desperation & giving up because they were failed by the education system.  I also agree that the prison problem in the USA is ridiculous & the entire judicial system needs improvement. I still also hold the belief that every individual is responsible for their own choices in life & that they all understand the risks they are taking when they do what they do. We need to look at why, even knowing about the increased likelihood of getting caught, these people are making these choices & what, exactly, these choices are because different crimes should NOT be treated the same. Different crimes also have different motivations.  And as for white privilege, if you take all other racial groups together aside from blacks & whites, whites commit more crimes, even after factoring for percentage of population, including when breaking it down further to different types of crimes. Whites commit all types of crimes at exponentially higher rates than all other groups put together, except blacks. This could also be due to the issues of poverty that the poorest whites face. Many smaller populations within the white population live in poverty similar to blacks, & we can see the similarities & correlations between these different impoverished groups. It's certainly a hell of a lot more complicated than they just simply choose to be criminals. It's also a hell of a lot more complicated than all whites are privileged & all blacks are oppressed. It's not that simple, & never really was in the case of all whites having privilege.  Poverty has always, in my opinion, been the biggest contributing factor & the biggest form of privilege in this discussion. Blacks just have a higher percentage of their population in poverty because ALL blacks started in poverty. They've only had the last 50~ years to be able to try to catch up. If such a high percentage of whites still can't find their way up out of the cycle of poverty, it's to be expected that blacks will, too. And with the public school system in the USA being still fairly privatized, there is certainly not the education-wise level playing field that other countries have to help give the poor a chance to something better.  I just don't want to take away from their own personal autonomy in their ability to choose differently because I don't think that helps in the long run to promote the idea that they CAN'T choose differently in their situation- because they CAN & many DO. I would prefer to increase promotion & encouragement for them to do so, & hopefully programs are improved to provide more incentive."

Because, from my experience, a lot of white conservatives get their warped opinions on crime and punishment/economics from personal experience with 'moochers' or family members/people in their lives doing bad shit and getting away with it, and I have a hypothesis that they project their assumptions gleaned from that onto the black community rather than recognizing that a lot of those are pretty-heavily white pathologies due to white privelege..."

"Racism is clearly problem in the US. The question that bothers me is: Is the US a more or less racist society than others. My belief is that Youtube is dominated by racists and Nazis, but this is wildly out of kilter with actual US lived experience. Of course these youtube trolls are hell bent on converting the majority to their white supremacist views and this is a problem. However if you are an immigrant to a country where you will be in a small minority, the US is still a pretty good choice. In most parts of the US, especially cities, nobody will notice your color or ethnicity. People are used to diversity. This is not the case in most countries in Europe. You may not be discriminated against, you may be welcomed, even celebrated, but you will never be accepted as a French/English/Irish/Czech/whatever even if you get citizenship.

It is not right to praise a country that constantly commits hate crimes, passes deplorable laws, and elects f@scists as president. I'm glad there are people like Contra to be reasonable in a society that pushes away fact in an attempt to defend an arbitrary idea of 'superiority' or just plain fear."
"i nut everytime i see contrapoints uploading a videp"
"That was very good.  I hope the 'remix' gets the attention it deserves.  (I feel there was a lot of very current and uptodate information!)  And while, like you, I don't want to overplay the lead issue, I want to just say: lead is fucking scary.  I work in engineering (fun if you are queer, BTW) and many people are so nonchalant about it, it's quite upsetting."
"if people of different races use cannabis at the same rate of use, its important to specify how 'rate of use' is defined - frequency or a binary?.  'how many times on average per...' or 'have you used in last..'    the latter introduces a skew that could be hiding a large disparity."
"How do u even fit a slice of lime in a budlight bottle wha"
"HAIL SEITAN  Thank you for this. As you said, the lead issue is just one small part of this, but it was one that I had never heard about before and a reminder again about how racism and poverty screws people over in so many different long-term ways..."

"I get so annoyed when people talk as if the past has nothing to do with the present...as if there are no effects still lingering from slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, etc. it was literally only 50 some years ago that the civil rights act was enacted, that‚Äôs really not that long ago. Sadly, People would rather keep their blinders on though"
"Its fitting you end this with a church song. The church of social justice. Fuck it. Makes about as much sense as the rest of them."
"Mostly good points mixed with at least two bad ones. 'Gentrifying' marihuana: You showed that the marihuana laws disproportionately affect black people and you demand that such systems should be abolished. Agreed. But then when some states legalize it and entrepreneurs spring up, you complain that whites also profit from that, and if you don't find that unjust, you might just not care about black people. That's unreasonable. You can't say you want one thing and when that happens move the goal posts. Makes you look like the only thing you genuinely care about is complaining. (I'm not saying that's the case, I'm saying it makes you look like it) Listening to black voices: That's reasonable, agreed. However it does not follow that therefore you should stop listening to others as you seem to imply by suggesting we unsubscribe... that's the notion of the progressive stack that 'privileged' voices speak last, whereby privilege is measured by skin-tone and other superficial nonsense, which quite honestly is objectively racist. If you can't acknowledge that, then you will never convince the majority of people with skin tones you decide to discriminate against for _some inexplicable reason_ .  Addionally: constantly guilt-tripping the current generation for crimes of their ancestors is unjust and unreasonable. Sure it's also unjust that they start off with better conditions, but punishing the innocent for the crimes of the guilty won't annihilate that injustice... it just creates another one. The way to minimize racism is to stop obsessing about race... recognize race, sure, fine, but for the love of god, don't view everything through the lens of race because that's fucked up beyond words (as history has shown over and over and over and over and over and over and over again)."
"America: SJWs still reaching levels of self delusion that shouldnt even be possible."
"Contra, this video is awesome as are you (mostly) but here is some constructive criticism for your consideration.  Now I know you‚Äôre making a joke out of it but real talk, you‚Äôve been on a trend of ‚Äúeveryone I disagree with is a fascist‚Äù is more of an intellectual crutch than a joke.  When you‚Äôre on topic and getting down in the dirty details you‚Äôre great. The low-key slander and impugning by false equivocation is not a good look for you."

"What a coincidence, I just got my forest tranny licence last week!  I feel like racism would be close to solved if we drowned all yt people tbh.  No, being trans has nothing to do with wanting to die, why would you suggest that?"
"Very educational, thank you."
"Baltimore? That's funny, I just finished watching all 5 seasons of The Wire. ü§î"
"16:11 the only point i disagree with. The BIG difference is those people who are in jail sold weed illegally. I know its 'just weed' but its still a fuckin crime and they chose to commit it. Also i bet there are loads of black business men selling weed legally rn, its not only the 'white men' so this was a reach."
"Not to... cis-splain vocal ranges to you, but re:the last few minutes, I‚Äôve known cis women whose range rivaled some baritones, so please don‚Äôt feel like you have to sing higher. I mean, sing however makes you happy, but just know that your range is perfectly womanly no matter what it is."

"Stupid question, why the battle hymn of the republic at the end and not the John Brown version of the song?"
"Another excellent  video.  I see a similarity with your video 'Baltimore: Anatomy of an Uprising'  I'm not complaining,  just noticing similarity  is script and stats used.  Also,  I just watched a documentary on PBS's 'Independent Lens' series called 'Rat Film' that used rats in Baltimore as a jumping off point to talk about institutionalized discrimination. Check it out  if you can."
"Can you please not use the T-slur, even in an ironic context? Thanks."
"i think white people just arent used to being lumped together, the way that black people and other POC have been for basically all of human history. so they tend to push back, instinctively, without actually listening to what protesters say."

"How about I stay subscribed, but I follow way more black creators."

"down with the battle hymn, up with john brown's body"
"When I hear the oversimplified and horseshit response, 'well blacks just commit more crimes! They're violent/thugs' I want to smash my face into concrete. people always CONVENIENTLY seem to leave/forget that for profit private prisons exist and have written into their contracts (based on the last case study I read in 2014) that they need to remain as full as possible to make more profit for the owners and shareholders? If that's the case, then yeah, let's round up minorities and toss em on in there whether or not a law was legitimately broken or whether or not a crime was actually committed. If you don't factor in these really critical aspects to the crime rate and how it really kinda serves to skew accuracy of crime statistics, you're being dishonest if you refuse to consider the role it does play. Yeesh."

"Ive totally heard the first part of this argument before...like literally the same argument point by point...maybe shaun or some other youtuber....just sayin'"
"I believe that black people are making bad choices. Rowdy protesters and thugs always hanging around without a job to get to. My race acts more like a bunch of circus animals than actual human beings. Then wanna just go around calling people nazis                (If you believed that I was actually being truthful and liked this then you are an actual racist and if I offended my race I apologize. I just wanted to make an example of these 'non-racist' people'"
"While I really liked this video, I find it curious that I feel like half of this video was already done by you previously? The Freddie Gray story was one you had laid out in good detail previously so it felt like maybe only half of it contributed new information. Then again, if you just wanted to revisit the topic and hoped this would be a better video on the subject to replace the previous video that had more been a look at a single case, then I can see the value in that ^-^"

"No offense but you overestimate racist white people. I have been a leftie all my life and at this age I finally recognise the limits in the belief system. Oh I still believe in the ideals of the left but I have long given up on believing in peoples' capacity to grow and change. This is the advantage the right has and why they win so often. Recognising man's animanl nature, they craft their strategy to manipulate it. Meanwhile on the left we believe people are making rational, moral choices and are just ignorant of the facts. No, racism is rooted in the primal, animalistic part of the human brain. Everything else is just backward rationalisation. You can't teach them or explain to them why they are wrong."
"3 not so-short points. 'not my racism friend' The internet has a problem with americanocentrism. That's almost a fact. The us is the default for everything both because it is the larger usergroup and because the us has a lot of political influence. However, it is still only about 40% of the western userbase. When non-us citizens are confronted they may wonder why the us is being backwards again. But at the same time they often get caught in the crossfire of us racial politics and somehow find themselves under attack for nothing. This seems to create a lot of tension. Therefore I would like to ask. Is the current approach actually suitable to the internet or just to a fantasy us version? Furthermore what would be the results of this disconnect?   'why then don't you talk about that' It's just disappointing how things like the lead paint, redlining, fraud, the prison system often get unexplained. Instead we get people who berate whites for wearing dreadlocks. That's just the pinnacle of elitist nonsense and actually one of the great causes of the dislike of black activism. There is great classism Which is really annoying because most examples of systemic racism are actually detrimental to all lower-class groups but just more damaging to the black neighboorhoods in particular. Why do people campaign for black women in movies instead of renovating black houses? where is the united push to abolish private prison? why do people campaign for some upper-class black people in congress who'll still be the companie's lackeys instead of creating a broad push for voter reform? Why do I care bout this? it's not my problem. I'm Dutch. Well, because it's just infuriating to watch and because I'm sick of this goddamn crossfire. by all means fix it. But, fix it...  'But at least try to sell the vacu√ºm' Blm just sucks at optics and has taken all the oxygen available for a large-scale black emancipation movement.. Yeah, it is good at getting protestors. But it seems mostly good at being angry instead of constructive. I'm not saying they should placate... well fuck it. they should placate the group in charge. how else are you going to get things done? I'm not aware of black people having tanks in their backyard."
"My day just got better with a new contra video."
"I don't really care about black people, not because I'm racist though. The secret is that I don't really care about anyone who's not in my immediate vicinity. Call me what you want, at least I'm honest with myself. When I look at this video or videos of people on the 'right', I just get reminded of how stupid everyone is, none of this is worth anyone's time, nobody will ever speak about this honestly except maybe one or two satirical cartoons... at least it was entertaining. Good job on that."

"Another part of the problem are 'average' Americans who go to YouTube for cat videos and base their vote mostly on who promises to lower their taxes and besides, 'Black Panther' proves that racism is over, right?  Organized white supremacy is still basically a fringe issue, but Trump and the GOP capitalizing on white grievance and ignorance is still a thriving industry.  Also, speaking as a middle-aged white guy, I hope to be ContraPoints when I grow up!"

"Really glad you‚Äôve tackled this topic, especially as it relates to housing discrimination. A sociology course I was in abt gender and family looked at racial inequality in depth and some people were so resistant to it.

"i love u big sis"
"Natalie, I really like your videos but I've noticed a troubling theme with your (and the rest of the 'SJW' left's) content. The notion of Fascism as simply 'bigotry made political' isn't in really representative of the vast majority of third positionary thought and the propagation of this convenient post-war strawman doesn't really do anything for the discourse other than malign a group with an incredibly large amount of Revolutionary potential (disenfranchised young white men) and force them into the Lumpenproletariat (making them support a system that is fundamentally opposed to their interests). I know this view isn't a popular one and I pretty much only hold it because of my reactionary origins and sympathies but I think it's something to consider. I guess what I'm saying is that I think a lot could be gained from having actual discussions with some elements of the ACTUAL reactionary right in order to produce some synthesis of the alienated.  I doubt I can change your mind but hope you read this.  P.S. Keep up the good work of creating content."
"CONTRA POINTS WE LOVE YOU"
"The racism of the past *MUST* be put to rest. Recent generations were not alive during that period and should not be held responsible for the past actions of (probably long dead) ancestors. It is the fixation of the past actions and the blanket assumption that all people ‚Äúinsert colour/prefix here‚Äù are guilty of ‚ÄúX‚Äù crime because their ancestors carried out said actions, that prevents us from moving forward.  If we don‚Äôt sort this out we‚Äôre going to repeat history, whether we intend to or not."
"Battle hymn of the republic? Solid choice."

"The alt-right 'free speech' warriors are already preparing mass-flagging campaigns for this video"

"I agree with this wholeheartedly. My only problem is your use of 'classical liberal.' You seem to you that term for any sort of center-right opinion. Most of the classical liberals (including myself) primarily blame the state for the oppression of people of color."
"Spicy content"
"This may be a controversial statement, but you probably should have linked to videos by activists of color rather then just explaining things the way you did at 17:30  It doesn't mater if you got it word for word from a professor of African American Studies, white people explaining to black people how they should feel about racism will always be... white people explaining to black people how they should feel about racism."

Thanks Contra :)"

"These are all the same points you made in your other video about race. (They're still good points, but still, why make another video if you're going to say the same thing?)  Also, way to be postmodern with all of this data. That's fine, but you can't shit on scientists like you did in your other video about autogynophilia (which was pseudoscience to start with) if you're going to use data anyway.  But you have a point like you did a year ago, I'll give you that."
"Big fan of your videos. So refreshing to see this type of content in the sea of alt-right reactionary videos. Looking forward to seeing more. All the best."

Thanks, righties.   BTW: I am not from the US and I don‚Äôt want anybody to think that I am looking down on the US here. In my country racism is a real problem as well and in recent times it is getting worse. So yeah, you could apply the same sarcastic tone to many other countries as well: ‚ÄúRacism? Here? Nooowaaaay...‚Äù    Thanks Natalie for taking the time to make this video."
"Are you going to respond to Alternative Hypothesis‚Äô video he did on your race video?

"I'm white and I know white people are ruining the weed industry in California. They made licensing so expensive that only wealthy people and venture capitalist can afford to work in the industry 'legally', effectively monopolizing the industry and pushing out anyone with a good idea and the ability to grow a business from the ground up. In 2016, Californians voted, under the guise of legalization, to take something that was already legal and effectively make it impossible for a working class person to buy into the industry while simultaneously taxing it 25-35%."
"A lot of people on the internet, especially outrage youtubers(sargon, BPS) really dont care and will use mismatched and cherry picked statistics to justify why they dislike PoC and women.

"Dear Black people, please give this video to all your friends."
"loves it"
"Oh great, another ideologically driven cherry picked video that will further push people to, and reinforce, alt-right scum positions. While I appreciate what you might think you're trying to do, if you continue to be this intellectually dishonest all you're really doing is making the situation worse and personally benefiting from the division you are helping create."
"I was once intensely alt right, then again in high school I swung between intensely communist and willing to die for a Ayn Rand's perfect psuedo-minarchist state. I'm intensely eclectic and endearing weeee~~  However, you have changed my mind for the better in more ways than one."

"Also, America has an embarrassingly short memory. Black people (and Indigenous people especially) are always the canary in the coalmine.

"love this!"
"I fucking LOVE your videos. Thanks again for blowing up the 'they're just questions' pseudo argument as well as pointing out the fact that people don't have to be 'angels' to be victims of violence.

"You're the first user I have ever belled."
"Got any Vitallimax left? Or you sold out?"
"Yeah, who knew literally poison black children would actually have some effects on statistics"
"miss ContraPoints no fun to play ? the White man is awake and ready for the fight Words lite nazi and racist have very little mening its have lost its grip and Power over us most of us by know knows of Cultural Marxism and other bs  whty dont u stand up for your leftys bullcrap vs the golden one ore any other of the high raking Alt right  u going to have to face us sooner or later if u ever want to try to stop us we will soon take over and its game over"
"Are you the piano girl now?"
"Oh shit new Contrapoints video  Heck yeah boyssss"
"You are a goddess. So glad I found your channel."
"M o m! üíï"
"Using single incidents of injustice, while great for whipping up emotional hype, don't do intellectual justice to the deeper issues."
"why am i attracted to freya i just cant say no to a girl in leather dammit contra great vid as usual"
"Nat. I love your voice lately."
"Hey, did you already release this video?"
"I don‚Äôt always agree with your content, yet you still raise valid and fresh perspectives on these topics, it makes your work always engaging"
"Contrapoints: Still Crazy. Racial segregation would equal blacks not being able to complain about white people anymore and they could go build Wakanda in Africa as they violently kick out white South Africans, without compensation. Also, there are plenty of black people who don't have this perspective on racism, both historically and on YouTube, i.e. Tree of Logic, Diamond & Silk, Tommy Sotomayor, Thomas Sowell, Carol Swain, Morgan Freeman, Zora Neale Hurston, etc. I could name many more and know they are often annoyed by this constant white pity."
"Please start posting videos of you covering left anthems"
"I always felt that the 'it's not my responsibility' argument was a little weird because at least the people I've seen try to represent themselves as agents for positive change, which means that.....yeah, it your responsibility. However, I can understand the frustration of dealing with people who expect you to educate them and are not interested in doing anything to find out for themselves."
"Thee weed hast been gentrifi'ed, Randall."
"Unsubcribed"
"America is the least racist it ever has been. The resurgence in racism is due to left wing intersectionality and hatred for whites under the dog whistle of 'diversity'."
"hey baby, you look kind of hot in that nazi uniform"
"I would suggest everyone read ' *The Color of Law* 'by Richard Rothstein on Audible. It talks about the long history of the American Gov't using racist laws the segregate integrated neighborhoods and how that still affects us TODAY. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pb6y9rNKmo"
"Still baffled by how amazing your German is. Almost redeems the Fritz character in a way, but then you have to remember he is a Nazi."
"Freya is Blaire white"
"I got used to 1 hour long videos, and now this? What else do I suppose to do this month?"
"What a great birthday present! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Our Wondrous queen has returned"
"still fantastic. Absolutely amazing."
"Ugh I got physical pain from that roaming millennial video."
"America needs to mandate reading of Malcolm x and Dr King, in both autobiographies they metion the problems of houses allocated to black families including the case of a young girl who was bitten by a rat"
"I haven't seen your videos in a while but holy shit it's just as great (or even better) than you're older videos!"
"rando alt righter: So lead paint is racist?"
"That Tabby whistle though"
"Love you QUEEN."
"I really hate when people tell me the reason I believe certain things, is because they somehow know better than I do that I'm really ashamed to be white."
"YOUTUBE DIDNT NOTIFY ME NATALIE I‚ÄôM SORRY I LOVE YOU"
"1. anecdotal evidence 2. in-group favoritism 3. okay, but much more complex if you look for the reasons, and jumping from mass incarceration to BLM and kneeing is so diffuse and ruining your point. 4. i won't unsubscribe, but i already listened to SomeBlackGuy ;)))"
"Contra be slayin"
"I just discovered you and I'm binge watching all your stuff. You're brilliant.   Next video... the rise and fall of Laci Green..."
"5:24 No, what I was thinking was: 'Police brutality also happens to white people, and the police also get away with it despite their terrible ability to actually do a cover-up well.'"
"Not part 2 on 'whats wrong with captalism'  My heart is bronken, Contra, BROKEN"
"Freya sounds so cute speaking german"
"This was my favorite video of yours, really happy you remade it."
"Actually, I think I would like to hear the story of trans woman Nazi Contra transition"
"the original Baltimore vid has been one of my faves for ages, I'm delighted to see it remade"
"Yay! You're using fake blood because 'real blood looks terrible! Only fake blood looks real!'"
"Notification comrades unite!"
"I love how every time someone fucks up they ensconce their apology statement with two obligatory 'I have Black friends' Black people from the office, you'll just have to stand there for a minute, Barry, please, I'll write you a bonus"
"I always love your videos. Informative, artistic, and thought provoking.  ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Ms Points, I believe you are trying to seduce us"
"Oh shit, I wasn't expecting another video so soon -  consider my evening made!"
"Noah fence"
"Notification squad?"
"Hmm... This looks... Contra - versial... ;)"
"These videos just keep getting hotter and hotter"
"Thumbs up for Natalie's new b00bz"
"This video is partially an adaptation of a video I made over a year ago called ‚ÄúBaltimore: Anatomy of an Uprising.‚Äù That video is my least-viewed video, and I‚Äôve gotten a lot better at YouTubing since I made it, so I‚Äôve been eager to try the topic again.   The middle section of this video is more or less a remix of the ‚ÄúBaltimore‚Äù video, with some passages recycled more or less verbatim. In this video I‚Äôve added a new introduction, a new section on mass incarceration, and all around better framing and style.  The thesis of this video, that America is still racist, should not really be controversial, but here we are. I guess this is my attempt to nudge the YouTube Overton window a little toward ‚ÄúHow should we address the racial injustice that exists in America?‚Äù and away from ‚ÄúAre the international Jewry cucking the white race or are non-denominational globalists responsible?‚Äù  EDIT: 0:31 I misspelled 'Millennial.' This is what happens when you don't sleep. But hey, I have deadlines."
"I love you ContraPoints"
"This video hasn't been up long enough to comment on it, but it's good. As always."
"Personally, I don't think America is racist, I think America is just culturally ignorant any culture that is other than American culture, also don't even get me started on cultural biases. Lol"
"I WANT A TUBBY WHISTLE"
"My day just improved ten fold :D"
"I think a big factor in the ignorance of historical opression is that people often feel like something that happend before they were born has the same influence on modern society as ancient greece. Maybe I'll do a video about this. Btw I'm always impressed how good your german is!"
"Tiki Freya... m-m-m, tonal dissonance <3"
"Load, damn it! Curse my internet!"
"Should I watch now or wait for Contra in her full 1080p glory?"
"yay!"
"90 min of sleep paid off"
"capitalism part 2 ????????????"
"Hey, I was wondering when you‚Äôre (or if you‚Äôre) going to do a capitalism part two. Love your stuff!"
"Is there something wrong with being racist"
"hey"
"Of course it is, it's built on white supremacy. There is no recourse for people of color.  Salty white people dont @ me. Your defensiveness and 'not all white people' makes you complicit."
"I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS"
"AMERICA IN STILL RACIST SHOC-...wait, that's not a shock at all?!...carry on."
"Contrapoints! You are amazing!!! <3"
