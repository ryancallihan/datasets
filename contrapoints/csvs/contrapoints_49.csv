"WELCOME TO THE FREE SPEECH ZONE"
"Does anybody know where she gets her huge earrings in her look from 16:04 to the end?? I really want them"
"'Biology is the nature of pronouns' The German language calls washing mashines, bottles, pages in a book, even the air 'she'"
"I can't believe men can make a living trying to be edgy on TV, I mean did Ben Shapiro ever do anything to enrich anyone's life"
"where i live we have only one pronoun for male and female. How Am i SUpPoSeD to kNow YoUr aNatOmY"
"You're so talented and beautiful"
"Even if C16 didn‚Äôt result in anyone going to prison due to misgendering so far, the issue is that the state now has the power to compel speech, which in principle, is wrong."
"This is great!!!!"
"I love how right-wing transphobes call trans people 'snowflakes' for (rightly) getting angry at transphobes, but the second they see the word 'feminist' or 'vegan' they are absoloutley fucking furious"
"Shapiro is an obvious executive level troll.  He has an agenda and socio-political stance to maintain and he's going to do that, come hell or high water.  The only person that might have any real effect on his position is a close friend or family member who was trans or non-binary.  Someone he cared enough about to actually feel bad about trolling.  Otherwise, he's going to stick with his schtick."
"Thank you for the education. Trying to unlearn is hard but you make it easier."
"Uuuugh, I'm sorry, but why does it have to be 'they' and 'them'.  I got points marked off on essays for that shit and I don't like it now that people can just do it willy-nily, no pun intended."
"Lol, ‚ÄúI was a yum yum though.‚Äù"
"Comrade, the best non gendered pronoun :)"
"'you cut that out now or you'll be going home in an ambulance' Ha that's where you're wrong snowflake, ambulances don't take people home they take people to hospitals"
"i dont want to hate on you, but the makeup around your eyes kinda reminds me of windows-xp application windows glitching out and its making it really hard for me to focus"
"I like your videos and all but i can't finish anyone of them because their atmosphere scares me"
"Bitch, you are valid as fuck. Thank you for all you do."
"how about we ditch gendered pronouns entirely? maybe right-wing snowflakes would be more down for that so they dont have to strain their brains too much?"
"o √∫nico defeito desse v√≠deo √© que ele acaba!"
"I love when you laugh at your own funny/rediculousness"
"'In expression, I am a mess.' SO RELATABLE."
"I think if people can call their boats 'she' they can handle calling a trans woman 'she'."
"Another argument against this 'idea of she and he are exclusively biological, therefore we should not call transgender people by what they want':  -Actually, in lots of languages it's not only contextually wrong, it's also a fact that it is not used like this. In Spanish, the second most spoken language in the United States, we use 'el' and 'la' as articles to indicate the sex of a person, being the pronoums '√©l' and 'ella'. However, we use this also as a form of naming objects. With this idea, if we say 'la computadora' as 'the computer', we are adding two X chromosomes to a piece of plastic. Using this words in a biological sense in a day to day language is not appropriate nor logical."
"Mademoiselle Phuan :))))))) I always say phuan to annoy my French friends, and this cracked me up :D"
"Everytime I watch this video, apart from the great explanation of pronouns, I always end up thinking about how well made the characters are. Like, how can someone, in a video, most literally, tell me 'Go to hell!' and make me feel something similar to when gives me a blessing? Well, that's just Lenora. Less than 5 minutes of screentime and I already can understand that, for her, telling someone to go to hell is a compliment. That's... simply amazing. Thank you for your good wishes ma'am (?)"
"This is nonsense... I can't help that I call someone he if he/she sounds and looks like a dude. Why should I put so much effort for trans feelings...when in normal life, I couldn't give two shits about how ANYONE feels. I treat everyone the same. :)"
"As an English as Foreign Language teacher I say, in the past (like, from I don't know when until 15 years ago) the rule for pronouns was: when you dont know what to use, use 'she', 'her' and 'hers' and the addressee has to deduce, by context, it is supposed to be a neutral usage (even when it was about concrete nouns, not necessarily persons). After some serious struggle from linguists - including me - from around 15 years ago has been also accepted the rule that, even in formal settings, whenever you can it's ok to use the expression 'he or she' accompanied by the plural pronouns as in 'they'.  From around 8-5 years ago, serious struggle from gender politics influencers - including me - estabilished now it's also ok , even in formal settings, to abandon the cumbersome 'he or she' and just use always 'they' with the according plural pronouns, SO PLEASE, dont ruin our schooling struggles saying now the correct use is mixing 'they' with singular pronouns, it will confound the minds of the all poor dears trying to learn to be PC cosmopolitan bilinguals, they will feel their rl became like trying to read 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' LOL Please, everyone, help me try to estabilish it's correct to pronominate in plural even to refeer to a singular subject."
"I'm really enjoying this video but for some reason, I have an irresistible urge to watch the golden one. Weird."
"Criterion collection classics üòÇ"
"SHITGIBBON"
"Ben is always talking so fast, he looks like a muppet being portrayed by someone who just downed to much coffee."
"In fairness, I very much do not look like a man. I was born female but I've been called sir or been mistaken for a man on many occasions."
"What's even more confusing is how where I'm from there is just one word for gender and sex"
"Got an ad for AMAZE Org before the video started playing"
"I've found that some of the people I have come across who are against calling trans people by their pronouns, also refer to me being only Polynesian. When in fact I am biracial. To these people I can never refer to myself as being of European descent. To them, that part of my lineage doesn't exist at all."
"Lol"
"Ben Shapiro‚Äôs voice sounds so dumb, I wonder how people took him seriously in the first place"
"I fricken love this video üëè"
"MAMWESEL PWAü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"finally, the pigeontoed representation ive been seeking for so long"
"You have four eyebrows."
"Oh no not bencil sharpener"
"I LITERALLY JUST GOT AN ADD FOR THE DAILY WIRE ON THIS VIDEO"
"15:10 gold"
"Nice arrangement of Bach's 'Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582' at the beginning of the video."
"12:23 I can actually smell Ben Shapino shitting himself"
"Pronouns, on the most base level, are based purely on how we perceive the target. We see someone we perceive to be a woman and tell out friend how we find her attractive. Ben Shapiro loses the argument because he removes objectivity and his religious bias reigns supreme. I am all for using your preferred pronoun of he/she, but do not get the backlash when someone accidentally mis-genders someone.   Also can we stop pretending like the amount of people that have so far gone to jail is a measure of what a law allows? Compelled speech never ends well and a law that supports it is bad. Bill C-16 is bad because it allows someone to compel the speech of someone else under the law. That is not a plus and just because it has yet to happen, does not mean the bill should continue to exist. Free Speech is important and as we saw in the UK with Count Dankula, bills to limit speech only end up doing more harm then good.  I think you are trying to present pronouns as something more then they actually are, because you claim that you cannot use appearance alone except that is the nature of pronouns. Used in the third person in conversation to denote the person or group of people. I would even argue that your argument about the way a person acts (i.e. mannerisms, etc) are all a part of the appearance. It is how you present yourself to the world. This is why I hate it when people try to compare names with pronouns. It is an ignorant argument."
"ben shapiro= not a real man"
"Loved the retro Elvira-esk intro. Lovely."
"Your production is off the charts good. I love your work."
"THE SECOND PART OF THIS VIDEO WAS FUCKING CONFUSING!!!"
"Damn, I love your videos so much. I agree with a lot of what you say, but you have also made me think about my opinions. There are also a small amount of things that we still disagree on, but that obviously doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt like you or the ways you express your views. I love how you logically explain your views while still making it theatrical and funny and artistic. I just love it."
"cw: they critical  I honestly prefer the made up words xem/xe/ze or whatever to a singular 'they,' but I also understand that people think that established words are more legitimizing. When I use 'they' for a singular person it's always because 1. you asked me to or 2. i'm talking about a total stranger and I have no way of knowing who they are or how they identify, like the author of a book I liked that's named Taylor for example. Once I know someone, it feels like I'm distancing myself from them by saying 'they,' like, 'I don't know her' and disrespectful. I will use whatever someone requests, but I hope young people asking for 'they' are patient with older people like me who aren't used to using it / hearing it this way."
"thank you for taking the time to explain patiently all of this"
"I'm glad that ContraPoints and I have 27:44 in common"
"Ugh the Futch scale is so annoying. Butch and femme are hard identities/roles, it's not a scale."
"Dude, you need many years of therapy"
"There‚Äôs also the fact that chromosomes don‚Äôt necessarily cause biological sex. I have swyer syndrome, which means I have xy chromosomes, but due to a mutation on the sex-determining portion on my SRY gene (y chromosome), I was born female. I have female genitalia so when I popped out, the doctor said ‚Äòit‚Äôs a girl‚Äô and I have lived and been treated as a girl my whole life. I didn‚Äôt even know I wasn‚Äôt an XX female until I was 15, when my period didn‚Äôt start and I went to the doctors only to find out in the place of ovaries I have nonfunctional, internal testicles. It would be objectively false to call me male, or a man, or he- despite me having a ‚Äòmale karyotype‚Äô."
"I get offended whenever someone refers to Contrapoints as a woman. The correct term is Goddess"
"God this rat boy's voice makes me want to jump off a cliff 'FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS' *shoves my face into a wall*"
"He/she is fine but when you ask me to use made up pronouns like xie xir zieh ill tell you to go fuck yourself."
"Shapiro refers to trans-women he is cordial with as she. You make him out to be completely clueless in this video as if he was about to have a major breakthrough over social language. He deadnames trans-women he doesn't like intentionally because he enjoys being callous - which is different than being clueless. He has to pretend it's not over enjoyment of callousness though to save face which is where he will make clueless sounding arguments to mask his behavior. He's not actually clueless is the point... I'm sure we've all indulged in inappropriate things which is all you really have him on. Just not the type of inappropriate thing you are desensitized to.     @ 5:57 Also, to say 'we all agree on the biology' is just not true. Here's one of many articles of feminists pretending biological gender isn't set at birth. https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/02/trans-women-not-biologically-male/. This is primarily what Shapiro argues against when he isn't busy being unnecessarily inconsiderate to transitioners and non-passers. It's an easy argument for Shapiro to win because it's correct. This has little to do with language and everything to do with biological classification so you missed the point in your argument."
"I'm conservative and I'm subscribing to you because you, are amazing.   (Also I'm gay and trans but that's another thing)"
"Why does a transgender woman need a tampon? Googling gives me irrelevant or resentful answers."
"Shapiro really doesn't have a clear understanding of biology and he constantly contradicts himself. In a perfect world, people will stop listening to him altogether. Until then, only Natalie can save us."
"Can I eat the last hat"
"Ben Shapiro destroyed my virgin asshole."
"I thank God for you my dear ‚ù§"
"I‚Äôm sorry, but all I can think about is wanting to eat the shit on your head. It looks too much like candy and I‚Äôm fat"
"I respresent a person who deals in XX, XY and YY Chromosomes. If you criticise my view then you are intolerant and a bigot!!"
"I told you in an earlier video that I have an issue with some aspects of the discussion around people like Germaine Greer, but if it matters in any way ('which I realize it does not); even as a cis woman that does not fully stand behind you on the current 'terf' debate,  you are definitely a woman to me and so are other transgender women that I see around. 100 % agree on the female energy comment, this is not merely a thing about passing or not passing as a woman."
"does anyone not like Joe Rogan? because i really like Joe Rogan."
"I'm sorry but everyone i hear or read the name Ben Shapiro i automatically think of Robbie Shapiro from Victorious"
"As a nb my pronouns are thou/thee/them. When addressing me thou shalt speaketh in the informal case."
"always fun to see binary trans people respect non binary trans people even if i'm 8 months late to appreciating this video - a trash bastard enby"
"Shitgibbon is my new favorite insult."
"25:00"
"29:33 Ah, yes, the one non-patriarchal language."
"Calling Ben Shapiro a man would be a lie. I feel it would be more appropriate to refer to one of such stature, a *ahem* little bitch boy."
"‚ÄòHow do I explain to my child-!‚Äô ‚ÄòKILL YOUR SHITTY CHILD FOR ALL I CARE! That‚Äôs simply not my problem.‚Äô Lol!! Usually kids never even give a fuck about this sort of thing, ironically."
"You were a baby at birth so I refuse to see you as an adult BeNjAmIn. Also how does someone misgender Natalie like I'm a cis girl and I've never looked that feminine in my life."
"Also it absolutely is not the case that 'chromosomes = biological sex' as a human's sex is made up of five different factors (many of which can be changed thus making biological sex not as set in stone as Benny apparently would want it to be.)"
"I‚Äôm back again watching the first contrapoints I ever watched for the third time."
"To be totally fair, adoptive parents don't actually play the exact same role as biological parents, as their children will always have the fact that their adopted in their subconscious and does cause a few problems to their mental health, overall, though,  functionally, they're the same. (Please tell me if I got any of that wrong, I'm basing myself on what my mother told me [she's a PHD in psychology] and was too lazy to do research)."
"nice Tales from the Darkside references!"
"love the baphomet pose at the beginning"
"U look so beautiful üíú"
"Binge watching"
"Ben sounds like an idiot in that Blaire White clip."
"Those nails need a trigger warning."
"A good analogy for being trans if using Tomato sauce and Tomato soup. Tomato soup is Tomato sauce, but you add milk and butter after simmering it."
"‚ÄúThe facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù says the Orthodox Jew... I don‚Äôt mind religious people; I‚Äôm just saying, that‚Äôs some hypocritical bullshit. Like, the facts don‚Äôt support the Torah."
"the intro music nearly gave me a panic attack oh mah godddd"
"19:17 I‚Äôm trying to make nuanced decisions and not jump to conclusions on things, and with that said I agree with basically everything you say in this video  But I think the bill C-16 thing is a little too short to really handle the situation. My perspective is‚ÄîJP definitely tends to drive things down to a very symbolic level and make misjudgments because of that. Also, bill C 16 hasn‚Äôt and probably never will have any casualties.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean it should be law! If someone made a law saying you should be imprisoned for putting your foot on their lawn, even if no one ever suffered for it, it doesn‚Äôt mean the law is right.  And this *is* different, and there *may* be laws that insinuate something similar, and JP *is* betraying bias by caring more about this than other, similar legal decisions. I acknowledge those things and I‚Äôm not bringing this up as a call to action.  I‚Äôm just saying it because I love your videos and that 10 seconds out of ~1920 rubbed me wrong, and I don‚Äôt like leaving that stuff behind because I have no life. Please ignore me. Thank you for your videos üôÇ  Ugh I need to add to this that I‚Äôm really grateful that you take pains in seeing multiple sides to issues (even when I agree with neither) and I hate being another voice of dissent. Like, you draw twice as many detractors by appealing to multiple perspectives. I just made my comment to satisfy my own dissonance, really it isn‚Äôt meant to detract from you at all"
"English has been fucked for the past 200 years. I don't see how it can be difficult for people to adapt to singular they"
"My friend sent me this video after I discovered that I was cisgender because nobody ever told me what to call myself so I was excited that I had a label but I understand more having watch this and I have one thing to say I fucking love you"
"Quoting laura jane grace makes things better"
"Okay girl but you should really consider debating  Blaire again"
"How long will these random philosophy/commentary channels keep milking Shapiro or Peterson . They're old memes , no one cares."
"Can't believe how jobless someone would be to watch a 30 min video about pronouns or whatever , which most people including most Democrats don't care about . Ben Shapiro was only a good meme and obviously he is not correct about everything. I'm only saying this coz I wasted a lot of  time in these pseudo intellectual arguments no one in real life really cares about , so stop wasting your time and do something productive"
"Ben Shapiro DESTROYS the finish on this hardwood floor by just pissing all over it during a 'debate.'"
"Ben Shapiro will call a trans-woman a she, as long as he does not know she is trans. People don't look at someone's genitalia or chromosomes first and *then* decide on which pronoun to use. Obviously looking the part determines that. Pre-transition means, someone want to look the part but doesn't do yet, so it's just civil to call someone she at even this point"
"'you'll never be nothing but a glorified kidnapper' made my day"
"I just wanted to say thank you, you frame your debate in a very organized and concise way that as captain of my debate team is a perfect debate in a sense that it is understandable for most people and gives enough evidence to show that you have facts behind your opinion and the use of the actual video words not taken our of context from Ben Shapiro is also very nice. Just overall thank you for being civil yet still getting your point across in a way that isn't brash and not thought out."
"the way you said ‚Äúgod damn it‚Äù at 19:50 ish.... üòçüòçüòçüòç"
"I stan/d so hard for uuuuuuuu"
"My culture raises kids as gender neutral, with gender neutral pronouns until the kid decides what they want to identify as and such, and that's been working our great so far. Have fun with whatever it is you guys are trying out tho"
"I smiled at the end part, that was really great"
"Whenever I'm sad I just think about how angry my very existence would make the Angry Goblin Boy and I can't help but smile"
"Facts don't care about your feelings, but people aren't facts and should have a bit more fucking civility"
"*e  v  a  n  g  e  l  i  c  a  l    t  r  a  n  s  e  x  u  a  l*"
"Ben shapiro doesn‚Äôt speak ‚Äúfacts‚Äù, he just won‚Äôt let anyone finish and those who say he does are 13 year old edgy boys who have offensive meme accounts"
"I just wanted to say that the effort and trouble you went through to make the two seconds of footage from 17:22 has not gone unappreciated."
"But why you kinda look like Jenna marbles in that opening üòÇüòÇ"
"I love how Ben says he wants to have civil and respectful discussions but completely disrespects these people by not respecting their identities. It makes it nearly impossible to take him seriously. He is acting so childish by doing these things. Ignoring pronouns is something kids at my school do. He is acting like a fucking high schooler thinking that he is 'destroying' the liberals. It's kinda pathetic."
"That Ben Shapiro bit highlights an important point about civility vs violence as a means of convincing people Blaire White talked to Ben very comely for an hour and it went nowhere Zoey threatened him once and he never called her 'sir' again of course we all want to live in a civil society but I think the old Theodore Roosevelt quote 'speak softly but carry a big stick' has a lot to teach us on how to get there"
"12:25 .....that was hot."
"‚ÄúKill your shitty child‚Äù I fucking died"
"Thank you for this Natalie. I'm non-binary and I like this video. Your videos are very informative and smart. Love you <3 Sorry if I misspelled your name!"
"whoever did the futch scale for the weapons fucked it all up"
"Well, I feel like I should have been born a woman. I wish I could get pregnant. The fact that I can't makes me feel like the world robbed me and really fucks me up. HOWEVER, transitioning can't get me that, so I see no point in doing so. I also would be way too butch, shaving my hair off is a favorite past time when I get too bored. So transitioning to not present in a way that wouldn't confuse people and not getting the thing that fucks me up the most 'fixed' just seems like too much fucking work. I don't want to deal with that.  I HATE being referred to as a man/male. But I also don't want to be referred to as a woman because I don't feel like I fit the part. (I know how you present and such isn't what makes you your gender, but it's just SO MUCH WORK TO EXPLAIN IT TO PEOPLE.) So that doesn't make me feel comfortable either. So I settled into the middle and just describe myself as nonbinary."
"'I'll call Katlyn Jenner Katlyn Jenner but I won't call Katlyn Jenner a she.'  so... you're okay with calling someone you consider to still be a man a female name they weren't assigned at birth.. but different pronouns are just a big fat nope?? you know you can legally change your gender marker on official documents such as licenses, prescriptions, etc, the same way you can legally change your name right?"
"'mm. i was a yum yum, though.'"
"Am sorry I don't fully understand any of this. How about I just treat you as a human being. you know with kindness and respect."
"just to point out Ben did say youre not a woman to Blaire."
"How am I only just watching your videos?! You‚Äôre so funny"
"I honestly think Ben got rejected by a transwoman and lost his mind"
"What about intersex people like me with both chromosomes tho"
"in my native language i would call a book 'a she', a table 'a he', a chair 'an it' etc. could ben shapiro explain how to check my computer's karyotype to be sure it is indeed a he??"
"God I disagree with you... But God do I respect you"
"Your eyelashes are intimidating me"
"'You become a woman when an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant and says 'maybe you should order the salad sweetie'.' perf"
"I LOVE THIS CONTENT"
"How dare you slander our lord an saviout Ben 'The Libtard Destroyer' Shapiro!!!?! He has done nothing wrong, he only spreads the truth by destroying Libtards all over the globe. Burn in hell you evil witch!!"
"So if I have to get a hysterectomy( hit the jackpot with brca1 and brca2) and lose my tits do I lose my 'she' privilege?  Eventually i will have no boobs, and no uterus so... what will I be? Just an empty vagina collecting cobwebs? Is that a gender?   Maybe instead of a pronoun people could just try to think of the color violet before taking to me. That way I'll know. Know what?  I dunno.  There's a half hour of help above this. Scroll back up!"
"If you haven‚Äôt already, can you talk about abusive parents for trans kids and adults? I have very narrow minded parents and I would like your pov on it. And if it exists can someone direct me to it??"
"Natalie's charm and flawless reasoning is just enough to allow me to put up with the nails-on-a-chalkboard screeching that is Ben Shapiro's nasal little troll voice."
"I hate leaving multiple comments but I didn‚Äôt see another one like this-  I‚Äôm torn on your scale of ‚Äúwind instruments‚Äù on one hand I am very offended you put a bunch of brass instruments next to woodwinds ; On the other, I completely agree with the scale itself given where brass is.   Maybe that was the whole point and I‚Äôm just high üòú"
"One of my ex friends who I originally came out as trans to started watching a lot of Benny and started bashing trans people to me and it had to be the most uncomfortable thing a friend Alba‚Äôs ever done to me.    Honestly, Ben is such a dipshit and has no idea how to make a legit case for anything."
"26:02 that gave me an LSD flashback."
"I love your dialog."
"Ben Shapiro's views on Trans people aren't even supported by Orthodox Judaism (a religion he claims to be), A friend of mine looked up the old texts on it, because Ben Shapiros remarks just sounded very un Jewish to me.....you can't ever be trans according to Torah? How? You can kill according to Torah, you can eat Pork, there's literally a reason to break nearly all Torah's law sometimes...yet somehow being Trans is universally against G-ds laws? That's just unbelievable. So the friend looking it up said that the official ancient ruling is 'what you see is what you get' meaning if you've had re-assignment surgery, you are inarguable the newly assigned gender according to Torah. His views on abortion and immigration are also completely against Torah values....I'm not saying that this invalidates him calling himself an Orthodox Jew, but it does mean that he really needs to reconcile what he says with what he claims to believe. It's true that facts don't care about feelings, and the fact is that Abortion is ok according to the Torah, there is room for Trans people in Torah following society, and being 'tough' on immigration is super against Torah."
"that's why I absolutely despise the whole 'Destroyed' and 'Obliterated' trend that we're seeing in headlines, whether from conservative or liberal or middle of the road writers/outlets. No one was destroyed. No one was torn asunder. No one's career was shot up in flames. It's not that one particularly *wants* to see careers being ripped apart like toast is ripped apart by my teeth, or that it should be easy to destroy someone. rather it makes me roll my eyes, and pushes me away from the entire conversation from all points of view. It feels like yellow journalism because it is,whether or not I hate or love the person being 'totally owned, dude'"

"amen"
"3:38 you're still a yum yum. I would say no homo but that would involve me giving a fuck about what other people think about my sexuality. Attractive is attractive and I refuse to let my sexuality define me as weaker or stronger than anyone else.  Ain't nobody who has a job and hobbies has time for that."

"i love u candy mommy"
"if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck  it's a duck  unless it's a minecraft chicken"
"Really agree that it's not necessarily about how you look. I had a student who looked male but presented very female in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. He did sometimes wear make-up and nail polish, and always hung with the girls, but even without that, still came across as feminine, or at least nonbinary (his English name was Berry, which seemed too on point to be a coincidence). But I'm in China, where anything outside traditional gender roles is barely even discussed, and it would have been unprofessional of me to make inquiries. The student used male pronouns (though pronouns in spoken Chinese are gender neutral, so he may just not have cared), and seemed happy enough, but it was a learning experience for me that feminity does not necessarily have to do with looks."
"Ben shapiro is making money off of his stance so he has to keep his character even if he fucks a trans person every day"
"trans mom says i'm valid so everyone can fuck right off about my pronouns"
"u r very cool"
"Fascinating video, very collected, eloquently spoken and entertaining. An interesting aside on the Korean language: The Korean language doesn't rely on pronouns at all though there are exceptions to this rule, Gender is usually assumed in conversation. There are some titles, jobs and gender-specific roles however there are work arounds to all of those with exception to some familiar terms to my knowledge. They will say 'Ïù¥/Í∑∏ ÏÇ¨Îûå' which means this/that person often :) random tidbit!"
"Girl, this eye make-up makes you look like you're Violet Chachki sister. Love it."
"from one bisexual transsexual drag queen to another, I need this sour rainbow stripes candy foam fantasy party hat   for reasons"
"I've struggled a lot with gender identity for a long time, and I've reached a place of not caring how society views me. I will be as I am with or without the approval of those around. I'll wear the dresses I love wearing, the tastful suit jackets, the stiletto heels that I'll regret in a few hours, or the biker boots that i could stomp a mudhole into a bigot with, and I'll answer to any pronoun but it, it will piss me off faster than anything else in the world."
"as a non binary person, i just wanna hangout out with my friends and talk about random things i like with out it making people question how masculine or feminine i am. i may not be able to pass due to me faking my existence to my family, but atleast cut me some slack with my actions.   im not gonna sit here and do some very much seen as feminine things and expect y'all to not be confused, but i should be allowed to call stuff cute. BECAUSE IT IS. im just spitting fact. you show me a corgi i'm gonna be all over that.   and my emotional instability is not from being non binary. it's because i am suffering and want to die inside. and me getting therapy is less realistic than santa coming into my room and slapping me with a fish.  moments that make me feel good is talking with random strangers online and them not immediately assuming what i am because idek myself. currently im a human child with no clue on what is happening and i rather not have a full breakdown from anxiety and stress thank ya very much.  i can't even go with constant typos and i manage to still wear shirts inside out. stop expecting me to have all this crap together."

"Is it weird that I love Ben Shapiro AND you?! I love this look on you btw, Gorgeous!!!!    I am in the middle of viewpoint about gender labels/pronouns : I think people deserve the freedom to call themselves what they want but I don't think it's right to pass a law in which a person can be sued for using the wrong pronoun, particularly unknowingly so. The attempts of Micro managing scares me.     I love Blaire too.  I know some MTF trans that want to be called her & some that don't & same with FTM. I call them by the pronoun they prefer & it doesn't hurt me any, if I can't decipher (say androgynous people) then I avoid using pronouns to my best abilitt which can be tricky & frustrating, in that I don't want to unintentionally offend, and if someone has a very clear male image than I say male pronouns & vice versa."
"i dont watch most of blairs debates after what happened with onision but the adoptive parent comparison is surprisingly fitting. while a trans woman cannot give birth, she still functions as a woman.

"The adoptive parent analogy actually goes a lot further. The difference between calling someone a parent, or an adoptive parent is closer to calling someone a woman, or a trans woman. If you apply Bens logic to the medical scenario to the extent he applies it to trans people then in a doctors meeting the medics should refuse to accept the adoptive parent has any association what so ever with the child and call them unrelated individual or something instead. Which would be just dumb, as well as being confusing and upsetting for everyone involved. I wander how many adoptive parents would be complaining and campaigning to be referred to by their parental status in medical settings if this was the case. And I assume Benny would just sit there and smugly proclaim 'Well biologically you're not actually parents. Facts don't care about your feelings.'"
"If you identify as trans but still live as a man, your womanhood remains hypothetical, it stops being hypothetical when you start to live as a woman, not just when you pass as one.   How are you able to hold this thought along with accepting existence of non-binary/genderfluid people and not having your brain melt from the steaming pile of cognitive dissonance it creates? What are the roles in our society for non-binary/genderfluid people since every role we have is based on evolution and biology which, as we all know, scream binary?"

So I'm going to explain myself without using words like 'identity' and all that. I'm genderfluid, which means my gender can shift and change, and I try to match it with my presentation. To put it simply: sometimes I can wear a dress and have long hair and have everyone call me she, and sometimes it makes me want to shrink into a hole and die. I don't usually have a clear sense of anything until I try things out - my gender is essentially whatever presentation and pronouns make me feel the least like shit. I do experience dysphoria, but it's irregular, and I can do nothing about it because I'm inconsistent. I'm open to questions, but please be decent. I hope I can help."
"what plane of reality did you film this video in?"
"honestly the solution to all of this: be nice"
"Basically, the whole video you subjectively criticize objectivity and suggest that those who drive their actions by objectivity are wrong and not being 'useful' to achieve a 'greater good', I suppose? From my point of view, you simply reinforced the importance of having terms as 'biological gender/pronuons', to separate the truths of the hard sciences (which are independent of any context) from the everyday stupidity of the interactions of social life."

"This still makes my dick hard"
"You're never going to convince me that a trans woman is an actual woman, because he's not; however,  I will use whatever pronoun that person prefers to be called, just as much as I would use whatever name they want to be called.

My friends feel beaten up for being not adressed correctly by friends, but even mor by strangers, but some people don't have the chance to know on the spot. What i meant is... I want to have more tolerance for this topic, on both sides. Feeling beat up because of a false pronoun might be hard, but some people can not know. The world should be more relaxed. This show is awesome! :) P.S. i find this educating and this starts me to think about this topic more than before. And this presentation is very funny. xD Awesome! Lovely Greetings."

"I was ok until minute 20 or so. You say that what identifies you as a woman is the fact that you live, relationate with people as a woman, and that until then, your womanhood is hypotetical (maybe I erred here). Then you make a joke about a female older relative saying to you 'maybe you should order the salad'. But then, you are defined as a woman by your experiencies? I am a cis woman, I don't know if I make relations in a different fashion than men (I'd like to know how we explicit those differences), and even if I do, I'd like to think that men and women aren't categorized in genders according to the things they do or don't do.

It‚Äôs usually a sign that one side is deliberately stalling because there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt an actual argument beyond definitions."
"If I‚Äôm being honest, your main argument is a huge red herring. The right is arguing that they won‚Äôt call you a she because your biological sex fails to hold that fact. You‚Äôre claiming that language is more important than biology in this regard but that‚Äôs not what the right is arguing. You‚Äôre missing the point of bens argument entirely and just saying it‚Äôs invalidated because people have been called he and she since before chromosomes were discovered."

I'm afraid to one day misgender a trans/non-binary person in that way and hurt them. I wish that more speakers of gendered languages would realize how contextual and historically contingent their languages are and stop misgendering people just to hurt them while pretending to save our biological fate or whatever the fuck they say they are doing... By Ben Shapiro's standards, everyone in Turkey must be agender. Or perhaps not even a person, since we also do not have a separate 'it'."
"The busboy is sad now."
"People refer to you as 'she,' 'lady,' 'ma'am,' etc because you dress like a woman and wear makeup. It has nothing to do with language haha.

"Well, once you have to enter a hospital or emergency room for whatever reason -- i.e. it's about your health, even your life -- you'd be thankful for these people knowing your *biological gender* in order to *save your life!* No 'she' nor 'xer' will save you when you're a biological male ('he') that dictates the treatment/procedures necessary. You cannot fight biology, and when you do (which is what you do) you will lose sooner or later. Ultimately biology will exclude you from the genepool one way or another. No Ben Shapiro necessary."

"I feel so bad for trans women, because, in part, I get it, but there's also so much more. I'm a trans guy so I get the dysphoria struggle and all that but the way society demonizes typically feminine behavior in men puts so much stress on trans women. I was fine to dress like a boy as a kid, I was a 'tomboy,' I liked trucks, cars, littlest pet shops, and polly pocket. It was ok for me to want to be masculine; but as soon as a little boy decides he wants to play with dolls or wear a dress it's instantly fought and denied because, in this society, *being feminine is seen as being inferior.* Wanting to be masc is ok though! Obviously being a man is desirable because men are better!1!! Why would you eVeR want to be a wOmAN???? And also there's the fact that trans women are statistically way more likely to be attacked or killed. ESPECIALLY trans women of color. If you google 'trans women' right now on June 11 2019 the first result is about the murders of 3 black trans women in Dallas. For 'trans men' it's a page about sexual health, then a Huff Post article about reproductive rights concerning trans men, a wikipedia page, and then a news story about a guy charged with the murder of a gay man and a trans women because google pinged 'trans' and 'man' in the same headline. There's also the fact that when there is a politically charged discussion about trans people it's ALMOST ALWAYS about trans *women.*   There's plenty more I have to say on this subject but I'll leave it at this so as to not end up tying a full length essay."

As you can tell, there is a but coming. I don't disagree that s/he does have a social function.  And I respect that. When I was a kid, I was transgender in the sense that I questioned gender and sex. I asked multiple people how you were supposed to know if one was male or female. My first crush was transfemale. That made me question my sexuality. Was I lesbian? Was I a gay man in a woman's body? Or was I only attracted to my crush because her physical body was one I desired? I had no answers at 14. Because this was a complex moment, I decided to wait. At the age of thirty, I met up with my crush again. At that time, I realized I wasn't trans- not in her sense. I had no dysphoria. But I still questioned sex and gender. I know the definitions and how they are separated. Sex is the physical aspect and gender is how you feel inside. I still didn't feel anything. So, I called myself an androgyne. But I was wrong about. I am a woman because of my physical sex and because I don't have dysphoria. What I don't have a gender as it's understood because who I am as a person is found in my personality. My personality contains both masculine (aggressive) and feminine (passive) traits. And which one is more prevalent doesn't change the fact that I am a woman."

But the thing is, if i meet a non-binary person who looks perfectly feminine and makes no indication that they're not a cis woman, i'm not trying to actively misgender them when i call them 'she'. I just, make an assumption. You are all well within your rights to tell people like Shapiro who willingly, continously misgender you to go fuck themselves. More than that, i encourage it!

And my biology is certainly none of his business so what BS is concerned the pronouns used for me would refer to my social role 100% of the time."
"'Shitgibbon' is an amazing insult, and I totally want to incorporate it (when deserved, of course) into my everyday speech.  Also, as a straight cis woman tomboy, I of course wonder where actual lesbians would place me on the Futch Scale at first glance.  Because internet test thingies are ALWAYS fun, even when they don't apply to you!  :P    EDIT:  Okay, after watching the actual examples of the Futch Scale, I realised that I'm...probably Butchy Femme if we're going by Steven Universe characters (and why wouldn't you?) because I'm pretty sure my closest appearance/style match is Amethyst.  Heck, not only do we have similar body types and hairstyles...I considered freaking dressing as her last Halloween!  (Then I got sick and didn't have the energy for something that elaborate.)  Also, 'LITERAL Stone Butch'  LOVE IT!  XD  But, things get a bit more muddied when we go on into the other subjects being measured on the scale, because my sword is probably closest to the butch one shown here (iIt's a 3-foot bastard sword!)  but the wind instrument I play is very femme leaning into high femme.  (And what about other instruments, hmmm?  Where does my synthesizer fit into this?)  So the end result is...  ...I'm me, everyone is themselves, nobody is JUST one category on anything and shut the fuck up.  :D  Also...use whatever pronouns a person tells you to use for them--at least, once they tell you.  Misgendering by legit accident happens and does not make you a monster, but once you KNOW that a boy-ish looking person wants to be called 'she'...just go ahead and call her 'she' already, you shitgibbon!"

I mean: Within the temporal context of this old video Miss Wynn DID identify as a man, and it would be a misgendering to call this bygone version of her personality 'her'. - Time is weird!   O__O"

Your humor is wonderful, you catch me by surprise all the time and make me bust up laughing. Never lose your cynicism, it's a wonderful part of you.  That said, please be kind to yourself, you deserve to feel happy, and haters be damned, you're fabulous.  I'm a cis dude and I can't pretend to understand what life is like for you, but you do manage to make your struggles relatable, and its clear that you're intelligent and thoughtful and you work hard. Through all that you also manage to address really complicated subjects in kind and reasonable ways. Your content is personable, and top notch.  Keep up the great work and I hope you can have a happy life ahead of you. Peace."

"I wish I could watch this. But even a snippet of conservative bs propagators like Ben Shapiro trigger me to high heaven."
"Ben Shapiro's argument is stupid. Do you normally address people by cultural standards or biological ones? I'm not going to outline my entire genetic code when I first meet you. Culture and society determines our social interactions on the day to day. If a trans woman goes to the hospital then they should mention that they were born biologically male in case the doctor has to check for prostate cancer or something, but outside of that context why would your biology matter more than culture?"

"3:36 well damn lol u were yum yum. Ur gorgeous now too sis but that bod was yum yum"
"The only two problems with this are that  1. Ben gets tripped up on pronouns and accidentally says ‚Äúshe‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt actually disrespect trans people when he meets them by forcibly not using their pronouns. Just if he‚Äôs involved in a larger discussion of the topic he doesn‚Äôt use what he sees as incorrect pronouns because he would be undermining his own point. He‚Äôs stated this many times.  2. Bill C16 wasn‚Äôt a false alarm. You don‚Äôt get jailed for the offense directly, but you can be once you refuse to pay the fine, which nobody would willingly do. That doesn‚Äôt mean a law compelling speech isn‚Äôt very obviously a bad precedent. More importantly it‚Äôs ineffective, why would you think making it illegal to misgender will make others more accepting of trans people? Peterson doesn‚Äôt give a damn in any direction about pronouns he just doesn‚Äôt think compelling speech is a good idea, often times these laws are precedent for more laws to be passed along similar ideological bends. Very stupid point on many levels but otherwise good video."
"He becomes she and she becomes he and those in the middle are they. Well that is binary as all get out."
"JOHN MACLEAN MY KING MY GOD MY LOVE"
"My viewpoint is simple.  You do not own pronouns.  The pronouns say less about the person being spoken of and more about the person speaking.  If I say he it means I perceive the person as as a male."
"You just gained yourself a new follower"
"I want to taste the candy hair."
"I think people generally need to chill out about pronouns. Your first guess is usually right with most people. To avoid being an ass, use the pronoun you can deduce the person probably prefers (that is, even if a trans person is 'clockable' you can still usually tell how they try to present, so just use the pronoun you think they'd want). 99% of the time you'll likely get it right. And if you don't, if you make an honest mistake and the person corrects you, just apologize, change your language and move on. It really doesn't have to be a big deal."
"Can we talk about how absolutely stunning and gorgeous John MacLean is though? *sigh*  PS I'm so glad I found this channel. It's lovely to see someone liberal expressing their opinion in such a logical, beautiful way. It makes me sad when the so called 'SJWs' express themselves erratically and emotionally because as valid as they are in their opinion, few people take them seriously. Also, I identify as trash too, so I connect with Miss Points on a spiritual level.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"The intro is sooo meta and so genius. It's a perfect parody of the conservative straw man for liberals and trans people. Completely takes the wind out of their sails by dissecting that straw man and exposing it as a phony worldview."
"You‚Äôve eloquated so well this sense of vague confusion I‚Äôve had around trans and non binary people. I feel like I‚Äôm equipped with the intellectual tools to actually start having nuanced and meaningful conversations about this. Also, that blooper was so cute -‚Äúcan‚Äôt you see by what I‚Äôm wearing, the traditional female garb of my culture!‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ more bloopers please.  Your content is awesome. üíó"
"'You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you in a restaurant and says 'Maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.' I guffawed. If that is not proof positive that a newly-transitioning person is going through a very real second puberty, I don't know what is."
"People can use whatever definition they prefer to use and they would be right (according to their definition). You don‚Äôt have to agree with every definition. It‚Äôs words, they have subjective and not intrinsic meaning."
"I learn a lot from watching your videos. I must say though that I always find myself having to go back a few seconds throughout the video because I lose focus when you smile because your smile is so beautiful and I love you!"
"I would swim through a lake full of water to make Ben Shapiro watch this video."
"I will never see a transexual as the sex they made the cosmetic changes to make themselves look like (unless they actually pass and I didn¬¥t notice they were transexual)  but I agree 'he' and 'she' as requested is simple ettiquette. I don¬¥t just 'tolerate' you, I accept you and I really appreciate your vids.  I just disagree on your sex.  I am certainly happy you can identify and express yourself in all the manners you wish to do so as you do."

"One thing that always baffles me about criticism of the singular they is how it blatantly ignores the fact that 'you' is both singular and plural, and poses no issue whatsoever."
"Strong feelings of admiration and affection for you and your channel's content. I appreciate you so much. Thanks for getting me through this Friday"
"What I want to ask Ben Shapiro is, is it a lie what you call Lady Liberty a lady because she doesn't have the right chromosomes? Or when you call a car or a ship a she? No where in the definition of the word she does it say anything about chromosomes; ONE of the definitions is that it is used to refer to a creature of female sex, but that's just one of several definitions."
"I got a question which is prob gonna be pretty little brained of me but hey, I'm already stepping out of my comfort zone so here we go. You mention that you hope people will address others by their preferred gender which I agree with. If you wish to be called 'they' then I will call you just that. But you also say that it is important that a trans person seem like the gender that they identify with. I don't know why but that statement is messing me up. I feel that it in a way contradicts other statements, such as referring to someone as their preferred pronoun. It seems like there are two objectives, identifying your gender and seeming your gender, which often do align quite nicely, but don't always. John Maclean as you showed in your video in my opinion is an example of this conflict. He 'seems' to be a woman based on appearance but identifies as a man. I agree that defaulting to how he wishes to be identified is the best go to option, but why bother with the 'seem'? I sympathize with the idea of wanting others to see a trans woman they see any other woman, but defaulting to just their preferred identity feels like it would be lying to them. If a trans woman does not 'seem' to be a woman, is it a disservice to refer to them as she? I clearly do not see them as a woman because they don't seem like a woman. Like yeah ok sure. Be polite. That is what I will do. But is it the best thing to do? By calling someone a woman because they identify as a woman, are we not therefore claiming they 'seem' like a woman too? If they do not seem like a woman, is that not lying? Is that detrimental in some way? I don't care what they seem to be, as long as I know how they identify. But I got a gut feeling that they care how they identify and I feel they deserve to know if they are truly being treated as a woman because they seem as such or if they are only be treated as a man identifying as a woman. If I were to hang out with John Maclean with my cis guy friends, then I would try to treat him equally. But that is the problem is I would be trying. I'm not trying to make this look like I'm the victim here cause obviously I am not. But it feels inherently unequal which I think is not the goal that John wants. He doesn't want me to just pretend he is a man, he would want me to feel he is a man, but I really don't know the fix to that other than bringing it back to identity. I really forgot where I was going with this cause I didn't know what words I needed to express my confusion. Maybe my long rant can give you an idea of why I feel confused cause I feel that way, but I am not sure why..."

"kill your shitty child"
"Considering the words boy & girl are fairly recent in historical terms. And the concept that girls like pink & boys like blue again a recent occorrance - up until the 1950s it was the opposite. Social norms & language are not written in stone but are in fact constantly changing  Can we all just stop trying to box ppl in, labelling them & allow for ambiguity. We each have the right to define ourselves & also allow that definition to change."
"Creating a third gender would be an acceptable compromise but this gets awfully complicated when there is so many different things no one can understand things. A big problem that guys like  Ben Shapiro have with all this is that this portrayal of feminine archetype is not accurate or flattering to women as he is accustomed. My problem with it is that in the first place you are attempting to decide what language I have to use and it contradicts my perceptions. And while you may appear feminine, you do not appear female. I don't mean any offense by what I'm telling you but if you are offended that's ok. I'll get over it, and I'm sure you will too. You are clearly a very strong person inside and you are a great performance artist and articulate speaker. But hit the nail on the head you are nothing like my mother, grandmother, sisters or any of my past or present girlfriends. In fact, if may say you are kind of mocking those women who place in high reguard. Now, I can accept you for being yourself and expressing an inner self outwardly but as of recently we have children in drag stripping in gay bars and trans people getting beaten up and murdered in the street. I do not find these things tolerable. And I do not think oh, that's a cute outfit on that trans child, I think oh that child looks exploited. And I do not think, oh they killed a transperson, I just think they killed a person. And you might think why would a person like me choose to comment here on your channel. I mean by all accounts I'm a cave man who can barely operate a computer and I'm more talented at turning a wrench than sending an email, but there is some real considerations on how people are going to get along in this world, you may not care about shitty children, but I certainly do. The family is important in the world today and let's face it some people are just assholes who don't want to share the world with eachother. But like you said, you are seeking converts just like any other religion. Frankly, what I see here is not a woman, what I see is a complex shaman with alot of wisdom and understanding. That may not be how you identify yourself however, I am pretty observant. All this pronoun stuff is just a big barrier to the real realization about ones self."
"When you call people sis you are being antagonist in the exact way you say you don't want to be antagonized."
"I know there are a lot of douche bags out there who refuse to use a persons preferred pronouns intentionally, and they're terrible humans (there are folks that are SUPER sensitive to honest pronoun mistakes when transitioning too but that's not the subject). BUT I don't think the government should be legislating that intentionally mis-gendering someone as a hate crime with punitive ramifications. In the same way that we don't penalize someone refusing to acknowledge the legitimate use of the word 'parent' for adopted parents this encroaches uncomfortably upon free speech which, despite what SOME governments will tell you, is an inalienable right every human being has.   Bottom line: Is intentionally mis-gendering someone a douche move? With out a doubt! Should you be legally fined or go to jail for it? Absolutely not."
"Help me, I have developed a potent parasocial bond with this Natalie Wynn person! Her filthy rhetorical flourishes and pro-garbage verbiage greatly resonates with me.  Natalie, you are the reason I landed in Enby territory. You are one of the loudest voices moving me left, and that means more than it might normally mean.  I possess a running undercurrent of bloodlust and disdain for other human life that both repulses and entrances me. It makes me sympathize with the violent or predatory, and I have a hard time reconciling this feeling with my more empathetic feelings. I suspect the berserk emotional cocktail I'm dealing with may have been present in others who were less. . . prepared to deal with them.  My life has contained a subplot of gathering resources to help me rationalize and defend against the bloodlust I feel, and this is where I get back to you.  Contrapoints is visually striking, trashy, and absolutely monstrous (in a literary sense) and I love these things about your YouTube channel.  Thank you for building a bridge into the darkness, when so many on the left won't bother to reach down into the pit.  I'm planning on building a little bathysphere here so I can give people directions toward you, but god fucking damn. . .  Thank you so much for your contributions to humanity. You are a true treasure beyond measure."
"you are just great"
"Loved the video! I guess I'll share my position if anyone is interested: I am a genderfluid that was born male, and I like male pronouns when I am presenting male, and female pronouns when I present female. I have always been a feminine guy, and I love presenting a a girl, and I love my femininity, no matter what anyone thinks (a lot of people assume I'm gay, I'm used to it and really don't mind, what's wrong with being gay?) <3 I am still discovering my gender-ness, I am attracted to women, but I am more attracted to personality than looks (although I am very open and think that so many different types of women look beautiful), I like very feminine girls (as a feminine guy/girl/genderfluid/whatever myself, it makes sense) and I find kindness and compassion very appealing in a woman. As I said, I am still discovering myself, and sometimes find myself really confused, but I am glad of who I am and I choose to just be ME! If anyone with gender issues or gender confusion is reading this, just be yourself and you will eventually discover who you are, don't listen to the haters that see trans/genderfluid/etc as mentally ill, or 'traps' or whatever, learn to not give a fuck about what random haters on the internet (or even in real life) say about you, love yourself for who YOU are! Also, to Contra, you are worried you don't look like a real woman, really? I think you look stunningly gorgeous <3 and I'm not honn-ing you, I genuinely think that you are beautiful! You say you need plastic surgery, but I think you are beautiful just the way you are, you DO look like a real woman, you are beyond passing <3 I wish I could be as beautiful as you. You are gorgeous and you should be proud of your femininity! <3"
"my one comment is, I am on the side of people not needing to completely present as the full stereotypical appearance of their gender. I am a cis woman, but I also dress and act more androgynously. I identify as a woman, prefer female pronouns, and usually people call me female because I got tiddies. But, I dont conform to the idea of a typical woman. i like wearing men's clothes, I have short hair, i never wear makeup, but I am still a woman. I want gender expression to be less rigid for cis and trans people. Butch trans women are still women, etc."

"You present an unsubstantiated false dichotomy on the correct way to use language; reducing language to prescriptive and descriptive grammar is a gross oversimplification.  Shapiro grounds his argument on language's purpose to communicate, that communication at its core should not be clouded by gratuitous lies mentally disordered people want others to believe. A trans woman is not a woman. A trans man is not a man. Trans people should keep being referred to by their biological gender until technology reaches a point where one can actually change sexes.    Yes actually, you do put an article before a pronoun if you are referring the the word itself in 'quotes', or in other words as a noun, dumb dumb.    Chromosomes being discovered after the words for the sexes were created doesn't invalidate Ben's argument to rely on them for determining sex. The date of discovery for chromosomes has no relation to its effectiveness as a determinant for sex.    What words other people choose to refer to you as does not restrict your freedoms whatsoever, these are the same rules everybody lives by. They might affect your personal ability to enjoy life, but that is entirely on you.     The definition should not be changed because 'gay people want x feeling', it should only be changed if there is logical reason to. In regards to the analogy made by Blair White, there is a difference between white lies used to preserve a child's mental stability vs gratuitous language forced upon the entire population to appease a select minority with mental disorders. I've known a few adopted children while growing up, some refer to their foster parents as 'mum' and 'dad', some more formally as 'mr. x' and 'ms. y', and I even have a friend that calls his foster parents by their first names. I'd say it's up to the family to decide how they want to do it. However, unlike lgbt, foster parents aren't trying to force people to refer to them as the mother and father of their adoptive offspring.    10 minutes in and I am disappoint. 5 minutes of unnecessary introductions and another 5 spent broadstroking criticisms that might actually have merit, had you taken the time to flesh them out before moving onto your next jab. Don't think I'll finish the video as I find it quite revolting from a purely visual standpoint.    Also, notice how only the left wants to mandate people refer to trans people by their preferred pronouns, where as the right will has never tried to mandate people to call trans by their biological sex. One side openly wants to control what you say, the other couldn't give a fuck, but will nevertheless die defending your and their right to say it."

"I wonder what you think about Lacan‚Äôs idea of female vs. male subjectivity. For anyone uninitiated, the basic argument as I understand it is that male subjectivity consists of dominating others in response to the crisis of being a lacking subject, while female subjectivity consists of banding together with others in the face of that crisis. And though he aligns each mode of subjectivity with biological sex, I don‚Äôt believe the argument is that all men are male subjects or that all women are female subjects. Further, being of one subjectivity doesn‚Äôt designate a permanent position to my understanding."

Now through the power of one-sided debate I believe, like you, that more than half the planet should be violently extrerminated.  This is of course a sarcastic joke about some ass hat screening at a camera about the degenerates who dare argue with him while demanding that they argue with him.  Shapiro also looked like he just got out of the shower and threw on a work shirt to look relatable instead of his regular blue/grew suit and optional tie."

"If you yourself claim to 'destroy' someone else by taking quotes out of context, you have done just the opposite. You have created a circle around your points and claim that everything outside of this circle is false or wrong.  You use different outfits, lighting, and make believe scenarios to enchant your followers into a delusion of self-righteous crusading. You are an entertainer who found an audience in those who could not let go of their cartoon-like fantasies, those who so easily latched onto the thing that would be seen as a rebellious phase. In hopes of being an individual, yet remains a part of a clique, all the same, never truly an individual with a unique thought in their mind other than the hive-mind.   Why does this matter? Why does what you do to get your audience matter?  Easy: Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and anyone you crusade against don't need these things. They could make their videos, audio and we would enjoy it all the same. We would listen because it is educational, with truth in it. Not fantasy.  The point is: They don't need visuals, they just need their voice of reason to gather their audience which is far (numerically) superior against yours. The numbers prove your close-minded ways are falling to common sense. Your delusional days are numbered, the fad is breaking, people are growing up and realizing this is just a game to you.

It's just... ugh, glorious. How much do you spend on make-up with each video? You look fantastic.  Anyway, yeah. I generally think I'm a cis woman although lately I've been unironically identifying as a genderfuck depressed trash monster that lives in the sewers and that's the tea on that, and honestly... fuck, life's too short and the world is too shitty to also care about other people's fucking pronouns or gender or whether they've got dicks or pussies, like whatever.  Also fuck Ben Shapiro and his incel (because I refuse to believe any woman would hit that ugly amass of cancer) ignorant ass, because biology doesn't work the way he says it does, which also shows he never bothered actually listening to biologists about biology and everything he's been spouting in those 'debates' are elementary school notions of biology that a man who's over 30 and demanding to be talking about biology should be over.

"Can we all agree that Ben Shapiro's a fucking idiot? I mean, he's a known climate change denier and that instantly makes him a moron in my book, so him also being a fucking bigot is just the icying on the shit-cake. I love it when people defend him cause he's Jewish. As if being part of a minority that has been in the past and continues to be to this day a target of bigotry, somehow makes him immune to having bigoted views himself, the same idiotic argument of...'black people can't be racist'. Well, at least since he's a Jew, he can't also deny Holocaust happened, like some other specimens of the alt-right fuckwit dogma claim...cough, cough, Jordan Peterson.  Derailing an argument from the actual topic that is argued to a logical fallacy has always been his method of 'winning debates' and 'destroying his opponents' in them. Like how when he's asked what does he have against two people who love each getting married, instead of arguing about that, he answers with another question: 'what do you have against a child having both a mother and father?' As if that has anything to do with anything... He effectively implies that gay people getting married deprives children of having parents, which is absolutely absurd. And he actually said this himself, he talked about this tactic as a theoretical concept and advised people to use it because it's valid and it win debates (even if it has no logical sense to anyone with half a brain and who isn't one of his idiot fans)."
"Not even the transphobes (who, let's face it, are mostly right-wingers) believe that gender is a binary thing. They have their own ridiculous criteria for how to determine how 'manly' someone is. They've decided all on their own that any man who is a leftist is less of a man than a right-winger is. If you can't bench-press as much weight as they can, then you're less of a man. Any man who has a job that doesn't involve manual labor is less of a man than one that does. 'Real' men keep their emotions bottled up (except for anger and rage). And is THAT shit based on any science? Fuck no, yet these self-proclaimed champions of science believe in it wholeheartedly anyway."
"If these people were so committed to reason and rationality and logic like they claim to be, they would immediately recognize the absurdity and superfluousness of us even having gendered pronouns in the first place (many other languages don't even have them). I mean, think about it: when you're talking about somebody, why should what's between their legs determine how you begin and/or end your sentences in that discussion?"

"Your reiterate time and time again how the person who has not even began transitioning but has identified as trans is 'fully trans' and a woman. I understand that this is a point you are making due to discourse in trans community. But don't you feel that talking at the same time about how gender emerges in social interaction and how at the same time you are fully your gender based on your identity (even using the term 'true gender') kinda looks like you are talking about two different concepts or social entities. In my native language there is only one word for both 'sex' and 'gender', so we needed to add additional descriptors to discriminate between 'biological sex' and 'cultural sex' [that is, gender]. Maybe English also needs to discern 'psychological gender' and 'social gender'? Or would that lead to more avenues of oppressing and discrediting trans people?"

"I have no problem understanding trans people and people who don't identify as being either male or female. I call people by the pronouns they want me to call them. The biological vs sociological definitions of gender I understand. But I've become aware of an extremely small minority on tumblr for whom gender is something which seems to have taken on a third or fourth dimension. Gender being used to describe what I think is personality, gender being used to describe an affinity with fictional characters or mythological animals. I really don't know what to think about someone who is 'faeriegender' and who wants to be called fee/fae/fim or whatever. This gender seems to transcend the biological vs sociological argument. I have no reason to NOT call someone by the pronouns they want me to call them by, but I can't help feeling a little weird in the more extreme cases. Anyone else have any thoughts on the matter?"
"This has all gotten so ridiculous. Sex is an observable characteristic which usually coincides with gender roles because of how society has developed to maximize the utility of the two sexes.  Only recently have people tried to claim a gender opposite of their sex in any significant number.    When people say he or she, they are referring to their subconscious grouping of people based on their physical characteristics first and foremost.  That is why people feel weird when seeing a masculine person wearing a dress.  They intuitively understand that the person has an XY chromosome pair, but their presentation does not match what they are used to seeing.  It is also why there is far less controversy or internal conflict with transwomen that pass well, people are able to sustain the idea that the person carries the primary characteristics which define femininity.    We need to be honest about how language has evolved.  Gender roles have changed over time, but primarily masculine and feminine pronouns have referred to the physical characteristics which denote XX or XY chromosomes.  The gender expression just validates the basic utility of these words.    I get it, we live in a society which now allows you to freely choose your gender expression.  But that does not mean you can decouple pronouns from their primary function as they have evolved in our language.  People have to actively try and use pronouns which subvert their original meaning as they were initially understood, and that is fine.  But let's be honest, these pronouns were always about physical characteristics which made it clear if a person was a biological male or female.    The problem is that trans people often base their identity on their gender expression and lend it far more importance than is normal in our society.  They need to understand how these words evolved in the first place, it has always been about discerning between the two sexes, therefore they should not be offended if people use pronouns which match their estimation of their sex.  Sure, ask them to use different pronouns, but understand you are asking them to redefine the basic structure of language they have understood since they were infants, so some people might object to that.  If you can't handle that, then you are far too sensitive and unable to deal with the reality of how language has evolved over time."
"Thank you Natalie for all your work and these counter arguments. I have had the same thoughts about this argument and it's all about language not biology. Since my egg have been cracked lately and discovering that my gender doesn't fully alien with my sex, transition has been on my mind since. Searching and trying to find arguments made against trans women have been consuming my for the last 4 month. I don't know if transition is the right step for me but if it is. Know full well that your work have made it easier for me to navigate this journey. Thank you again and keep up the good work. Cheers"

I had a really hard time switching my pronoun usage when a classmate came out as trans and I don't think they ever really forgave me when I made the mistake. They hadn't transitioned yet so I instinctively used their previous pronoun and even though I haven't seen them in over 2 years, I still feel guilty about that. Other classmates seemed to have very little trouble adjusting their language so it must've felt like I was just stubborn or something..."
"Pronouns don't belong to the person they are describing, they are tools for communication and they are particularly used to reduce cognitive load. You use the pronoun that looks the most right. Once people start asking for special pronouns for themselves the extra mental effort isn't worth it - you either just use their name or say 'that person over there' or just stop including them in your conversations. At the time of bill C16 there had been a spate of stories about an explosive growth of new pronouns (a seeming cottage industry amongst the pokemon generation who applied the same 'gotta catch 'em all' spirit to pronounery) and the seeming possibility that some one could really destroy a person's life by setting forth unwinnable pronoun rules backed up by the force of law and bring someone to the human rights tribunal. It seems most of those pronouns had short lives but the weapons still exists. It should not."

"Facts don't care about feelings, but people do. Because people do have feelings and that's a fact.  Of course, as pointed out, feelings can be wrong. That just means that you have to evaluate every case for itself; disregarding all feelings as wrong by definition is lazy and downright irrational. You can't go around pretending that fundamental parts of the human experience don't exist or don't matter and call your self a rationalist or whatever, that's simply self-delusional."
"I think many people on the right or undecided would find you more compelling and believable if you were willing to have a civil debate with said Ben Shapiro. Because many times all people do is throw mud and make videos attacking him without actually saying it to his face. It takes more effort, but is more likely to change the minds of more people in the long run. Just being honest. That said. I very much appreciate you having the dignity to rise above such petty tactics. Few can do anything other than scream in rage. All the while proving nothing. Words might be flawed constructs designed to hold meaning. But biology, science, and math never lie. Prove your logic using those three and you will always win.  PS. You are very funny. And are a near satirical genius. You should seriously consider using this as a springboard to launch more ideas and create a larger platform. That can speak for many people who don't have the same capacity to convey deeper meaning to complex issues as eloquently as you. Well done."
"This effeminate gentleman is making sense"
"I don't feel that any appeal to logic is going to work with Ben Shapiro because he confuses objective logos with the neo-colonial perspective.  He's a victim of his own fanatical obsession with this one worldview and using logical argument with a fanatic always either ends ugly or fruitless.  In my experience, alt-right bullshit appeals to the emotions of white men, not logic, and only an appeal to the emotions and empathy of the man can snuff it out.   My experience went like this: my ongoing transition from the alt-right to my current attempt at anti-oppressive perspective started when I was invited to a Denny's after an anime convention by a cute cosplayer that I wanted to go on a date with.  At the Denny's we met up with her friends, who were all non-binary or queer-identifying and she herself was a lesbian.  Whoops, no date for me after all I guess.  So imagine the scene: a conservative white guy, at a table with 15 people covered in body modifications and dyed hair whom I had never met before and kind of...stuck there because I did not want to upset the girl that had invited me.  I just sat at the table hardly saying anything, staring into my 2600 calorie bowl of pork gravy, cheese curds, and fried potatoes just to take my mind off of the dramatically uncomfortable situation I found myself in.  I felt out of place, undesirable, strange, like I should not be there due to my sexual orientation and gender identity.  And I had a revelation.  What a role reversal.  I was having a brief glimpse into an experience that they have every single day.  To be the only person not feeling comfortable with your assigned gender on a bus, or at work, or at the bar.  Feeling like you don't belong wherever you are.  But the difference was that if I felt like I did not belong then I could get up and leave and go anywhere else in the city and feel like my gender identity is acceptable to the masses.  They couldn't do that.  Months of angry keyboard SJWs in my social media inboxes leaving essays trying to convince me that my pronoun-related microaggressions were tantamount to hate crimes and violence, and years of humanities courses in my bachelors studies, did not convince me to be more mindful about the way I use language surrounding non-heteronormative people.  In fact it galvanized me and drew me closer to the alt-right as I felt accepted among them while I felt disdained by the left.  Nothing convinced me to listen to the experiences of a non-binary person or a queer-identifying person and believe them, and think about what it was like to be an NB person in a society of enforced heteronormative, until I was the strange one at the table."
"'You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.

"I do think that your video funny, and you are clearly very intelligent. I definitely respect that. However I can‚Äôt agree with everything you said. For instance, you mentioned that pronouns like ‚Äúhe and she‚Äù were never associated with biology but I‚Äôd say that is untrue. Society never started associating ‚Äúhe‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äù as constructs until the 1980‚Äôs, when anthropologists began to challenge this. Before ‚Äúhe‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äù were based solely on biology. And even though they didn‚Äôt discover chromosomes until after the pronouns were made, they made them based off the differences in biological. Whether you think you should force everyone to stop using the original definition is a different debate.  Also, a big trend I see that‚Äôs happening in society is that many trans people and advocates have gone so far as to not focus on the gender part and and say that it IS biological. The best example I have for this is that trans women are usually placed in the same division as biological women. In many contact sports like the MMA this is really problematic because there a general biological difference in bone structure and strength between men and women. I guess the best example of this would be the controversy surrounding Fallon Fox. If you saw some of her fights, she really brutalized some of these women, and my friends who do MMA told me she really isn‚Äôt even that good. She was eventually beaten though by a biological women who was really good. But still Fallon Fox had an unfair advantage and many feminists have actually written about this saying that she is a biological man and shouldn‚Äôt be in these competitions with biological women. But still, it‚Äôs unfair when you have been on testosterone for 30 years then only began to transition for like 6 months. And the fact that anyone who is challenging this is getting labeled a bigot makes it kind of clear that many do believe a trans women should be perceived in terms of biological sex.  Another example is that some trans-women who have had the surgery will not tell people they are first dating that they are a trans-women and the boy ends up breaking up with her. Some people on the left say that this is totally fine and that is a boy has a problem with it then he is a bigot. I understand how a transition is very personally for many in the trans community but this is being unfair. Sexual orientation for the vast majority of the population is based solely on one‚Äôs biological sex. Even gay men distinguish that they want to date other men. And to not reveal to your potential partner that of your biology is extremely problematic.  Also, you mentioned lesbians in video games at one point. Now personally a lot of people have had gay and lesbian protagonists and not received any backlash. An examples is dishonored: Death of the outsider and it has not received any backlash that I‚Äôve seen. The only thing I‚Äôve seen regarding this issue was Assassins Creed Odyssey. This game let u choose your sexual orientation based on your decisions in the game. The controversy came regarding the DLC, when the game had your character choose the heterosexual route and start a family. People were outraged because they felt it was making them choose. I would understand this but a part of the plot was that the main character had a biological child, which a heterosexual relationship would require. The pressure was so bad they actually had to change the DLC after it was released. I felt that this was kind of unreasonable since games with story modes almost never do this.  I just brought up these points because I just wanted to tell anyone who would care enough to read this far in that there is always another rational side to these arguments and not a side that is the crazy stereotypical alt-right one. Even though I don‚Äôt consider myself conservative, nor do I support Ben Shapiro, I think that it‚Äôs important to be fair to why both sides believe what they believe. Because even though Ben Shapiro is extremely conservative, he is not the crazed neo-nazis redneck. I think it‚Äôs totally fair to criticize him and argue yourself(heck I‚Äôm actually glad their are people to criticize him on some of the things he believes) but I think that there is a logical reason on why he believes what he believes. And I don‚Äôt think the sole reason is is him just being a jerk."

How language becomes automatic and how it's difficult (although necessary) to make that switch when you've been socialized otherwise your entire life? And how it's okay to make mistakes, as long as you're not a dicknugget and correct yourself / allow yourself to be corrected?

"Jordan Peterson is right to stand up against government compelled speech - regardless of the outcome, it sets a dangerous precedent of power that government should not have. Even if Jordan didn't call trans women she, which he does, the correct thing is to convince people of your position - which you do very well TY! I stand with you for equal rights and common dignity, but I also stand with Jordan against government compelled speech.    Compelling speech is not the governments business, nor is this a problem the government can solve - this requires wining hearts and minds. We can't allow governments to tell us what we must say. Think about it like this, and I'm sorry if I get into insensitive territory here, in the video you talk about worrying about being misgendered. You even at one point say, 'I love it when people misgender me, as long as it's not the wrong one.' Imagine if that 'wrong gender' was what people were required by law to call you - because 'it's biologically correct,' as the argument why. That would be wrong, and I'm sure you wouldn't like it either, but what about the person the government is requiring to use that language? Imagine if you were that person, and the government was requiring you to identify your trans friends as their 'biological gender.' Do you think the government should have the power to force you to address someone as their 'birth gender?' The government shouldn't be allowed to force us to have to say things, not directly, not by proxy. Telling us what we can't say (a power which is heavily constrained), is very different than telling us what we must say (a power the government shouldn't have at all). It doesn't matter that zero people have gone to jail it's still wrong.    ((This was originally above, but I moved it here because it got too long lol. I discuss a sensitive point here, surrounding the following question posed as a argument: 'but how would they know what your biological gender is?' Let's be honest for a moment and recognize that many people can tell what sex people were born as - hence the fear of being misgendered. For example, and I'm sorry :-( but for the purpose of honest discussion I'm going to cross a line - I am sorry for this. You mostly read to me as a woman and as a heterosexual male I do find you physically attractive, because you trigger that part of my nature, but I can also tell that you were born male - it's just that the 'female read' overrides the 'male read' - if that makes sense? If you started to read to me as male the physical attraction would go away, because I'm not attracted to male features (which is an incredibly interesting outcome to my science brain :-). I personally don't think it should matter how people see you, as long as they see you as a person and treat you well, but I understand that it's important to you. However, even though I recognize it's importance to you, I also wouldn't be being honest if I said I can't tell you were male and I suspect many can (I truly am sorry :-( I mean no harm). When Ben Shapiro talks about it being a 'lie' (as you showed), that's part of what he means - he can tell you were male. But you are right to notice, and point it out, that sometimes a person would have to do extra work to call someone 'he' when she looks like a 'she' and therefore is naturally called a 'she' until they purposefully 'correct' themselves :-)))   But I do believe we can solve this problem by talking to people and trying to understand each other. I am 100% sure that video's like these, where topics are discussed openly and honestly, while engaging directly with the other side's actual arguments (and not just straw-people :-P), will win hearts and minds. They also empower people like me, who are honestly trying to understand, with the honest perspectives needed to translate for people trying to catch up :-) We do live in a world were we won't always agree and sometimes people are jerks. I know that can be tough, scary, and even dangerous, but two wrongs don't make a right - we have to win this fight the right way."
"Natalie, I get what you mean to live as a binary woman and to feel like a woman at times, but when you honestly look inside yourself and ask whether you feel like a man or a woman it's a question you can't really answer (27:07). I think it's because to be a man or a woman isn't an all-encompassing definition that 100% defines who you are. Sure I live as a woman, but there's also more to who I am that really doesn't have anything to do with my gender. I have an attention disorder, I also love to learn, I'm terrible at math and totally not hardwired for it, but I'm talented with animals, I get anxious about different things than other people etc...there's a lot of other stuff that is a part of my personality that doesn't have much to do with me being a woman (although these other traits can defs be affected by living as a woman). When you have a look inside yourself you get yourself staring back. :)"

"I think my biggest problem about 'Facts don't care about your feelings' is that it undermines the importance of feelings and that's like, the only thing that matters  Like, when he talks about against unisex toilets, why does he do that? Because he believes that rape could occur, which he is against. Why is he against rape? Because he as a person naturally should care for others. And why would he care about women who get raped? Because they suffer from it.  So basically, in this single situation that he's in, there are several emotions of himself and others that are basically the root for all. And that is always this way  We talk about stuff we care about because if things go bad, we *feel* bad, and that's what we don't want. All of our motivations in life and all that drives us has the root of feelings. We want to live because of feelings. As much as Shapiro undermines feelings, they are still the most important thing in existence to anything that is alive"
"This lady is the jam! Great content and so clear in her presentation. But now I have questions... So what about male/female terminology? I am a biologist and in scientific community these are always used to refer to biological characteristics. Yes, given there is a multitude of biological signifiers that make up one's sex and if these don't all point in the same direction...well there tends to be lots of confusion and arguments about which signifiers are the most relevant. But in case there is no biological discrepancy, are there women-males and men-females? O.o That seems beyond confusing, however sometimes it's hard to navigate politeness when dealing with diseases etc. which are for example associated with sex chromosomes and you need accurate biological descriptions. Next, in my native language, there are no different words for gender and sex. There is no assumption that gender is society created concept. Man=human male, woman=human female, bitch= canine female etc. Would there be a requirement to come up with a new terminology? Again how to best approach this when scientific accuracy is required? Next, in my native language we have multiple ways how to address a person= you, (formal) You and the most formal honorific they. This singular they you reserve only for people you have the utmost respect and gratefulness for. I bumped into couple of scenarios where I really didn't click with the non-binary person and all I wanted to do was not even mention the person ever but instead I needed to refer to these people in this honorific pronoun- something they have no awareness of at all (different cultures) but grates on my nerves soo badly. Is there a way how to bipass this and still remain respectful (mostly to other non-binary people who are not even in the room or who I don't even know)? I know this last one is very specific but these two people just make my blood boil! Happy to expand on any questions if needed and thank you for answers :)"

Femme and butch are not on a spectrum, they are specific subcultural identities that not only encompass the way that lesbians present, but the identities are more about a lesbian‚Äôs relationship to both women and men, or lackthereof. Also, stone butch is not ‚Äúmore butch‚Äù or ‚Äúmore masculine‚Äù, but rather a specific sexual identity that is about having sex. Stone/high femme is similar, in fact it‚Äôs the exact opposite of stone butch."
"You know, funny enough, Ben Shapiro was the person who literally convinced my stepbrother to repeatedly misgender me and attempt to justify it with non-existent arguments like ‚Äúit‚Äôs about appearance‚Äù while ignoring all of the trans people who you could only tell are trans if they directly told you (although the worth of a trans person, or a person in general, is not related at all to physical appearance or voice). He genuinely thought that he was being civil, while consistently mocking me for being trans. He got kicked out of our house."
"Honestly,  despite what Ben Shapiro wants to say is her reasoning, the reason she (see what I did there?) decides to deliberately use pronouns that her targets dont identify as is because she is using it as an insult and a way to show her distaste and lack of any respect for them as human beings.  That makes her a GIANT dick with a tiny one attached."

"I will always use the pronouns people ask me to use. And always do. But to be totally honest, I can actually tell if I'm talking to a woman or a man nine times out of ten. So I use the pronouns they want, but still in my mind know I'm talking to somebody else. For instance: I will always use the 'she' pronouns with you, if I would talk to you. But I know you are actually born a man, so in my mind still a man. But I will use it out of respect. But you ask me to see you as a woman. I WANT to see you as a woman, but my mind tells me different. Not out of a lack of respect but more something I cannot turn off. You can only be truly loved and respected by other people, if you love and respect yourself. Changing yourself to be accepted by others, is in my mind never the right path. Part of this is maybe accepting the sometimes hard truth. I really hope you reconsider plastic surgery. You are a beautiful person as you are, and your videos inspire a lot of people, me included. You are who you are. You don't need anything done in my opinion. I don't see you only as a man or a woman, I just see a great and good person with a lot of humor and creativity. For that I respect and envy you. (sorry for my bad English at times, I'm not a native speaker) <3   Edit: I've been watching more videos you made. Sorry if I offended you in this post. I'm trying to make sense of it all, takes a while I guess. I first wanted to delete this post, but maybe not. I'll get back on this.

I didn‚Äôt notice anyone else bringing it up, I was hoping I wasn‚Äôt the only one that noticed.

They fear this so much that it becomes an acceptable bragging right-- 'Well, Bob, I've never kissed a tranny!' Like it's a lifetime achievement or something. Shit, where was I going with this? Oh! Fragile masculinity is an overwhelming culprit in cases of transphobia. For the men at least. The transphobic women fear that men will beat them at some invisible/psychotic game of getting the best menz. Maybe?"

Being an asshole is not a crime and a society that tries to use laws to make their people behave politely is not one that I want to live in.  By the way, I find your perspective on trans issues really interesting! I have a very critical/negative opinion on most of the liberal left positions these days. You showing me that there are reasonable people out there really helps me"

Transwoman concisely explains the entire situation, so ‚Äúwoman,‚Äù as the colloquial, would follow his logic.

"The thing with using they and them is that they are mostly used for more than person Like f'eks they did it We hate them What are they"
"Even if (and I say 'if') we accept Ben's 'genetic' premise, things are not as clear cut as 'he' implies, e.g there are people with XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), XXXY or XXXXY chromosomes. They have male characteristics, but suffer low testosterone levels. But if we already have this kind of exceptions on a purely genetic level, how should Ben's criteria hold up on a wider biological scale, where we see a wide range of deviations from 'normal' hormone productions? I would argue that when a criteria is already so flawed in the area it was constructed, it makes no sense at all to adopt it in a social context, at least not in the strict way Ben does, but only as a statistical phenomenon (people with XY chromosomes behave _usually_ so and so)."
"The thing I find funny about Shapiro is when he says (and I'm paraphrasing here) 'intersex people have different chromosomes but they usually either look like a male or female so you can gender them thusly' but this does not apply to trans people, he can't stick to a proper argument. If chromosomes determine what pronouns you should use, then intersex people should be called gender neutral pronouns but he doesn't believe this. Ben Shapiro shuts down his own arguments with his lack of intelligence, he's well spoken (not very well spoken but enough to enthrall a few idiots) but he's actually pretty stupid and lacks logic. ‚òï"

"I agree with everything you say, but what's your opinion on all the new pronouns like Zie, Sie, Ey, Ve, Tey, Ze, Fae... I think not using them has nothing to do with not being respectful, but practicality. I tried to write a couple of paragraphs talking about 4 people, each one of them identifying with one of these new pronouns (all different), using them and their declensions and it took me an eternity. At the end it was impossible to follow what I was writing. Using them in a normal conversation would be really difficult, especially if they keep coming up with new ones."
"Contra, you have helped me move on from the transmed rhetoric. I'm an ftm who is not super masculine and of course I have social dysphoria but I always told myself it just stemmed from physical dysphoria which was all that mattered for identity. You helped me realize that's narrow minded and arbitrary, and that social dysphoria is valid dysphoria! (Although I do think there needs to be more freedom for cis women to present 'masculine' and cis men to present 'feminine' without them thinking they must be trans. What YOU helped me realize is that social dysphoria is not the same thing as gender presentation. Thanks! :3"

"I feel I have one kind of interesting perspective to bring to the whole discussion. I've been working in the field of biomechanical engineering for many years in prosthetics design, which means I work with a lot of veterans. In the field of people who've lost limbs, there's an unsurprising amount of overlap with men who have lost all, or most, of their genitalia to shrapnel and explosions.   First, there's the obvious mix of suddenly parallel experiences - men experiencing rejection because a lot more people than you think are 'genitalia essentialists', men experiencing horrific dysphoria because a part of their body they're very attached to is no longer returning the favor. But there's also a level of privilege.  Of course this injured soldier is still a man! Of course the correct course of action for his mental wellbeing is for him to go on hormones to ensure he retains secondary masculine characteristics! Of course it should be acceptable for him to employ a number of prosthetics for all the different functions a man uses his penis for - to suggest otherwise would be not only a level of insult you'd want to knock someone's teeth out for, but a huge violation of his right to do what he wants with his body and live the way he's most comfortable.  You'd call a woman who broke up with him upon learning of his injury a shallow, heartless, unmitigated bitch, and she'd deserve every insult you could throw at her (this is not sarcasm, I've seen this shit happen many times).  In the instance of damage and repair, it is acceptable and admirable when someone proves that they can view the human body for what it realy is: A machine to serve the needs of the conscious brain inside. But when it comes to elective change, well it depends. Are you  using your bodily autonomy to change your body into something I find acceptable?"
"More videogames for lesbians!"
"As much as I like Ben he is wrong in this. In my opinion if there‚Äôs no cure for transgenderism then might as well call them whatever they want. 40% suicide rate is very alarming and tells me that whether they‚Äôre accepted or not there‚Äôs something mentally wrong with them"
"This is a great argument, but the thing is, there is a innumerable amount of features about a person that we as humans can percieve as being 'boys' or 'girls' even from a young age. Be it a result of ignorance and societal norms or otherwise, chastising people for not being able to tell the difference is immoral. To simplify, if I've been raised to be polite (as I hope we all have been) and kindly say 'thank you sir' to a person who has mostly male features but identifies as a woman when she holds the door for me, is it fair to indict me as a rude person? To exercise my priveliged mindset for a second, you as well as many other trans-people who I've seen/met have a lot of the characteristics that I would consider to look 'female' so I suspect that I would make the quick mental association upon meeting you that you are a woman, however not all trans-people are as clearly distinguishable as you. If it's difficult to tell (with some transwomen not always wearing the clothes or makeup or acting in the way that you do, it's often a gray area where a 'priveliged' person such as myself can get lost in) am I expected to ask someone's pronouns every time? It's a part of English idiomatic speech to say sir or ma'am or even 'thanks man' if I ask you the time, for example. In such minescule interactions as asking when the next train comes or how to get to South Broadway, should I really be expected to open every encounter with a 'hello, what are your pronouns?' I'm sorry but the vast majority of people just simply don't care. I mean no offense and I'm absolutely open to calling you what you wish to be called, but the main points that I get from Ben's arguments about transpeople are that they are 'confusing' especially to young children as he is shown saying in this video. It's unfair to all people who have grown up with values and necessary stereotypes to all of the sudden require them to change their entire vocabulary and language tendencies. It's often an argument that people who incorrectly misgender people are rude (and purposely doing it is, don't get me wrong) and even at times it is considered 'violence'. The concept of this seems to have ominous implications, as while I am happy to indulge in whatever you would like to be called, it's incredibly easy for me to say he instead of she or her instead of they if I am briefly referring to someone, especially in that 'gray area' I referred to that is hard to independently distinguish. I get the arguments of both sides and I think it's rude to purposely misgender, however I also think the common reaction to accidental misgendering is rude, people make mistakes and we can't be expected to completely change the way we start a personal interaction by integrating 'hello what are your pronouns' cold turkey. It seems harsh I know but if you identify as something that you dont look like based on the societal norms we have maintained for generations, you have the right to get offended but no right to lash out and verbally retaliate when you are called something you don't consider yourself to be. It is not the fault of the average citizen that you don't look like your personal image."

Not only have you really opened my eyes to my own internalised biases, but because of how you explain your points you have laid out a road map for me when these topics come up. I work in a typically conservative environment and try to put forth a compelling argument when certain topics come up. So thank you for all you do, and keep being amazing."

"Hello ContraPoints! Do you wanna go on a date with me?? üòç"
"Exactly. If you adopt a child, you are NOT a parent. You are an ‚Äúadoptive‚Äù parent. Similarly, if you are a man who transitions to a woman, you are NOT a woman. You are simply a man pretending to be a woman; or in your terms, a ‚Äútrans‚Äù woman. Thank you for proving Shapiro‚Äôs argument."

"This is by far the best argument for pronouns I've ever heard. I've never objected once to using someone's preferred pronoun, and always have in social situations, but I have listened to far too many conservative arguments about the issue that I was downright confused about what to think. So many of the arguments are presented in a way that appear compelling, but I've never been able to understand why they're wrong despite feeling that something was missing from the picture. To hear it articulated so clearly is refreshing!"

I wish people making similar mistakes would be as embarrassed when they address Trans people who are obviously presenting as their identified gender instead of doubling down."

"Yes I would not call a post op trans-woman anything but she or her or woman. Or even a pre-op trans woman who obviously was trying her best to be a woman, not like say a guy with full facial hair wearing a dress, like at a costume party or some other event where it was obvious that he was really a he and just wearing a dress to be funny! Besides a post-op trans woman is by all visible means a woman. Cool video NW!"

Let people who want to stick with what actual science says think what the evidence says without the insults and aggression from the left wing political types."
"All this pronoun and gender stuff has been a thing all of 5 mins. If people don't believe it all they are somehow evil? Why not be nicer to people that need some time or more information on the topic? Why be such insufferable cunts to people that either don't care or don't agree with you? Literally since forever, males and females have been defined a certain way and now you want to change that and people that don't go along with your changes are beneath you?"

My native language simply do not make distinction of gender in third person at all, you can talk about a person for ages without clear of any gender identity.

"Sure go ahead, touch it"
"What about the idea of sensible, easy, anthropologically and historically viable definition, instead of this double strawman? I propose the one obvious definition you did not care to consider: - A woman referring to a caryotype seems wrong, because as you pointed out, in the old days, people knew full well what a true woman was before caryotype was discovered - A woman referring to anyone who is assigned or has chosen a gender role should be ruled out as well, because in the old days, people knew very well the difference between a guy who aspired to a female gender role and didn't refer to him as a woman, except in very specific cases (fa'afafine), and even then it was more of a third gender than a proper woman. Also traditional societies worldwide did not seem that interested in personal ambitions in terms of identity and social roles (cf. slavery, servage, tribalism, and so on and so forth)  So how about the obvious anthropological definition of a woman as a resource for her tribe/society? Woman : Person who exhibits the traits and qualities of female biology. The first being: She should be able to bear children to reinforce her tribe/nation if not for a terrible disease/curse rendering her sterile and therefore dysfunctional.  Trans women are not biologically dysfunctional women, they're perfectly functional males (the overwhelming majority of them, anyway). In a woman among pretty much any society on the face of the Earth and across time, the lack of a potentially productive uterus is a dysfunction. Something that harms society and reduces her value to her tribe/nation/social group as a woman. In a trans woman/fa'afafine/deranged gentleman/however they were considered by their group, the lack of a fertile womb is not a dysfunction, it's a feature. One that made room for masculine qualities and traits also exploitable by the group: muscular strength, sperm, all that good stuff.  The main idea, if we are to consider 99% of humanity through time and space, is not to advocate for a reductionist prescriptive definition (the impossibility to define the common essence of all women that ever existed doesn't mean there is no such thing as a woman), nor a reductionist descriptive definition (whatever yourself and lovers and friends agreed upon didn't make law in the city/tribe). Instead, I think a sensible notion, both descriptive (in the sense that anthropologically-wise that is probably how the group validated your use as a woman) and prescriptive (it was useful to know what each sex could provide for the group) was fully sufficient: Women can offer the group kids. If not, the lack of a better physical use made them natural caretakers for their nephews and fathers/merchants. As for a man, he could give the group sperm. And if not, at least, the physical strength and other capabilities associated with the high levels of testosterone and musculature an XY caryotype entails as opposed to an XX caryotype.  I do not think human groups (or mammal herds, for that matter) define 'female' as a want from the individual, nor as the expression of a pure essence applicable to anyone born with an XX caryotype. I think 'females' are considered by the group as one kind of resource. Males, as another separate kind.  Edit : Interesting video nonetheless, as usual. The intro is especially beautiful. Well done."

Don't you know that's not according to the rules as discovered by Ben Shapiro's flawless facts and logic?  I mean, just explain to me how milk has XY chromosomes and how a bottle has XX chromosomes, please!  It's anti-reality, anti-science, and worst of all anti-American.  Don't you understand that this will inevitably lead to the demise of Judeo-Christian values and the collapse of Western civilization as we know it?!

"A shame English lost its grammatical gender finally. In French the noun carries the gender even if the noun is referring to a person who is or looks like a man or a woman. A sentinel can be the biggest, butchest, most muscular warrior, but because the word sentinel is feminine, that soldier will be ‚Äúshe.‚Äù  And since ‚Äúmajesty‚Äù is feminine, the king will always be literally ‚Äúher majesty.‚Äù Even if Louis XIV hadn‚Äôt dressed like a drag queen. üå∏‚≠êÔ∏èüåà‚òÆÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"So, if he and she refer to XY and XX, respectively, do we not need three new pronouns for people who are X, XXY and XYY? If so, how do we identify these individuals. It's important to know, since I am Canadian and do not want to end up in pronoun jail."

"Here's my rule...  If a person looks male (short hair, masculine face, typical male clothes, low pitch voice, stubble or beard, etc) then I will call them a man/he. If a person looks female (long hair, make-up, typical female clothes, high pitch voice, hips, breasts, etc) then I will call them a woman/she.  I never have had a problem with transgender people, I have worked with a few male-to-female transgender people and I have never had a problem with calling them 'she'. I have defended them against some very nasty comments made by others as well. I think we should just be nice and fair towards each other. It doesn't hurt you or damage you in any way just to be polite and respectful towards someone wishes (i.e- if a biologically-born male wants to be called a woman)."
"I always argued this issue was insignificant because I never encountered anyone in the trans community.   However.. there was a cashier, an obvious male(biologically) with a peach fuzz mustache and and hairy arms and loose-fitting male clothes. They handed me the receipt for my purchase, circled their name (obviously an alias based around identifying as a female: I‚Äôll say Johniana to respect their identity) and asked me to complete the survey. Mind you they had grown their hair long, split down the middle and tucked behind their ears and speaking with a feminine voice.  I said ‚Äúthanks man, have a good day‚Äù..  I call everyone man, dude, bro, etc..  This was the first time that I sincerely asked myself, ‚Äúdo I need to change my patterns of language in order to ‚Äòrespect‚Äô this small community when my language bears NO intention of disrespecting the community?   I don‚Äôt feel sincerely burdened. I know those transitioning are in an emotionally delicate phase but I‚Äôm not half as mindful as I am polite. I feel like people like me can look like assholes.. I hope y‚Äôall understand.  Another thing, I‚Äôm not conservative but I‚Äôm pro-capitalism. Hopefully the trans community understands that not only communists empathize and attempt to respect them."

"29:25 I'm so glad that bit stayed in there. It's beautiful."
"Damn girl, your videos are art"
"I'm so glad to see a binary person talk about gender experience as opposed to pure identity. I'm genderfluid, and for me it really boils down to what social role I want to feel. When I go through times in my life when I don't really talk to anyone and therefore don't fill any social role on the daily, it feels like I don't really have a gender. It's really fascinating tbh"
"He"
"I enjoy your womansplaining (just mashed this up and don't know if it is a pre-existing phrase or if it has a negative connotation like mansplaining).   Your points seem practical.  I just began watching your videos.  I can't say I watch as often as I should, but I do occasionally see one and click.  What can I say? They are long bouts of you speaking and I can't handle podcasts for that same reason.  I do think that listening has been good for my soul, though.  God bless you!"
"Non Binary is fashionable and they are male or female. However they identify as it fashionable.   Your view is very clean and have portrayed your views well.   Be careful though, free speech is the foundation of free thought.   And there are only two genders."
"the god dammit at 19:51 is the most relatable fucking shit"
"I‚Äôm in a position rn where I identify as a guy but growing up socialized as female, and even with people you accept me and see me as male, I‚Äôm still treated as a girl if that makes sense. And I think that‚Äôs because in a way ‚Äòacting female‚Äô is the only mode I know to live in because it‚Äôs how I was treated. Trying to brake free from that so I can ‚Äòbe a guy‚Äô is probably one of the most frustrating things for me being trans. And from what I‚Äôve seen people don‚Äôt really socialize around you or perceive you ‚Äòas a guy‚Äô until you physically pass. This may be way out of the ball park or not make any sense but it‚Äôs just something I observed I guess. Great video. Good times"

"So, I'm addressing this question to Natalie; but I know a personal response from a content creator is [understandably] rare, so others please feel free to weigh in.  You talk about wanting converts, not just people who tolerate you.  But what is one to do when tolerance seems the best you can hope for?  Do you simply give up on educating such a person?  Or is there some middle ground between that and trying in vain to convince them?  I ask for practical purposes, as such is the case with certain close relatives of mine."

"As someone who loves science, most scientific studies are subject to some bias and statistics only mean things because of how we feel about them. Even if we're not blatantly lying, 99% of the time facts ARE influenced by the subjective opinions or emotions of whoever says they're true. In which case, people who say 'facts over feelings' have it wrong in my subjective opinion. Your facts are probably feelings just as my facts are probably feelings. Life is a battle of feelings vs. other feelings."

"I think you had mentioned before preferring that people use both male and female pronouns, one after the other quickly, when referring to you. You didn‚Äôt actually say the words though. I think you meant hisher (pronounced hizzer) and heshe (heeshee)? These kind of roll off the tongue and I could see them being widely adopted as an alternative to they. I‚Äôm glad you mentioned that this is an English issue (and other languages with gendered pronouns) and languages like Korean don‚Äôt share this issue. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time with Koreans and Filipinos and they often misgender people because they don‚Äôt use gendered pronouns in their native tongue."
"'Facts don't care about your feelings' is such a ridiculous statement. Facts can't care about anything so its equally nonsensical to state that 'facts do care about your feelings'. What shapiro means of course is that he doesn't care about your feelings if you disagree with him. But then he also doesn't seem to care much about facts either unless they accord with his argument."
"You make being funny and clever look so easy"

"I don't know how the Man or Woman rolls are supposed to be good when they taste horrible to me . Then when I bake my own fecking rolls every body looses their shit.  Then they like to say that they are imaginary rolls. That I just made up the rolls I'm eating, when the rolls are clearly on the table."
"You're 6'1? Whoah! Cool."
"I seriously needed a video like this. I'm introducing myself into American political and cultural controversy because I'm moving there in a few months for my Ph.D., and sometimes I just feel so fucking confused about why people seem to care so much about things that we don't really talk about in my culture (pronouns, vaccines, vegans, walls, you name it). The USA is just so weird. Thank you for shedding some light on this matter."
"Why aren't you out debating them though!?"
"You make some really great points in this video about why 'biological' terminology is irrelevant to a pronoun discussion.   This video was great for me to watch because it pulled my head out of my ass as a scientist and made me remember as a philosopher that science isn't necessary to make my argument.  Still, it's been worthwhile for me to think about the philosophical intersection of science and interpretation/it's misguided history. I'd been just referencing the hell of a lot of science to support trans/non binary/fluid identities, and the growing body of research. Throwin it out there for the general public/2nd that to similar prior comments: the focus on chromosomes as 'the' biological identifier of gender is not only over simplified, it's false in that it ignores a much larger and more complicated scientific discussion of gender. In fact if research were more integrated most gendered studies from psychology and sociology would have to be thrown out. What info is missing from this vlog on that subject I'd be happy to send people what I have/talk to them about what science/ideas they might know that I don't have.  It‚Äôs a painfully dry approach to an emotional subject for a lot of people, but I understand why scientists want to dissolve arguments about gender and sexuality.  A lot of scientists have been trying to find ‚Äòthe gay gene‚Äô.   They want parents to stop thinking they can change their kids just by sending them to gay camp.  Science never solves any problems though, either its interpretation does or it just causes more problems.  God forbid we found a gene that influences homosexuality then in some dystopian fucking future fetuses were screened for the ‚Äògay gene‚Äô during pregnancy.  That being said, talking about science won‚Äôt make people respect people‚Äôs identities and stop people from being prejudice, but it can dissolve idiotic conversations about genetics as some kind of end all be all of personalities.  A lot of genetics mutate their expression through out your life time and upbringing depending on your environment, also when it comes to gender there are multiple levels of bio chemical influences on cultural factors of identification including phenotype, behavior, and how a person feels about themselves.  People are coming around to the fact that there is no ‚Äògay‚Äô gene, but there is also no ‚Äògender‚Äô gene."
"ben shapiro almost explained why he was wrong like 5 times in that blaire white debate. the adoptive parent analogy is perfect-telling adoptive parents that their children are not really their children isn't just Politically Incorrect-it's...incorrect. in almost any situation where it is relevant, they are. and in discussions that are political rather than medical, the most accurate way to refer to a person who lives as a woman, who experiences the world as a woman, who is oppressed under misogyny, is a woman."
"ben shapiro DESTROYS liberals with his awfully nasally little voice!!!"
"This guy, contrapoints, is in love with his own logic. I can call him a he because I am trans-being, my narcissism and ego make me a God, yet no one uses my pronouns. My pronouns are My Lord or My God in place of he him or you. Use my pronouns or else you lost this argument"
"I wish someone would make a gender neutral version of sir/ma'am. But whenever I look on sites and see people ask if there are any, they just get shit non-answers like 'jUsT dON't USE aNY!!!11!' or 'I use Mx. instead of Mr./Mrs' or 'LOL WHAT KINDA PERSON USES THOSE?!??' like just say the answer is no."
"I'd like to emphasize the point you make at https://youtu.be/9bbINLWtMKI?t=1520 that there are languages like finnish, that don't differentiate between male and female pronouns, but use a single pronoun to adress all people. So yeah, the male and female pronouns are a pure linguistic construct and there's literally no reason to not adress a person how they want to be adressed, as it's all made up to begin with and has no roots in biology at all."
"TBH when I misgender someone in the service industry, it makes me want to crawl under a rock. I misgendered a ciswoman as a barista and damn near died of embarrassment. I think trans*people deserve the same level of respect. And by respect, I mean my utter humiliation and shame when I am socially awkward."

"tl;dr Thanks for the video, I enjoyed it!  very long; shouldn't read: I mean, I used to think that just because I don't get something doesn't mean it isn't without merit, but rather that there's a decent enough chance I didn't get it. Then I asked myself if I cared enough to bother learning more, and if I didn't I aired on the side of not being a shitgibbon.  Turns out I was just afraid that the government would come get me and throw me in my secret Canadian C-16 prison full of socialist healthcare.  I'm glad I got on the Youtube 'SO YOU WATCHED JORDAN PETERSON ON THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE EH!? YOU WATCHED THE JRE EVER EH!? HERE'S SOME ALT-RIIIIIITE FOR JOOOOOOO' train. It took the long way around but I ended up here and, say whatever you want, the production is enthusiastic if nothing else... which there is something else, also good.  I agree with some of the stuff Peterson says, which honestly isn't that surprising being that I try to be level headed about stuff, but after awhile I got rather tired of having to sift through the sheer volume of shit that he says and wondering how much of my annoyance with his inability to be specific was me until the Sam Harris events. Then I realized he's like a louder, less well-spoken Sam Harris. Or maybe the post-Freudian neon-Lobsterists got me, fuck if I know.  Anyways, thanks for the vid from Victoria, BC, Canada!"

"Men She-piro"
"I think men are much more threatened by trans women than trans men... not sure why, but i think it has to do with us feeling like we‚Äôre losing team members"
"Thank you for all of your hard work and time devoted to the civil discourse around these contentious issues. This video had so much great information and I appreciate the point of view of someone in the transgender community. I wanted to bring up a technical-genetics based rebuttal to Ben‚Äôs point - not all people with XX chromosomes are born physically women (XX Male Syndrome - about 1 in 20,000 live births) and not all people born with XY chromosomes are born physically men (Swyer Syndrome - about 1 in 80,000 live births). Many of the people affected with these conditions don‚Äôt find out until they are trying to have children themselves or they do genetic testing for medical reasons. The argument that sexuality and biology are perfectly linked to genetics is just factually inaccurate."
"In my personal opinion, people should always use the correct name and pronouns for people (meaning the pronouns and name they wish to be referred to as), whether or not you believe their identity is valid, simply because it's polite.  I mean, also I want people to think trans people and people in any way genderqueer or nonbinary exist and should be respected, but if I can't convince people of that, at least I can tell people to be polite."
"Here is why you‚Äôre wrong:"
"The definition of the word ‚Äúhe‚Äù is a pronoun used to refer to a male."
"The definition of the word ‚Äúshe‚Äù is a pronoun used to refer to a female."
"A ‚Äúmale‚Äù is defined as denoting the sex that has the capacity to fertilize a female.   This fundamentally implicates DNA and chromosomes as it is the chromosomes that dictates if a person has the capacity to fertilize a female."
"A ‚Äúfemale‚Äù is defined as denoting the sex that has the capacity bear offspring.  Dido with the implication of DNA & chromosomes as they control the capacity of a person to bear offspring."
"Identify as whatever you like, even as a banana if you like ‚Äì but don‚Äôt attempt to compel others to share your delusion."
"The modification to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill C-16, 2016) does make misgendering a person a criminal violation.  See here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Act_to_amend_the_Canadian_Human_Rights_Act_and_the_Criminal_Code   The analogy to adoptive parents is good, but also fails under close scrutiny.  Adoptive parents are charitably afforded the accommodation of not distinguishing them from biological parents to both reward the laudable act of caring for another‚Äôs child that has no parents as one‚Äôs own and to enable the child‚Äôs bond to the adoptive parents so that the child may have the closest experience as possible to having a biological parent(s).  In short is a charitable act meant to reward and enable the success of a laudable act that brings advantage to a society."
"Affording trans people the same accommodation is not justified because transitioning from one sex to another is the neither a virtuous nor laudable act and it does not bring an advantage for a society and therefore does not implore the same charity or justification to accommodate.     I don‚Äôt mean to offend but a trans-person‚Äôs condition is more akin to psychological delusion produced by a disorder rather than a pretense accepted to enable a laudable act.  And nowhere in the West is there the tradition of indulge peoples psychological delusions, even if it were to save their hurt feelings."
"And on a side note, you may be more effective in persuading others to provide those like you an accommodation to save your feelings if you were respectful of others people‚Äôs feelings, which would dictate you don‚Äôt burn the US flag in what I can only interpret as an intentional act of provocation."
"So by your argument we can just call you 'IT' because it fits what I want and that's what matters and words can be change to fit whatever we decide they be. And I can just refer to you as IT because it will not cause any confusion and everyone can agree to it.    BTW the only reason people call you she is because they want something from you.  Otherwise nobody cares about your delusions .  We are all to busy with our own delusions."
"OMG, you're amazing!! Also this is so helpful and entertaining at the same time, glad I found you on VICE :)"

"Anyone who dyes their hair from brown to blonde is a lying deluded snowflake and I refuse too call them anything but brunettes who are lying to themselves. Facts don't care about your feelings"
"I'm agender, and I don't care about what pronouns  people use for me, because to me, pronouns don't actually MEAN anything about my gender. But that being said, I care deeply about using the correct pronouns for the people who do care üëç"
"So then... can we please, please, please, please stop using 'fish' to describe being a woman? Because frankly, no woman I know does that. The only people I have ever heard calling a woman 'fish' are drag queens - and I can barely handle hearing that as is (Drag Race, I'm looking at you). As a woman, it's insulting. It's demeaning. It's saying that my anatomy has a 'scent' to it (and lord only knows if you aren't clean down there it does), but to have it suddenly be a perfectly accepted thing to call women 'fish' then ask people to use appropriate to your identity pronouns... yeah. Doesn't feel right at all. Other than that... please keep schooling. I'm loving it."
"This is awesome."
"Videogames for Lesbians?!?! NOO!!"
"I binge watch conservatives. I like Stephen crowder, Tim Poole, Ben Shapiro, etc. Mainly because I can't handle crazy SJW stuff. Somehow I've ended up here and I like it here. Contrapoints has led to me watch videos from the other side. The world feels weird when you're not a conservative or a liberal and they all feel like 'if you're not totally with us then you're against us.' Where do I belong? I think trans people should he called by whatever pronoun they want, have all the rights, and basically be left the hell alone. I don't think children should be allowed to take hormones to transition. I dont think parent should push their kids into a certain direction when it comes to sexuality or gender. I dont want a wall. I like people being able to get government assistance as long as they are actually deserving and not scamming. Example: my husband co worker wont marry his girlfriend because she gets Medicaid and food stamps when he makes $200k a year. Fuck people like that getting help. Where do I belong? I think abortion should be legal but not late term. I think the cutoff should be around 8 weeks (there's wiggle room with the gestation depending on moms life being at risk, rape, stuff like that) and do pill abortion only unless vacuum is absolutely necessary. I am all for legal immigration, very anti illegal immigration. I think we wouldnt be America without immigration but I also think we shouldn't give asylum to someone unless they have good proof that they truly need it and aren't just trying to get an easy way in to make more money and use resources. I dont think immigrants should get assistance, come here with money or only use assistance to get on your feet. They shouldn't get much assistance when Americans are homeless and starving. I thinks gays should be left the hell alone. Racism is bad. Rich people should pay more taxes. Healthcare should be universal, no one should die because they can't afford health care. No one should be in debt forever because of college but if we all get free college the degrees lose value. Where do I belong? How do I watch ben Shapiro and get it then come here and also get it? I dont like trump but also dont like.Clinton. outrage culture is bullshit. People take stuff too seriously. People are also too narrow minded. Minimum wage is too low. Corporations are causing suffering. Kids shouldn't be put in cages. We are all the same, no matter our colors, genders, wealth, or any other differences. Terrorism comes in all colors. Guns need more laws but I like hunting with a gun. I also want to be able to go to the gay club with my best gay friends and feel safe, feel like the place wont be shot up. I homeschool my kids out of fear of shootings. Where the fuck do I belong? Why can't I see both sides? Why tell me I have to choose sides when neither fits me?"

"Why doesmt everyone just start referring to Ben as a she and her and see how long she likes it..."
"We refer to comic book characters as she and he and yet they have no biology much less chromosomes.  Ben is delusional. He believes in a religion that is factually incorrect and a lie like all religion and yet he makes money off saying facts dont care about your feelings... when his entire belief system is infactual its hard to believe anything he says."

"Vice brought me to your channel. I've been watching all day. I wish I could keep watching, but I have to go to bed now."
"I've been binge watching your content and you helped me (a - would I say boring ? - cis hetero male) understand transgender persons and what they are expressing (And I used to be mostly unconvinced). I think you're brave and smart and pretty good at explaining it. And funny, too. There's always a point where I just have to stop the video to drop a like under it because you just made my day with one snarky phrase and girl you just deserved it !"
"As a white male who never meet a trans in person this make clear whay SJW screams about. I think i just use the pronoun 'by looks', just don't be mad if someone doesn't get it right. It's not easy for people without this kind of experience, and you must admit it's confusing, expecially with 'extreme' cases"
"This entire discussion is just tiring, Ben Shapiro just wants to say the most controversial things so he can get more famous so he can spread the REAL right-wing propaganda faster"
"I think the most powerful thing you do in these videos is concede the strong parts of your opponents arguments. Facts don't care about your feelings and there is something horrific about the radio silence incels experience on dating apps. Being charitable about the real points your opponents have makes your repudiation of their greater philosophy that much stronger. Thanks!"
"I got in a heated discussion with some trans ladies about being called dude.  I use this liberally for creatures as a 'you've got to hear this' or 'I can't believe this' Almost like MAN!  I felt horrible about it and still do, but I don't feel like I'm wrong.  The argument on the non-dude use side was how would you finish the sentence 'I like to fuck _____.'  I actually don't use dudes in that kind of sentence.  I would say men or penises.  Dude I don't see as purely gender-specific.  Can someone give me their thoughts?  On the person-specific side, my friend said she feels something in the pit of her stomach when called a dude - in her case I would not.  Just as if a woman requested that I not call her Hon, which as a Texan I do to nearly everyone else."
"Ben Shapiro is definitely a self-loathing stealth transguy, my trans ass can sniff out a fellow tranny from a mile away. Think about it - Untrained, high voice. Short af. Thicc, but hides it under HER suit. *FACTS DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS, BENJAMIN, YOU SELF-HATING WOMAN*"
"What's interesting is that I know some people who at the time considered themselves cis for whom gendering them correctly felt uncomfortable because they 'seemed' nonbinary to me.  Like, I had to make a conscious effort to refrain from using they/them pronouns.  Like, it is a thing that can happen with enough degenerate propaganda."
"As you have mentioned not all languages have gendered pronouns for third person, like my mother tongue for example, Bengali one of the eastern most Indo-european language only has gender neutral pronouns for third person. Hindi on the other hand has gendered verb modifications as well."
"I've always thought one of the gaping holes in Ben Shapiro's argument is the phrase he relies on so heavily: 'Facts don't care about your feelings'. Because you know what's also true? Feelings don't care about your facts! People with stable jobs and loving families can get depression, people with very low incomes can be seemingly inexplicably happy. Humans are built on irrationality and innate, unreasonable feelings and states of mind that are hard to describe. Even language (and therefore pronouns, because this is primarily a linguist debate as wonderfully explained in this video) has intense irrationalities that have grown into it organically. Transgender people don't need rock solid reasons to be alive and respected in the same way that I don't need rock solid reasons to express my opinion in the YouTube comments section."

"Ugh that voice is so cringe. Succumb to the 40-60% statistic Contrapoints"

"You say this debate is about language but language is flawed and subjective. I believe this debate is about respect. Respect cannot and should not be demanded, and asking others to recognise and acknowledge your language or belief when they observe deception and delusion is a fascist approach. Feel free to request whatever you'd like but don't expect others to comply. You can't excuse threats of violence because someone refuses to meet your demands ... but you ignore that fact completely (or do you with the suggestive knife waving?). Do you think maybe Ben was baiting Zoe to show how 'unladylike' Zoe is in reality? If someone calls me Miss, I might look at them funny but I don't threaten them with harm because I'm not insecure about others perspectives. You expect civility but don't respect how others observe you or their freedom to label you as they see fit. You're willing to see people kidnapped at gunpoint and put in cages for pronoun misuse (or you wouldn't have brought it up) ... it really doesn't get more fascist than that. Bad actors who don't 'pass' for the role they attempt will always be labeled as such despite demands to the contrary. If you think you can bully others free speech with threats of violence and imprisonment, you are mistaken. Just like you're free to label me a Hobgoblin because I'm insensitive to understanding the complexities to a small group of confused people, I can address you as Sir if I perceive you to be a man. In most cases, I might comply to a person's request to be addressed the way they wish to be perceived even if that description doesn't register as reality. The second you demand it and EXPECT me to change my behavior is when my understanding of your complexities and sensitivities end. Most of the world doesn't have these issues but most of them are also willing to be sensitive to YOUR issues, even though they arn't OURS. Be supportive of the effort most people make to help you feel included instead of focusing on condemning those that don't. My take away from this commentary is you made Ben look good and Transgenders appear to be violent and willing to jail me for the sake of their feelings. If you've destroyed anything it's your own credibility."

"As a cisgender who happened to know a trans women - while she had a male expression - I  find it easy to use the 'she' on present discussion but memory wise I find it difficult to do so when talking about the past (it takes more mental efforts cuz that our mother language is Arabic meaning that there is also a 'You-female' and a 'you-male' and the 'verb' then is also affected by gender afterwards) and I guessi  hurt her every time I identify her with what I remember her in our mother language which would make every conversation less flount for me and need to opplogies every two three sentences :/  for non binary ppl we in Arabic also have 'they-female and they-male' so I am clueless what to call them in Arabic"

You have feelings and desires that you believe are ugly, wrong, scary... And you're taking it out on the very people you wish you could commune with. Maybe your area, community, city, whatever is a small town and intolerant, or is dominated by a majority of toxic masculinity in the environment. Maybe your friends, father and older brother beat you up, called you 'faggot', told you to quit being a 'pussy'. Maybe you couldn't get with girls (and didn't want to anyways), maybe you secretly tried it with a boy and it still wasn't quite right... Maybe you have known all along exactly what you wanted, but didn't have the words to describe the dynamic.  And maybe it's staring you RIGHT in the face, across your keyboard, coming from your desktop, or phone, or whatever device, and it SCARES THE HELL OUT OF YOU. Maybe all you want is to be with a trans man, woman, non-binary, etc. Maybe all you want is to become and identify as such. Maybe you're taking all of your confusion, angst, stress, bitterness, resentment and fear out on these people here that you so obviously and deliberately sought out, because of all of these things... Maybe you're just a fucking asshole. I wish you luck on your journey, but I can't abide your intolerant, combative, disgusting ravings, especially in this political climate where people are being bombed and gunned down because the man on the TV said 'be afraid. Be VERY AFRAID. THEY'RE HERE TO GET YOU! TO RAPE AND KILL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!' So I can't allow you spreading this hate...  Find yourself. Ok? I mean it. FIND YOURSELF. Be TRUE to yourself.

"Hmm this all seems unnecessarily complicated. I think it would be easier if people just acted however they wanted and were referred to by their appearance. I don‚Äôt understand why a pronoun is so important in offering so much security to ones identity. As far as I can tell, gender in current society is merely a categorization of personality, but I don‚Äôt see the necessity in categorizing personality. Just act as femininely or masculinely as you want without the label, and have your pronouns correspond with your appearance for convenience. To me it‚Äôs unnecessary to label your personality so to keeping pronouns simple makes the most sense. That‚Äôs just my 2 cents. Great video though! You are super talented :)"

"@ContraPoints. I agree with you on many points. I especially like how you used FACTS, making me not disagree with any of your points made in this video. However, I have some views regarding the use of pronouns, as well as the purpose of gender in today's society, that you (and many of your viewers) might disagree with. If you or anyone else want to reply, I expect a civil discussion.  Before I start, I just want to say that I am not (completely) against transgendered people. I think it's completely fine if someone biologically male or female chooses to act, dress, or behave like the opposite sex and identify as the opposite gender. I even used to believe that you cannot change your gender until a few months ago. However, I am against transexuals (which I won't be discussing in this comment). I also believe that pronouns should be used to refer to a person's biological sex instead.  If what you said about pronouns is true and that they refer to a person's gender, then I believe that it's definition should be changed like how the definition of marriage. Pronouns should refer to a person's sex. My reason for this is because: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF GENDER IN TODAY'S SOCIETY?  This has been a question that has got me thinking for a while. A person's gender may be relevant when gender roles were strictly imposed (man being the provider, woman being the nurturer; men enjoying sports, women enjoying fashion). Now, people are working more towards achieving gender equality. This means that the only purpose of gender in today's society (as far as I know) is to have a sense of 'belongingness', which I personally think is a poor reason for it to exist. I was born a girl and identify as a female, yet I like to do 'guy' things like sports, acting emotionless, roughing around from time to time, eating like a pig, and even women (I'm bisexual). Most of the time, I fit in more with the guys since I behave like them, yet I do not feel the need to identify as a guy because people nowadays are more willing to accept women enjoying guy stuff and behaving like them.  Which brings me back to my question, if there is nothing wrong with being born a boy or girl and there is nothing wrong with a boy liking girl stuff or a girl liking guy stuff, then why does the concept of gender still exist? I want a LOGICAL reason. Again, the sense of belongingness or connection is not a logical reason since nowadays, society is moving more towards a gender-equal (or rather sex-equal following my views) society and people don't care as much whether you choose to behave like your sex or the opposite gender.  On the other hand, a person's biological sex is way more important due to biological and medical reasons. For physical competitions, men have higher amounts of testosterone, giving them an unfair physical advantage. Doctors care more about a person's sex compared to their gender. A person's biological sex is still relevant in today's society, while gender is not, which is why I believe that pronouns should refer to a person's biological sex rather than gender.  Additionally, since gender is a spectrum and people could identify as whatever they are comfortable with (meaning not limited to the pronouns 'he' or 'she'), it makes pronouns even more useless if they are used to refer to a person's gender. I am aware that there are also other genetic codes other than XX or XY, so pronouns couldn't completely describe all of them, but at least those issues came from a birth defect, which are unfixable while gender dysphoria has ways of treatment (although I don't think transitioning is the correct way to treat it). There are also some cases where a person with a genetic defect may shows more signs towards a specific sex, making them easier to 'pronoun-ize'.  I also want to talk about why I don't support transexuals (not because I hate them), but I'll save it for another time since this comment is pretty long already. If you are interested, maybe just leave a reply."
"I disagree with the video - overall, it ignores the most important points of male/female distinctions, and just leaves too many counterpoints unanswered. The bottom line is that gender assignments in today's society is practically beneficial, and the 'cure' is worse than the disease. Just a few major points:  (1) Descriptive gender assignment works fine with the current gender assignment, because transgender procedures do not change the vast majority of sex-based features, of which looks are amongst the least important. Being able to have biological children (women) and having physical advantages and hormonal differences are some of the most important ones, from a societal standpoint.  If you could construct a surgery to change a man completely into a woman (with the aforementioned feminine features, and possibly others), it would make perfect sense to call that person a woman. The irony is that being able to do this would make pronouns completely irrelevant, since you'd be able to alter genes at will.   (2) Descriptive gender assignment works well in society in the vast majority of cases. To say that in a few cases, like being able to describe someone like Blaire by calling her 'she', is cherrypicking, and actually just illogical (if there's a feminine cis-man, and you can best describe him as 'she', you'd ironically be misgendering him, which I'm sure you're against - and since trans are <1% of the population, you'd probably make the misgendering much more often with your own rules).  What is not cherrypicking is the fact that most people are straight (gay 2%, trans <1%), and many of them want children with a viable partner - having this sex distinction is very beneficial here. In sports, it's clearly beneficial to women, as without this distinction, women's sports would be nonexistent.  The fact is that your XX or XY chromosome pair is a good practical indication of who you are.  Also, just because 'he' and 'she' existed before chromosomes were discovered does not mean they didn't exist, and don't heavily heavily correlate with sex-based features, which are a practical benefit, and so make the chromosomes (and other very heavy indicators of sex-based features, like genatalia) valuable - this was possibly the worst single argument in this video, which I had to mention.   I'm not even a fan of Shapiro, but I do not buy your arguments for pronouns over his. Like every single social construct, pronouns and the gender distinction that we currently have is a practical benefit - it is far, far from the alt-right to believe that men should not be playing women's sports (no matter what modern surgeries they've had), that people should be able to identify biological women/men by pronoun in dating situations, etc.   Again, and this can't be emphasized enough - these genderings are effective in the vast majority of cases, and ineffective in many, but a tiny fraction compared to the former. Getting rid of them in society would be nonsensical, and a travesty.  BTW, I am not against showing respect, on an individual basis, to a trans person by respecting their pronouns. This is from a societal standpoint that I'm arguing."

"Coming from a biochemistry student transgenderism is a medical condition recognised by medical professionals in the science field.

"22:38 this point is the entire reason I sometimes agree with the descriptive usage of he/she. Like just the other day (or this morning) I saw an article of a manly man identifying as a female, getting the world record for dead lift in womens category and then in interviews said 'its ridiculous how easy that was'  So my greatest issue with trans people who tell me to use specific pronouns that they dont biologically agree with, is that some of them dont ACT or LIVE like a trans person. They just want the attention and it is very troublesome and puts a bad name in for the rest of them that just want to be as miserable and sad like I already am."

"Prescribing the singular 'they' is not a practical solution for creating inclusivity.   Yes, other languages do not have a gendered singular pronoun. Many languages do not also have a different between 'in' and 'on' in their prepositions.   But it  would not be feasible for us to suddenly use 'on' for both meanings like a majority of languages do, just because they do.   Grammar functions such as singular and plural aren't really a conscious process. 'Function' words like pronouns, prepositions, etc. are used and processed differently in the brain than words with dictionary definitions.  It would be about as effective as trying to prescribe 'Sally and I' not 'Sally and me.' No matter how many times your English teacher told you not to say it, most of us still say Sally and me quite often.  While it may not be realistic to suddenly adopt a singular 'they' in our lifetime, we can absolutely change our societal relationship to grammatical 'gender.'"

There have been many instances where I have been unable to go along with a mentally ill family member's ideas because it was dangerous.  I understand that it seems real to them.  But it's not.  And I certainly will not address some wino in an alley as 'Your Royal Highness' unless they are, in fact, royalty.  I'll use a trans person's pronouns if it's more beneficial than harmful.  And voluntary speech is far superior to compelled speech which doesn't really have any value anyway.  Compelled speech is just a power game."

"Shapiro's own criterion is flawed, on its face, as he only accounts for two genetic karyotypes, with normal sex chromosomes XX and XY. That is not reality. There are people with XXY, XXX, and other variations. These people are collectively referred to as 'intersex' and are not male or female in terms of sex types. Intersex people are born roughly with the same frequency as people with red hair in the US. So.. No. Ben. You are full of shit. Sit the fuck down."

Then i got lost in the kinda meaninglessness in the overall world context ( i know it means the world to some people though :) ) though logic long dissertation. Trans women are trans women or biological men, lady boys like thais proudly accept themselves and so are u, and trans woman, not a woman. but it does have to do with vibe and looks. If ure 'nice' and look like a woman ill adress u as she even forcing myself to remember if necessary. That Zoe was neither. Again if ure niceee and u dont have to be and neither do i.  Theres no such thing as a gender nonbinary or we are all gender non binary. Either or.

Inevitably, I manage for a few sentences but then when I get animated I slip - and then you have to have the awkward apology that half the time (particularly if you are in the presence of people who are unfamiliar with everything LGBT-related) spirals into a whole separate discussion. This makes me feel worse, because I don't want to make the person feel uncomfortable or on the spot or like they have to defend themselves. I'm socially awkward enough that TBH, and I know this is bad, I'd rather just avoid people where it is an issue -  for their benefit and mine."

"As always, appreciate the Orochimaru theme song. Also, great video"
"This is probably one of her most clearly outlined arguments. There's a point she left really vague though that I feel could still weaken her overall argument: 'Trans women are women because we live the lives of women.' What exactly does it mean to live the life of a woman? That's still a hole in the argument.    I tend to agree with that line of reasoning, nevertheless. It's the same logic that leads me to reject modern made-up pronouns like 'xie' or 'fae'-- faux-nouns. The idea of pronouns is they represent a classification in the speakers mind that categorizes whatever third-party they're referring to. For made-up pronouns to refer to non binary folk, it's less concievable. Those pronouns don't relate to any particular 'category.' We simply don't have that social role of 'xie' in our society like we do 'she' or 'he,' and I hate to say it but it almost runs counter to our arguments that feminine pronouns are used BECAUSE trans-women live their lives as women, a pre-existing societal category.   And being non-binary myself, I also reject the use of 'they' to refer to me. He, when I'm presenting male, and She, when I'm presenting female. But 'They' denotes ambiguity. It imparts some kind of unfamiliarity which is too otherizing. But that's a different topic"

"I'm nonbinary, and I completely agree with your argument about presenting as a certain gender, because that's a big part of my identity, I've been subconsciously acting like neither a man or a woman years before I even knew what the term nonbinary was. I think children are more likely to base their pronouns off of how you act rather than how you look, because I was called a dude by some kids back when I had long hair. My goal isn't for every single person to ask others what their pronouns are, I just want to be accepted by my close friends and family, the later I unfortunately still don't have, but I'm getting there. Just let me suffer through high school without feeling like shit every time I'm grouped with the girls, thank you very much."

"As an expression, you're a fucking godess. Even if, in my opinion, you focus too much on the feminine transwomen gender expression during the video.

I mean woman usually refers to a biological woman, someone who was born a woman (including abnormalities, because they are sooo few and rare + it's not something the person can do anything about and also, being trans is not an abnormality) and can have had/has/ or should have had the capabilities to give birth. You fall nowhere in this, therefor the definition of a woman is not for you. But transwoman (still has woman in it, just for you!) seems far more appropiate."

"Contra it is logical to change a definition when the definition remains useful. Including men pretending to be women into the category of the definition of women does not make sense. Youi're rendering the word useless. Because you are literally saying that 'men pretending to be women should also be called women' and vice versa for women pretending to be men. That is making the definition useless. Whats the point of having the word 'Woman' if both men and women can be women. You're just removing the usefulness of the word."
"I agree somewhat with ur linguistical argument about he/she. But back in 500bc we didn't have transexual women/men, so men and women were still used to people, that were that sex. Sure there was crossdressers at some point during our thousands of years alive, but they again, trick people into thinking they are the opposite sex. They didnt say 'hey i want to be called sir' when they were ladies. He was still used towards men and she was still used to women, so your argument doesn't work. Because its definition has remained the same since then really. Its still HE towards men and SHE towards female, they never called the opposite sex another word ."
"@ContraPoints i like your approach, very reasonable. But i think what Ben means, is that you are not a real woman. And to claim you are a real woman is delusional. However, i doubt your family or friends would ever say 'hey man.' I mean i assume your family and friends respect and love you more than to do that. And when you go around looking and pretending to be a woman, you will be approached as such, because you're tricking other people in to believing that. And most people in business wants you to come back and buy more shit, they won't start by calling you sir, since you could be offended and not come back. And just watch all the twitter backlash for having the wrong opinion about trans nowadays. Tho you can probably find the 'ITS MAM!' joke on youtube of a guy in gamestop who keeps calling a trans woman 'sir' because the person does not in any shape or form, resemble a woman besides his wig, which even there you could argue its a guy with long hair.   You are using alot of makeup to get that look, if you walked around without any makeup whatsoever, you wouldn't look as feminine as you do. Not to be rude, but if you walk around with layers upon layers of makeup, you are bound to trick alot of people. Hell just watch asian dudes making really convincing female looks with makeup. Thats makeup for you, thats how you get people to look like monsters in movies or like two face in batman.   So no, we are not 'delusional' we are either family/friends that loves you, business owners that wants business or just people that thinks you are a woman because your 10 layers of makeup."

"As an enbie who is newly coming out, I find that even people I have fully come out to still default to female pronouns. People who only know me by my preferred name still use 'she' and 'her' even though I literally carry a book everywhere with a 'I use they/them pronouns' sticker on the cover. Short hair and androgynous fashion doesn't spare me from the misgendering because my voice (especially when I am feeling meek or awkward) is typically registered as female. It doesn't help that I still wear a silver heart necklace that has a lot of sentimental value to me and I'm too darn anxious to bother correcting people. My experiences along with my continued use of an oc very much inspired by myself back when I still presented as female makes everything disorienting. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm actually non-binary or if I'm just lying to myself despite feeling dysphoria just because I don't assert my gender identity enough. Most people (when talking about someone in person) default to using the gender binary even with people whose gender identities they do not know for absolute certain.  I can't say I know what being a trans man or trans woman is like, but I wonder if trans people have similar experiences. I wouldn't wish those experiences on anyone, though I can't stop asking myself if these feelings are normal or if I'm truly right to doubt my own gender identity.   Most people dismiss pronouns as 'just a word', but what they do not realize (or, at least, admit to themselves) is that the pronouns people use to describe a person has a real effect on their identity and psychology. Having the people around you deny a part of who you are can mess with a person's head. It can make them feel like a liar, a fool, a bandwagoner.   Pronouns are a sign of respect, validation, and acceptance. No one deserves to have those feelings robbed from them, no matter how heinous they might be. It's only common decency."

This is just how I see it though so I can't speak for anyone else, nonbinary, agender, or otherwise. It's a bit paradoxical but my 'gender' is, in a sense, the absence¬†of gender. A good way to think about it would be, if you were to list out all your qualities and traits that defined you, that made you YOU in order of how important that is to your identity, my sex assigned at birth as well as the concept of a gender identity is either at the bottom or not on the list at all. I don't *feel* like a man or a woman. I don't really feel anything internally pulling me towards one gender identity or another. I just feel like me. The problem is in trying to express how little perception of gender affects my identity I have to make a big show of how perception of gender affects my identity.

"I have a really hard time getting through these videos, but I'm trying to understand where leftists are coming from. I definitely disagree with my boy Ben Shapiro on this one. If someone looks like a woman, just say 'she'. The part that I whole-heartedly disagree with, regarding pronouns, is the use of 70+ different gender-identities. Two genders, we can handle that. But if I have to worry about offending someone because they want to be called zhe and I call them xer, I'm gonna go insane. I don't think we are at that point, but I fear that we will get there."

"I, as a non-binary person, agree when Ms. Points says that she wants people to assume that 'she' is the correct pronoun. Like I would love for people to call me 'they' automatically but it won't happen in this society. I wish there was a way to integrate cleanly into this current society, but apparently we'll have to make a change for us to fit and that's going to be disruptive anyway you want to have it. There's also trouble in asking people's pronouns that you'll put someone in a situation of possible outing themselves when they don't want to, random note.

"Ben's entire counterargument for the fact that adoptive parents are still called parents is that there are different 'contexts'. Well, there are different contexts when it comes to pronouns and gender. There times when the biological context might be most important. But there are also times when the biological context does not matter. Ben might have been able to use this argument if he only argued against transgender bathrooms. But the fact that he will only use the biological pronoun even in informal conversations would be the equivalent of always referring to adoptive parents as legal guardians. If he was talking to somebody who was adopted, he would have to refer to their parents as guardians to their face."

"I agree with the first half of the video, Ben Shapiro is a moron. However the second half of the video is where you start to lose me. I don't agree with the current notion of gender identity and expression as in I don't think that people should base their personal identity and how they express themselves on gender roles, I think a better solution would be to detach all the personality traits that are associated with a specific gender from that gender. I find it funny that the people that push the idea of gender identity tend to oppose gender roles but use gender roles to determine someone's identity, shouldn't we work on getting rid of cultural stigma by getting rid of gender roles. All gender pronouns should be based on is your anatomy and in the case of trans people your outer appearance, adding in gender identity and expression into the mix just makes the issue unnessesarily complicated and confusing because as far as I can tell you can choose by whatever metric you wish to be adressed be it biology, identity or expression making communication harder than it needs to be and even if there are slip ups from time to time who cares? If you detach personality traits from gender this type of situation is not as much of an issue as it is not an attack on your character or identity as it is only someone misunderstanding your gender which is only based on your anatomy and/or outer appearance. As far as identity and expression we already have terms to describe people's personality and traits such as smart, funny, charming, rude, hateful and terms used to describe expression such as fashionable, eccentric, unconventional, tasteless, crude and many many more. Is there any reason why these can't be the way we address someones identity and expression? My goal is not to deny or invalidate anyone's feelings or sense of identity, this is simply an alternative to the current idea present by Contrapoints and many others regarding gender."

I look forward to more of your videos and wish I personally knew a transgendered person who I could learn more from. I fear saying things that may be considered offensive out of ignorance, but that is never my intention."
"I do want to refute one of the lovely madam Contra's points. We do indeed have a third person singular pronoun 'they' we always have. When you see someone across the street in a body disguising cowl/robe combo you would say 'Wow that person over there is terrifying. THEY are disturbing to my very soul.' This is one of the words in our fixed pronoun lexicon. I know this because I asked one of my linguistics professors about the topic so I could better understand the debate. That is what she said. (Not the fantastic example though, that was all me)"

"Using Ben Shapiro as an example to represent all conservatives is pretty stupid, American conservatives are retards, I get it. I'd call you a she if you wanted to.

"if someone corrects me in a respectable way and ask me to use whatever pronoun ill respect it, it might take a little to use the one they identify as.

"You sound like an effeminate Mickey Mouse. You are what you are, but I'll call you what you look like... unless I feel confused looking at you, I'll just avoid using any pronouns. You cant change that, and I wont ask people what their pronouns are, there's no need to overcomplicate things with new words. It should really just come down to your genitalia."
"Here's my random internet person opinion:  People should not care what others call them or what they call others. Changing what people are called based on a select group of stereotypical traits (feminine and/or masculine) actually reinforces gender roles and restricts people's creativity and individuality.    I don't really like this mentality of:  If a man wants to wear dresses and makeup and likes playing with dolls, he is a she. If a girl likes working out, being brave, or not wearing makeup, she is a he. Because this mentality in practice: assigns certain traits to gender rather than the individual, ostracizes traits that are not a part of the group, and socially favors those who force themselves into the traits of their chosen group (regardless if that is how they really feel). People seem to want to change gender because they like the idea of a 'man' or the idea of a 'woman' they want to be, and I understand that feeling but: no matter how nuanced these perceptions are, it still says something in the subtext: I'm a man. A man can't be sassy, hang out with the girls, or wear makeup without looking gay and dumb-- so, I must become a woman to do those things. By saying and acting out these feelings, you restrict what a biological man or woman can do. Everything else is weird. Everything else is other.   Ya feel me, Youtube?"
"To be fair, the singular 'they' does already exist in English, in certain usages, e.g. 'There's someone at the door, let's see what they want.' So all that's at steak is the need to expand that usage, albeit not by much, given that the example given is someone recognising the unknown gender of a single individual, and now we might use it to recognise the unstated gender of a single individual."

Gender neutral pronouns felt right. i don't feel like a chick and i don't feel like a dude, i just am what i am. i also have a sensory processing disorder so how i present myself is also dependent on comfort over style a lot of the time. presenting as more masculine or feminine generally isn't a conscious decision for me since i tend to favor texture and patterns over anything else."

"In the Blair x Ben discussion he ignores the part where he agreed with the adoptivePARENTS and it just needed to be distinguished. You can apply that to transgender as well, when distinguishing we go from woman to transWOMAN or man to transMAN.

"6:40  I believe this is a fallacious argument. The premise I take issue with is 'Because gender specific pronouns predate scientific knowledge of chromosomes, they cannot be based on them.'  I take issue with this premise because its the exact same thing Shapiro is arguing, but from the other direction: That words cannot evolve or take on new meaning or definitions even in a prescriptive manner.   If we take the words him/hers, the easiest way to define them is 'Third person pronoun referent to sex.'   Ben Shapiro argues that him/her doesn't refer to perceived/presented gender, only biological. Natalie Wynn argues that him/her doesn't refer to biological gender, only perceived/presented.  Neither is actually arguing the word from a prescriptive stance. The idea of a word having a 'correct' usage requires that all possible perspective be removed from the word.   10:25  This is also fallacious, because the words 'beget' and 'offspring' are not specifically referent to a biological child. The other listed definitions include 'to give rise to.' and 'to be the product of something.' To argue that 'parent' specifically refers to direct biological lineage in the prescriptive sense of the word is at best, reductive.   I'd just like to point out that, flawed logic or not, she's still right. An adoptive parent assumes the same roles and activities as a reproductive parent, it just depends when and what the child's needs are. An adoptive parent who never changed a diaper because they met their child when they were out of diapers, still has many more years of caring for this child in one capacity or another.   As the average white guy in the room can someone tell me what is the accepted vernacular concerning the words 'sex' and 'gender'? I understand in this community that the words sex and gender are not homonyms, but still seem interchangeable. Which refers to genetics, and which refers to presentation/identification?"
"You said that you would use anything they choose 'as long as it's reasonable'. I think this is the biggest problem. To me, it simply doesn't seem reasonable not to have any gender. Or, for that matter, to identify as a wolf or an apache helicopter. Everyone's got to draw the line somewhere and that means that there will always be someone who is left out, because their identification is so wild, noone will call it 'reasonable'. I'm going to say the pronoun which seems most adequate to a person's appearance. If they ask me to use something else, I might do so. If they demand it, I might not. If they claim not to even be human, I will not submit to tolerating something that is clearly, scientifically, demonstrably false."
"We need words to describe things that are in the world in a way that is meaningful to the people that relate to these things. And if a person looks like a woman, talks like a woman and wishes to be treated like a woman, the only meaningful way to address or refer to that person, would be AS a woman. I for one am inclined to respect the effort."

"Wait, if gender can only be defined by chromosomes and not by how a person looks like, how can we be sure that Ben Shapiro is not secretly a transgender? He may look like a guy but I've never seen his chromosomes... coincidence?"

"So ... technically the descriptivist argument doesn't work. Like, I'm on your side and everything, but descriptivism means describing language as it is used. And while is it absolutely true that most people would refer to someone who appears to be and identifies as a woman using 'she', if Ben Shapiro decides he'll use his microbiology glasses to figure out people's pronouns and refer to them by what their chromosomes determine, that would be how he uses language and therefore correct in a descriptivist setting. (Same goes btw for his use of 'a she', it might be ungrammatical for you, but as a native speaker of the English language, we have to trust his intuition which tells him that this is grammatical. In fact, using descriptivism, we can never tell a native speaker of a language that their way of speaking that language is wrong or ungrammatical) So yeah the descriptivism argument isn't really doing you any good here. Whenever you are discussing the use of a word, you need to use a prescriptivist approach, otherwise your argument falls flat right from the beginning. You could merely point out that people find that word offensive. Which won't get you very far with people who don't agree with you in the first place. You also called a dictionary a 'higher authority' which is also not true. Dictionaries are descriptive works. They do not put an inate value or judgement on a word. If a certain definition of a word isn't in a dictionary, that doesn't mean that that definition is wrong for that word, but merely that the dictionary either has fallen behind on that meaning (or that that use is very infrequent). In other words, you can only use a dictionary to say 'I am right, because my use of this word is defined in this dictionary.' you can't use it to say 'You are wrong, bc your use of this word isn't defined in this dictionary.' I hope I could help and provide some insight. I really enjoy your videos."
"First video I've seen on this channel and my goodness she's wonderful. Keep it up!"
"As an anti-sjw liberal, I agreed with some parts of the video but some were a bit cringeworthy. Like the part when you criticized the idea of being civil. Being civil in conversation is pretty much the only way you can convince someone to change their opinion, it might not work always, but there are no better alternatives. Now I don't think Ben is ever going to change his views, but there are a lot more people out there who are open for it. And sometimes it takes time. Correct me if I misunderstood your point. I do think what you identify as is more important than biology in day to day life. If someone looks like a woman, acts like a woman, thinks like a woman but is trans they are still a woman in every relevant sense (with the exception of some circumstances) so I don't see why they should not be treated as such. Sometimes people are born with brains that are more similar to the opposite sex's, and since our brain is where all our thoughts, feeling and cosciousness lies it matters much more than what one is biologically. Also, I don't agree with Ben Shapiros point that you are lying. If I were to say 'I'm only going to refer to biological females as she' and then refer to a trans woman as she I would be lying, but I've never made that claim so I'm not lying. And most people never explicitly make that claim. Anyway, I think you explained yourself pretty well at the end. Thats about all I have to say."

"I'll try and take it a step up from Ben's refusal to accomodate and your angle of technical definitions: Isn't this more about his freedom of association and you ignoring that transgenderism is an abnormality/forever tiny part of society?  I'm not trying to be rude with that last part, my point is that it goes out of bounds of reason to expect people to conform to your standards when this is a fairly rare thing (you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's like one in two hundred people? I doubt it'd ever reach 1% on average).   I'm not saying it's hard to accomodate or understand, I'm not apologizing for Ben being rude, I'm not saying being mean or not willing to understand transgender people is okay, but I am questioning whether expectations of people being openminded to the point where transpeople are accepted as an obvious and normal part of society one day is realistic. I'd like for it to be that way, but personally I don't think it's realistic or reasonable. We'd ideally want to have a tolerant society, right? But tolerance towards victims doesn't seem to be the ideal goal as much as tolerance towards the ignorant and bigoted people. If you can be tolerant of those and live side by side with them, then that'll do a lot more to help society in the long run, with the assumption that it might eventually help convince them and that you might learn to live with people who don't agree with you on everything or even anything (beyond very basic rules of law etc).  If anyone responds to this, please don't boil down my argument to 'there are too few to be bothered to be mindful of', my point is more about being tolerant of *eachother*. To be fair, there's quite a lot of activism that is accusatory and tries to shame people and it's a tactic that I find entirely counterproductive. You can't fix people being stubborn, intolerant or stupid, but you can work them over slowly."
"What is a ‚Äúgender-related characteristic‚Äù? It implies that a tomboy who loves sports is not a girl interested in stereotypically boyish things, but possibly a boy trapped in a female body. And a boy with a penchant for Barbies and Kens is possibly a trans girl ‚Äî because, according to stereotypes, he‚Äôs behaving as a girl would. So instead of enlarging our understanding of gender expression ‚Äî and allowing maximal freedom and variety within both sexes ‚Äî the concept of ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù actually narrows it, in more traditional and even regressive ways. What does ‚Äúgender-related mannerisms‚Äù mean, if not stereotypes? It‚Äôs no accident that some of the most homophobic societies, like Iran, for example, are big proponents of sex-reassignment surgery for gender-nonconforming kids and adults (the government even pays for it) while being homosexual warrants the death penalty. Assuming that a non-stereotypical kid is trans rather than gay is, in fact, dangerously close to this worldview."

"Laws shouldn't be judged by their implementation they should be judged on their content. Your argument that just because not every aspect of a piece of law hasn't been enforced to date means that concern over its ability to is unjustifiable is short sided. In our society we use an uncaring legal system which is devoid of a moral code and only implements laws based on their legal qualifications. So I don't think its unreasonable to be concerned over the prescient that a law sets even if it has yet to be enforced. I believe it is very likely that this tactic of setting a legal president without intention of immediate full implementation has been used before, though I am not privileged to any specific example.  I would like to close by saying that this is in no way a statement defending anyone position, merely a logical deference as to why concern is potentially justifiable. Also if your going to attack my argument please make it about the content of my argument not whether or not its grammatically correct."

I don't want to guess what you identify as because I might get it wrong, and some people absolutely lose their shit over it. This makes meeting someone for the first time awkward. Asking them seems rude. I hate using ' they' singular. It doesn't work that well, and it kinda seems disrespectful. And guessing the pronoun by their appearance seems like a gamble. Case in point, that whole fiasco with the trans person at GameStop. I would have called them sir. That person was not doing very well at being a 'maam' so how were the employees supposed to know? Lastly, didn't California ban 'him' and 'her'? That's just going too far. Even the Judge that passed that couldn't do it. Lastly, I feel like you guys should agree among yourselves what's okay and not okay before losing it over someone misgendering you.

"I'm fine with Ben wanting to call people by their chromosomes. Who am I to call her by anything else than she wants me to call her by, so I'll treat Bennie like the lady that she is, until she proves she has a Y-chromosome in there somewhere. I just assume she's lying about her gender. Projection seems like a theme with her, so it makes sense to extrapolate that to everything she says.  Also, they and them is confusing. It usually refers to a non specific person or multiple people, not to one specific person. I would have a hard time calling someone by a pronoun that feels so vague. I wouldn't feel like I am respecting someone's wishes at all but quite the opposite. On top of that, in my native language they and she are the same word: ze. So that wouldn't just get jumbled up and get even more confusing. So unless there are better pronouns, I would just ask which come closest to what they identify as and use that. Besides, I'm far more interested in the why than the what. I'd call you this and that if you give my sufficient reason to and I don't feel compromised in my respect towards you. Or if you're an asshole like Ben of course :p But that's beside the point :p I find my sincerity more important than other people's wishes."

This does sometimes lead me to mess up because after years of using one pronoun, and still using it 80% of the time.

I still think her views can be awful and hell, Ben Calls Women Men Shapiro managed to learn almost nothing from the diplomacy and patient explanations."
"I'm not even sure why 'trans' people even refer to themselves as trans.  A trans man is a man and a trans woman is a women.  The qualifier isn't necessary (except perhaps to Doctors or medical staff).  Using the qualifier implies they are not fully what they are, and to some what they will never be.  Why is the biology even relevant in most situations?  Male pattern baldness is also biological (and can have severe psychological effects on some).  If I take steps to correct that, I don't start calling myself 'Implant-man' or 'Minoxidil-man'.  If I choose to correct a flaw in my biology to be healthy and happier, the steps I took and why are no-ones business but mine."
"Got Manlet Ben shap ad to this vid, wtf YouTube"
"I feel this allot because I'm also a trans-person who mostly just feels like garbage"
"Just catching up on this, and I just got to say that one thing about the use of 'they' as a non-gendered singular pronoun has very, VERY strong historical precedence due to the changes .  The word 'you' is currently used as both the singular and the plural second-person pronoun, and has been used as such for centuries now, with even people currently adding qualifiers such as 'you all' or 'you people' in order to clarify when it is used as a plural.  This is grammatically incorrect by the original usage of the pronoun.  The pronoun 'thou' is the singular second-person pronoun, and 'you' is plural form.  If someone has an issue with the modern use of 'they,' then that person should also have an issue with the modern use of 'you' and the lack of use of 'thou.'  This shows that our language is fluid and has always changed through usage, and it also gives you (the plural you) a fun sticking point to assholes who don't want to use 'they' as a non-gendered singular pronoun, as you can rightfully demand that person use the pronoun 'thou' when they speak."

I don't understand why I should be legally required to affirm that I believe a person has actually changed sex, because for me it's on a par with being legally required to believe God exists.

"In my language (Portuguese), as in a lot of tongues that originated from Latin, the pronoun 'they' doesn't exist. Everything is either female or male. A strawberry is a he, a statue is a she, ect. I wonder how non-binary people would handle that sort of language ground rule."
"A good video, a strong, logical argument, undeniable against the objections that Ben Shapiro has risen, but it's still fatally flawed. It doesn't account for the importance of language in one's own ability to think and the fact that people who don't use the pronouns you'd prefer aren't simply disagreeing linguistically, but are disagreeing based on a worldview that actively disapproves of the connotations of the belief that a man can become a woman (or was always a woman) Now, that can be argued, I know where I stand on the issue, but were I to use 'She' in reference to you it would be a tacit acceptance of the belief that you are actually a woman. One can argue the definition of being a woman, as you do but when referring to a 'woman' but then you come down to which definition should be adopted by each individual, and of course the answer to that question is down solely to that individual. When you speak of being a woman, correct me if i'm wrong, but you mean socially, whereas I would mean biologically.   Basically, its not merely about language, it's about ideology, to refer to you using female gendered pronouns would be to capitulate to an ideology that i don't agree with, it's not from hate, but I suppose it is a battle between two conflicting worldviews. You do all you can to propagate yours and i'll do all I can do to propagate mine, we'll both win and lose at times but as people don't have ideas, ideas have people, it's not an argument that will ever be settled."

"So just call people what they want you to call them.  If you got it wrong, don't apologize because you're not Professor X. Just say, oh, then continue.  If someone accidentally got it wrong more than once, the trans person should just ignore it and not make a huge fuss about it. Because not only that this shit is impossible to get right if it wasn't by pure chance, it will also strengthen the narrative against trans people. Like in the case of Tiffany Moore¬†who has an anger issue."

"I would argue that hormones, in this argument of gender by biology, are what determine your sexual characteristics, anatomy, and for certain people, your gender. People with Swyer syndrome have xy chromosomes but have gonads that are non functional and don't secrete testosterone or AMH in this developmental stage, and therefore form internal female organs: vagina, Fallopian tubes, uterus. With estrogen hormones administered during puberty they develop secondary female characteristics such as breasts and have periods. And if a fertilized egg is donated they can give birth to a child... but have xy chromosomes.   Please note I myself have a much more liberal interpretation of gender and would call someone by whatever the hell they want. But if you encounter anyone like Ben Shapiro, inform them about Swyer syndrome, and ask how they would refer the them, as a man, or woman. I would love to know."

Pronouns will lost all meaning or be a adjective like fat or skinny. Laws will have to change quick to keep up. Or maybe we need to take a leaf form the mandarin language and not have them. This has change in my life time with rename shit like man-hole cover to person-hole cover. But if you think words have greater power then the idea or meaning.

But if you are in denial... it's not my problem... unless it is. But I don't get personal enough for that to usually factor in.   In any case I refer to 90% of people as 'hey, you over there.', so it really isn't an issue to me at all.  If I'm being compelled to refer to anyone as anything (doesn't matter who they are) I'll probably just refer to them as a 'shit head' whilst telling them to 'fuck off'. But lets be honest. When the hell does that ever happen? Only time it's ever happened to me is when some authoritarian dude asked me to refer to them as 'Sir' and you can refer to the above to know how I responded.  So idk. Am I good? I don't claim to be a civilized person, or even nice for that matter."
"It seems you're making a drastic separation between social and biological contexts even though they often overlap. Trans women/men and women/men aren't the same in every social context. For example, wouldn't using the biological pronouns be correct in the social context of dating? I know it would be important to me. I.e. on my dating profile when I say I only date 'men' or 'women' I mean in the biological role. Would it be transphobic for me to make this distinction? Also your analogy for the social role of parenting and the biological role was an interesting one but I think if you pressed most adoptive parents they wouldn't actually believe they weren't technically guardians but trans people believe they are 100% the opposite gender."
"All I learnt from this video is that Natalie would be down to fuck her former male-self."
"I'm all for non-binary as a concept. Smash the stupid concept of gender altogether - clearly it hurts people a lot feeling like they have to look or act a certain way. Heck, the fact that you're so mentally free as to feel it's your right to change your gender, to wear and act out what you want, but still feel completely confined to this artificial binary and live in fear of how someone's going to mis-identify where you belong in that spectrum... isn't that evidence enough to declare the whole system FUBAR?"
""
"I have a hard time understanding how someone can be 'woke' on the flawed system that is gender and how we express it but still care which pronoun someone uses on them. How can one remain so heavily invested in a system that's so clearly flawed? Just be yourself and let people mis-identify as they will. It neither erases your identity nor bars you from being who you are. Why don't we just shed the psychological shackles already?"
""
"Maybe it's just my gender nihilism spreading to general nihilism, but it's my opinion that if someone's opinion of me is rude and off-base, I should probably care as much about their dumb opinion as they've shown to care about me. For 99% of mis-genderings, that's zero."
"Can anyone explain this generations obsession with gender, pronouns and identity in general? Gender, sexual, racial, national, cultural, religious, ideological, political...so many fucking identities. Whatever happened to the eternal wisdom of Mewtwo in Pok√©mon the First Movie?  'I realize now that the circumstances of ones birth are IRRELEVANT, it is what you *DO* with the gift of life that determines *WHO YOU ARE*.'   All of this sounds more like a massive, collective societal identity crisis to me than anything else. What society really needs is to stop pouring fluoride in the water and start pouring liquid Psylocybin into it, see through all the bullshit lol."

"Ain't 'Sir' both gender? At least I seen sir use for females in a high position before as form of respect. But I suppose it don't count in this context. Since weird to refer a female customer as sir."
"Goddammit, the part about adopted family is so upsetting to me.  As an adoptee who have never met his biological parents, I have a not-so-pristine relationship with the only woman I ever called 'mom'. But, at the same time, I have also accepted that familial bond is purely determined on emotional connection and NOT genetical similarity!  And then, we have assholes like Ben-Ben and Blaire who are so obsessed with corporeality, not only they are massive transphobes, they are also willing to dismiss any sincere emotional bondings that occur between adopted parents and adopted children."
"Is thinking your previous self is sexy considered incest..?"
"You was a cute twink, just sayin. As a gay man..."
"I love your videos. I've learned and laughed a lot. I have a question though.   How would you feel if we all called each other 'they' (as in, the singular third-person pronoun)? Is it offensive to want to call/gender every person as 'they'?  I just feel like it is so much easier to just get rid of both 'he' and 'she' and just start calling each other 'they'. Is this problematic? Is this wrong? Although I identify as a cis male, I wouldn't mind being called 'they' because it shows me that they respect my gender identity enough to not get it wrong, but also that they know that they don't have all the time in the world to find out each person's pronouns, especially mine.  If someone calls me or you 'they' even after I tell them my pronouns, I think it is misgendering, in a way, but I also think it's just a progressive movement towards getting rid of gender-specific pronouns, so I'm not necessarily offended, just taken aback. In many languages, there are singular, third-person pronouns, like in Tagalog and Bisaya/Cebuano (two major Philippine languages): Siya/Niya/etc. As well, 'thou' used to be the singular, second-person pronoun, and soon it went out of use (apparently because 'thou' started sounding too impolite and too informal, but no one really knows). We got rid of 'thou' (not completely, but basically) because it got old, and I think 'he' and 'she' are getting old as well: should we soon get rid of 'he' and 'she' in order to just be respectful to all genders but also freely lazy to learn people's genders, etc.?  That's all I have, I guess. Your videos are amazing and hilarious, and I like sharing it with friends and others. Thank you!"

"Fuck, throughout the video I really wished you would help me out a bit to understand nonbinary people, but no luck. I don't even know how I'm supposed to describe the situation because 'sister' is apparently a bad word, but still carries relevant information that 'sibling' cannot. I did enjoy your points on pronouns, the difference between identity and expression etc. Not a fan of your style really, and I'm not on your 'side' really I guess (not for gender and all that, more the media censorship, racism etc.), but this was a great video."

"Those fucking nails!!!!!!!!!!"
"As a linguistics graduate and lexicographer-in-training, I have a couple of remarks concerning this video."
""
"1. Words, or lexical items, can be polysemous. It is perfectly possible to mean ¬¥sex¬¥ in one context and the ¬¥gender¬¥ in the other, or even use more finely-grained distinctions. And the examples given in the Blair vs Ben discussion showcase that."
"2. One has to remember that descriptive and prescriptive refer to grammar as used by a language community and"
"not single people. The paradigm for lexicographers and linguistists is to be descriptive. So, in the case of the former one has to look at a lot of data of actual language usage representative of community in which the language is used and see what meaning(s) people make in relation to those pronouns. Democratic expression should sort things out."
"There is more to be said about language, gender, and how we make meanings but that¬¥s enough for one comment."
""
"I really like your channel and just wanted to provide a constructive perspective :)"
""
"Best"
"PS There¬¥s also the proscriptive approach."
"off topic but i wish i was half as pretty as you areüòçüòçur gorgeous"
"I really like your hair and nails in this one. Very creative."
"Interesting video. Thought provoking."
"I didnt know you were trans! Im a nonbinary trans woman and I always see your vids in my recommended, I'm glad I finally clicked on one. I'm so in love with your style of comedy, and the way you stay level headed on these rough issues. Subscribed and hit the notification bell. Stay wonderful. That 'good girl dont stop' bit killed me."
"Even if you don‚Äôt agree with transgenderism or non-binaryism just be polite. There was this absolute twat in the comments the other day talking about how funny it was that he was pissing off a trans woman by calling her a man the entire day. I‚Äôm like, just be nice you‚Äôre not getting any points across you‚Äôre just being a dick."
"I think burning the flag falls into bad taste >n<"
"Any kinds of pronouns are great to me. I'm trying to understand right now as well, but I'm finding it incredibly difficult. Most things I can keep up with, but using multiple sets of pronouns for a single person is super tricky for me. Maybe it's cause I'm super tired while watching this but my brain has trouble absorbing that concept üòÖ. I'll go check out those non-binary channels you mentioned, though. Never expected to be educated by a single channel, time to branch out :P"
"This. Is. Genius!"
"Of course pronouns are linked to biological gender, because beings of the same species can tell whether they're male or female...and therefore know how to express that distinction in language just by sight alone. You don't need to discover the exact biological marker that determines gender to prove that males and females distinctly exist. The only reason it's even remotely difficult to determine a random person's gender sometimes is because of heavy makeup, clothing they're wearing that obscures their build a lot, or years upon years of unnatural hormone therapy. Sorry I didn't watch more than the 30 seconds that claimed this in the video but holy shit was that mind blowingly stupid to say that pronouns predate the discovery of chromosomes, therefore pronouns aren't associated with gender. Did I miss some sarcasm or something?"

"'AS A TRANS WOMAN' BITCH I DIEDDDDDD"
"Natalie, interesting video. I think it drags on a little too long. Shapiro (and others on the religious right) continue to make straw man arguments when it comes to trans/non-binary folks. Their argument stems from the principle belief that a transman looks between his legs and sees a penis, when there's a really a vagina. Vice-verse for a transwoman. Shapiro believes that calling Chaz Bono a 'he' and Caitlyn Jenner a 'she' is feeding into their delusional belief about their biological sex.     The irony of the situation is that Blaire White, Dr. Drew, and others have explained to him, that gender is about cultural differences and brain structures. It's not about their chromosomes or the sex organ/s they were born with, and they are well aware of their biology. The countless examples you gave about the complex natural of gender are 100% on the money.   I believe the true underlining problem is religion. Shaprio is an Orthodox Jew, and believes very strict gender structures. As in, God made you're a man, and those wishes by God cannot be changed or altered by personal feelings.   Now I for one, am under the belief that Shapiro should be permitted to call somebody by whatever gender pronoun he wants or refrain from gender pronouns, as he indicated with Rogan. What is troublesome is his belief about others views on gender vs. sex."
"this is smth thats always been wild to me, as a nonbinary lesbian who's also in the sciences. I do know someone who's mother has Turner syndrome (single X chromosome karyotype) and there are many cases of chromosomes which are not simply XX or XY. going by the argument of 'your chromosomes dictate what you should be called' not only is stupid lol bc you'd have to scan the genes of literally everyone to call them anything, but you'd also need to make up new sets of pronouns to use for people. which Ben shapiro already hates. and then there are people w Sywer syndrome (XY individuals born with a vagina, uterus etc) and 'XX males' (born with a penis and testes) who get assigned female and male at birth respectively bc of their genitals & in the case of the latter, can theoretically never find out and live life as a cis man w xx chromosomes. facts don't care about your feelings Ben, and it's a fact that human existence is complex - how we define 'biological sex' right now is socially constructed and geneticists have been proposing a review, and gender is just made up entirely."
"16:07 I searched for it."
"Idk why but I expected this video to be about proper nouns and why -some people- Americans are prone to randomly capitalising words.  Ik the title says pronouns, I still expected proper nouns though. I feel as though I've been blind sided by gender politics here."
"The right realise that Shapiro is a jew, right? They, uhh.. they know Shapiro is one of ((them)) ?"
"I was actually ready to disagree, but then she hit me with that logic."
"can we agree to refer to ben shapiro as 'she' to make a point. like, dont question the logic behind it, there is none, just calling ben a pronoun that she isn't comfortable with."
"I legit thought you were an intelligent person right up until you made the assertion that Courtney Act is more beautiful than you. I mean what the fuck lady, get outtaaaa here."

"I don't have strong opinions on the whole he/she thing but I do think it is important society sets a clear distinction between words to describe either sex and gender. Using male/female, man/woman, masculine/feminine to describe both just needlessly makes gender dysphoria sound illegitimate. For example a trans woman is not female, and never will be, despite identifying with the feminine gender and modifying her body to have more biologically female characteristics. You could argue that once hormone therapy modifies her body to the extent she has breasts etc she is superficially slightly intersex, but until she grows ovaries and switches chromosomes through a gene therapy, she is a male woman (if we decide woman refers to gender rather than sex)."
"Oh my GOD it‚Äôs Riley! *sobs*"
"LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND I'LL SHOW YOU A SIR"
"I feel like I'm at a weird crossroads at this point in time. I'm learning more and more about other people's experiences everyday. Evolving my thought process from a very strict one to one that includes the multi layered, multi colored array of experiences out there. I'm not going to lie, if I had found Ben Shapiro and his band of degenerates instead of a the lovely degenerates I follow now, I would've been a much worse person. At least according to myself. My social seclusion helped me in that case. I'm really glad I found your channel and that my ADHD ass got ensnared by all the colors. You've help me find more information about the wide world and helping spur thought process that make me see the world differently. Thank you."
"Facts don't care about your feelings. For example, evolution is a fact."
"Has anyone who's 'debated' with Ben just constantly called him by she/her to his face? Not sure how much it'd achieve as a point, but it'd be somewhat satisfying to just consistently ignore the pronouns he prefers to go by. If he can talk to a transwoman and think it's within his right to call her a 'him', then surely it's within her right to call him a her despite it being against his wishes."
"Why can't 'they' just be a homograph who's definitions are 'used to refer to 2 or more people or objects which are easily identified' and 'used to refer to one person without the specification of gender'"
"Oh my god I want to be friends with her in real life."

"29:26 A glimpse at her true personality; a goofy depressed baby."
"I dunno ContraPoints.There's logic to what you're saying but it's also kinda disingenuous. Just because language evolves earlier than science doesn't mean that pronouns don't refer to biological identity."
"I'll use w/e pronoun someone wants but i must be referred to as mastershake in return"
"Ur fkn grate!"
"The 'futch scale' isn't a real thing.  It was a joke created by lesbians"
"Definition of marriage and parents can change but a definition of an apple will always remain the same, if you referred to it as grape you'd be wrong. When I look at you or when I look at transgenders, I CAN TELL that they were not born a woman. There are clear distinctions between a born woman and a transgender on estrogen - you can't deny that. Look they want to be a woman badly they've gone through what is irreversible and even after that they still don't quite look like a woman and it's crushing for them to hear it, I get it - but fact of the matter is a trans looking person is not what anybody imagines when they think of 'a woman'."
"Fan of Ben Shapiro's view of Politics, I couldn't care less about his views of Pronouns.  This video is extremely well thought out, thank you for stopping me from falling into the trap of many other Ben Shapiro fans. However, I will continue to watch Ben Shapiro for his views on US politics, regardless of how well thought out this video is, I just wanted to mention a quick thanks for getting me to challenge my own views."
"Every one of these videos is a work of art. Really digging the palette."
"My first language is gendered, that means that every animal, object and noun are either female or male. By Shappiro's logic it means spoons have XX chromosomes and tables have XY chromosomes."
"uuuhhhhhhh idk if this is something just local for my PC/browser but some of your videos are for some reason translated to swedish for me :0   like idk why but it is this one and the incel one where the title and description are swedish, have anyone else seen that glitch(?) or is it something Contra did herself?"

And almost all words are gender neutral, unless you emphasize that you are referring to a male/female in that situation.... (like in professions, eg. teacher, female teacher) It can be confusing sometimes, but no pronoun-wars.."
"It's so true that we just give people pronouns based on what they appear to be to us.   Side note it's really hard in Black South African culture due to us being taught at a young age to add on gender defining 'honorifics' while speaking to someone, it's so easy to put your foot in your mouth if you can't decide right between bhuti (male) or sisi (female)"

"The first video of yours I watched was mirrored on Shaun's channel. I honestly couldn't tell what your gender was (this is partially due to me being bad at identifying even cis people's genders) but I'm excited to learn that you're a trans woman. I support trans people but I struggle to understand their experience. It's helped that I now know a few trans men but I've never met a trans woman (at least not yet). I'm glad to know I have easy access to information on the trans woman experience"

I don‚Äôt know to much about Ben Shapiro but I would feel deceived  (and rather ill)  if after a random hook up i found out that the person was not being forthcoming about there transgendered state. Transgender culture to me is a symptom of a society that has been over sexualized to where shock and awe tactics are the only ways for some to get off... and thats perverted. Having said that, I got to know a transgender person in highschool because we had a lot of classes together. I saw the transformation happen and it made me sad to think that people would feel so conflicted about there sexuality. Our problem in America is that we use sex to sell everything, and then slut shame at everyone. Transgender culture seams like a harmonic to this fundamental poor sexual condition. Either way, be well."

"There's a very interesting video in this topic. Is by a youtuber called Innuendo Studios. He does a series called 'The Alt Right Playbook' disecting various techniques and methods by the alt right this days. One of the episodes is called 'Mainstreaming', talks about the case of Samuel R. Delany (Fans of science fiction knows who he is) being a gay person in the conservative society of the 60's. Back then being an LGBT comunity member and the word 'gay' it was used in a more narrow way just to describe homosexuals with a very femenine attitude, using flashy colors, long hair, make up, stuff like that. Delany is far from that arquetype, he have tatoos, a very long beard, short hair, dress in a very sober way with very little color, you get the idea."
""
"The point is that in his younger years Delany did feel alienated cause he didn't have a way to describe himself as a gay person without being kinda missplaced (Queer, faggot and other terms were there but were very offensive) and the narrative (being gay back then was consideer a disease) painted by society made hard for anyone to talk openly about their homosexuality without enforcing bad stereotypes of the community. Delany talk on one of his books about of the sexual revolution in the 60's helped to shape new terms for marginalized groups and the broading usage of it made easier for them to talk about the LGBT comunity without the feel of alienation that he had prior."
""
"This idea is a principle that could be used in this case. Now a days trans people is alienated in many ways, but one of the main ones is languaje. Is a she? a he? if he was born a man, then had an operation to be a woman but likes boy is gay? is complex i know and i try my best to understand how works for trans people and don't judge about it. But assholes like Ben use languaje as a subtle way to discriminate and alienate them (Suddenly the jew that thinks homosexuality is a sin and uses a Kippah is worried about science, evidence and genre) in the same manner people did in Delany's young years in the early 60's."

"I find it really strange that English speakers get their knickers in a twist about using 'they' as a singular and a plural when we do it with 'you' all the time. Like you don't hear people get angry about whether you used the word 'you'  to refer to a group or an individual. They might ask you for clarification, sure. But it's not something people get mad about.  Also, trying to establish grammar rules in English is kind of hilarious, considering it's a combo of a ton of different languages with different grammatical systems. For example we still use cases AND sentence structure to denote the function of words. Hell, we have loan words from Old West Norse, where they have a specific pronoun for a group of two. And Old English, where they have words that are DELIBERATELY ambiguous (like 'awful')  because the Anglo Saxons loved complex epic poetry and riddles. The whole of the English language is a  grammatic mess, and that's kind of what makes it beautiful. We should be embracing new uses of language, not stifling them.   Medieval linguist out. Xx"

"The origins of He and she are from anglo-saxon He (masculine pronoun) and Heo (feminine pronoun). But like any other language with gendered nouns these apply to all nouns (as far as I'm aware, I'm not an aglo-saxon scholar). Not only does this apply to inanimate objects but animals are gendered by species so even the karyotype sex of an animal is not relevant to the pronoun used to describe the animal. Tell Shapiro he's at odd with the anglo-saxon origins of the language, pretty sure his head would explode from the paradox like a cartoon robot."

Thank you for all your amazing work and divulgation."
"Language is the attempt to express the experienced world and includes information.  Gender related pronouns and the distinction man/woman reflect the biological female or male potentiality needed for reproduction. The biological sex male and female exists as a distinction of the physical systems that (as we know now) form gametes (egg and sperm cell) - female for the egg cells, male for the sperm cells. There is no other third gamete form in humans and therefore there is no 3rd gender. Rare cases of intersexuality may have both or no attachment to it, but do not represent a distinct biological gender."

Is it so wrong to be disturbed by the fact that trans women who don't look like women at all are entering female bathrooms? Aren't the lines long enough already? Do we pass laws protecting trans people from being misgendered (make it illegal to misgender someone like Bill C16 in Canada) and okay you addressed that nobody has been arrested for it, but it is still a law and have you ever thought that maybe they aren't invoking it yet because they know they would have all out riots if even a single person was arrested or fined for their speech? What about the UK speech laws which have already had people arrested and fined for tweets they made or private messages they sent to their friends?   We cis people wouldn't care if it weren't for these things.. ya know, stuff that kindof effects us too, most of us are happy to let you tumblr people do your tumblr stuff and live out your lives how you see fit, just stop trying to pass laws that affect the rest of us... thought you anarcho (even though you've never read noam chomsky) [insert denomination here] didn't like government? didn't want to force your personal shit on others? Also don't make us pay our taxes towards your gender identity calling it (medical) cancer is medical, aides is medical, your whole gender identity thing is a psychological phenomena, unless you're willing to call it a disorder, but if that's the case then it should be cured and not perpetuated (I don't think it is a disorder as much as it's a product of the culture but hey look at me philosophizing on my own and shit)  Maybe all this screaming that everyone is a fascist is just self denial manifesting as projection?"

"I find myself agreeing with you and Jordan Peterson on this and against Shapiro. His strict biological argument doesn't hold water and for reasons of practicality and politeness I've no problem calling a trans woman She. On that point I'm with Peterson, if it's just a matter of social convenience and politeness then fine.The problem comes when, as in Canada, the use of this and many other new trans pronouns is proscribed and compelled by law. In your Peterson video a while back you claimed equivalency between his 'rules for life' and progressive gender pronoun rules, but the law isn't just a rule, and when people's academic careers are directly attacked, using the full force of the law, to take away people's livelihoods over pronoun use, that's going too far. Those incidents are also the main reason the debate over this has become so acrimonious."

What I'd really like to know, is if Ben (or any other trans-denialist) discovered that their biological karyotype did not match with their gender identity...would they embrace their biology and live as the gender that it would (usually) indicate?  Or would they just stick with whatever they had used until then, that fit with their identity?

Now I've come out to myself and feel truly happy for the first time in years. Like I'm not as uncomfortable in my own skin for once. Thanks so much Contra for being partly responsible for even indirectly helping me find out who I really was. And rewatching this video as an out trans woman, I just picked up on the line from Laura Jane Grace from Transgender Dysphoria Blues by Against Me!. Amazing band and honestly, Laura Jane Grace is my model for how I'm gonna present myself."

"I've thought up several sarcastic and ironic comments about pronouns and in the end I've felt that all of them were out of their spirit and I've not quite come to realise why but I have come to realise a better comment; There are a lot of people, and there's a lot of things in this world worth fighting for. I want to be part of those who fight for the right thing. I have therefore decided that I will fight for this channel, for the right of misgendered people to be gendered properly, and for people who feel misplaced by society to fight for a proper place. On top of that, I would like to fight for society to find a place at all, I don't know where we're headed but I'd like to be part of whatever remains of society and a teacher for those of us who are young and come to us in order to learn about what society used to be. Don't worry, young societalist, you're on a good way, we are all compassionate human beings who care about eachother and want us all to have a good experience, you have found an old relic of ours and we together hope that you can channel us and make your world and the future of it a better one.

"Even before nonbinary people became visible in the public space, I was accustomed to using singular 'they' sometimes. Not even for the purpose that NB use it for, but just because I didn't feel like using he/she for whatever reason even though one of those would also perfectly functional. No one told me that 'they' was specifically plural, just that you would use it in a plural instance."

"Most cultural third genders are used for gay, intersex or binary-trans people. Neither of which is actually a separate gender. Some also refer to people not conforming to whichever traditional gender roles this culture has. This could mean non-binary people, but also gnc cis people. Also in most of those cultures third gender people generally aren't well respected in society. For example most Hijras in India live in communities amongst themselves because they are rejected by their families and as a result live in poverty and have to result to sexwork or begging for money in exchange for blessings. Violence and discrimination against them is also a major issue. In general it seems to me these third genders are less a matter of identity and are more a tool to other lgbt and intersex people"

"@contrapoints I love your videos and most all of the points you make. However, I want to point out that Biology of sex is not nearly as binary as people like to believe. In general , people with XX chromosomes are biological female, and people with XY chromosomes are biologically male. However, some people have XXY or XXX or XYY chromosomes. There are a lot of cases where an X and Y chromosome aren't differentiable. Is it a Y with an extra little tail or an X with a very short leg? Who knows. Neither chromosomes nor hormones perfectly equate/correlate to biological sex. Sex determination is a very complex process. When looking at the whole tree of life, sex determination is even more complicated and interesting and non binary. Project Biodiversity has some cool materials you can read on how gender and sex are incorrectly taught in basic Biology classes to reinforce the myth of a sex/gender binary. https://projectbiodiversify.org/workshop-slides/"

I explained sex, gender, and orientation to my kids like thus (and I'm aware it's rather oversimplified, but it suffices to make a young child aware of the concepts; the details can be filled in as they get older): Sex is your body, if you were born a boy or a girl. Gender is your mind, whether you're a boy or a girl on the inside. Orientation is who you like, if you like boys or girls or both. Pretty fuckin simple, really."

"@ContraPoints  While I can mostly agree with your points I will have to call you out for one important piece of Context. The way Ben Shapiro acted was mainly because people on the show argued emotional and 5 vs 1, he tried to be objective and so he was, nothing you can blame him for given the Context (he often stated that if he is treated like shit he is happy to do so in return if necessary).  Also, and I am not sure whether you cut this out on purpose or not, he clearly stated that if he knew a transgender person privately he would respect their pronouns, SO WHAT EVEN IS YOUR POINT ON SHAPIRO IF HE PRETTY MUCH AGREES ON YOUR VIEW OF SUBJECTIVE GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND BEYOND THAT!!!! All he really did was arguing on objective gender, which was logically presented, so arguing that he hurts Caitlyns feelings... omg.. SO MEAN given the context.... So stop painting him as the devil and actually have the guts talking with him.  The rest of the video was sophisticated and well-presented, props on that :)"
"Cool video Par contre j'ai une question, Je ne comprend pas l'importance de s'identifier a un genre. Pourquoi ne pas considerer qu'etre un homme c'est aussi pouvoir etre une drag ou un trans? Quand vous vous identifiez a un genre est ce que vous ne validez pas les stereotypes que vous haissez?"

"I've give you an honest response and tell you how I think most straight cis  people who don't think about this stuff much use pronouns, because I am one. You went into a lot of detail here about a range of, let's say, options. It was very interesting too, btw. I understand the basics but honestly you kinda lost me at some point with the definitions. So for most cis people who don't know these definitions it's going to highly depend upon looks in a way, which you mentioned. I imagine there are trans people out there that I wouldn't even notice were trans, so I would use their correct pronoun automatically without any conscious effort. Then the other possibility is that you can tell that the person is trans just by looking, so that's a separation point between decent people and assholes. So for me, I go with the gender I can tell they want to be called. Stuff like non-binary or a whole bunch of other categorisations, if I'm just talking to you as a stranger, I'm not going to be able to place any of that, and I'm not even going to attempt to because I'll probably fuck up the definitions.   So it's simple for me. I meet other human,  Looks like like man, say he.  Looks like woman, say she.  Looks like trans person, go with the gender they're portraying.  When in doubt, avoid he and she entirely until you hear what other people say."
"Dude, lose the edge, you might cut yourself"
"I don't care what other people think or say in regard to this whole issue. People are born as either male or female. The end.  Any thoughts or feelings that contradict the gender you were born as, I'm afraid are all in your head. Go ahead, get your dick chopped off or a dick sewn on, it makes no difference other than the fact that you cannot breed via the normal method. Which is a good thing, it's natures way of saying we don't want your genes. So basically, you've now become nothing more than a man or a woman with mutilated genitals.

"I agree with you but I still don't get the non binary thing, or the ze or zim or they.. It's undeniable that everyone always either seems like a man or seems like a woman. I have no problem with calling a trans woman a woman or a trans man a man, but the ze and zim, it's not apparently obvious and it is a slippery slope.  idk."
"okay so I've always been a trans ally and understood in like a basic 'I don't like being a shitty person' kind of way that it's not my place to tell another person what gender they are or how they should identify or any of that bs, and I've never had any problems with people wanting to live their lives in a way that makes them happy, but the whole mindset of a trans person just never really made sense to me. Like I believed that there are genuinely people who feel more comfortable as a gender other than their biological one but I just didn't really get how? Or what that would feel like? But for some reason this video in particular just made it click with me? Like the whole part starting around 27:50 , and I understand that this is just your experience and not universal but still, just made sense? It suddenly became analogous to say,  being into heavy metal versus classical music, but to a higher extreme. Like yes those are considerably smaller aspects of identity but if you consider the ideas of male gender versus female gender as a whole it's basically like saying, hey there are aspects of option A that I enjoy way more than aspects of option B so that's what I'm going to immerse myself in and surround myself with and the biology of my birth has no effect on that. And just explaining it on those terms idk? It just made sense to me all of a sudden.

If you don't manage to change any one's mind, you still show them that to defend an opinion, you can't just repeat whatever blank statement you heard from your great uncle. Please keep up calling people out on their circular and deceptive arguments, so that we can have a proper fruitful discussion.  P.S. I don't see how calling someone by a pronoun of their choice can bring the world as we know it to an end. I suspect that some people just enjoy having their noses in other people's business."

"Slight correction, the usage of singular 'they' is actually perfectly grammatically correct, and has been in use for a relatively long time. The addition is that usually singular they requires some kind of ambiguity about the person referred to, now that ambiguity is optional."

"there are hundreds of languages that are not gendered. A lot of languages go by contextual pronouns. e.g. the language that I grew up with, the male and female pronouns are exactly the same and it just depends on the context of the conversation for one to understand who is being referred to. People like Ben Shapiro are acting as if gender pronouns and language are as universal and concrete as biological sex when that is not the case"

"Trans people should be able to use the gender pronoun they feel best describes them.   But it is difficult to make other people do something they don't see as real.  Personally even though I at times think of trans women I know as male I use the female pronoun because it makes sense to me overall as well as the fact they prefer it.  However I think calling someone 'they' for example is nonsense.  I would have difficulty taking someone who insisted on this seriously or feeling much respect for their good sense.  It is pretentious."

"Tbh i do think everyone should call everyone by their preferred pronouns, but that's more a law of politeness and personal respect than legal law. And I don't feel that those are things strangers owe you. Now, the minute that falls into discrimination and/or abuse/assualt that is illegal and should be penalized heavily. So , for insrance, if a stranger politly refuses to call you what you prefer, defend your position, but at the end of the day it's their choice, and you aren't going to change their mind by out agressive-ing them. It'll just give them a bad idea of whatever minorities you are a part of. If a friend refuses to, consider defriending them. But if someone starts calling you slurs, inhibiting you from doing something (such as going to a store, getting a job...) due you being trans or a different race or whatever, or physically assualt you , that is a big no no go to whatever authority is at your disposal asap! And hope to good they are a good, fair one and not a discriminating dictatorship or something"
"I agree with you on most things. How do you define 'The lives of women' Isn't that creating a gender norm by saying your pronouns should 'Match the life you live'? If we need to use pronouns that are specific to gender and if the way someone looks doesn't have a connection to their appearance then why do you want to be called a woman on if you 'Seem like a woman to other people.'   What is the point? Why does anyone care about what they think their own gender is? I'm so lost on that? Like I don't give a shit if someone were to exclusively refer to me as a female I would only have an issue remembering to respond to that simply because that's different from what i've been raised to hear my entire life?  What the fuck does it mean to live and be treated like a woman? I don't understand. The only societal differences that are based on the 'Gender/sex' of someone are almost entirely based on one of two things Your appearance, or your chromosomes. And you've based your video on the argument that both of those are irrelevant to pronouns. What the fuck?  Heads up I'm a cisgendered male. I haven't disagreed with you yet until I got lost on this video. I'm trying really hard to understand this because my current partner is very deeply involved with this community most of her friends are from this community."

But I‚Äôm also not a big fan of a brand new pronoun like ‚Äúze/zey,‚Äù but also a different one for like... every single one of the seventy-million infinities of other gender identities that are out there. Language evolves, yes, but the binary pronouns we‚Äôve been using for centuries are so time-tested and tried and true because they‚Äôre so expedient and user friendly - and they‚Äôre just descriptive enough to convey understanding of who someone is talking about. So how do I take the middle ground here? You know, how do I not become a disrespectful dickhead (because I earnestly don‚Äôt want to be one,) but without having to unlearn a ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô rule of English (the fact that ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù is a plural pronoun,) and learn a bajillion new gender pronouns that I have to memorize and correctly employ?"

"Ben doesn't know much about gender issues and is a perfect example of someone exhibiting the 'Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect' - overly confident cause he knows so little.   As a trans woman (who's socially transitioning but still prefers to have facial hair) Ben et al. can refer to me as 'he/him/man' all they want. Internally I refer to myself as 'she'. Also fun fact: if you pigeon hole me into the male category for online advertising, you will get a much lower rate of return than if you showed me ads targeted primarily towards women. As biased as they can sometimes be, you still can't win agains AI and machine learning. According to those algorithms my interests align more with women than men. QED"
"Great video! My only issue is the part where you mentioned that you wanted to believe what nonbinary people believe about themselves 'so long as those beliefs are reasonable.' The thing is, cis people (and even some binary trans people, like truscum) use that reasoning to deny nonbinary people's gender because, to them, the fact that we identify outside of the binary is too farfetched; to them, simply not identifying as neither a man or a woman is 'too unreasonable' and they use that as justification for misgendering us and using the incorrect pronouns. I'm sure that's not what you were trying to say, however, some people might misconstrue that particular statement as antagonistic to nonbinary people. Just thought I should let you know :)"

"There's an argument here that Ben Shapiro is a defender of rigid gender stereotypes.  But isn't someone that says: 'I like dresses and want to wear make up. Therefore I am a woman.' Basing their logic on those same rigid gender stereotypes. Who decided a man cannot wear dresses and make up?  If I say that a trans woman is a man. Because their sex is male. That does not mean I am pushing gender roles on him/her/it. It means I am talking about biology. If me saying this makes you feel like I am suppressing your ability to express yourself. Then you are the one upholding stereotypes, not I.  There is a distinction between sex and gender. That the trans activists love to bring up to support their arguments. Because it is the foundation of their beliefs. But at the same time they absolutely hate when a trans person's sex is brought up in any fashion.  Why?  Is it because you don't want to admit that sex is a thing? You want sex to be ignored? irrelevant? Sex is measurable. It's objective. You can do a test and find out what sex someone has. Someone's sex matters in regards to what medicine they can take. It matters in regards to how their biology is put together. It matters in regards to weather or not it's fair for them to be on the women's team in the Olympics. In these cases gender doesn't matter. it's irrelevant.  When does gender matter? I can't think of any reason it should. What even is gender?  Can you test someone to find out what gender they are?  No, you can't. So how do you know how it feels to be a man? a woman? Neither?  Are we just back to talking about gender roles here? Because I'm pretty sure we decided a while ago that gender roles shouldn't matter any more. That it was okay to not adhere to them. That not liking sports doesn't make you less of a man. Not liking pink, doesn't make you less of a woman."

"Trombone is the true Stone Butch!"
"10 minutes in and I love the argument you‚Äôve made. I can understand where Ben is coming from as he needs solid ground to define man and woman this relying on chromosomes. I feel that after going to different colleges and hearing that a man can be a woman without transitioning is why he makes this distinction. This puts a gap in his argument to where humans, at least english speaking ones, will use a pronoun as a form of a descriptor to what they perceive. In your case, you‚Äôve said people call you she which makes sense because no one is going to take a DNA swab to check your chromosomes before making their judgement. Cant wait to finish the rest of the vid"

I am grateful that you have laid these things out in this way and it's wonderful and I'd also say thank you very much for your work, it's been a trip. Thanks Natalie!"

"You don't have to be trans to change your pronoun. Amiright?"
"What I've never understood, and hopefully I am not parroting the video too much. Is why people cannot seem to understand that there is a difference between what sex you are and what gender you are. Your sex is determined by your reproductive organs, your gender is determined by who you like to mosy with. And in common parlance, it makes more sense to use the pronoun to denote the gender as that is more pertinent to the layman."

"I've been trying to find a way to explain this to people who don't WANT to understand basics about gender expression and gender identity and this is the perfect video. Got me some really good ideas out of this! I love the fact you pointed out that gender expression and identity is, at the end of the day, still a very subjective thing. Your expression and identity of womanhood could clearly differ from another TrANS womAN's. An example I like to use is how your age, just like your gender identity, can be fluid but will be an innate thing that pertains to yourself, no matter what age you are perceived to be by other people. On top of that, two people the same age will have a different experience and neither should be invalidated.   I don't think it's such a big thing to listen to the person you're talking to and adjust to their preferred pronoun. Hell, I'll sound totalitarian, but in my opinion you should default to 'they' - and that's not because you should be afraid of the reaction you get for using the wrong pronoun. My trans friends are the most loving people who would never want to make someone uncomfortable over the fact they misgendered them. I just think it's more correct to default to neutral than assign a gender. I know it can't be helped, sometimes, and I've used pronouns which other people weren't comfortable with before. But just think of how we view, let's say, a dog or a cat. You will use 'it' until you have had personal interactions with that cat or dog. The same with people (altho people are not pets unless we're talking about a very specific... fetish, to say so, and god, why do I know so many things about things people like to do in a sexual scenario I need Jesus)... As I was saying, the same with people, it seems, at least to me, more correct to default to 'them' before having an interaction and learning more about that person.   Thanks for your videos, Contra! They are always so... On Points!  P.S.: Your videos are porn for sapioromantics, just thought I'd let you know lol"

I dodged them because I watched people like Bearing, and No Bullshit and just couldn't stand how damn rude they were about everything, calling people retarted, calling overweight people whales and disgusting. Always scraping the bottom of the barrel for the grossest shit on SJWs, it was all so toxic and mind numbing to just watch that circle jerk between channels that I just stopped watching it and went back to watching generic let's plays that all 13 year olds should be consuming.

"I actually really appreciate that bit about 'whether or not trans women feel like women on a visceral level'. I always use the pronoun that's requested. But I always felt guilty that it came more easily to me for some people than others.  I've only met one non-binary person who made the usage of 'they' a natural thing for me. But as my understanding of the phenomenon increases, I'm sure my comfort with it will as well.  ....Especially since I'm starting to think I might be a bit non-binary as well."
"29:26 I wish I lived in a culture where that outfit was the traditional female garb!"
"Now when you speak a language like French with no gender-neutral third-person pronoun (I mean, there's one but it's already used as a familiar substitute of 'we') AND where you have to specify gender on nouns, adjectives and fucking past participles, things can become a tad difficult.  Regarding the whole 'visual' aspect‚Ä¶ well, that's really the only thing people can rely on to guess the pronoun when they don't know the person. Because, you know, most people can't read minds."
"I know it's taboo but it's true. When I randomly meet a trans person I get so anxious that I'll misgender them that I kinda avoid talking to them. My goal is never to offend someone so if I get attacked (I live in a very liberal city) for accidentally using the wrong pronouns, I would get heated. I think this is mainly because non binary folks have no assigned gender by appearance and we're left to guess. I'm bad at guessing and I get embarrassed.  Oh and the second look it's stunning. Omg wow."

"i always felt like i had to argue for my ex (i enjoyed doing it and she was tired of doing it over and over again) who was a short woman that people on the street thought looked like a teenage male, because of her mohawk and stature. its kinda like the same argument in reverse. people thought she was my little brother. almost made me feel like saying to them, 'this is my teenage brother we fuck'.   she identified as a woman, was born as a woman and was proud. but hated gender rolls with a passion, to the point the only female singer she enjoyed out of all music was Adrienne Droogas from aus rotten. she hated most traditions considered feminine and those she didnt that were considered traditional feminine she didn't consider feminine at all. she thought they were human but were oppressed by toxic masculinity. a better example, she didnt hate the colour pink, she just hated the stigma attached to it. if she wore a pink shirt it wasnt because it was feminine its because its a fucking colour and who give a fuck. but she hated dresses with a passion.  she emasculated men in their own fields weather it be, brewing, distilling, crafting, cycling, intellectual discussion, conceptual art, tattoos or handy work. infact she hit me, which as bad as that sounds it wasnt a problem. she hit me cause we were rowdy punks in saying that its not like i ever lay a hand on her beyond pushing her around in a mosh pit. she belittled masculinity while partaking in behaviors and activities considered traditionally masculine. at a stiff little fingers show she knocked down skin heads like bowling pins.  as much as i am aware violence on females exists heavily with in society i think it usully exists through a different power dynamic, based on control and sex. she how ever was assaulted by some teenage kid who stoll her phone assuming she was a male, usually this assumption kept her safe from sexual assault but put her in danger in this case. a 1 armed man ended up chasing off the attacker and when i went to shake his hand, well... i felt like a ass hole.(wrong hand)  she hated it when her boss was mansplaining, she hated old men who acted like they knew everything at the department stores.  so i guess my statement isnt anti trans at all but that assumptions regardless can be offensive. so lesson of the day... is when in doubt, shut your fucking mouth."

Why would anybody go against his core beliefs? don't you think it's awful to do that to people? or perhaps you can't ampathize with them.

What I am kind of interested in seeing now, given how he struggles with words kinda based on proto-german is Ben Shapiro applying his reasoning to our current day German language.

"Tying gender pronouns to chromosomes is a really bad idea.  There are a several different sex chromosome arrangements beyond xy and xx pairing that may or may not match a range of sexual phenotypes (Androgen insensitivity syndrome for instance).  While these differences are rare, so isn't transgendered people.  I don't want to DNA test everyone just so I can use the proper pronoun.  I would much rather take a guess based on how they look and act.  And if I'm wrong, what's the point of being obtuse about it?  I have better things to do than argue with someone so I can pretend that biology and society isn't messy."
"You really ARE the queen. Hail."
"I think while sometimes there is transphobia, sometimes ppl aren't phobic but, just don't understand the difference between sex and gender b/c gender is associated w/ a sex, and think when transgenders call themselves women or men they're referring to sex b/c often in society these things are used interchangeably. While some think of sex and gender being the same, transgender, and some others see it as a social construct or roles applying to men or women by society. All points of view are valid but, one can still show love and respect for someone by using their preferred pronouns, and if one defines sex and gender as the same thing, if a trans takes the opposite sexes hormones, and get the surgeries, are they not somewhat transitioned into the opposite sex anyway in a way even if they don't technically have the same chromosomes? The thing I don't get about non-binaries is non-binary means neither gender, when they're often look and act more like a combination of the genders, or one gender or the other, so it seems they should call themselves bi-binary or genderfluid instead, meaning both, or androgyny. Ofc I would nvr disrespect them but, I've yet to see one that doesn't look and act male or female in my personal experience. Same w/ the other tumblr genders. This ofc isn't to say they aren't valid as ppl b/c they are but, I would define them differently in the sense of termanology than they'd define themselves since they don't really seem like a new gender as ppl, but instead rather a combination of 2 (and ofc they and them is appropriate for that, but calling them zir and zim like the cartoon w/ the alien Zims would be harder to remember). Ultimately though, whether ppl understand u, one shouldn't look to others for validation, or feel the need to conform the please others. The truth of who u r comes from within, not without, and all good loving fun ppl should be treated w/ love and respect. Don't let ppl like Ben Shapiro get u down. U r valid, and an awesome funny and fun af human being."

But, yeah, I know, I only see what you intend to be seen, that's the nature of videos and production.  Still, I've watched several of your videos this afternoon and every one has a handful of slights you direct at yourself and it's painful to watch because regardless of how tongue-in-cheek they might be that bit of self harm is still there and you don't deserve it. To quote my amazing 20-something queer daughter, 'Contrapoints is an internet goddess of Reason and Drama.'  And I've gotta agree, because, ya know, facts don't care about feelings <3"
"(Because so many people have missed my point on bringing up Swyer syndrome I will now explain it here so I don't have to respond every single time. Some people, Shapiro included ((and I may be wrong about him so feel free to correct me)) seem to suggest that chromosomes without exception determine what gender someone is. It doesn't matter how rare Swyer syndrome is, the fact that it exists at all debunks such claims. Unless of course someone really thinks a person who was born with vagina, and grows up looking and acting like most cis women (((and who's brain is probably more female too))) is still a man because she has XY chromosome. The ultimate point is that gender really isn't as clear cut as most people think)   Does Ben Shapiro know about Swyer syndrome? Maybe you bring it up in the video. Not trough with it yet.  Damn it is easy here in Finland. There is just one personal pronoun h√§n. And it refers to both male and female. So a transperson like me at least don't have to worry about language. Also in common Finnish speak it isn't considered rude to refer to someone as 'se'. Finnish word for it. Apart from some really special formal occasions it doesn't have the same dehumanizing vibe as the English word. 25:22 Had to pause the video there to get some cereal. And I actually said silently 'Uu (ooh), se sano (said) Finnish.And example of what I just commented. : ) Interestingly, all three languages you mentioned were once classified in the Ural-Altaic language family.

"The guy you *need* to take on if you want a legit challenge and this is the best, is @ConceptualJames on Twitter. James Lindsay. He's a math Ph.D. who stopped his work in that field to embarrass the 'Grievance Studies' fields in 'Sokal Squared.' Anyway, he's on the Left but he's really critical of the shoddy scholarship in 'Grievance Studies' (Natalie, some of the scholars in these fields do indeed *suck*) and he's always taking on trans rights activists. I think he has written but has not published a 14,000-word critique on trans studies (it could be a broader polemic though on GS.) I think he's a legitimate critic, on the Left and arguing in good faith. He's in the Quillette hemisphere. It's not going to get you a million clicks, but if you want to further the cause, I think he's the kind of person you want to beat and do so publicly. Don't leave it up to the 'experts.' They're pretty awful. All the best."

"I'm fascinated. You're quite brilliant. You *do* represent the trans community very, very well. They don't know what they're doing. You're self-aware and you know where the Overton Window is on these issues. You're asking for recognition within a very comfortable context for cis people. *There's nothing wrong with that.* It's how politics works. You can persuade not just liberals, but even thoughtful people in IDW, etc. I wouldn't listen to the rest of trans community on this. Here's what a lot of us know about them: we ask an innocuous question and they jump in and tried to get us banned, to de-platform us (Twitter, usually.) Do you think that's a good look? It's a horrible look. It feels like, yes, bullying. Twitter is the worst. There's a pack of them and they do not forgive and will not forget. This is pushing people away. Keep doing what you're doing. Also, they need to get rid of this over the top rhetoric. No one is 'canceling you' as a person. No one is 'invalidating your existence.' This is the kind of rhetoric that needs to go. It's so drastic."
"I don't know how to contact you. Start here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snqXOvnHzcQ Afterwards, move to 'Coddling' and take that on. That's what I want to see."
"my general rule of thumb for addressing strangers (especially in customer service): if you're unsure how to read a person's gender, avoid gendered language when talking to them. otherwise, go with whatever your gut says. and, most importantly: if someone goes 'oh, it's ma'am/sir/etc.,' you go 'i'm sorry; my mistake' and then you adjust. getting misgendered sucks, but at least in my experience, that initial misgendering hurts way less when the person goes 'oh shit sorry i meant (pronoun)' and then you move on.  tl;dr: social interaction is hard, and if you misgender someone and they correct you, apologize and correct yourself and then just move on. chances are a trans person will feel more awkward if you make a big deal out of it than if you just quietly apologize and correct yourself."

As for not calling trans people their preferred pronoun....Eh no. Thats just rude. Is it really so much of a stretch just to call someone she or he cause that`s what they prefer? It just seems to me to be about being a stubborn pain on the tits. I get that people slip up and that`s ok, most people won`t bite you. I`ve been around trans people for years on the gay scene so i`m used to it but it really shouldn`t be a huge problem for others. Even if 'you don`t agree with the lifestyle' or whatever rubbish it is, at least just make the effort not to be a fud! It`s like telling me i`m a straight guy when i know fine bloody well i`m about as straight as the local roundabout that`s garlanded with pink perennials."

What you gonna call those people, huh? And for all we know, he could be XXY. I mean, no one asked him for his karyotype. Everyone would have to be tested. Is this the first thing you do when you meet someone then? Ask them to give you their complete genome? Before you speak so that when you have to talk about them you can know what chromosomes they have and thus know what pronouns to use? And if so, would the state be paying for this? By now genome sequencing costs only $1000 per person (remember the first complete human genome to be sequenced took from 1995 to 2003 and cost over 3 billion US dollars). Cause if that's the case, then trust me the scientific community will be VERY HAPPY to know they have such an incredible database to dig through to find links between diseases and genes. Trust me on that, I'm in my last year for a BSc in Genetics.   As for 'biological' he might want to look at brain biology and how in both children and adults brains of transgender people corresponds to that of their actual gender and not their 'biological' sex‚Ä¶   yeah.  facts don't care about his feelings"

"Gotta say the thing that disturbs me the most about bill c16 is that it seems like  blatant attempt to force a change of language in an attempt to change the way people think, i get a strong 1984 vibe this. Its not about throwing people in jail for missgendering people, its about making laws that deter people from speaking an opinion that isnt in line with todays pc agenda.   On one hand we want to have a multicultural society accepting of everyones beliefs and views but on the other he hand we are writing laws that dont give people the option to freely speak their mind. How can religious person freely speak their mind with these kinds of laws, if their interpretation of their given scripture says there are only 2 genders then thats their truth, its based on shit (imo desert fairy tales are not the best source to pull knowledge from) but thats their truth and that should be okay too and they shouldnt be forced to comply to the idea of 'there are millions of different genders'.  I can see why transpeople wanna have extra pronouns and titles to be adressed with, its very important to your identity and its also about acceptance, but i already got my own definition of what a man or a woman is or how many genders there are, stop forcing your views on me, its like having the fuckin jehovas witness at the door everyday trying to convince me of his very subjective views.   Transpeople believe there are a million different genders thats cool, thats their view, alright, the jehovas witness believes in the existence of some kind omnipotent being but im not forced by law to validate that belief in any form but i have to play along with the transpeople, using the made up pronoun of their choice?

"Alright. As a cis-male, the first part legitimately persuaded me. I don't feel comfortable admitting it, but yes. I concede. I'll call a transwoman a woman so long as they put in the effort and don't just continue acting male but calling themselves female. Your reasoning is sound.  However, the second part I had many, many gripes with.  There's a really good article that deals with microaggressions (which I'm still pretty on the fence about, but mostly against), that divulges into what the author calls 'the pristine self' that I think is a pretty good analysis of the situation going on right now. Here's a link: https://legalinsurrection.com/2016/05/psychoanalyzing-microaggression-mania/  Effectively, his point boils down to the fact that many of the microaggressions that people experience don't come on behalf of the actual individual's so-called 'aggression,' but rather from some sort of internal 'pristine self,' which is the embodiment of who they see themselves to be internally. However, it's the gap between their internal self and external self which is brought to their attention by another, and therefore offends them through the addressing of that distance. But I'll comfortably take the stance you propose at around @18:37, 'performing your gender is the only thing that matters, and how you identify counts as nothing.'  A quick disclaimer: don't treat people like garbage, no matter how ridiculous their 'pristine self' is or who they 'identify' as. I don't advocate physical violence for just about any reason, though words are fair game. Let's continue.  So your point @19:30, 'how many people have gone to jail because of C-16' is an absolute straw-man against my boi JP, because his point was never that people could definitely go to jail because of it, though that's a part of it. His point was that it could be taken the wrong way, and should absolutely be re-worded due to its vagueness and ability to be taken wrongly. Which it has been, demonstrably in several instances. You didn't take on his true argument, and that disappoints me, because you're usually better than that. Even still, the Linsey Shepard situation and many others prove that it HAS been taken wrongly, and should be re-worded.  As for your argument about how people 'identify,' this is where your argument fell apart for me. You could simply replace the different gendered pronouns (he/she, won't budge on those two, though asexuality is chill and non-binary is its own thing I guess) for any other 'identity,' and your logic gets screwy. @21:54, you mention that a person could identify as something different than they look or act, and that identifying somebody based on how they look isn't usually possible. So effectively, you have to identify someone based on their pristine self, and if you identify incorrectly, it's your fault for not seeing their pristine self and not theirs for having an unbalanced perception of reality.  Identity matters, but only in as much as it relates to your literal self you see in the mirror. If you identify as something that is obviously not true, in many cases it's seen as a mental disorder, such as a biological black 50-year-old male identifying as a six-year-old white girl. It's obviously not true, and to expect others to believe that and address him as such is nonsense. I know you're not defending that logic necessarily, and I hate using the slippery slope argument because it's usually fearmonger-y, but I think in this case we've gotta keep the whole 'identification' thing purely to what other people can recognize and comprehend on a physical level, lest it be taken to the absolute extreme.  Even if you hate my argument, thanks for being rational and putting out entertaining content. I respect your right to speak even if I don't like what you say all the time!"

To be honest I really try to understand everything you're saying here, but it seems to go j√∫st over my head, so is there some further reading (or listening (or watching)) anyone can recommend, I understand the general story but have difficulty understanding the details so yeah... And I don't think a second point is coming."

"I just wanna say you e changed my mind and educated me in so many things, and I‚Äôm beyond grateful Also Ben Shapiro is ignorant, and goes against the rules of conversation: he instead enters an argument with the mindset of a debate, which is neither a conversation or argument, but is the defense of a perspective with no allowing for open mindedness or alternate perspective.  In other words, he is a failure. Does not get a sticker. Does not pass go, does not collect 200$."

"You kinda contradicted yourself in the same statement... 'How many people were jailed for misgendering because of bill C-16? Zero' but then you said 'you can use your freedom of speech...' But the whole point is, Bill C-16 specifically makes it so misgendering (regardless of intent) is a hate-crime, and thus does not fall under freedom of speech. The argument was NEVER that it would send people to jail, the issue is that it violates freedom of speech, and it could be abused by individuals to claim others have committed 'hatecrimes' against them, when they never intended to do such a thing. You counter Sharpiro's points in this video using well thought out arguments, would it not be a shitty society if instead people were allowed to take him to court and try to get him sent to jail, by claiming that him speaking publicly about these topics is equated to if you beat up an innocent black man because you hated his race?"
"I hope your self-loathing is in jest. You are indeed attractive, interesting and intelligent.  Let your awareness of your imperfections (we all have them) drive you to greater beauty, if you wish, but remember that those who define themselves by their imperfections have already committed the sin of imperfectly defining themselves, and that causes wrinkles."

"Great video. I agree to most, but i think the real discussion is about how  non-bianry snowflakes and others want to push 'their' way of seeing things onto others. And as we know, the snoflakes have a particular aptidude of pushing the rest of society to accept their bs. So 'ordinary' forlk they fear that this little minority are going to change the laws and regulate speech just because they have feelings and opinions that dont match the general population. Lets say, im gay. And i am. I belive my soul is female. So i can also be non-binary, and also trans, i can be anything. Probably that is because my brain is wired differently than a regular cis male. However, i would have understadning that the general population DO NOT have this way of seeing it, so i would not push myself onto them. I would understand that they come from a point of view that makes it hard for them to understand it. Thus; by being a bigger man, i simply allow their ingorance; but what i see in the LGBT and pronoun community is that they are so obsessed with the pronounes and they think that this is the only way they will get their 'way' to legalize or get credit for being what they are. But that is simply not the case. Because many of them are rude and pushy. They fall into the victim mentality because of people that dont understand them. So the alt-right crowd and conservatives i totally understand them, because the LGBT community is so strong and their tentacles into politics are strong. Everyone can see that, and thats why they fear them. Fear the unhinged snofalkes, that need all the attention to their pornouns, when they are simply just a small minority of kids... seriously..They ruin for themselves and others by pushing too hard and thinking that everyone needs to accept the way they see it and how they feel. And that is simply not true. I dont think most people have a problem with calling a trans MTF she if she dresses and looks like a girl. But when you want to push legislation that affects all people; people rise up. Its like if im gay, and want my own gay bathroom. I dont like to be in mens bathroom, because im not a man, and not a woman either, so i will demand my own gay bathroom. You see how stupid it is. This is what you have to live with when you are on the fringe of society. You will know more deeper and compleex things about gender and sex than most people, but you also need ot have understanding for them. That they are the majoriry, and are not gonna change all their law to suite your little fantasies... Ye.. I bet all this snoflake gender binaries have ruined for everyone by triggering a defence from the cis community. Its really sad, and it all backfires. They need to grow up, accept themselves, and know that, yes, they might not be accepted as they are. Just as someone that is handicapped or has multipple sclerosis wont be accepted the same way."

"One criticism, though. I don't think she should have ceded the point about how the use of 'she' may be the obvious pronoun to use in a social circumstance, based on how 'convincing' a transgender woman looks. To imply that using 'she' in this circumstance is intuitive seems to contradict the conclusion of her argument (i.e. that pronouns are evolving to be used in new ways.) Unless there's something I'm missing - I only watched the video once."

"When Shapiro claims that the idea of his daughter becoming a boy would be 'damaging to her psyche,' he accidentally admits the fact that identity is more than biology/karyology, that it is determined by psychology as well.  So there he, by introducing psychology as a determining factor, reveals the fallacy and bias of his argument, which is not based on empirical, scientific fact, something he admits by showing his concern for his daughters psychological health on the one hand, but completely ignoring the health of the trans psyche on the other. So we should follow his advice and not care about his daughter's feelings, right?"

"Gender is a bimodal paradigm and the notion of man and woman is not socially constructed. To suggest this is fundamentally an assault against science and people who truly struggle with transgenderism. The obfuscation surrounding non-binary identities in relationship to transgenderism is why people like Ben Shapiro have a reflexive aversion to referring to people who truly struggle with gender dysphoria with their preferred pronouns. This is because the movement associated with transgender people is led by radical left-wing ideologues with political and social goals."

"Ben Shapiro logic of how pronouns should be used to identify  biological gender is the most dumb thing I've ever heard. I don't ask people, 'hey before I used this pronoun, i am not sure of your actual biological sex. Are you biologically a men or women?' I don't think this would permit a normal conversation but would make it seem like I am some gender gastapo. I've listened to several of Shapiro arguments and he isn't open minded but extremely oppressive with his point of views. If you are going to debate this man, stick to your narrative. He will not change his position on the subject and that is fine but don't get lost in his bullying use of language . Shapiro often times come off as very childish and naive when it comes to more serious social issue. His black and white point  shows he lacks experience and only wants to see things in its most simplistic form or idea. He isn't very intellectual at all and not well informative. He is a hack."

"When someone can explain the detailed differences between all those nonbinary-identity terms in a way that everyone can agree on, they will actually have meaning. Until then, they're just a cloud of words, although I assume there are some that mean identity as both genders, identity as neither gender, identity that varies, and partially-A-but-more-B identity. Did I leave something out? Probably, because more identities seem to be invented all the time (insert dead Tumblr joke)."
"Strangers can't fault you for using the pronoun that matches their current presentation, so that's a safe and easy choice.

"Hey. I'm a long-time consumer of JP (more in the self-help 'get your shit together' way rather than politics, which I'm sure is more how he prefers to it too) and also a long-time watcher of Ben Shaprio because I'm British, know nothing about American politics and enjoy his approach to getting facts out that I can digest, and frankly, also because the speed at which he talks means he gets a lot of words out of his mouth in quite a short time!  I say all this to give exposition to the fact I'm attentive and inquisitive, but respect directness and honesty (in terms of YOU are telling the Truth as you feel it). I endeavor to look at what I don't yet understand with optimism, hopeful that I can find something I don't know. Due to being exceptionally ignorant of the whole pronoun thing, having no lived-experience of it (probably the most important type of knowledge I'd argue) and because you have laid all of this out like you have, it's fantastic for my particular situation. I've learned a whole bunch and thank you for the effort and lucidity of your explanation. Your tone is also 'on-point' and masterful. Whilst I can be a bit reticent to be open when coming across REALLY new ideas, you stealth-bombed my brain with wit, memery and glitter. Kudos! I will watch a lot more of your videos. Keep doing what you're doing."
"You never addressed Ben‚Äôs argument. The reason he doesn‚Äôt use the pronouns is because he believes that trans people suffer from a mental illness and using their preferred pronouns is just providing false affirmation of the mental illness. You can talk about linguistics all you want but that is avoiding his main gripe."
"So according to Ben Shapiro... an XY woman, as in, someone who is visibly female in just about every aspect except having XY chromosomes (an intersex condition where the trigger to send testosterone to the developing fetus, aka the literal purpose of the Y chromosome, is not recognized, causing the fetus to develop as ‚Äòfemale‚Äô in regards to its sex)... should be referred to as ‚Äòhe‚Äô?  Ben, honey, sweet summer child, it makes no sense to insist on calling a cisgender woman with an intersex condition, having XY chromosomes, a ‚Äòhe‚Äô if your argument is ‚Äúbut chromosomes!‚Äù"

"Preface: I'm a fan of Contra (generally) and not of Ben (generally).  From what I can see here, and I'm hoping to have someone explain this to me if I'm incorrect along the way, is that there are two perspectives on gender represented in the vid that I commonly encounter in the world. One is Ben's, that gender is explicitly linked to biological sex (biological sex being characterized by either chromosomes or what role one can play in reproduction) and the other is Contra's, that gender is completely detached from biological sex, that there is no correlation between a persons chromosomes or the role that they play in reproduction and how they feel they are to be characterized within our gendered society. This is my initial understanding, please correct me where necessary.¬†  So if the argument rests on this divergent premise, I would happily grant the latter to be true: there is no correlation between biological sex and gender. But then if we take that premise to be true, what happens to gender is that it loses any and all measurable features (which I'm also perfectly satisfied with). What I'm confused about is this: What are we talking about when we're talking about gender once gender is completely separated from biological sex? (sincere question) After all, the existence of a categorical distinction seems to rest on it corresponding to some measurable constituent features. What are the measurable features of gender within this framework?  The example of adoptive parents is good. The category 'parent' has certain measurable  features we could probably all decide on, like - a person who supports a child (whether theirs from birth or not) financially, emotionally, etc. A parent provides food, shelter, love, guidance, etc. These are things we can measure and determine whether or not they accumulate to constitute the 'parent' category (of course this category gets blurry at the edges or in particular contexts but they all do, and it is still functional). Or, there's a comment in the comments here that talks about hair colour that's also a good example. If someone is born blonde but they dye their hair brunette and maintain that colour change, then there's no sense calling them blonde anymore etc. etc. Again, these categories have directly measurable features (In the case of hair colour it's only a measurable feature).   So when men and women can equally, and should equally, dress the same, fuck the same, work the same jobs, love the some people, etc. (of course this is my perspective living in Canada and being surrounded by people who are enlightened by my standards) then what are the measurable constituent features that make gender a category at all? I mean this very sincerely, because it seems to me that gender has been rendered  a non category, which I'm perfectly happy about.   People might say: Hey gender's not erased just like that, there's a history of gender that is still playing out today! And that's true, but it's only playing out via people who think about the world through gender. Like, there used to be other social categories we lived by, like serfs and lords but they no longer hold any measurable features so we don't think along those lines anymore (accept land lords, which is a very specific context, like the Contra mentions is the case with distinguishing types of parents)   And there are infinite categories that could be introduced as long as categories don't require measurable constituent features. For example, wujiklon and badgiklon are two different types of people. They can look the same and do all the same things but they are two different categories of people and I don't know why, but they are.   My inevitable conclusion is that gender, after being emancipated from the grips of biology, does not go off to enjoy its new autonomy but rather dissolves into nothing.   So, why the heck am I wrong (asking the no one who has continued reading this far... and thinking right... right... )"

Its gotten to the point where I just say 'Yes 'em'   and to be clear, im not worried about someone yelling at me for calling them the wrong thing. Im worried of making someone feel anxious about not comming off as the right gender. And while you can make sure of that by asking a friend, its kinda akward to ask the person over the speaker 'yes sir I'll take a number 11, wait is it sir or ma'am?' cause asking that question itself can be taken bad and- GHA THATS IT im communicating via dolphin chatter!!!!"

"The answer is to stop assuming you know what someone is from just looking at them  It's all about being thoughtful and remembering that the rules made by society are 1. Not always factual and 2. Made by us, who as a society can voluntarily change, redefine, and improve those rules  We know that cis women can have short hair, sharp jaw lines, thick brow bones, wide shoulders, deep voices, an adam's apple, narrow hips, dense facial hair, a muscular build, they can be flat chested, they can be really tall, some can have more than one of these traits, some have all of them, yet most people don't stop to consider them when they look at a person and assumes they're not a woman because of those traits  The same can be said for cis men, who we know can have long hair, be curvy, have narrow shoulders, have soft rounded jawlines, have small brow bones, have boobs and breastfeed, have thick thighs and butts, have high-pitched voices, grow no facial hair, have barely any muscle tone, have a dainty frame and build, but no one thinks about that when they define what a man looks like. Do these men just not count? Are they defective? Are they not men because they don't 'pass'?  If we know that cis men can look, sound, act, and dress like cis women, and that cis women can look, sound, act, and dress like cis men, why do we still pretend we can tell what someone is from their looks?  Not even including trans people, the whole issue of assuming someone's gender and genitals just from looking at them can be harmful for many people, their identities, social relations, and their self-esteem  Trans women can look like cis women, they can look like cis men Trans men can look like cis women, and they can look like cis men They can look like anything, because everyone can! You can't really know for sure unless you confirm with the person that they are that gender or have those genitals  If a cis woman can go without makeup, without getting her hair all nice, just wearing sweats and a hoodie and still be called a woman, why does a trans woman only get a chance of receiving that respect when she's dressed as hyperfeminine as possible? A lot of the same people that will treat a trans woman like that, are also the same who will defend cis men when they wear makeup, dresses, skirts, ribbons, purses, and all kinds of other 'girly' stuff, saying 'clothes have no gender'. So if they don't, and we as a society know this, even when we still try to hold on to things we wish were still traditionally masculine or feminine, how come those rules don't apply to trans people?  Being gendered correctly by strangers is nice and all, but with the rules and norms set right now, that's a privilege, which too many people do not have. Because they don't fit the mold and aren't gendered correctly, are they not what they say they are? Do they deserve to be misgendered and possibly even face gender dysphoria on a regular basis?  Right now you get gendered correctly from people assuming by your looks, but you also get misgendered.  You have to work hard to have your gender respected, while a cis woman doesn't really have to do anything to be treated like a woman, even though you're both women Would you like it if instead you were always gendered correctly? If you didn't have to bust your ass for just a small chance to be treated properly? Would you like it if just saying 'I'm a girl' was enough to get treated correctly, the way a misgendered cis woman would if she did the same? How would you feel if someone gendered you correctly, without you telling them you're a woman, not from the image you've created for yourself, but from feeling the womanly energy you project? You could have these things in a world where people didn't assume from superficial norms Like you could really be free to be whatever woman you want to be and still be happy if these things changed   In a world like this, where we remember that the binary is mostly bullshit, and that anyone can look, act, dress and sound like any gender or sex; people who don't fit the binary can also be included and treated fairly, be they trans, cis, intersex, of a binary gender, or of a non-binary gender.  Before it was widely thought that liking men was something strictly for women, and that homosexual men were either not men at all or an inferior type of man. We as a society changed that. Pants were for men, then women wore them. Then pants were for everyone. Men were once always expected to be the breadwinner, and women were once always expected to just have kids and take care of their house and husband for the rest of their lives, society did that, and we as a society are changing that now, stay-at-home dads aren't considered womanly, women who work aren't considered manly, I could go on but my point is  We do not only live in a society We are one We have the power to change And I feel like we need an aesthetic revolution  We need people reclaiming their gender and their bodies from the norm We already know boobs are normal on men and women, now we need men owning those manly boobs of theirs and even showing off their man-cleavage if they want We already know it's normal for women to grow facial hair, now we need to make facial hair a fashion statement,  We need to make broad shoulders be considered hot and/or valid on anyone, not just men We need to make it so that most of us are aware that all these traits really could belong to anyone of any sex or gender, and to be aware that non-binary people exist  People who don't fit those binary norms help with this by just existing They might have traits or looks that might seem manly or womanly, but the fact that they're just there and they don't fit that norm serves as proof and as a reminder that that's not always the case, and that those things aren't inherently manly or womanly They're out there We just need to be aware that they are, that they're a part of the conversation when talking about people of their gender or sex, instead of acting like they don't count Our words shape reality, they shape society, they decide who is in and who is out, and we don't want to leave people out unfairly by denying their existence  Also, after transitioning to a state of mind where you don't assume gender, sex or pronouns, it makes conversations and thinking a lot easier! You save so much time and energy saying 'they' instead of looking and assuming, and you can avoid the bad feelings that come with accidentally misgendering someone! When you call someone whose gender you don't know 'they', you remind them that they are more than just their outside, and that you care about what's within, enough to not just judge by looks and jump to conclusions, in a way you help acknowledge their humanity, and that's really nice too"

"Ok so I am a trans man pre t and still haven't had top surgery. I  would like to point out that I am technically still a woman, but I am constantly being called a he. That is until they see that I have boobs. Then they always say they are sorry and then use she. This has happened my entire life. I was very tomboyish growing up. I always had long hair till puberty hit then I would cut my hair short most of the time. And even with my enormous breasts I would still be called he until they saw them. My question is what is the difference between being misgendered as your biological self and being misgendered as your transgender self?"

"I studied biology for a couple of years in college and now I'm moving for a language graduation  (linguistics, literature and that kind of stuff)  It's sad seeing people like Shapiro because:   1. Most of biologists are pretty comfortable with trans and gay people existence. They are all working with other stuff because they know arguments like 'it's unnatural' are dumb (and no one listen to their contra arguments anyway)   2. Language is an actual object of study for God's sake. You can actually learn some linguistic and grammar and whatever and ask someone how it works before decide you don't wanna use the fucking pronoun. It's like that crazy people who decide from nowhere that vaccines are bad or the earth is flat."

"To anyone still whinging about the 'singular they': 'They' has been used as a singular pronoun in English since at least the *14th Century.* It was used in the *King James Bible,* by *Chaucer, Lord Byron, Jane Austen, Daniel DeFoe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Thackeray, and Shaw.* I can guarantee everyone who speaks English has used it (Whoever did such-and-such, _they_ better; 'They'll regret/rue the day', and so forth).  It amazes me just how upset and petulant so-called adults get when simply asked, 'don't be a fucknugget'."

This is backwards to me and feels like we are going in the wrong direction.

"The definitions of he and she have always been labels for each biologically recognised gender even in 500 bc. We now have a better understanding of what that biological difference, chromosomes. The definition is still descriptive and prescriptive. However if you subjectively identify as a gender that is, from somebody elses objective perspective,  identified as being untrue, I don't see how you can claim control over the use of those labels by others.   Also the emotional investment into these new words seems insincere. These words did not exist a year or two ago. Am I to believe that all this time emotional scars were being cut, up until the point a specific gender pronoun was used on a particular individual?"
"Your channel is very good, i tend to the other side of most of your opinions in others subjects, but it's good to hear a different opinion every now and then. I agree that pronouns are not biologically based, it's our interpretation of man and women, personally i would call people for the chosen pronoun(mostly to be polite, if i don't like the person i wouldn‚Äôt) except things different from he or she, first it's always political, different from trans or gay people, gender fluid negates how we interpret being trans(how can you be a man in a women body or vice versa if there is no such a thing as being born man or woman, just socialized a s such, this would even justify the 'X is turning our kids Y' , and implies that every trans person is just socialized in this way)."
"I'm Brazilian and this would be impossible in Portuguese, even adjectives have express gender, i think it wouldn't be a problem in Japanese because they already have gender neutral forms of speak, if someone tries to change it' would just be a political move, but i think if you could sell your idea the language would change and be normal after some years ( use the state to force it to change now will not work)."

"I don't care about the rest as long as we aren't denying biology, i have no problems calling trans women she or her etc its just there was that professor in that interview that straight up denied that there are biological sexes, other trans advocates claim there are 3 biological sexes, male, female and intersex, i believe neither of those claims to be true, there are 2 biological sexes and intersex is a genetic departure from the norm in a similar way that albinos are. Currently some feminists are claiming that if we say trans women are women it erases lesbians, because if a lesbian does not wish to have sexual relations with a trans woman then its transphobia and not recognizing them as women, personally i don't think anyone should be telling anyone who they should have sexual relations with. Ill grant you that C-16 amounted to nothing, but it does make me wonder if it would be zero if the big fuss hadn't been kicked up, i suspect it wouldn't but there is no way to know, my main concern over that drama was you should always be extremely cautious when you give the government more powers, the next political parties can use those same powers."

"I agree with you for the most part, but doesnt your position on womanhood-- ie. it not being how you look but mostly your actions/mannerisms that get you accepted by wider society as a woman-- just play into the patriarchal idea of what women 'should' be? How do womanly actions differ from manly actions? Im not trying to be unecessarily inflammatory, as i do agree with most of what you posit in this video, i just think that trying to codify the actions/mannerisms of womanhood would only reinforce the patriarchal vision of what women are."

"Dear miss Points. You are  using very crooked arguing in the first part of your video, I have to say. Just because human sex chromosomes weren't discovered until 1905, doesn't mean they didn't exist, or that their effects weren't obvious. Women were called she and men he because of the clear, visible, BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES between men and women. This is true throughout all of history in literally every single different culture you will find. I would say that counts as a lot more sound anthropological evidence than your friends and (some) strangers calling you she. So actually, Ben Shapiro's argument makes perfect sense, when looking at it from a descriptive point of view. Men have always been called he, because they were born with a penis, women have always been called she, because the were born with a vagina.   I agree with Ben Shapiro that when someone is born a man (with x and y chromosomes), they will remain a man, no matter how much they change themselves. Saying a person can change gender is like saying they can change their race, or even their species. Ben Shapiro is an asshole, however, who feels that his world views should be shared by everyone. I tolerate and accept transgenders because I know that my view on things is not the quintessential view on things and frankly, I don't care enough to make a big deal out of it. If I ever meet you I will call you she, madam, or bitch, because I am polite. But if you asked me if I were attracted to you, I would say 'No, because I am not gay'."
"A trans woman dismantling Ben Shapiro and his pompous, petty bullshit makes me giggle with absolute glee."
"In Greek language we have the ''plural of politeness'', which means you refer to a person not as ''he'' or ''she'' but as ''they''. Is that a lie that referring to ONE person as they are many?

I'm a psychology undergrad but I'm not good with science."
"This was very confusing but I love it so much."
"Thank fucking god there are other people out there that understand the difference between sex (genetics) and gender (a cultural creation). I can't stand the idea that people don't get the obvious difference between the two. It's hard to have ANY debate at all if people can't get the basic concepts of what makes a person male/female verse what makes them a man/woman."
"So Shapiro FEELS he is entitled to be self-centered and lazy and thus ignores FACTS that would challenge his worldview... yeah, that would be congruous with his modus operandi. Thank you for killin' it once again Contra. As a cis male trying to be a better, more compassionate, more educated representative of the group I identity with I truly appreciate the work you are doing."
"I've always considered myself the logical type. I've viewed my emotions as a weakness.

"Here's my brand new favourite argument, having gotten karyotyped recently. Yeah, I am a woman who is trans, but I also have two X chromosomes, aaaaaand no Y chromosomes. The biology argument is invalid for me, so why are you using the wrong pronouns for me?"
"Don't care about the correct use of words or your feelings. Trans people are just imitations of the actual thing / aka trans woman is just a man-trans man is just a woman ,with mental delusions . examples,schizophrenics/bipolar with multiple personality disorders .. So one can believe they're  lucifer reborn i na humans body,the fact stands that they're just human and not satan,and you would only call them satan in consideration for their feelings or out of fear of being called A demonphobe ,or because society tells you to,or they do it so they look like a  good person ."

That's the simplest explanation for it. I'm not a man or woman I'm [trash] neither and want to exist in a world where that neitherness is shown, physically, socially and as an ace person. no sex please."
"Hey, could you please at some point do an in depth historical, psychological, biological, and social look at the nonbinary?

"Second video I've seen from you but god I love your personality! The adoptive parent argument really made me re-think things (not that I was ever against calling trans people by he/she but I never thought of it that way). Two of my best friends are adopted and they'd be fuckin' pissed if I acted like their parents weren't really their parents. So why do we treat trans people differently? What harm comes to us by referring to trans people by he/she? Nothing. People just want an excuse to be an asshole. Are we examining the chromosomes of every person we interact with? No. So who cares? If I can brighten someone's day by correcting my pronoun usage when asked to then better believe I'll make an effort to do so!"

"I think a great way to metaphor this for cis men is to use an example of the word 'Sir' among cis men. Some men expect you to call them sir (think a drill Sargent or the father from Leave it to Beaver); and some others are offended by the term 'Don't call me Sir, I work for a living!'  -- and the expected way to handle it is two step--  Step 1 - use the term you naturally come  up with before knowing their preference;  Step 2 - after hearing a preference, decide if you want to cater to the person (or not).  It's already an ingrained social script we can follow that can easily be adopted for gender pronouns without much effort."

"Thank you for the insight into the 'they/them' non-binary world. I have really been struggling with this one. As someone who made a career out of writing intelligence analysis I must admit to having become a bit of 'grammer nazi' (gasp! and, no, Godwins law does not apply here!). I am super pro LGBTQ, et.al., and am happy to call anybody whatever they want. However (comma, pause for effect) the They/Them pronoun absolutely grates on the singular/plural disagreement front. I know it shouldn't, but it does. I'm very happy with 'you' (direct speech) and 'that person' (indirect speech). I am thrilled with calling two or more (is that a gaggle?, a congress?, a flirtation? ;-) non-binary individuals as they/them. But I am having a very hard time wrapping my head around calling a single individual by a plural descriptor. I want to not only be polite, but also supportive. Maybe I should think of a non-binary individual who prefers a plural descriptor as a tri-part human; me, myself, and I. I guess that would be like addressing multiple personalities in a single individual. Not the same, I know. But it might be help me to be a better person to (wait for it...) Them. Anyway, I have learned much today from my random landing on your channel. Kind regards,"

"Mentioning that not all languages are gendered = win 25:22"
"The arguments about language are a bit of a muddle. On the descriptivist side, it's not entirely relevant that most people use 'she' to refer to you. To really understand the meaning, or usage, of words, one must examine how they are used in all contexts, by everyone, at all times. Clearly the defining link between the signifier 'she' and what it represents is the biological concept of 'female human'. There may be outlying forms of use which do not correspond to its general usage, but the importance of the aforementioned conceptual link is undeniable.  On the prescriptivist side, saying that these words should be used a certain way is all very well. You can do as you wish. But you don't really have any say at all in the way *other people* use words. The fact that you want to be referred to with some particular word, and not with another, does not mean everyone else is forced to agree with you."
"A shop called Videogames For Lesbians would make so much money, why haven't the libertarian free market boner champs figured that out yet"
"I'm very undecided on the subject of pronoun usage. Part of me is fully supportive of anyone's and everyone's pursuit of happiness, identity and meaning (so long as that does not involve hurting or discriminating against other ppl ofc), and in that spirit, I will call anyone whatever they wanna be called. Another part of me feels that 'he' and 'she' should really be reserved for biological gender, and (!) gender pronouns, adjectives and names should generally only be used in medical, sexual contexts and the like, where actual biological distinction is relevant.   Humanity has a lot of biological diversity, such as genders, races, physical capabilities, mental capabilities and so on. Among these types of biological diversity, gender is the only one that has given rise to its own set of pronouns. Ofc there are adjectives and names we use to address groups that have one common biological denominator. But when we use those, we typically only refer to this biological meaning, factual biological implications and practical consequences, well knowing that extrapolating any further meaning would be wrong, as the majority of us seems to agree that one's biological make-up does not define one's character, ethics, humanity, or one's role in or value to society. Equally, most of us are aware of the dangers and fallacies of generalizations per se. ¬† So, the question is: Why do we treat gender differently? Why do we accept gender connotation beyond biology, while we reject this kind of thinking for any other type of biological diversity, and call people who use it that way Nazis, racists etc.? Isn't the type of transgender, that is not induced by biological gender dysphoria, just another expression of sexism buying into some stereotype of what it means to be female? I do get how this acceptance of gender connotation beyond biology has developed historically, and how it comes to us naturally to think and speak in categories and add meaning beyond biology to these categories over time, but I think it's time to abandon this concept. We should work towards using these terms only in regard to biology, where they only have one well-defined and factual meaning. This way we can focus our language and thinking on the humanity that unifies us, while leaving little to no room for stereotypes and prejudice."

"Just because we didn't technically discover chromosomes till later than pronouns, doesn't mean that it didn't still line up with our PRACTICAL understanding of sex...yes? I mean because there were obviously, men and women sexes far earlier than when we actually discovered chromosomes.  Seems to be tricky semantics, when you actually think about it...but I know that's hard."

Thank you!!"
"As a thing, I really want Contrapoints to do a video on demisexual/asexual/aromantic people and inclusionism/exclustionism in the LGBT community. I've been seeing it more and more online and I honestly don't know what to think about it (which I guess is shitty).   As a lesbian on one side I have other lesbians saying that including Demi/ace/aro people in the LGBT community is allowing cishet people in, which I can understand their concerns. On the other side, I'm scared that some TERF-y shit might happen and I find that deeply spooky. I've never been one for gatekeeping. I guess it's a bit late to drop a comment and expect her to see it, but nonetheless, it's worth the try."

"Someone might have already said something about this, but I wanted to bring up that the 'futch' scale was kind of made as a joke. Both Femme and Butch are historically important identities with their own communities, and go far deeper than just a method of presentation. While it's easy to denote being 'futch' in lesbianism, the reason for butch and femme sub-identities is specifically the need for lesbian identities that represent femininity and masculinity in exclusively male divorced ways. Both identities have a rich and interesting history that goes far deeper than being feminine or masculine and also a lesbian."
"Hey there! Huge fan here! I was wondering if you would be interested in making a video about the recent thot audit crusade that is plaguing social media.

"Damn. These are great points."
"guys ben is ftm he just has really bad internalized transphobia üò§üò§  let him cope in his own way"
"As far as I'm concerned, everyone has the inalienable right to chose whatever personal pronoun they want. The rub is that you can't make anyone acknowledge your choice of pronouns. I have no problem referring to transwomen as 'she', but Ben Shapiro can't be forced to make that same acknowledgment. I disagree with him, but I can't force words out of his mouth."

"How should we use language? -Proceeds with some marxist bullshit about how language is a political tool. -Has no grasp of inductive concept formation and the correspondence theory of truth."
"Well presented. I would only say that comparing the word 'parent' to 'he/she' is misleading. Shapiro makes the argument that he/she are used to describe sex. It doesn't require biologists to become linguists,  but in order to explain something scientifically then the definition of the word (despite words being naturally evolving) must remain constant. It's why animals and plants have scientific names. You would never refer to a dolphin as a trans male or female. You would only refer to a dolphin as a he or she if they were male or female....because that is what is true scientifically AND appropriate socially . If a dolphin took care of an offspring not their own, you wouldn't call that dolphin it's parent because it's true scientifically and it's socially appropriate. Your argument still rests on what is considered socially appropriate, but that must always fall second to established fact. Every nuanced situation in between is a manifestation of the problems the trans community causes for themselves in a cis/heteronormative society. The majority doesn't need to bend to the will of the mentally ill. We do however, attempt to allow those people to live in peace. no interaction is necessary if need be."
"Would love to see you DESTROY lil ben ‚Äî in a debate."
"I agree with all of your points. But something about those long green fake nails grosses me out so much that i want to dislike the video. I won't, though, for the benefit of humanity."
"@ContraPoints : I think your argument about pronouns not being related to gender, based on 'history', is appealing in a way but also completely unsustainable and false.  Yes, pronouns were in use before the discovery of chromosomes. But even without chromosomes, they described what has always been known, i.e that men and women are differentiated based on their anatomy. That has only been opposed very, very recently. So 'he' has always been used to talk about a biological man, and 'she' to talk about a biological woman, regardless of the discovery of chromosomes. So they were indeed 'biological' pronouns...  If 'he' can be 'she' and vice versa, how are we to define the sex of a baby for example ? I know most transgender people don't care about that and want to actually abolish it (cf Tasmania), but it is a legitimate question. What most transpeople are asking for is a complete change of how society has functionned for thousands of years, just to please less than 1% of the population (probably more in the years to come if we continue to teach children that they can - even should - reconsider their 'gender'). And I'm not even going to address all the questions concerning compelled use of pronouns and all the possible ways in which this will cause problems (in prisons, in medicine, etc...), and the fact that trans people are unable to agree on what pronouns should be used... And if there's a legal punishment for misusing the pronoun, who's going to tell me what pronoun I should use when I meet you ?? All of that just for the sake of sparing someone else's feelings... I've been called 'madam' when I had long hair (even though I had a beard and was clearly dressed as a man), I just laughed about it, I wasn't traumatized, I didn't ask for safe spaces or non discriminatory laws..."

"'we all agree on biology' in this case maybe but does the left as a whole understand it. would assume they like to pretend someone can magically turn into a woman and they are so adamant in their believe that said person is a woman that they disregard biological facts, and it has nothing to do with language. this is made obvious especially in languages that dont have gender pronouns. (me coming from one of those) in context of these languages gender is only biological, so ones appearance does no longer matter as there is no he and she in the language. you will always be what your biological sex is. how people view you either as a man or a woman will be only between their own ears.  of course we get around with this kind of system, our language possesses 15 cases which function like 'with', 'of', 'from' in english, and this being just one example. the only thing as or more diverse seems to be hungary, and they are in the same finno-ugric language family."

"Right now there are 10,143 comments on this video. I don't expect love, or hate. But a safe space to share something I haven't had told anyone. Why a youtube video? Because Contrapoints makes me feel safe. Even if no one reads this, at least it's finally out there... When I was younger, 14, I started to wear boyshorts and baggy shirts. I felt more comfortable this way, and it helped me deal with my ever growing breasts, which turned into DDs. While this was going on, I was actually mocked for my bust sized and made to feel gross for them. No one seemed to like them, and I didn't either. I tried to strap them down only once, admiring how much flatter I looked only to almost pass out from restricting blood flow, it hurt there was nothing I could do, and my mom being flat was only jealous, making me feel like one day I'd appreciate them. My face, I always felt was endogenous, if only I could flatten myself out, I could be mistaken for a boy. when I was 16 I stole a picture of a guy and pretended to be a boy online, I only stopped because there were girls who were falling for me, and I didn't want to break their hearts. Still when I was 16 I was rather large for my age and boys IRL would grab me when they had the chance, but due to other issues I have, I stood there unable to respond, every. single. time. I started to dress more feminine and embrace my appearance and high pitch voice, I felt like I understood my irreversible role. Online though... I'd go to 4chan, and learned how to be savage, and I learned to blend in. I made sure the way I spoke would be taken seriously, I was a guy, and there was no way you'd be able to tell I wasn't. No one questioned it, even responding to me as 'he', and the mistake felt good. I started to notice when I talked to my friends verbally it was different than when I'd talk to them through text. The voice in my head sounded different, deeper, than what I actually sounded like (and still does). I started to smoke cigarettes to lower my voice, just so I could be taken seriously, or at least that was my excuse. Still, I thought I was a normal girl. Who didn't want to be a boy? Now a days, I don't feel like either. I don't want to be either now, but I don't understand why. I always wonder if I had been born later would I have transitioned? Would I, a 28 year old be less confused by now? Or maybe I'm just gender-fluid. It's hard for me to tell..."

"i've dealt with gender dysphoria after realizing i identified as nonbinary, but after watching this i feel a sense of relief and validation that i've needed for a while. thank you so much."
"I think it's pretty confusing, it works when someone clearly look like a specific gender, but not when it's just in someone's head. I think that if we really have to change it up then we should just go with no genders at all and have a common term for everyone. Last thing this world needs is more tribal factions.    Thing is, it's really blurred these days, there are tons of women that don't wear makeup or clothes that are obviously made for women. Similarly I don't see any reason why a man can't wear a dress and still identify as male, it's just fashion after all, few hundred years ago wigs and makeup on men was the norm. So wearing makeup or not wearing makeup does not identify how anyone sees themselves. We can't start calling all women who don't dress up like a traditional woman a he, so in my opinion it doesn't matter what you look like, only what people identify as.   And the whole point here is to not hurt peoples feelings right? People wouldn't have feelings about things if they didn't attach themselves to it and made it part of their identity in the first place, we just feel hurt because we feel like something is taken from us. If you call someone an asshole they'd get hurt if they felt that wasn't true, it conflicts with their identity. So the best solution would be to just stop using genders in conversation and instead just have one pronoun for humans, we all identify as human so that could never go wrong.   And to take that a little further we might be better of getting rid of our identity/ego all together and start identifying as a collective. Maybe the only pronouns we'll need in the future is us and we. Now that would be true change."

"I don't think the existence of third gender pronouns is the problem. The problem is that the overwhelming majority of cases you assume someone's gender by their appearance and use language accordingly and in good faith. To be attacked for this procedure is highly problematic, because it assumes bad faith on your end where there wasn't. So 'passing' is the major criteria for the vast majority of interactions. People make snap calls on male/female and act on them - and it makes sense. People do not take non-binary genders into consideration. Not because they are bigoted, but because for the vast, vast majority of interactions they do not come into play.  Even if you are told a pronoun, it is hard to apply it, if it runs counter to the apparent gender. You even brought it forth against Shapiro. So it will take training to get it right and it won't come naturally 100% of the time.  So all I'm asking is: Be relaxed and don't assume bad faith immediately, just because someone uses a wrong pronoun. Even if you already proclaimed your preferred pronoun."

"Ugh, that man is clearly scum. I refuse to refer to him as Shapiro ever again -  I refuse to live a lie."
"this was a lovely video, i enjoyed it!  my personal opinion is that its not biology its not linguistic it is just social grace. you just use whatever they want you to use; if you are not comfortable with what they want you to use, then dont fucking address them by a pronoun - or even better yet, just dont address them ever since you would clearly be too big of a child to open up your mind enough to be gracious. ISSUE SOLVED :D"
"Shapiro's arguments don't even hold water if you *do* want to argue on the basis of biology. He doesn't seem aware that XXY, XY0, XYY and people who are biologically hermaphroditic actually exist. I don't know who is going around teaching people that humans are only XX or XY full stop, but it needs to end. There are plenty of other interesting biological facts that don't care about Shapiro's feelings, but I can't sit here typing all day!"

"I'm a big fan of Ben Shapiro and I've seen some of your videos, including your debate a year or two ago with Blaire.  I watched this entire video and it's funny and well done.  You don't actually destroy anything other than a number of strawman arguments, but you are entertaining.  Ben has specifically said in a private setting, he's not going out of his way to call you a male.  However if you for example wanted to apply for a female only schlorship, push yourself into female only spaces or participate in a women's sport he would rightly point out you are biologically male and NOT female.  Live however you like, but don't force people to agree to your subjective claims because 'kindness'.  If that's the case I suppose Rachel Dolezal is black, or at the very least 'trans-racial'. And I'm not 'cis'.  I reject your made up language for me.  I'm simply a woman, I will always be a woman and I do not have to dress up like a (admitedly very cool) drag queen in order to present myself as a woman.  I can be as butch or feminine as I please and I have been and will always be a woman"

Secondly, thanks for breaking this down a bit for the cissies lol honestly tbh I think gender should be up to the individual and whether or not someone understands another's gender, respecting it is 100% free. Like why thee actual fuck do people feel empowered by invalidating an experience that they. are. not. experiencing................. Don't understand that I love my tater tots and coochie and makeup and long hair but absolutely do not connect with the idea of 'femininity' and that being called my dude or big boy or using he/him or they/them pronouns is decently affirming??? That's okay, you don't need to understand. But it's simple, if you want to invalidate my experience as I am then you don't respect me and therefore do not deserve to be around me 0:) so truly honestly it's sad for you because I'm deeply divine and you poor transphobic fool are missing out on someone spectacular.

"Pronouns are shorthand, and can be substituted (awkwardly) with nouns and names. 'When Adam stubs Adam's toe on Adam's bedpost, Adam swears loudly at the bedpost' instead of 'When Adam stubs his toe on his bedpost, he swears loudly at it'. The purpose of language isn't to accurately reflect reality, it's to facilitate the communication of a message reasonably succinctly and unambiguously. If being technically correct makes your message less clear, consider being less correct and more clear. Of course, Shapiro perfectly communicates his message of every trans person being delusional members of their biological genders. It's a matter of respect and courtesy to call someone their preferred pronoun, within reason, not a matter of honesty and reality and the noble virtue of never telling a lie. Also, being completely 'honest' would lead to murder, for fucks sake!  'Do I look fat in this dress?' she asks him.  'Yes, and every other dress as well, honey,' comes the reply."

"Bravo; although I do find a modicum of truth in some of Shapiro's arguments, you've done a splendid job getting to crux of his purposeful misgendering, which is at worst abusive and at best unintentionally inflammatory."
"I'll be honest. I'm nonbinary (broadly speaking...) and I've no idea what the fuck it means to myself. There was a time in my life where I considered myself binary trans but I found out that taking hormones could very possibly aggravate a medical condition of mine that already causes me a significant degree of sadness and dysfunction. That experience made me consider my future plans for my self image, and I had to re-contextualize a lot of the presentation that is within the social bounds of my assigned gender at birth such that I was able to still feeling as if I was able to express my 'true' inner self. I'm still trying to navigate this and in online spaces I'm very careful about not divulging my assigned gender because I prefer for people to draw their own conclusion."

"I'm a genderfluid guy, but prefer people calling me 'she' since I feel like it suits me better, even when I feel completely like a guy, I feel like my female name(Jessie) works better for me, than my original name. It's simply soothing for me, to be called Jessie, and 'she', even if most people don't understand that, or accept it, which I don't really mind, but I love the people who call me what I prefer, cause they seem to truly care about who I choose to be, and show myself as <3"

"I agree with most of what is said. Except, people using the term nonbinary. It seems to suggest that one exists outside the binary and I don't think its possible to be outside of the binary because of our species as humans. Most nonbinary use elements of both female and male behavior.  I think its fair to say that one resides somewhere in between the binary, not out side it."

"I am a total descriptivist in grammar and I think that the prescriptivist approach is typical of the people who try to assume an elevated position with respect to others (those who don't follow the prescription). Thus I think everyone should use the pronoun that he/she thinks is appropriate (yeah, I prescript descriptivism). On the other hand, I may use the pronoun the other requests just not to hurt the sensibility, but I don't think anyone should be mad at a thing like this.  Also, I love you."

"The problem with non-binary is that there's no sex attached to this, so it's just an abstract. For people who live in the real world, this doesn't really make sense. The third gender in other worlds are always about homosexuality, gender non conformity, intersex or transsexuals. So this isn't a third sex, it's just a regressive way to see people who are not cis and heterosexuals. Non-binary keeps that trend going because they're not conforming to gender stereotypes, and I have huge problems with this. That said, I call they people who ask for it, but I won't call people neo-pronouns."

You gave into 'the aesthetic.' I can't find much in this video of value, it may as well have been me sitting down and watching a Ben Shapiro video with literally any of my friends that lean even slightly to the left. There used to be an element to your content where you were able to fully immerse us in both sides of an argument (one of my favorite examples being a lot of your antifa vs centrist videos, but perhaps your ability to communicate those viewpoints with more nuance gives away your own, now much clearer than it used to be bias) and thereby give us a more well rounded perception of an issue, but now it kind of just feels like stereotypical tumblr circlejerking.

If that doesn't work you can infiltrate the education system and brainwash the defenceless young, you can infiltrate political parties and make them adopt your delusion as part of their platform, you can infiltrate the courts and make your delusion legally enforceable, you can infiltrate the dictionaries and change the definition of words.

And ‚Äúthey‚Äù is the easy example. What do we do with things like zer and zay? I have no argument identifying anyone as he/she.

"Hello everybody! I'm a hetero cis male, and I try to learn (and my English is not that good, so sorry for the mistakes I surely will make)... maybe this question is just stupid, but what I ask myself: We all know, that gender is a socio-cultural concept, which we learn by being in this society; and also, that there are biological differences between men and women, but the concept of binary sex, that is called natural, is a scientific concept and artificial as well. My question is: If we all would live in a society, in which these concepts wouldn't exist, or in a society that is truely genderneutral, or in other words, in which gender would have no importance for a person's identity; would in such a society exist any persons, who are 'born in the wrong body'? How do body/biological sex in a materisitic sense (if you HAVE a vagina/a penis, if you can have children or not etc., but also the chromosomes, hormons and all that stuff), the concepts of gender and personal identity relate... exacty? What is it, that doesn't 'fit'? Is it the gender or the sex/the body?"

"Interesting video...funny and well argued. However...the discussion really is about how pronouns are used. First, in a conversational English we use pronouns to refer to third persons. So there are very few instances which I would ever have a discussion with you, where I would refer to you as 'he or she'...I would say 'you'...now if I'm speaking to another person about you...I might say 'she or he', but never 'you'. The second layer to this is why people use pronouns... people use gendered pronouns based on what they know or see...not based on what you believe about yourself. For instance...if I see a male lion eating a Gazelle...I could say ' look that lion is eating a Gazelle...He must be hungry' I use the pronoun 'he' because of what I know about the male lion...what that lion feels or believes is irrelevant. The lion does not get to dictate what descriptors I use when speaking to another individual. So demanding that I use she while I speak to others when referring to you...is not going to work... because no one thinks you are really a she...even though you live as a woman...we know you aren't...at least some of us know...so in our private conversations we will likely  refer to you as he...or maybe she depending on mood. However If I'm standing right in front of you and talking about you to another person...I probably would use she. The nonbinary gender queer gender fluid people are going to have to come to terms with the reality that there are not discrete gender differences between them...these are just lables...and people are going to say what they know...not what you want them to believe. Most people find this kind of language policing to be a bridge too far. One could argue that it is you that must accommodate the larger society not the reverse. So in other words if you cannot pass...you get the pronouns that most fits your gender  presentation. Like in your video...if you're a 200lb dude with five o'clock shadow in a dress...it's unreasonable to require people call you 'she'...they perceive you to be  a fraud...and will default to what they know....that a man in a dress is still a man."

"Personally, I wish we could do away with all  pronouns and titles (Miss, Ms, Mr, etc), I would love it if we just used 'Comrade.'  Though it is tainted with political overtones that offend a lot of people, I like it for its more original non-political meaning of just friend or ally.  Besides, it's just such a cool word to say!"
"Hello everyone, I admittedly am a fan of Ben Shapiro but I came to this channel because I realized that I need to diversify my viewing and Tim Pool had mentioned this channel on a panel at Mythcon, so here I am. Now I do agree with Ben  and many others that makes cannot become females and vice versa (genetics) but where I disagree with him is on how someone should refer to someone that is trans (don't get me wrong, I'm not going so far as z, zed, etc. But he she seems perfectly reasonable, except if I believe the person is young and in a time of confusion or if it's clear that it's a play for power). This is where the libertarian side of me comes into play; welcome to a free society do what the hell you want as long as it doesn't interfere with the rights of others (i.e. don't tell me or anyone else that they MUST call you by your preferred pronouns especially if your plan is to have it mandated through law).  Thank you Contra for expressing your views in an intelligent and easy to comprehend way. I look forward to watching more."

"plz debate ben ritenow <3333"
"Shapiro says he doesn't want to explain to his daughter that she could become a man. I'd like to imagine that he is just as terrified explaining to his young daughter that she will become a woman. Periods and pregnancy aside, Shapiro would have to abandon his notion that institutional misogyny doesn't exist and/or 'damage' and 'confuse' her psyche by telling her that her existence as a woman is a target for predatory, incompetent men. Either way, he only imposes his false narrative of gender because it's the one that works for his ego. He'll probably just leave this talk to his wife though."

And I don't necessarily mean it in a negative way; freaks can be funny, freaks can even sometimes be brilliant. But being 'freak' just means 'deviating drastically from the norm'. And the norm is boring. You are definitely not boring. Instead of arguing for people to call you stuff like 'a lady', just accept the fact that you are a freak. Remember what Tyrion Lannister used to say. The world might for a short time even indulge you in your glorious freakishness, but sooner or later they are going to just move on. They will find some other freak for them to be entertained."
"Your point about how someone's gendered experience can differ from their identity is very interesting and honest. It helps explain how a trans-femme AMAB person who comes out later in life has been raised with male-privilege, even if they don't identify that way.

The insidious ways he lays traps trying to humiliate people and how he claims to be about logic and facts but tries to use insidious language to rile people‚Äôs emotions.

"I have a question that harks back to 'the aesthetic' but is also relevant to this video.¬† I understand that everything in these two recent videos are meant to be practical responses that address a lot of general uncertainty surrounding being trans. Natalie refers to how a person presents themselves (how they look as well as how they act, fill space, etc) as the determinant of their gender and the basis for her explanation about why people reflexively call her, 'she', which implies to be that to be considered a man or a woman on a practical level, a person must practice at least some conformity to protracted gender roles which the Old Feminists and non-binary folks have spent a lot of time rejecting.¬† To me, a cis-woman (sry) raised by an old school feminist, it seems that a lot of the performative aspects of womanhood Natalie might be referring to have been designed by men for the convenience or enjoyment of men.¬† Many traditionally female mannerisms/dispositions that may or may not be natural to an individual woman are simultaneously reinforced by men and used as a cudgel against her (emotional sensitivity/awareness for instance, or the use of makeup).¬† So to someone outside the trans community, I have to wonder if it is harmful to aim to replicate the parts of womanhood that have those loaded implications or if its a great thing because it means that women across communities are helping each other shrug off the association of 'female things' with male expectations just by doing exactly what they want.¬† Basically, is modern 'female performance' inextricably linked to mysogyny or is it just that we live in a world that punishes female 'performance'? Does it matter much when we're talking about personal independence?¬†   My second question is in relation to the implications that this gender performance argument has for non-binary people.¬† Is it somewhat undermining to suggest that recognition and legitimacy can only come with performing one specific gender?   And just to be clear, I think individuals should all do whatever they want.¬† I support trans rights.  Also i love Natalie.¬† I think she's creative, intelligent and doing meaningful work. SO this is not a hate comment, not meant to be hurtful, just a curiosity comment lol"

It seems like it would become a frivolous construct, as we broaden our definitions of man- and womanhood. How do you envision a world for Transpeople looking once we reach total gender equality? If there's no functional difference, would there still be a need to assert 'I'm a man' or 'I'm a woman'? As an effeminate Cis-male, I struggle with trying to place myself on the spectrum often, and I feel like this is sort of in the same vein. Thanks for any thoughts!

"Ugh, I hate this. I can see the views of both of you and I disagree/agree with both of you. On one hand, I don't believe that there are more than 2 genders (I think most of the 'Genders' are feelings or personalities, so I will just use genderneutral pronouns to stop the arguments) but on the other hand, it is straight up transphobic to a transgender by their original pronouns if they prove they have gender dysphoria."
"If I dont know you, I will just refer to the pronoun that you look like until you correct me. I dont know youre life.  That being said, I understand why accidently misgendering can be upsetting.

"Hey Contra, I'm still a little confused on some of the things you bring up in this video. You say that trans women who stay in boymode for whatever reason or are not recognized as women in public are still valid but 'hypothetical'. Likewise, on Twitter you've said that AMAB NB people who remain masculine presenting are 'weak'. Despite these statements, you insist they are still the gender identity they prefer. I'm not sure I understand this. I am a somewhat androgynous trans girl and I'm very early in my transition. I still get misgendered in public very regularly. Does this make me only 'hypothetically' a woman until I present fully feminine? This all gets a little muddled because feminine cis men or masculine cis women aren't trans women or men respectively, are they only 'hypothetically' their preferred gender? I really don't get this concept you're applying, and would appreciate some clarity. It's made me considerably frustrated. I get that you are probably a very busy woman, and I greatly admire your work here on Youtube--my partner and I find it very entertaining and well made--so if anyone else would like to chime in and help me out I would appreciate that very much. Thank you and keep up the good work."

As oppose to his normal call-ins of incels who complain about SJWS or 'comic gate' or whatever.   He has Aydin Paladin on there often and she presents so many arguments I feel like you could easily counter.  Anyway, I feel like you should get into contact with Dick Masterson, only because I think it would make for a great podcast I could listen to at work."
"Damn i really appreciate how well made this is"
"The genetic argument says one thing to me: they are an idiot.   Remember, a Y chromosome only alters a female fetus. Everything for a human to exist obviously already needs to be there without it... or female humans.... wouldnt exist.  So, it is perfectly possible to have an XY, CIS, woman. Yes, cis. With AIS (Androgen insensitivity syndrome), in which the body doesn't recognize androgens, the only thing a Y chromosome does is prevent the fetus' undifferentiated gonads from becoming ovaries. They don't become testes, and without androgens, the external body develops totally female. That Y chromosome may as well not exist.   These women (who overwhelmingly identify as women) usually don't even notice until they fail to start having periods. Checking this out, the undifferentiated gonads are discovered, and unless their family freaks out and makes a big deal (which, sadly, happens) they can take hormone replacement and live normally.  There are lots of other conditions and phenotypes that affect sex. Anyone who mentions a Y chromosome or lack thereof is just a run-of-the-mill idiot."

"This video is great, but I think it's worth pointing out that Shaprio's 'fact' rubric is not consistent with his overall philosophy and metaphysics.  I suspect this is the case because the 'fact' posture allows him to attack what he perceives as 'left canards' for the political currency is creates.. and not because of any commitment to objective fact.  An issue with taking him on face value is that this recreates his rhetorical trickery as a starting point, and that's kinda letting him have his cake and eat it. It would of course be rude to immediately attack his evident faith, but then he is more than happy to do that to others."
"Wow this is extremely convincing! Honestly I was of the Ben Shapiro mindset (albeit willing to use the pronouns that the person who I was speaking to preferred), but this video was a great way to open my mind on how words are just sounds and we can ascribe the meaning to them that we want. It's not like we are calling the engine in a car a brake pad, which would be a serious detriment to Western society. I understand we are just calling people by how they would like to be referred which is both practical and compassionate."
"Honestly I find the overall debate over this topic to be vaguely short sided. When it comes to something that exists on a person to person level if you are purposefully using a pronoun to offend someone then no amount of moral or objective reasoning changes that attitude. If someone unintentionally misgenders someone these types of debates gears people up to being defensive and wanting to attack the other person on a debate. (That's more of an anecdote but I've seen it too often to discredit it as only my experience.) Even on a person to person level a situation of being misgendered is a small issue that can be quickly and respectfully dealt with without much friction. I have a good few transexual friends who I discuss alot of these hot button topics with. They agree that its either just dealt with quickly and respectfully or the person is just trying to offend so you ignore them.  You can't implement something like not misgendering someone at an institutional level either because of the intentionally grey malleable nature of gender fluid-ness. Bureaucracy only functions properly when dealing in terms of black and white objectivity.   I just never understood who this debate was for. It always feels like argument for argument sake. Catharsis against an imagined strawman argument. Like when you pretend to debate people on your commute to work or in the shower. Both the right-wing and left-wing side. Its such a moot thing.    I don't know that's just my two cents. What are your thoughts?"
"Could you do a video on the different terms and such, living in Canada where our main parties are Liberal and Conservative and being next to the US where their parties are republicans and Democrats it can get confusing by the meaning of the ‚Äúbig L‚Äù or ‚Äúlittle l‚Äù liberals and so on for the other groups"
"Shapiro is wrong in the biological sense too by the way. You just need to know a lot of biology to realize it. Chromosome expression doesn't always go as expected and there are people out there who have male chromosomes but have vaginas. Also being biologically male depends on the expression of dozens of genes outside of the famous XX and XY chromosomes. Furthermore, A LOT goes on in puberty to make you truly a man a truly a woman in the biological sense. Finally, recent studies show teenage transgender brains resemble more the brains of the people of their desired gender than the brains of the gender they were assigned at birth. That means there is some evidence that there is a biological component to being transgender. Ben Shapiro is a d'ck... in his childish desire to 'destroy snowflakes', whatever the f'ck that means, he bashes a community that has the highest suicide rate by saying 'a man who thinks he's a woman'. He is a child, immature, socially slow, lacks perspective, civility and scientific knowledge, believes he's the shit and doesn't really know anything about anything. Don't forget he's also FUNDED by some nasty people to say those things. I hope he's wife comes out transgender"

"Your hazy use of language is awful. A parent is not just someone who is a genetic ancestor to a child, it is also a custodian of a child. If you wanted to ask if they conceived the child in the case of an adoptive parent, the answer is no.   If you are suggesting that woman means two things as well, a.) someone who resembles a woman, vs. b.) someone who is biologically a woman; then that will depend on what definition the person uses.   In daily life, I always use the appearance of a person to determine their gender, so if you did a good enough job resembling a woman I would call you that. It is impractical to think I could guess correctly when someone tries their best impersonation.  However, if we are talking about a woman in terms of objective biological functionality, hormones, sex expressed characteristics, the ability to give birth, then you are not a woman. No more so than a person who puts on cat ears and a tail becomes a cat.  It should be a personal choice as to what definition someone uses, prescribed by individual liberty.  Now this is where you guys always mess up. You make the debate appear to be about being polite to the poor downtrodden oppressed minority, but the real debate is can we use the power of the state to force others to use your definition. The answer to that question, if you respect the individual liberty of others, is a big fat no. Even if it may be mean, an individual has the right to use the definition they came to by their own logic."

"Beautifully done (including the nails).  I (frighteningly) agree with *everything* she said in this video! I'm also a big fan of the non-binary plural-as-singular 'they'. But I get in trouble when I'm asked to use 'Xim' or 'Shim' or 'Xer' or 'Zurg' for someone.   I will do as they (zurg) ask, provided they (zurg) use 'Lord God Almighty' as *my* gender pronoun. It's as if they (or zurgs) are demanding I speak in a foreign language (and not English as it is commonly practiced).  Language is a cultural (group) phenomenon, as ContraPoints astutely notes.  Person to person, I will use a personal name to refer to someone, or if they wish, he/she/they - but I will probably not use 'zurg' if that is their (zurg's) unique pronoun of choice. When they (or zurg) is not present, I will use 'they' if they (zurg) are non-binary (and do not want 'he' or 'she').  When they (zurg) *is* present, I will use their (zurg's) name - because I respect them (zurg). If they (zurg) insist I refer to them (zurg) as 'zurg' when they (zurg) are not present, then it's quid pro quo: 'zurg' will have to respect my pronoun choice: 'Lord God Almighty'. If they (zurg) can do that, I will do my best, in good faith, to return the favor and call them (zurg) 'zurg'."

"Fantastic video ..such verve,wit,self effacement,charm and depth of understanding..and even occasional flashes of sweedish muscle nazis. Some no doubt conservative,fixed as they are in the slightly wooden and flinty dialectical opportunism of privilege and power,tell you flatly that their issue is the concept of disgust.Disgust has been looked into of course and appears to be when an object begins to lose its form and become something else - forgive the examples - when shit becomes diarrhoea,when food begins to decompose etc..It seems,regardless of rationale, they have little tolerance for ambiguity and react with barely concealed nose holding.It is this putative pathological pursuit of certainty that allows them to ignore the intrinsic ambiguity of language and the provisional and contingent nature of reality - interpose God/western civ/ahistorical junghole/methodological assumption de jure etc.Well,i could go on but suffice to say the trans community may continue to find rictus welcomes in suburbia and curious lingering blankness in the flyovers so the best hope and fun is always with city cosmopolitans."

I appreciate your willingness to put out there your experiences battling with gender dysphoria and your transition journey. I really resonated with 'The Aesthetic' in terms of validity of being trans. I identify as NB (genderfluid specifically) but, for me, instead of embracing the 'aesthetic' I've for the most part rejected it. 'We're all born naked and the rest is drag.' - You helped me realise the depth and validity of that statement. I do occasionally embrace my femininity in a similar way - as a baby drag queen still playing with make up in my bedroom.  Looking forward to achieving the same amount of misery as everyone else :thumbsup:"

"7:13 for easter egg"
"This man can't even come up with a coherent argument. Instead trying to weave and invent new arguments that are clearly lacking in logical analysis and just opening the door and possibility to dictate everything. This man and as well as so many other people are simply attempting to dictate what is fact or opinion.   A girl has a vagina and a boy has a penis. That is biology. It doesn't matter what you look like, how you act, or what you express. You accept the biology but you say its a grammatical point? That is ludicrous.    You're trying to change grammar to fit your desire. At 7:01, and following afterwards, he made the point that the words he and she were used before we discovered the Karyotype. That is yet again, another ludicrous point.   Here is why. Simple. He and she were used to refer to the gender of each person. Therefore we must conclude that means a 'he' has a penis and a 'she' has a vagina. There is no argument on that historical and grammatical fact. When we discovered the Karyotype, it isn't as if we discovered the idea of biological gender. We already knew about the 2 genders in our species. The Karyotype discovery was a further step into understanding gender, not discovering it in the first place. So the discovery of the karyotype has no logical claim to presume that the pronouns were not gender based prior to its discovery. Biological gender and the grammatical usage of pronouns in a gender context existed prior to that discovery. So the point is completely invalid.   Stay true to the linguistic fact that a 'he' is referenced to men and 'she' is a woman. Men have penises and women have vaginas. That was known to humanity since the homo-sapien evolved into existence. Our ancestors knew this as well.   This is why delusional and mentally ill men can't play barbie. I pray that this man gets the mental help he needs. May God forgive you for your disgusting mental state."

"Hey so I figure the odds of you seeing this comment are infinitesimal, but I have a question about the metaphysics (ish) of identity and specifically gender. So it seems to me that the idea that gender is sociolinguistically constructed is not only transparently true, but also indispensable for trans/a/fluid etc. identity claims. However, I don't know how to square that claim with the claim made by many trans people (I'm not sure you are one of them, of course) that they feel in some metaphysical or at the very least extra-social sense that they are whatever they are. You circled around this a bit in the video but never said it explicitly so I won't put it on you, but some people say stuff like this (I've even heard variations of feelings of being born in the wrong body). It seems to me that this type of sentiment directly implies that gender is at least not entirely sociolinguistic, and has some metaphysical or at least biopsychological basis. Long story short: I don't know how the following two claims can be held together. 1) gender is entirely sociolinguistic (I endorse this claim) and 2) some people have extra-sociolinguistic bases for their identity claims (subjective feelings of womanhood/manhood/etc.). I guess this is why I tend to like the genderfluid/agendered approach, especially politically, in that it attempts to avoid the sort of grovelling tolerance narrative that you rightly critique (you must accept me because I can't help who I am) and at least sometimes asserts a more militant stance of 'I'm whatever I want to be at any given moment.' You seem to be headed that direction at points in this video towards the end, but also express reservations about that type of non-binary genderfucking approach, so I'm just wondering what you think on this."

"'DESTROYS' haha love it! Pronouns, gender identity etc. are individual and complex, and can confuse a lot of people, and that's okay - but to completely deny a person's identity, even in speech, is disrespectful and arrogant almost, Ben shapiro being a perfect example of that when he deliberately chooses to use the wrong pronoun about a person. Though I think to some people, in some cases, it might be like getting some math equation right trying to properly identify someone's gender identity, which complicates an interaction (the risk of feeling awkward, embarrassed, offending someone etc.) exactly because it is such a complex thing... and there's the added complications when gender identity is confused with biology in debates on the topic."

"I stumbled across your channel while working, and I am hooked. Your combination of intellect, debate, humor, aesthetic, sass... it's exactly what I needed. Bravo. Keep going, I cannot wait to see what you do next!  Side note, I never really understood this 'facts don't care about your feelings' nonsense. Of course they don't, but human beings aren't reduced to just facts. We care about each other's feelings (or at least, we should) BECAUSE of our shared human experience in trying to find a place, some deeper meaning."

"Hey I'm a nonbinary person here! I totally get what you were saying about the futch scale! Trying to pin down what exactly my nonbinary identity is has been super hard, because I know I don't identify as a woman, but I also don't identify as a man, so it's like I'm floating in space somewhere on the gender scale where I don't really know where to put myself. Sometimes I loosely identify with gender but other times I really don't identify with any gender at all. And it's really hard to describe that experience to people. And I think that's why so many nonbinary labels exist, because there are so many individual experiences and everyone wants to name their experiences and find other people who have experiences like theirs.    The way I try to explain it to people is a lot like a color spectrum, where certain colors have specific names and other colors might not, but they are still able to be seen and experienced. Compare that to gender identity, where some genders are very specific and have names, and others are a bit less specific and might not be named or might be more fluid, but are still valid experiences and should be valued."

"check me out check me out boom bam bam babbom DEE DOO DEE DO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"Changing gender might be seen by conservatives as a flight from the obligations of manhood and an undeserved retreat into the protections and privileges reserved for women. As the Titanic went down, for example, the men let the women and children get on the lifeboats first. Who gets on the lifeboats first now, they might ask? A man is expected to face his grim duties without shirking, or turning away. Society's greatest contempt is reserved for males who fail to become men. At the heart of the matter might reside the fear of a failure of manhood. Whether this fear is justified is another matter, but Shapiro addresses the transgendered as one might talk to a draft-dodger or a traitor."
"I can't help but notice that despite your growing popularity, none of the usual reactionary dipshit Youtubers have dared to respond to any of your videos. I think that's a good sign that you're on the right track."

"I've been very pro free speech from the beginning and the whole pronoun thing did get me worried. That and  the whole culture of social justice still worries me but you keep me from going full on red."
"1. As a lawyer, when I write documents in English, I use 'they' when it is unknown who exactly the subject is gonna be. For example if I draft rules that apply to an unknown amount of users, whoever they are (including also legal persons), or a contract template that is going to be concluded with whoever will become a client. Not weird to me, just a linguistic solution. But I'm not a native speaker, so I'm not sure if it is also common in native speaker countries? If it is, does Ben Shapiro think it is a LIE? And maybe that such contract provision is thus void? :D  2. My language has no gender pronouns. Just an 'living' and 'non-living' pronoun, and we use them somewhat fluidly (i.e. it is grammatically correct to use the living one for literally everything, if you feel the thing is important... however, it is never correct to use the non-living one for any human or animal, or a legal person, i.e. a company or a state). We are the same species of humans as English speakers. Biologically. But in our case it didn't determine analogous pronouns, so they can wipe their butts with 'it's biology' argument, no logical link there."
"Contrapoints is so amazing that she obviously is a man."

"while i agree to some degree with shapiro's views and the fact that we might have progressed too much to the left and need to take it down a notch i can also see that he's the exact conservative equivalent of the triggered sjw snowflakes he often combats in the sense that he's progressed too far to the right we lack the ability to find common ground between two extremes here"

"People like Ben Shapiro and Milo are just good at shutting down arguments in real time.  They have mastered the art of flashy debating and use that mixed with outrage inducing, politically incorrect 'truths' that mislead arguments.  I've definitely caught myself going down the shit path of considering their arguments until I actually break them down (sometimes with help needed), so I really appreciate videos like this.  Also ***AS A LINGUIST***, pronouns being biologically based is one of the worst arguments I've ever heard."
"Too much things to learn with these LGBBQ+ peoples - too much things now my brain hurt.  I like learn one, at most two things about a subject, and never expand that knowledge network, and you should not call me rude just cuz I prioritize my own comfortable, hetero-cis-normative ignorance over your fair and just social recognition.  No amount of feminazi preaching will change my opinion, because opinions are the solid, rigid rocks that constitute the foundation of society and live in the heads of traditionalists like my(HIM/HIS/HE/MACHODUDE)self.  I can also prove this, if you DM me I will send you my address and you can come try to convince me otherwise - it wunt work heinous liberal demon!"

"You should do a video on the controversy regarding the word 'trap' and whether or not it's offensive to transgender people and if straight people falling for them makes them gay."
"I don't know about you but whenever I talk to or about someone I directly reference their chromosones instead of using pronouns.  People think I'm a weird asshole because of it, but at least I'm being factual!"
"I generally agree with the arguments but I have a problem with the 'there are no people in jail so who cares' argument. Because a law is not used effectively doesn't mean someone can't care about a law. I think there are many old laws we don't use but who are still bad because they have harmful content."
"You are amazing. I love you. Not only are you (your brain) beautiful, but I quite enjoy looking at you too.  I'm impressed with the video skills you've developed and I thoroughly appreciate your academic tone mixed with vernacular oaths. I'm now having a blast watching your back videos and seeing you mature into this amazing woman.  You are truly 'two spirited' in every sense of the phrase. Keep changing, but never to suit someone else's agenda. :-)"

"In another video you said you were genderqueer and to call you her/him pronouns. What changed? Were you inching your way into what you were really wanted? Im nonbinary af btw. Just trying to understand the change from non binary identifying to trans woman. I could never identify as one gender personally."
"DATH"
"This was such an effective breakdown of why Shapiro's argument is flawed. I'm so glad I found this video!"
"I didn't notice until someone pointed it out, but it's perfectly natural to use 'they' as a gender-neutral 3rd person singular when you don't know a person's gender.  I noticed it at a gas station.  Whenever the typical English speaker refers to a person they can't see, they call them 'they.'  Here I'm doing it about some hypothetical person."
"OK THIS IS EPIC"
"I've been waiting for someone to talk about Shapiro for a while. I love you, and thank you."
"24:06 Pretty shook by this. I live with this too - this ever-present, CONSTANT fear of not coming off right just because my body got fucked up during adolescence."
"Ben Shapiro literally makes his own counterargument and it's frustrating that the lady doesn't pick up on it! Adoptive parents are a type of parent, so we can call them parents. Transwomen are a type of woman, so we can call them 'she.' He ties it to biology because that's the only way he can make the point he wants to make. Also he said 'you can legally change your name' like you can't legally change your gender."
"girl i'm sobbing over you including that fantastic linguistics point just thank you so much for being this insightful. i love you so fucking much contra and this was so so good to watch. amazing as always"
"How many outfits do you have?"
"your term -- 'hypothetical femininity' resonates a lot to me as an early-transition trans man. i've only been on T a few months and i *feel* like more of a man than ever, but i have no surgery and no vocal changes and really don't pass. my masculinity is hypothetical and it feels in my grasp but it's still hard to realize, even to myself. thank you for this video, it's actually really helpful to verbalize my feelings"

"You know I think the algorithms have us spoiled with the endless content all the time and its unfortunate. Even though I can't binge on new content from this channel all the time what always keeps me coming back to check for new videos even when they don't appear in my feeds is that the content is just so excellent and well crafted on this channel. I really hope ContraPoints explodes and gets some more recognition because it deserves it. And also just I really wish I saw more stuff like this on my video feeds instead of random top 10 lists and click-bait. Sigh.."
"on the topic of medical gatekeeping recently posted on your Twitter as a disabled person I ask this what is your view on transablism those who damage themselves to be disabled in terms of mobility and the senses I personally believe this completely erases the disabled community as a whole and is a profoundly dangerous practice."
"I don't always agree with Blaire but I do appreciate her work. I recognize her position for what it is. She's doing what she can from her side. I also can't help but admire her strength in facing audacity head-on. The blinking eyes say everything. I would want to lay the dude out, but like, that's not my gender role either, I guess, right? ROFL I'm even a mostly prescriptive linguist. Shapiro is a dolt.  Personally, the realization I hit the other day was that the men most 'threatened' by trans-women, lesbians, and others who are non-gender-conforming and non-sexuality-conforming is that, in the end, they see women as objects. If we don't fit their expectations, we are abominations, because they are sooooo uncomfortable with how the non-conformative threaten their definition of their own sexuality. Ladies, stahp. You / we owe them nothing. Let them simmer in their own crap."

"I would love to see Natalie respond to the ideas of Girl Defined. They have gotten a lot of critical response videos for their various commentaries on gender and sexuality, but those responses are usually shallow and do not really say much. I feel like Natalie could really do a good job"
"I reject the notion that a law isn't a problem until someone's life is ruined by it. If people perceive it as a problem they have an obligation to act against it before harm occurs.  I've seen the 2003 communication act go almost a decade without much use to recent times where social media has a arisen and my government wiped it out their back pocket and went postal just because they can."
"27:07, the biggest mood"
"what is striking about Ben Shapiro is that he is a pretty religious man also. Following his 'facts don't care about your feelings' deal to the logical conclusion, well, it's not really coherent right?"
"I'm sorry but the English language already makes no sense. 'You' is already both a singular and a plural pronoun and no one talks about that for some reason. 'They' being plural is the laziest, stupidest excuse I've ever heard."

"Very good point about the pronoun being more associated with phenotype than genotype. The karyotype argument really fails the case of XY androgen insensitivity. In this case the person has XY chromosomes yet develop essentially as women."
"I love you, Natalie. You are so candid and insightful.... And fucking beautiful!"
"This was interesting. Nothing really shocking though. Having the privilege (or whatever you'd want to call it) to be a part of the process by which people transition genders (and unfortunately having to ask for the karyotype related gender for medical purposes) I tend to agree with a lot of this. As far as binary goes, it seems fair to describe as what you 'see' and correct if needed, I've learned to 'evaluate' carefully to be respectful (or use non-gendered pronouns similar the french 'vous' when the situation allows). Though some of this is based on a pre-established knowledge of the person (as a sidenote, I've erred once or twice in the opposite due to this as well... oops), as far as this goes, correcting the mistake is easy, apologize (because it hurts so bad to be told you've made a mistake, right) and don't make a fuss about it.  Just as a lot of 'CIS WHITE PRIVILEGED MALE BIGOTTED STUDS' (ha, I wish I was a stud) I'm having trouble grasping the non-binary... well, lets call it a system. Simply looking at it from afar, as someone profiling as anything non-binary you've got to just... know that people are going to make mistakes (intentional or not). Unfortunately my only experience with a non-binary person thus far has been rather bad (as in: 'this medical questionnaire is too binary!', well I'm very sorry that we have to ask for your background and psychological health in order to provide adequate care?) and I continue to fail to wrap my head around situations like genderfluidity in the sense that it can change drastically at a moments' notice, how do you even work that out unless you are closely related to this person?  I'm not sure how much I'm doing things out of respect/politeness or simple habit by now, I can only evaluate that appearances (behaviour, looks, attitude and so on) do make up a great deal of this, fair or not. It's at the same time not a hindrance to speak of. Assess. Adapt. Overcome."
"The flag burning (paper though it is) is a whole other argument. I had hopes that followers of my profile I was going to post this video to could handle taking your arguments into consideration. But I don't have confidence that they could handle thay particular political argument being tacked onto the end; in fact they very well may allow that to invalidate (in their minds) your position entirely. Is there any way to get this video without the Elvira clips framing it, or with the last part cut off in any case?"
"For me, it's more a matter of gender being a stupid, fake sociological category system imposed on us by the powers that be in order to better divide and control people. I'm agender, so I don't care what gender is or why it should be considered important; as you said, it's not biologically real. But, it is important that people feel comfortable, which is why I do my best to cater to my non-binary sister's they(m) pronouns. For me, it doesn't matter, and honestly, I wish gender as a concept had never been invented, along with race and organized religion. Then we'd all be a bit happier."

"On the topic of Bill C-16, gender identity was added to the Ontario Human Rights Act in 2012.  Presumably anyone who had a problem with being misgendered by Peterson or otherwise could have pressed a claim long before the vote on C-16, unless of course Peterson's appeal to protection of free speech was simply a transphobic dogwhistle."

"#NatalieWynn #Contrapoints Dear Natalie if you read your comments: your racial justice takes are great. I‚Äôd like to see you make more vids on topics such as classism, saneism and ableism.   As with being Black, being neurodivergent or mad is a huge risk factor for encountering police violence and violence generally, dying young and being forcibly incarcerated in jail or psych hospitals.   I also see a lot of disgusting classism in leftist forums, such as the popular Facebook group ‚Äúsh* bootlickers say‚Äù.... and the class-privileged left in general, I‚Äôd say. Sarah Silverman has spoken about this rather eloquently. I really like her now that she admits that her past use of racial stereotypes makes her cringe now.  It upsets me to see poor people classified as universally ignorant.   Obviously you and I know: Trump fans are not mostly working-class or disabled-class folks- people who live in trailer parks do not all vote conservative or practice incest (üò≥ü§Øü§¨üò°) Not only is this kind of casual classism a kind of bigotry just like racism and transphobia, but it creates an impasses when it comes to leftist with class privilege discovering their potential allies in the rural poor, disabled and homeless"
"One of your best videos. You've really altered how I think about gender.  Also, the 'Go ahead. *Touch it.*' is one of the funniest things on your channel."
"I feel so bad but i just physically cant watch this. And now i feel worse for saying it ... sigh"
"This is like listening to the new daughters album."
"Three reasons for misgendering that I see a lot.  'They get offended when I misgender them.' Did you apologize when you were corrected? Because if you did, then that's their problem, not every trans person's problem.  'It's an unnecessary ego boost.' Yeah, I get an orgasm every time I get called he (I'm cis, by the way). I bet their soul grows stronger every time you say 'they,' and will eventually vaporize all cis people.  'The pronouns they use are made up.' As opposed to he and she, which are found naturally in mines? Is it time that's the issue? Because gender neutral pronouns date back to the 19th century.  Just be polite. It's easy and costs nothing."
"You provide a lot of deep insights in a fun and interesting way. I bet you were an excellent teacher when you were still in academia. I'm very glad you're still using your talent there for all of us."
"It all makes SO MUCH sense now THANK YOU! I used to be pro 'facts' but i didn't realize that using pronouns according to the way a person looks and wants to be perceived just makes more sense."
"Question to Shapiro, since language is the anchor of his 'biological' views that so infallibly point out the gender of people and nothing else..., does he speak any German or Spanish??"
"i want to look at that sculptural candy wig for eternity"
"Going back to the adoptive vs biological parents argument, we can make a distinction between adoptive parents and bilogical parents, but it would be nonsense to deny that they are both parents. Using the same argument, we can make a distinction from trans women and cis women, but it would be nonsense to deny that both are women."
"I really want to witness Ben Shapiro meeting John Maclean, calling him *sir*, trying to get a rise out of him, saying he refuses to call him *a she*, having John tell him he identifies as a man and uses male pronouns, Ben having a meltdown when he realizes his stance won't be able to make someone whom he doesn't agree with uncomfortable"

"This is basically a socio-lingustics issue, not a neurological issue. You people wanna manipulate language to adhere to your  *connotations* . You want the social benefits of being referred to as the opposite sex. If we allow our connotations to dictate language, 'acting black' would be a legitmate concept."
"Thanks for these informative videos. It got me thinking, by Ben Shapiro's logic, can you show a transwoman's tits on TV? Male nipples are allowed, so therefore it should be okay. I dare anyone to try this and not be censored by the FTC."
"Ya know...if it's all based on looks...tell me why Anne Coulter shouldn't be called 'he' by Shitpiro.   (FWIW, you're much more feminine than Coulter.)"
"Ben Shapiro is an asshole.  He should have stuck to shaving the night before (that was seriously the subject of an early column). His dumb ass knows nothing about genetics.  What do you call someone who is XXY? I have no problem with calling you she, at any point during your transition.  Ben Shapiro's a gelding. Fun fact:  Marriage used to be the transfer of one or more pieces of property (women) to a man; at one point, a man couldn't rape his wife, since she was his property; now, it is the union of two people, period."
"im nonbianary  and go by whatever pronouns come out of someones mouth unless i explicitly know theyre trying to be mean or upset me. then i fuck with them."
"I'm from Venezuela and from someone who often watch USA politics, and saw how Ben Shapiro became a visible icon especially with the video where he 'refutes' the abortion thing, I always found that clip translated into my language and I was tired of the same stupidity that they repeat here in Latin America but I also wanted to understand why it was very attractive when I only thought that it was my neighbors that were easy to persuade until he met with Sam Harris for the first time and was for nothing because the conversation was entirely focused on religion and I still was confused with this transgender thing (honestly I have never discriminated in my life gays or transsexuals, but with transsexuals I assumed before that someone who is born with one sex and thinks that it is another had a neurological problem, but let it be clear that I never treated them differently, actually I do not have transsexual friends because I do not know any).. so then I met Peterson, and I understood 'better' all this thing and for what he 'fought' because it's crazy to put someone in jail because you do not say the words they want BUT that fucking moron doesn't know what is TRUTH and for fuck sake after 2 years of this.. the only thing I can assure you is that if I was this confused; this country where the mockery against homosexuals continues (it has decreased a lot, although here the Venezuelan people knows how to take blows in life and gets up quickly from bullying) I am worried about how I can make them enter in reason with such complexity that today I can understand more clearly. Even my parents who are strongly Christians (but are not homophobic in the discriminatory sense but would fall into the homophobic definition that you [americans] use when someone thinks that a transsexual has mental problems) I know it would be in vain, but if I try with people who are more malleable they would end up thinking that I'm fooling or I went crazy."

"Latin languages call 'tables' 'she' out of sintactic convenience. Germanic languages call sexed creatures like animals 'it', but use 'she' for ships and nations.

"The political perspective she/he talks about is not really the issue. The issue is the way an individual uses pronouns. The argument is that the norm should be on what society agrees and that everyone should be/act like 'rule x'. The problem of this is in meaning, but not in the objective. In this I agree with the argument. But, on that same coin, all Ben would have to do is disreguard the 'facts' model and stick to a subjective meaning model. Therefore all one would have to do is explain how the way one uses the pronoun vs the way the other recieves a pronoun. When I say she, I mean all of social aspects that are rooted. Even the bad, such as voting rights, fear of rape, and unequal workers rights, etc. The problem with the social subjective argument is that in practical usage, when people generally talk about a transgender he or she, they refer to the equal rights issues of transgender people, not the rights of the woman or man. If this was the case, than all one would have to do is make cis men and women equal on all fronts and simply by proxy, transgender people, whether man or woman, would have all the rights agreed upon. The transgender equality problem lies in the idea of transgenders, not the ideas of what a man or woman is. Those issues are all in an environment of their own."
"This video has been an exorcise in reductio ad absurdum. There's too many mutually conflicting factors to satisfy everyone's preferences. I'm not transphobic. I just demand standards (precision). For my language usage, homogametic is female and thus inexorably 'she' and heterogametic is male and thus inexorably 'he'.

"I don't know if this has been said before or if this is like the point of the channel but I feel like this channel is one of the most effective ways to convert those alt-right influenced boys that flock to rekt feminist, videos or the armoured sceptic wipe, because you use the language that they understand and have the same sense of humour and break most of the leftist stereo types those alt-right influenced boys actually listen, and because you are funny even if they don't agree with you they come back.   Bty: most of this is from personal experience mostly from being an alt-right influenced boy, and this channel really made me look past, XX = Woman, and other such opinions."
"Singular 'They' has been a part of English since at least the time of Shakespeare, probably much longer.  Most people actually have no trouble using or understanding it, either.  'Did you see someone run past here?  Which way did they go?'  'They went that way!'  It's not that difficult, and doesn't take that much practice, because you already do it.  Also, 'They' isn't 'neuter gender,' but rather, it is neutral with respect to gender.  Every person on the planet is a 'they' in addition to whatever else they identify as."

"Ben would have a fit at my work.  I have many Chinese co-workers who use 'he' and 'she' interchangeably.  When they repeatedly refer to a female coworker as 'he' I understand the language differences and get on with my life.  But as a 'cis' person?  I also feel like people are asking to be put into some box which makes no sense to me.  I've had feminists on message boards tell me that I'm wrong for referring to myself as a 'woman' (seriously) and now I have these other people saying I need to break myself down and label myself in the way they wish.  I just want to be me."

"I have absolutely no issue calling a person that which they desire. My only quandary is...when writing an essay, and talking about a group of people, then trying to discuss a specific non-binary person: how do we differentiate between the plural 'they' and the singular 'they?'  When writing, one has to be as specific as possible and make sure what they are writing is understood by all. Let's say an author is non-binary. They are discussing a group of people in a book being used in someone's dissertation. Say the dissertation wants to express what the non-binary author wrote about something without being too repetitive (one can't just keep using the last name over and over.) How does one differentiate between the 'they' the non-binary author was discussing and themself? This is something the English language needs to address. I almost feel we should introduce a new pronoun that is gender neutral singular in order to prevent confusion at least in the case of writing essays.   Maybe this isn't a popular idea...but I'm coming from an English student/Art student's background. I don't want to insult anyone's identity, but I also wouldn't want to be marked off for being unclear (granted, I've been out of college for years, but on behalf of future students, I beg the question.)   I guess I don't expect an answer...I've been out of school for a while, so is this already being addressed in colleges? Maybe I'm really behind in the times (well, that goes without question XD)"
"singular they has been around for a while, hasn‚Äôt it? i mean, ever since i was little i‚Äôve heard it used like a sort of genderless backup, like when people ask ‚Äúwho left their phone here?‚Äù or ‚Äúguess who just lost their will to live?‚Äù"

"If that's the case, only trans women who pass as trans women should be afforded the privilege of being adressed with feminine pronouns. The 'adoptive parent' prescription doesn't come about without a clearly defined 'legal' transaction - if a trans person hasn't begun transitioning then they shouldn't have the audacity to dictate what pronouns people should call them. Anothet thing: I don't see Natalie or Blair as men because they look and act like women. I think that's enough to call them 'she'. However, Caitlyn Jenner and the person who grabbed Ben Shapiro by the neck don't look or act like women. What do we do about this? It's interesting because there are manly females in appearance and behavior and who would fool some people but still are referred to as 'she' because of their biological gender. I think these things are worth pondering very seriously on if the transgender community wants to be considered in a legal framework."

It's impossible in certain moments to be prepered in time! In Italy we can manage it with the form 'lei' that is the singular form for 'they' that in English you don't have. But it's troublesome in some phrases and you can't address the person with any nominative as madam or sir. How do you do?"

"Natalie, I watched your talk at a recent convention 5 Days ago where you're talking about being a representative of transgender people. And I don't think that's necessarily true.  You're one of the most visual examples of a transgender person. You've probably heard that you can't use one person to define a group. Well there's nothing that you can really do for those who don't understand that people differ from what they see on the internet or on TV.  You should continue to be yourself, because you CANNOT become a representative of transgender people. You know, it's not like the mistakes of a single man or a woman or something have besmirched the image of the entire group. Most people are aware of that singular event and compartmentalize it.  You represent Natalie Wynn, not someone else."

However identity is typically the space for questioning people to not cement themselves, but when I am just me being a woman. I don't say I am being a person identifying as a woman. It has this displacing effect. I think identity versus being is a point that you might want to consider delving into even more. But I know you've already hit a lot of that ambiguity a lot, though exploring that specific space between those two is really amazingly important."

"I do believe that transsexuality is perfectly valid but I have to admit that I have a hard time wrapping my head around the concepts of social gender, genderfluid people and all this stuff. I don't want to be intolerant but I think this whole concept is pretty much obsolete and counterproductive. Wouldn't it be much better if being male or female was just purely biological and had absolutely nothing to do with your identity or personality? If there were no more stereotypes about what traits, interests, hobbies, talents, clothes or whatever are typically male or female? I was born as a woman and I feel very comfortable in my body but I don't wake up in the morning and think ''Yep, I'm totally female, as always.'' and I do have a lot of interests and traits that are considered typically male but I don't see how any of this makes me any less female and I have zero desire to label myself as genderfluid or something so people know that I don't conform to social norms and gender stereotypes in every aspect of my life (which basically no one does). To me, being a woman should just be about having a biologically female body or wanting one and nothing more. I think acting like being male or female (or whatever) is part of your social identity is reinforcing stereoptypes and nothing more. And yes, right now it IS pretty much part of our social identity but I think the logical conclusion is to try getting rid of this thinking so that everyone can just act and look like they want without feeling the need to label themselves as anything.  Sorry for any mistakes, I'm tired and this is not my native language."

"'[...] so long as those beliefs are reasonable. [...]' This is the crux in my opinion. Just take a look at this list: https://ageofshitlords.com/list-of-all-tumblr-genders-so-far - There are so many genders that it is virtually  impossible for any human to distinct between them.   TL;DR I don't have a problem with men identifying as woman or the other way around. I have however a problem with these thing going out of hand, ie. 40 and more genders.  ¬†It also is in my opinion over the top to define more than 40 genders. This then is not about gender but about a social status which is fine, but you cannot expect me to know what a 'Glassgender' is and how to call you. This is also getting more and more vague with people calling themselves 'Transage'. To say that you feel actually 21 when you really are like 13 is not a thing society needs. Should you be able to vote, drink and have sex at that age? No. Even is you 'feel' older doesn't mean you have to mental capacity to decide those things yourself."
"What's the song at the end?"
"hey i really love your videos and this whole video, particularly the second half, made me really happy. i'm a nonbinary person and i honestly wish there was more conversation between binary and nonbinary trans people. obviously we all have a lot of stuff in common but we also have a lot of things that differentiate us and i think just claiming we're all a community and never talking about our experiences really does us all a disservice. nonbinary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming identities and ideas are so stupidly complex that i don't even think most nonbinary people fully understand them, i know i don't. i know for me, the idea of forcing my way into the public sphere with a gender that essentially doesn't exist on a societal level is incredibly frustrating and kind of hopeless. a lot of nonbinary people i know, including myself, try to shove ourselves in as close of a binary box as we can, and are really only 'out' around people we already know are conscious of nonbinary identities, so transition is sometimes an incredibly complicated process. i know for myself, i plan on essentially transitioning in the same way a trans man would, but i know that that isn't the end game for me. realistically speaking my ideal is to not pass as either, but for safety and ease's sake getting to one i hate less is the best option right now. i'm not really a trans man, but i'd rather be socialized as a man than as a woman. both options are incredibly uncomfortable for me, but one of them doesn't make me feel like i'm about to throw up. also (sorry i know this comment is really long fjadfjk) but i actually really appreciate your philosophy of not just tolerating, but understanding and agreeing! honestly speaking its a lot more helpful to me in the long run if a person asks questions upfront rather than just accepting that i want to be referred to w/ they/them pronouns. LAST COMMENT god this is so long but i could talk all day about myself apparently. i feel like i differ from other nonbinary people in that outside of explicitly LGBT+/trans spaces, I do not like being asked my pronouns in front of a group of people. i'm in college, and in some classes, professors will ask us to say our pronouns. i am from an area where LGBT+ people are at genuine risk when they are out, especially trans people. if no one asks my pronouns they can assume whatever they want and there's not too much i have to reveal to them, unless i wish to correct them. if i'm expected to say my pronouns i'm suddenly forced to decide whether to out myself as a largely pre-transition nonbinary person in front of an entire classroom of people, or i have to actively lie to people. neither option, in my experience, is a safe one, and it certainly isn't a comfortable one. i know some people who default to they for everyone, but i'm not really comfortable doing that to binary trans people either. i don't know what the answer is in terms of social pronouns, but i don't think anyone does really. i guess right now its just be polite and correct yourself if someone asks you to."
"I notice that while Shapiro spouts his catchphrase about facts in the name of rational discussion, he conveniently ignores not only the science behind gender as a social construct, gender dysphoria, and transgender people, he also ignores those who are intersex, or have an aneuploid karyotype.

"One thing that always annoys me is the mere presence of the biological argument, even though biological sex is a spectrum, so someone with XX chromosones might have still developed male reproductive organs and grown up both looking like and being socialized as male, nobody even knowing about their lack of Y chromosones until well into adulthood. A conservative like B.S. would never have even considered calling this person 'she'. Or men with micropenises. They were probably just a few millimeters from having been given gender reconstructive surgery as infants and assigned female instead, purely based on the developmental stage of the penis/clitoris which has clearly started developing towards penis shape but hasn't reached satisfactory size to be called a 'real man'"

"I object to the placement of some of the weapons and fish pokemon on the femme-butch scale. There is no way the small axe is more femme than the two-handed sword or that the pole-arm is more femme than the chainsaw. Chainsaws impress people who don't know better but those rotating chains can get stuck easily and they would not do well against armor at all, chainsaw may be loud and aggressive but so is the gun and the gun is quite femme, so the delicate chainsaw belongs in the same area as the gun. Although it's a lighter axe, the axe is still for crushing armor, definitely much more butch than the chainsaw and more than the sword which is heavy enough to stab through some armor but still meant more for poking into the weak parts of an armored enemy.   The fish pokemon one is more on point, but I think Lumineon's femmeyness is being understold, she's not that butch. Huntail is softest butch of all those butch water pokemon, Huntail may love hunting but he expresses mostly very similarly to Gorbyss, just with blue and blockier shapes instead of pink and rounder shapes. Whiscash and Seaking are much more butch, they're big burly man's men of the fish habitat, Whiscash is a hard-drinking blue-collar lumberjack type guy and Seaking is a KING, he made sure to put it in his name so everyone knows, he wants everybody to know he's not just a man but the lord of men."
"Ben Shapiro is just jealous that most trans women have deeper voices than his.  I used to think that 'dogwhistle' meant that there were certain words that agitate a pundit's intended audience while looking harmless or deniable to the general public.  But then I discovered that it's just an accurate description of Ben Shapiro's pinched whine.  If I had a voice like that, the only way I could justify continuing to identify as male would be to tour the country and spend hours every day trying to convince people to change their speech for political purposes while claiming to hate political correctness.  But only the truly woke can fathom the full scope of the truth: Ain't no pronouns 'cause ain't no nouns 'cause ain't no English language. Joe Rogan did 9/11."

"I agree calling trans people the pronoun most suited to the person  appearance, but I draw the line on 'they'. If someone doesn't make an effort to look female or male I will not go the extra mile. I also don't agree on being labeled as arrogant, insensitive or rude for not calling the appropriate pronoun, it's far more arrogant to have the expectation that people must use specific words to accommodate your sensibilities than to not recognise these sensibilities. Interesting point of view nonetheless."
"I think people should say whatever they like and simply live with the social consequences, and also people should understand that not everyone runs in the same circles as them. If you have friends who would get up in arms about pronouns, chances are you've long ago learned to tread lightly on the subject. In this situation social consequence would be high for using the wrong speech, and chances are you'd be more affected by it. If your social circles don't contain anyone like that then nobody should expect you to think about that sort of thing. In this situation there would be no consequence for using the wrong speech, and if there were you'd be unaffected by it.  People are all different."

I still see it as a psychological anomaly at best. Not something evil and not something that should be outlawed (Ben has even said he doesn't want reassignment surgery banned) but not something I can accept as true. I can't see a transwoman as a woman. We're a sexually dimorphic species. Conforming to the appearance and social expectations of a sex doesn't make you that sex."

My boyfriend has dropped she all together. I'm still his baby girl because that's my title in our BDSM lifestyle. I don't accept female pronouns from anyone online. I correct politely. If they continue (outside of slip ups) it's a block. I am Non-binary because I hate how I felt as a woman. Many people say 'You can be gender non-conforming & still use the same terms.

"Shapiro's choice to pick karotypes as the aspect of biology to use as a basis of what pronouns to use just seems so... arbitrary.  I remember seeing a few studies and brain scans that suggest or support the theory that trans people have brain chemistry that matches that of the gender they identify with as opposed to that of their biological sex and that they neurologically/psychologically are indeed incongruent to their bodies, so... why is neuroscience invalid yet karotypes aren't? Brains are a part of our biology, a big part, in fact. Doesn't that seem like a far more pertinent means of deciding this type of thing? It's not like Shapiro has a fucking karotype reading machine that he just waves at people that tells him what chromosomes they have, he and most people infer gender from things like how people instinctively behave, how they present and posture themselves, et cetera, as mentioned in this video. All of which are examples of what our _minds_ are projecting. Not our karotypes. You and Blaire White put it pretty well so yeah I don't really have much else to say that hasn't been in this video or Blaire's.   Great video, keep up the good work.  (sources on those studies; http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/ https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/ https://bigthink.com/mike-colagrossi/transgender-brains-more-closely-resemble-brains-of-the-sex-they-align-with-rather-than-what-they-were-born-with there's probably more out there but whatever)"
"@ContraPoints This has been one of the greatest pieces of work you have put out.  Much appreciated."
"I just had two thoughts: 1) I don't believe the words he and she were primarily defined by social roles before we knew about the biological differences. The most obvious biological difference between a man and a woman are the different roles each gender plays in the creation of children. So to know that there are  biological differences (pretty deep ones in that regard) you don't have to discover the karyotype. 2) Ben said in one of his videos that he would call a transperson he/she in private, but his job is to make political/objective points. This doesn't go against your argument but discriminating here is important. I think same is to be said about Peterson. He was making a political point in defending the PRINCIPAL of free speech. Maybe Bill C16 was a hoax (as some comments suggest) or people in Canada started policing their own language to some extent.... = 0 people convicted. Who knows xoxo  EDIT: Instead of only showing the total amount of convicts it would be interesting to research how many cases there have been and compare those numbers"
"I like Ben Shapiro but I will call people what they want, even if in my mind I don't believe they are what they claim they are. Most people will use the pronouns you want, few people are as confrontational as Ben Shapiro"
"Wow, finally someone explains what the SJW idea of pronouns is. So it is based on you femininity and masculinity? If yes, then I can be on board of that. Blaire White and you actively tried to change your appearance to a more feminine one, you want the role of a traditional woman, so I can respect calling you a she. What I won't respect is a man that doesn't want to transition, acts extremely masculine and has all of the facial hair to be called a she, you are neither feminine nor did you transition. Thank you for actually giving good requirements for calling you a different pronoun than your biologically based one. And if not, then I still yet to have a good reason to call you a different pronoun that isn't based to your feeling, which I AM NOT OBLIGATED TO CARE ABOUT. All I ask is some semblance of objectivity in the sense that everyone can actively see the same criteria, like masuclinity and femininity, which have pretty strong definitions and don't mean whatever someone wants it to mean. But I still don't see the need for non-binary pronouns in society outside of just 'mah feelings'. P.S. I fucking love how rational you are in all of your videos."
"I know some cis folks that are worried about having their heads chewed off for using the incorrect language. Unless a person is miss labeling you on purpose please be understanding."

"You're awesome. And in addition to all that (besides getting language wrong), shapiro actually also got biology wrong - even counting with the fact that geneticists don't study pronouns xD Oh if he knew all the ways a body has to develop into what he and other transphobes like to call 'biological women' and 'biological men'..."
"Trans people are basically like doppelgangers. They take on the mask of someone effectively becoming them but what about the person underneath the mask? Are they empty and void inside?"

"This was really insightful, thank you. I unfortunately don't have any transgender or gender non-binary friends, so my thoughts on the subject are kind of nebulous (mostly because my own gender identity has never felt particularly strong, so it's hard for me to understand), but I always think it's good to be respectful, and I like to know where people are coming from. And as someone with a master's in linguistics, I *completely* agree that language is subjective and pronouns are not about chromosomes. They have nothing to do with 'facts' or 'definitions,' they have to do with whether you want to be a jerk or not. I choose not to be a jerk. (Also I love your twisty rainbow hair. üòç)"

I hope that I could just meet you one day in the future, when I‚Äôve figured this all out. Until then.."

"Wow I‚Äôm so glad your videos showed up in my suggested tab"
"sigh. i was really hoping you'd redeem yourself from the last video. but it's hard to forgive you when you don't even try. you're still internally transphobic and projecting that outwards, like those jerks in the 'truscum' club. no contra, not all of us feel 'fake' or 'hypothetical' before we meet your arbitrary standards, and you don't get to decide that for anyone. saying you respect identity and then blatantly disrespecting it doesn't make it better, you are basically tiffany tumbles in denial. this 'vibe' thing you're talking about isn't some harsh truth about gender- that's your internal cissexism presenting itself as some universal truth about all trans people. you still betray your non-binary and gnc siblings. you're still basically truscum, except with emphasis on social roles instead of biological dysphoria. and for that, i feel remorse that you hate yourself so much.  ps - that world you're talking about where trans people don't have to come out or present a certain way to be taken seriously? that's the fucking dream. i hope someday, you'll take a break from enforcing cissexist gender norms and join us in it."

"Even if we would accept Shapiro's BS biological-pronoun argument, he is still wrong. Chromosomes are an outdated, simplistic method for teaching biology to children. They do not represent reality accurately. There are healthy and fertile cis men and women who do not have their respective xy/xx chromosomes. So unless Shapiro DNA-tests every single person he meets before talking to them, he cannot possibly claim to use the correct 'biological-pronoun' even if all those people are cis. Edit: Since a commenter brought it up, I think it might be good to explain further and this twitter thread does it better than I ever could: https://twitter.com/jacobphd/status/945711150737453056?lang=de"
"0:24 What the hell is DATH?"
"By a descriptive approach Shapiro absolutely wins. Maybe everyone you deal with calls you 'she', but that's not a random sample of people living in your society, since they're both selected by you and self-select themselves. But most people in general do not refer to transwomen as 'she', nor do they think of them as 'women'.  And by a prescriptive approach he also wins. Words and categories are used to distinguish and discriminate between classes objects (and people) who are meaningfully different. There is a purpose in distinguishing and discriminating between people on the basis of sex, because sex is important in many areas of society (e.g. reproduction, medicine, violence), while self identity is utterly meaningless. Nobody cares about how you identify as, but people do care whether you can get pregnant or not, or could beat them in a fight."
"what the hell is 'living as a woman'? I mean if you don't pass as a woman, then surely you don't deal with the a difference in social dynamic, you just get treated as a man? Do you have to do different things if you're a woman? Can't you just... show up to work like always?   The They/Them stuff also bugs me because, on the one hand you want to go along with somebody who's transitioning, if they're not ready to say they're a woman, but on the other hand a lot of kids in university just want to be edgy and revoke pronouns on a philosophical basis, to challenge your idea of gender or something and that's not something I'm interested in playing along with. In those cases it has nothing to do with their own experience or their identity or any of that shit, they just wanna be edgy."
"I‚Äôve been having some trouble grasping trans experiences and arguments, but this video and the incredibly simple yet completely uncondescending way you went about was really helpful. Too often in these kinds of situations I feel like I‚Äôm being attacked or made out to be an asshole for asking questions, but you explained your position brilliantly and you have a new subscriber.

"hi! I have been thinking about this a lot, and I think that Shapiro is right...wait!!! dont crucify me yet, hear me out, right in the wrong way, just like we have come to understand that,  nothing is black and white, just like psychology puts everything in a spectrum, (every human study has a spectrum, physics, math, even the ambiguity of language is in a way is a spectrum) and that society as a units is the worse at defining parameters (we are still fighting about Pluto that damn dwarf planet or what 'white' is even harder what a 'hispanic' is are Brazilian hispanic? ) the definition of male and female is so innate as the definition of red and blue, we all agree on what each is, so why don't  we have to fight whether  purple,  magenta or violet should be called  red or blue?? because we understand that from one to another there is a spectrum that is hard to tell where one becomes the other, there are some points where we can all agree that one is not the other and very proudly we recognize the existence of those in between, I mean we all are America but Texas is not New York, there are 52 states!!! all with counties and  borrows and we all know there is a difference between a brooklyn accent and a bronx accent; then why are we so obsessed with 2 genders and trying to reach the complete 'all boxes checked' definition of any of them? I mean do you feel like a woman or a female? once we understand the difference we will be able to rightfully identify ourselves"

"I preface this comment by stating that I apologize for my somewhat messy/inappropriate use of parentheticals. I love the book 'House of Leaves' and 'Infinite Jest', so that might help you understand how fucked I am with respect to footnotes and the like.   I have beat myself about the head regarding this (keeping in mind I'm about a 2.258916515180000000001 on the Kinsey Scale (I think...see the following for elucidation or perhaps none because what the fuck am I ever even talking about), considering that I am a seemingly cisgender male (although I enjoy not being aware of my gender most of the time as much as I can help it, perhaps leaning me toward gender fluidity?...nor do I see myself as a 'shit-gibbon' per your comments later in your video, heh) ):   If I find male-to-female transgendered individuals to be sexually attractive, even being perfectly fine with referring to them as any gender they so desire (I do understand how sex and gender differ, unless I'm missing something), I cannot help but think to myself, 'I find someone who was unequivocally born a male attractive' (let us not consider the even rarer cases of those born with both or ambiguous female and male sex organs as this may complicate matters more than my question warrants, although it may bring up relevant and important discussion). I want to be ok with saying to myself, 'I find a male who lives as a female attractive,' but it seems at the same time that such an individual may dislike me for seeing them this way--in thinking that they're a male per their sex, but at the same time appreciating their chosen gender.   Perhaps what you talk about at about 23:22 - 24:10 elaborates on this, but what if in your significant other's life they'd refer to you as a woman, but also kept it in their head at the same time that you were born as a male? Something that they may never forget (Fuck Shapiro, let's say they're not like Ben Shapiro), but is not ashamed of whatever, either. Is this offensive to the gender non-conforming person? I cannot help but be aware of that fact (in sex, not in gender), although I don't mind at all if one would prefer to be referred to as a female (or vice versa for female-to-male individuals).   Penises, per se, do not turn me off (and maybe this pushes me higher on the Kinsey Scale given I'd rather a male-to-female transgendered individual keep their penis), but rather the adherence to masculine tropes. If someone told me that I was masculine as some kind of compliment, something in me would respond, 'Oh...ok, that's whatever...I secretly wish that you could also appreciate my feminine traits in the same breath,' heh.   I don't know. This is touchy and complicated. I am confused. I mean no harm, I'd just like to be less confused and you seem to be exceptionally gifted in the use of words to explain such complex and nuanced topics. I'd greatly appreciate your input here if you so desire.   Either way, peace.   P.S. Your nails at around the 20:00 mark are fucking amazing works of art. Anytime I doodle and draw fingers they look exactly like that--surreal, uneven, gnarled. I'm a bit of an outsider artist...meaning that I suck at drawing, but I enjoy it quite a bit, heh.   P.P.S. 26:58 - 27:15 Please don't feel like shit. Although I do, too, for different reasons.   P.P.P.S. You seem like a woman to me and I find you ridiculously attractive (although super-aesthetic make-up isn't my cup of tea, you do your thing). Please don't hit or maim me in some way for saying that.   P.P.P.P.S. Those milk scenes tho..."

When someone makes a grammatical error about a third person that I know, the only recourse I have is to say 'she, but yes' or some other sentence containing the formula: correct pronoun + the word 'but' or 'and' + the next sentence in the conversation.  i've done it twice, and the conversation went along as normal, with no shame or extra attention on gender.  I suppose Shapiro's career is currently dedicated to turning exchanges like this into massive debates where lines are drawn in the sand."

I was wondering, do you do this naturally or do you have a formula? If you do have a formula, would you be willing to share it with us? I'm a person who jumps all over the place in their thinking, so it makes my points a bit difficult to understand sometimes, and I'm not good at making myself very clear. It's as if I assume others have done the same research and will understand without me explaining ever detail. I'd be very grateful if you could share your ideas with me. I'd also like to say that I love your artistic approach to the format of your videos. Its so fun to watch and helps my ADD brain stay focused haha"

"OMG i'm always mesmerized by your look ü§© Thank you for your video on that subject. Fun fact, in France another pronoun has been created for non-binary people : iel (il/elle) ; and I presume it is possible to do so for many language. Still, this is very rare to use it. And we also have a problem with misgendering jobs name (we don't have the 'it', everything has a gender). Numerous people describe women with the male version of their jobs because 'it's the use' (culturally, there are a few jobs which were not that easy for a woman to get...). Actually, a few women prefer to be called by the male version of their job. They may feel diminished when the women version is used...? Right from the beginning, as boys and girls, we are taught to behave in a very patriarchal way. And it is not always easy to completely wipe it off... Anyways, I don't have much information about what happen on that subject in the USA, and I thank you for the content. And I'm glad we don't have any Ben Shapiro in traditional media in France (even though our TV has its flaws too...) Have a nice week !"
"Maybe mr Shapiro will get over his inflated self. As a recovering Christian male republican , I  say you must accept the boundaries that an abiding respect for other's rights and dignity imposes.  It means that you address people as they wish, be it him, her, he, she , your royal highness, most high panda, . . . Whatever.  If I get it wrong decency require an apology and and that I respect your wishes in the future. If Ben Shapiro wants to risk coming across as a smug  self righteous prig let him suit himself. He is no different than any of these other modern hucksters who make their living staring up resentment. He should go in some quiet corner with Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity and have some tender touching."

IIRC you have an xy 'male' that can't impregnate or get impregnated, unless there's a donor egg, since they (sometimes?) have functioning wombs? Is that a male with a functioning womb, or a female with xy chromosomes?  Edit: just saying in hebrew, which Ben speaks, pretty much everything has a gender."

"I feel so represented!!! Thank you, Natalie <3  Sometimes I feel alienated by mainstream trans dialogues because they don't always exactly match my own experiences. When this happens I usually try to write angry essays, but none have taken shape fully enough to make sense/be published yet. Anyway, you articulate all the nuance that I want to articulate. I feel that I can show your videos to my other gendery friends AND to people who don't get it and are interrogating my identity, and you perfectly explain my feelings to both of them in a fun and accessible way. Nothing short of a masterpiece, tbh. You're gorgeous and perfect xx"

"I finally now know what my guilty pleasure is; philosophy. I did graduate from university with a Bachelor's degree in philosophy like 13 years ago. And then I stopped reading philosophy. Why? ...because I approached the boundaries of understanding; my understanding, and many many other people's understanding of what, like, THINGS mean. Eventually you boil down to a 'best guess approximation' of your own feelings. It seems to me that feelings beget thought, not the other way around. So now I indulge myself in YouTube videos which remind me so very much of who I used to be; someone who thought they could actually reach and be comfortable with the boundaries of human understanding. NOPE! Never gonna happen. So now I'm studying web development."
"The analogy I like to use is this :  I am a natural blonde. I dye my hair black. You can‚Äôt see blonde roots, since I keep up with hair care. In what scenario, besides referring to the past, would you say I‚Äôm a blonde? I am obviously not a blonde, and even though my genetic makeup says that I‚Äôm a blonde, I made the choice to change that outward appearance. Thusly, I am no longer a blonde, because it makes no practical sense."

"Not that I'm saying anything new or groundbreaking here, but... you're brilliant.  Thank you for giving us this."
"I think the problem with asking everyone their pronouns is that it can be dangerous. You have to be careful because you're basically asking someone to out themself, which is scary to begin with, but can actually put a target on their back in the wrong crowd. Fortunately I've only seen this done outside of say a GSA or a similar queer safe space once but still, it's a risk there."
"Me starting at 0:47 'I'm listening.'  Me starting at 1:06: 'Ugh...if we have to...'  Luckily the video is awesome as always.  Excellent job!"
"So, lets summarize - Shapiro's argument is that he shouldn't be *forced* into using pronouns he does not agree with and gives his definition of a male or a female. Your answer to that argument is - 'well, in my context and in my conversations people call me she'. This has literally nothing to do with his argument. I know you're practically a meme for having ridiculously shitty responses, but I was honestly curious about this topic. So once I dug up through the pretentiousness, I was disappointed to find the exact same drivel. Anyway, since you've watched the Joe Rogan podcast, do one on the transgender females completely manhandling biological females in sport and how that's fair and just. That might be an amusing trainwreck to watch."
"That adoption analogy is so good I'm using it from now on."
"Back in the day you called yourself genderqueer and accepted every kind of pronoun. I think it's interesting to observe your change."
"Amazing video as always Contra. :) But there is something I wanted to criticize about you here regarding Jordan Peterson.   Now I'm not about to go to bat for Jordan Peterson and say I agree with his worldview (because... I don't), however, I think you deliberately misrepresented his arguments in this video. Simply the fact that Peterson never believed or discussed the idea that C-16 was going to  send people to jail. Also, I've seen numerous videos where he clearly states that he would use the preferred pronoun of a trans or NB-gendered person if they asked him to. His main argument regarding C-16 was that he didn't want the government to regulate the language that people are allowed to use, and that he specifically found C-16 as an exploitable path to creating laws that regulate what you can say.    Whether or not C-16 will lead to that kind of censorship isn't my point here... my point is that you mis-characterized his beliefs to make a disingenuous argument."
"'When you talk about me in the third person, do it in this very specific way, particular only to me, or you're an asshole.' Why would I be annoyed with this ever? I want to be that person's friend immediately!"
"For me when you say binary trans people deal with the male experience so we can relate to gender non confirming identities is a flawed assumption. People put the male identity onto me the moment I was born. It was a form of brainwashing for me until I figured out what I actually was and then took the steps to fix my life. What I am trying to say is if you raised a natal female with the same view of them being a boy that is the result that happened to me. I never related to boys growing up I was shunned by both boys and girls and was bullied for being perceived as not masculine enough because my entire school life up to the end of highschool people perceived me as male but my behaviours were never male to begin with. The reason why girls thought I was wierd was because everyone put that label on me of being a boy so I must automatically want to sleep with a girl instead of just wanting to be friends so people called me a metrosexual in highschool. This is why I have a hard time understanding genderqueer people and why I get angry at them for saying they are trans when in reality they are queer so to genderqueer people say you are queer not trans. It just makes people like ben shapiro assume we are all fairies."
"You do not birth the child you are not the parent you are their caregiver... Caregivers can still love the child as if it was their own, but the child will never be 'theirs.' This is how family secrets happen and has been shown to cause a lot of issues for the child as they grow into adulthood."

"Remarkably educated, very informative, entertaining, down to earth, quaint, and I had to be informed that you weren‚Äôt the sex/gender I originally assumed you were. If you are in fact the poster child for transgender female as you said you found in the comment section of some of your videos, you really have nothing to worry about.   After defaulting to some of your videos for genuine education I started binging the videos backwards starting with your latest (this one). Every new layer of information I learned about you as I watched the videos was more and more impressive. You aren‚Äôt an impressive ‚Äútrans woman‚Äù, you‚Äôre an impressive human being. I find it shocking that you would face alt right youtubers directly when they simply aren‚Äôt as qualified to speak on the topics you cover as you are, but you face them as equals and it adds to your charm, as well as the educational quality of your videos. You cover nearly every counterpoint and directly reply to those who disagree with you, all while allowing public discussion in the comments below your videos.   I find myself entertained, educated and enthralled as I binge your channel and I wanted to leave a comment showing my support. I wish I could support you directly, but I‚Äôm currently pre-med and I have very little monetary income. I will strive to become like you one day. When I end my own journey through academia, I can only hope to remain as healthy, down to earth, educated (actually REMEMBER my education, like yourself) and sane at the end of all of it, which is particularly impressive knowing that YouTube is probably the loneliest job on earth.   In short, I love the videos, please keep it up, please don‚Äôt ever lose your confidence knowing how incredible you are, and regardless of how I‚Äôm 31 years old, I STILL want to be you when I grow up. You represent a nearly impossible standard that I‚Äôll nevertheless fail to reach, but be better off for just by trying. Thanks for making your videos and for being you!"
"I really do wonder what Ben Shapiro would have to say about Intersex individuals who are the gender opposed to their Karyotype"
"I've struggled to really identify with feminism for a long time now. I've always believed in its core tenets- that everybody deserves to be treated equally, but I've always felt there was a kind of gatekeeping going on within the community. Words like 'cis' and 'genderqueer' were thrown around and it seemed to me like we were expected to accept that this is what we're called, no exceptions. I'm from a generation where 'queer' was used as a slur, for instance, and I'm still not at all comfortable saying it out loud. It also didn't help that some rad fems were, let's face it, not very nice (though in fairness, the other side weren't nice either), which in my eyes shut down the chances for any meaningful dialogues. So, with that in mind, I am so, so, SO grateful that I stumbled across ContraPoints, which explains these concepts in an accessible way, and is just downright funny as fuck. Thank you. You've got another convert here!"

"I'm a She... Born as a She, mom and I'm a woman in my mind... I used to be (young adult) a lot about beeing sexy, having long hairs, etc... But now... Maybe because I'm a single-mono-parent to my boy... I'm not much into looking like a sexy... I'm not looking for a man... and If I still care about my appearance It's mostly to feel like me.    However, I was (temporairly) seeing my ex few months ago and lived something wird... He was much often, telling me I look like a queer.... And for a start I was not offended by -it, I simply let him know this is possible... I for two years now, cut my hairs short, and (If I did wear girlish clothing for years 17-36 years) I now doesn't care much about it.    But I was shock to realized that in fact (because he keept telling me I look like a queer)I realized that it was a way for him to shame me into getting back into my old behaviour...    But I donMt feel like it and I pretty mush feel good about myself.... But then I realized that sometime I talk of myself using masculine pronom or form... without being conscient of it... So I gues I finaly start to get what might be into 'in beetween' genders.  And in my mind, (I'm french) the bigger issue is HOW could we be clear about how we want to be called, so that at least 'civil' people could use the right pronom...  I'm still a women, she... But don't feel like I identify with pink-women-products... and I'm getting tired that our society are making a big thing about what a she of a he SHOULD BE LIKE..."

"I know for a fact there are people that want you to use their preferred pronouns, become enraged if you don't and would persecute people for assuming their genders. I've met my fair share. They would make it illegal to misgender someone. As you said, definitions can be changed, so we should respect individual interpretations of some words and how we as individuals define things. Just because no one has been arrested as a result of this law doesn't mean they won't be. If not much has changed because of this law, why was its passage necessary? I'll call you what I feel is appropriate because it's my decision and if I do so with the intention of respect, that intent should not be lost whether or not you feel respected. If you intentionally choose to disrespect me in response, you are only hurting your cause."
"This video PERFECTLY encapsulates gender chaos with flamboyance and humor.  Colorful, humorous cray-cray."
"I will admit, I got really excited about you discussing the difference between non-binary gender people and trans people, I wish you would do a whole video on it because it's still a place of confusion for me and you were starting to unravel the threads.

Your videos are so interesting, I need to stop falling in love with you--err I mean your channel"
"Deleting comments? Really?"
"The use of 'parent' in adoption is to ascribe a word that everyone KNOWS is NOT TRUE.  In fact, adoption is KNOWN to be a lie.  A white 'lie', but a lie nonetheless.

"The NAILZZZZ"
"We should honor and dignify the humanity of transgender people without joining in their delusions.  Like the crazy uncle living in the attic, we love you - we really do- but y'all are still cray-cray.  Pronouns are a convention to describe  sex not gender used in cultures worldwide.  Gender is an idea invented by white westerners who wanted to defy social norms related to sex.  People calling you 'she' is no more ACCURATE than using the word 'dog' to describe a cat.  The nomenclature is based on ACTUAL difference, not culture or perception.  The progressive sleight of hand by using language to supplant reality and MASK actualities is played out.   Perception is reality ONLY in the mind of the beholder.  It is mere opinion, or perspective, not factual or actual.  Not reality.  There are medicines, facilities and therapies for those who cannot distinguish between what goes on in one's head and what really exists."

"'...I am a woman in identity and in expression I am a mess' I died üòÇüòÇ 26:15"
"this is the best approach I've seen to this problem. so often i see trans people not actually caring to explain their position. i would call somebody by their pronoun if they ask me to. i don't mind 'they', it's weird but oh well. i do think the use z and x is a bridge too far, i just don't get the excessive expansion into language for their subjective states, if somebody misgendered me, i wouldn't care, i'd just be confused a bit so they can tolerate he/she if it is what they look like and i think that's reasonable to expect. but, i'm open so whatever, i'd dialogue with that person to find out what they prefer. i'm not trying to be a dick to anyone. however, i'm hitting a wall with c-16. in america you are safe if you misgender somebody, in canada, you are not and the fact that they felt to need to institute it into law is the only issue, it doesn't matter that nobody has been convicted, it's the threat that it could happen and it feels like an insidious powerplay. i don't want to be told how to speak by law. we have language and it is agreed. i accept some restrictions but i consider them reasonable. i do not consider legislating pronouns and he assertion that it is hate speech to be accurate or fair, it is bullshit. anyway. thankyou for the video. i think you are doing a good deed by explaining your perspective on these issues. i guess the fact that i don't question my gender identity kind of limits my ability to understand what it is like to not feel right in the body you were born into. that being said, it may be an overreach to expect alot of other people to even care. that is one of the compromises we make for living freely"
"Dear Contrapoints,   I don't know if you will ever read this comment. I suffer from severe depression. I'm sick and tired of all the hatred and tribalism in the world today.  You are a breath of fresh air. I just want to let you know that your wonderfully insightful video content has restored some of my faith in humanity.   Your videos aren't just informative, they're uplifting and like nutrition for the human spirit. I wish there were more people like you. Your videos make me doubt my own pessimistic outlook on life. Perhaps there is some hope for us yet. Thanks for all your time and effort, and may your success continue long into the future."

"This is an excellent video with a lot of good points. I would like to add though that singular they pronouns were introduced into English 700 years ago and as language has evolved it has managed to be kept. It was in the 1800s that a bunch of elitists decided that hey, maybe English should be more like Latin, and thus not have a singular they, which is 1) bad 2) the opposite of practical as language exists as a practical way to convey ideas and singular they is a staple of common communication. So the whole 'singular they isn't grammatically correct' argument isn't even universally agreed upon as it was just a group of people who tried (and failed) to force everyone to stop using language a certain way. The continued usage of singular they throughout the centuries can be found in various iconic pieces of literature even from the 20th century and also in a dictionary I got from the 80s. People who have an ideological disagreement with the existence of non-binary people are 1) mean 2) using an incorrect argument regarding the grammar of singular they and are basically fighting with a dictionary. It's a strange hill to die on but some people just... don't like dictionaries I guess? Which you probably knew anyway but you breeze over the grammar of it so quickly I just wanted to add this. Love your work. I recently found your videos and they're really good."

"Nicholas matte is an example of the types of people Shapiro is engaging with, you take a more lefty view without going full radical which is good but ultimately not Shapiros and Peterson's target challenge, there are most certainly leftist activists who are trying to conflate the 2 and it just ends up confusing everybody and that's the goal because when you wrap people up in mental hoops they're easier to manipulate if they think up is down and right is left, I would choose to call you she out of courtesy as I am sure Peterson would, but I totally disagree that I should be forced to so,, saying that if someone calls you are a he then they come across as dickish to me but that's their choice"

Here in the South, we can still call you honey, baby or sweetheart and avoid the whole pronoun thing if we're confused.  'Darling, what can I get for your today?'  'Baby, can I ring that up' (older person to younger one)  It's sort of like the Finnish person was saying below.  They are terms of endearment applied to anyone and are not sexist or sexual or demeaning.  Wish this could spread elsewhere... But alas and alack.  Kisses, though.  Shapiro, ughhhh.

I want to support them but I also dont want people always asking me my pronouns, or for my appearance to not mean anything related to my gender. You're so funny and dazzling. You often mention feeling like garbage- it would make me very happy if you feel good about yourself too. Thanks for the video."
"I don't know if I'm wrong in the way I see gender pronouns, but I kinda think of them like a title. Like... if someone wants to be called Miss, Mrs, Ms, etc. We ask which one of those they prefer and we don't get annoyed when they chose what they want to be called. So why should we get annoyed if they want to be called something else? You get to pick and that's what people should call you. Or maybe it's like when someone asks what you like to be called like 'Jessica, Jess, Jessie' etc. Really, to me it doesn't matter as long as I'm told what someone wants to be called and corrected politely when I'm wrong... but that could just be because I don't really give a shit about gender or gender-roles, or whatever. Like, I'm not sure how that's supposed to change the way I look at someone."

"you're always so well composed, i love how you addressed this! i'd like to take it a step further with when it is appropriate to classify someone as their birth sex and say that even then, there's a whole lot of fuzziness. i spent a lot of time thinking i should keep my gender marker with my health provider as female despite me being ftm trans. then i had a revelation with one of the nurses while i was in. i am not really a female biologically speaking. sure, i was born one, but to just put my sex as female on paperwork leads to just as much left unaddressed as male. i don't have breast tissue, i don't have a uterus or cervix, i have the hormone levels of a cis man, and my presentation is fully male. from a purely scientific standpoint, the medical field should not treat me as a typical young female."

"I'm a non-binary person who uses they/them (and a few others if I'm in willing company). I didn't really read your other video as transphobic, but more as a manifestation of the identity vs presentation argument that's really familiar to me, bc I have it with myself all the time. There's a desire in all people to wanna fit in with someone, and I think it's entirely possible for trans people to be expressing that by leaning on presentation. I did it for a while! I tried to look as androgynous as possible, highlighting my face bones and making hair all short and shaving and making sure my chest never looked too big, but the more I thought about this the more I thought 'what does this do for me'. On the one hand, it made people around me more confused and got me a variety of pronouns, but on the other it was an absurd amount of work that I didn't really feel fulfilled in doing, both gender wise and for my actual physical appearance. I hated parts of my body for being in the way of my presentation but, like you, I still got misgendered. I had to sit and think for a bit bc, what is this. Do I care what cis people think? And for a while that answer was yes. But then I got to the point where I don't care about that or binary or other non-binary people think about how I present. Presentation is variable, it can change from minute to minute if you want it to. My gender was not (I can't speak for genderfluid experiences here obvs). So why the fuck should I do anything but what makes me most happy with my hair, or my chest, of my face? The people who want me to be strictly androgynous aren't gonna change their minds bc I present enough. (and also. The androgynous concept we have in American culture rn is v punishing in that it links skinny white and hairless as necessities for a presentation.) But since I've allowed my presentation to skew more femme I'm getting more misgendered and more misogyny (misdirected at an NB tho it may be). It's a hard discussion for anyone who thinks about gender too long to have, bc tbh I don't think there's a universal answer. I'm affected by my presentation whether I want to be or not, but my identity isn't. That doesn't mean it's the same for everyone else."

However I enjoy your levelheadedness and your attempts to be rational about the topics. You're doing a great job in presenting the points of 'the other side' to people like me and, as I said, while I don't '100% agree with you all the time', I feel like I'm getting a little bit more insight on some issues I previously brushed off as 'sjw nonsense'. You're probably not making me give up my conservative values alltogether (and I don't think you try to, either), but your way of presenting points and underlying issues is great and very effective. This may actually be one of the most valuable youtube channels when it comes to getting a somewhat reasonable insight on current issues."

"So where‚Äôs the futch scale of Contrapoints characters?"
"So here's a question regarding the understanding portion of pronouns (I hope that made sense). It's a bit wordy,  you have been warned Speaking as (not for) a cis male, I have absolutely no idea what being male 'feels' like. 'Feels' being in quotes simply because most times I hear being trying to explain or describe their experiences with their gender identity, they bring up what it feels like to be a particular gender. So I don't really know what it 'feels' like to be a guy, because from my perspective, I just feel like whatever it is I feel like. This isn't to say I doubt or disbelieve anybody's experience, just that I have no way of empathising with it. I have no way to understand what they're trying to convey.  So if a trans person asked me to refer to them as a different pronoun, I would be happy to do so. It'd take a little bit of getting used to, as I refer to people by their names and pronouns more as a matter of habit than conscious thought, but it's an effort I have no problem with making. It's not really putting me out.  So perhaps this is just because of my lack of understanding the feeling of a particular gender, but I don't quite get what's wrong with referring to someone by their chosen pronouns out of politeness rather than understanding. This goes doubly so for non-binary people, once again, not because I doubt the validity of their identity or experiences, but because the idea of feeling (once again, for lack of a better term) a non-binary gender seems a step further removed from feeling genders at all. With all that waffle out there, I guess the question is... What's the problem with calling someone by the correct pronouns out of politeness rather than understanding? And is there a way for someone who does not experience gendered feelings (at least, so far as they are aware) to understand to any extent what different genders feel like?  ((Sorry for the text wall of a question and if this comes across as ignorant or bigoted. Even if it turns out my question is misguided, I AM legitimately trying to learn))"

I mean, I think some people may have issues with it, whatever may them be, but as long as they are respectful in every other way (not insulting, not being indulgent or treating you like mentally ill), if they just don't feel comfortable calling a trans by the gender they want to be, then... well, its not that big of a deal. I tend to relate it a bit to religion, tough taking into account its many differences. I do it in the sense that I am a christian living in an increasingly atheist society (specially at academical places like university), so of course I have to live surrounded by people who doesn't believe what I do. I have no issue with them not believing what I do, or that they freely express their critical view of religion, as long as it is made with respect. Because I've also seen many people just inmediately relating christian to 'weak, gullible people who don't know any better', and I think the key difference is in the intention. What makes them offensive is not their atheism itself, but the way their atheism makes them see the 'others' as lesser beings. I think that, as long as people treat each other as human beings, I think that being critical o being uncomfortable using a pronoun that (for whatever reason) they may just not feel like it,  its not the most important thing."

Gender non-binary people seem to be arguing for something far more radical, something that seems to culminate in the end of standard human perception of sex categories as reflected in everyday language.  This is what has people like myself, a paranoid cis-normy sensitive to the the ideological battles being played out in the linguistic domain, a little freaked out."
"shapiro has so many hoops to bounce through for his ideology there's no dimension where it's correct"
"I particularly loved your style in the second segment.  You're enchanting throughout but the rainbow headpiece and the shiny glittery moist lipstick was particularly mesmerizing. Also, beyond enjoying the fashion show, I adore your perspective."
"I feel too poor to relate to this, but I love the video"
"hahahaha. every single video a masterpiece. i love this flamboyant, marvellous faggotry ;)"
"This video is a little to long for the topics it has covered. I am sorry to say this, but I don't really agree with some of your points just like I do with Ben.  Love the candy hair made me actually hungry and that furry video sounds intriguing. If I would see someone like you on the streets what would be a really low chance by the way I would call you a woman atleast, even with knowing there is something more to it. Just manners, I just don't like those collage girls who claim to be boys or whatever they are bragging about these days. They are so vocal about it and don't leave any room open for discussion... and there are so many like them nowadays, I rather have people like you who can make it clear what their game is.."

Please keep talking, don‚Äôt ever stop, and is it true there‚Äôs a thing where I can dress like a drag queen even tho I‚Äôm a hetero(probably) female? I have always longed to be fabulous, and it always seemed so unfair that people like you and Divine got to be fabulous and not me.  But to get back on topic: I love you."
"my god you deliver things so effectively! also, i don't even want to think about how long it probably took to put that rainbow hairpiece together"
"Oooh. Contra. Pefect. Every time. Just *MWAH* üòöüëå You're so good at what you do."
"That headpiece though. <3 <3 <3"

"The whole chromosome thing as the basis of sex assignment is so dumb. There are individuals born with just one X chromosome, XXY, XXX XYY, XXYY, and other variations. There are even individuals whose bodily tissues are made up of cells with different sets of DNA (twins in the womb whose bodies have fused together so seamlessly that they are effectively one single person). Biology is way weirder than most folks would think"
"I love the way you were able to evoke such emotion using Blaire's analogy."
"I enjoy watching and listening to your discussions , but it seems to me that throughout this you are actually just making ben shapiro's point. It also seems that from what you are saying that a ts female should only be called a female if they are passable enough to warrant that term. I do think you usually make intelligent arguments though. It would be nice to have you do as blair white did and see if ben would be willing to have a youtube discussion on this topic with you."
"Yeah, at this point, Ben's just keeping up the 'I refuse to call a transgender person by the pronouns that best reflect their current appearance, because biology' as a way to stay hip and edgy among his conservative fan-base. As you demonstrated, even HE has to exert conscious effort to 'correct' himself when he 'mis-identifies' a passing trans-woman as a 'she'.    Identifying trans people as the gender they appear to be just makes sense... And if they're like Zoe Tur, and can't pass worth a crap, it's STILL just a common courtesy to pretend like they're 'blending in' with the natural gender-landscape...   But non-binaries, on the other hand... It's obvious that they only want to be considered some mystical, magical in-between gender because they want people to think they're special, and since they can't convince anybody that they're special by any LEGITIMATE means, they have to try to coerce them into believing their fantastical fairy-tales of being the 'missing link' between man and woman."
"The blooper (in the middle of the talk with the swirly rainbow candy hair) was what made me fall in love with your channel. This is the first video of yours I've ever seen. And I will see so many more now!"
"Contra points always does really good stuff. The reasoning is tight, tight, tight mmmm good. Jan Moir, nonagenarian Brit trans woman holds that ' we should all try to be kinder to each other'. That is all clear. The details are....wow...tricky. Philosophically demanding, exhausting even. So Natalie's effort to condense the complexity to a straightforward prescription that any cis individual of good will might readily assimilate is also very wise and reasonable. She (Natalie) is wrong about none of this. And if her happiness, and her dignity, and her assimilation into society as an equal, a citizen and a patriot is best accomplished by other equals and citizens and patriots according her some preferred pronouns as a matter of common courtesy that Ben Shapiro and Action Flower ought best not quibble with. Right? Case closed right? And there is more:- The principle of ' mind yer own damn bizniz and don't tell other folk what they should be doing with their bodies or aught else that don't belong to you and your damn religious convictions'. That last one is the killer knockout blow in Natalie's argument.  It is as killer, and as knockout as ' facts don't care about your feelings'. Eeeyeah. But. It is a bit TOO neatly resolved either way. It is bit too much like the rage with which the action of a flower may not hold a plea. It leaves the matter of Natalie feeling like shxx out of account. That is no small thing right? The action of a flower ought hold a plea with Natalie ( or anyone else) feeling like shxx. Ought offer something more than just an easy way out that lets Action Flower simply be correct? Something more and better ( like really, truly caring...or trying to figure out what might really be the sort of love that asks for no reward)...well that's hard eh? That's a proablem eh? Not likely to yield a triumphantly conclusive answer. Surgery sure sounds triumphant and conclusive and reality bending and irrevocable and legal ....and kinda violent nay? Would it be okay to say something like...'whatever is wrong, IF at all possible, fixing it by means other than surgery is a less violent approach'....the correct answer is ' mind yer own biz' sure. But...y'know? If I freely spoke with free speech to someone unique and precious and valuable ( and who is not that?) then maybe I might say something along those lines.   Peace.  Out.  PS...more Shakespeare PLEASE....contra points Shakespeare is to live for!"

"My opinions on Shapiro are very... mixed to say the least. Lately ive been more likely to side with conservatives lately, but this is a very well made video that gives a very different perspective. I will say tho that while its good no one has been arrested for the enforced pronoun law, the fact it exists, meaning people COULD be arrested for it in thr future, is not a good thing; while i try to use the preferred pronouns of anyone i meet, i personally think allowing people to be a dick is an unfortunate necessary evil that we need to allow to protect free speech (i will argue that we can still call these people out tho with the same free speech we are allowed). Still, this was a very well made video that was very entertaining and easy to understand"
"You are not a she, but not a he either because you do not identify as a man, it is irrelevant you think to be a woman in your head, you are not. The right pronoun for your would be IT. I am a woman, and sorry you are not a woman, and she is used for women, and you are being disingenuous in your rhetoric. I am sure I am going to get the usual braindead idiots calling me' bigot' as you sjw types like to call others to shut down criticism of your insanity.

"It's fun to see how for Ben the argument about whether adoptive parents can be just as qualified as biological parents depends on context but when it's applied to trans people's preferred pronouns he's not willing to give them the same amount of respect. It goes to show how weak his argument is. We all know that language is extremely fluid and mostly determined by society.  And also I don't get why he refuses with all his heart to use a preferred pronoun, such unapologetic and childish behavior"

"Love this, though I wonder if it's strawmanning to only address Ben Shapiro's definition of gender as based on chromosomes, when many people hold a different definition?  I've seen many people who define 'gender' as 'what sex organs did you exhibit at birth', which circumvents the argument Contra makes at 7:00, debunking the idea that chromosomes would define gender in the descriptive approach, without her addressing the concept of external sex organs.   Anyone got CounterPoints?"

"Disregarding the kinda pointless comment I put here before, considering how carefully constructed your videos are, the moment toward the end of you being candidly silly about your outfit made me smile. There's nothing wrong with scripting and preparation, especially for something as rooted in careful discussion as your content on gender, but seeing a moment where you can be unscripted and genuine helps me relate to you a bit more. You're a goof and you make me happy, Natalie //u//"
"i respect people's pronouns and gender identities short of the them xlem xler xlorp bullshit. gender is fake in all the ways that count. it's a social construct. but deconstructing the biological meanings of male and female is ludicrous. if you find a disfigured body in the woods do you test it to see if it's male or female or do you speculate as to what it identified as in life?"

Its much easier for us to be honest with ourselves about our true feelings than to hide them under a 'movement' of assholery. But when you're a confused bigot, that's kind of you're only option. Its unfortunate that Ben cant just say 'I'm confused about and uncomfortable with trans people' because that's a much easier problem to solve than tearing down an entire movement based around the nonsense of the 'biology' of language."

After all, _his_ name is Benjamin, not 'Ben' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro so every time he introduces himself as 'Ben', he's 'lying' according to his own bad logic.

"inb4 I, as a ciswoman, have mistakenly misgendered other cis folks and they got mad. Because it's about the respect of getting it right really.  Let's just say catching a fleeting glance of a woman in my peripherals, calling her 'Sir' and freezing like a deer in the headlights is just enough of an awkward time for a cashier as anything that when you're the one being mistakenly called 'sir' for the same exact reasons, you totally don't bat an eyelash at forgiving them. It's not a biological argument really. It's a battle of validity and respect over being a fucking asshole and fighting change in an ever-changing world where new types of people are being born. Being ineffective at adapting is how many animal in nature have gone extinct if you care to debate on biology.  And for all that matters, Points, I 100% thought you were a woman in the first video I saw, and you still are in my heart.... just with extra... bit and history now attached. Keep doing what you're doing because these debates need to be had to help both trans and cis folks navigate this scary world filled with people who get your desired pronoun wrong regardless of if you're trans or cis."
"You are the best thing to happen to youtube and I stan the shit outta you. Bean Sharpie is an irredeemable turdhoover."
"I may be a few days late here, but there's something that I think needs to be brought up about this topic. I follow both you and Blaire and have for quite some time. Chrome crashed on me while I was typing it, and perhaps I should take that as a sign to keep my fat mouth shut lest I end up in some kind of hot water, but I'm nobody, so I don't really care, tbqfh.  A couple months ago, Blaire did a livestream about 'coming clean' or something or other, to explain why she veered away from doing political commentary on her channel. (Sidenote: Ya'll should chill on raking her over the coals since she p much stopped doing what ya'll wanted her to stop doing, but I digress..). She stated on this livestream that her reasoning for steering away from the political commentary was the discovery that some of her colleagues, people in her network, her peers, etc., where 100% fake; that some of these individuals push out their slanderous, bigoted, alt-right-esque videos, and yet don't believe in any of the opinions they regularly espouse; that some don't swing conservative in the slightest.   Now, Blaire was 'careful' enough to not namedrop anybody, but that didn't stop chat from doing so. More than a few people in chat claimed they 'knew' who Blaire was referring to and one name came up repeatedly: Ben Shapiro. Others in chat brought up various names, asking 'Is it [name]?', 'It must be [name]!', etc, and to a lot of those, Blaire responded anywhere from 'No, not [name], they're legit.' to 'I don't know [name], so I can't say.' to 'Oh god no, definitely not.' But she never responded to anyone asking about Ben. To rephrase: She cleared many, if not all, accusations levied by chat, but when it came specifically to Shapiro, she just beat around the bush or changed the subject.   Of course she's not going to throw him, or anyone else, under the bus, because they could potentially pursue legal action, if not getting her kicked from her network or blacklisted if it just so happened to be one of her colleagues. From my perspective, the avoidance of the topic is enough evidence in and of itself, otherwise why not clear his name as she did with many others?   I checked her channel, and the livestream isn't available. Whether it's been unlisted or privated, I have no idea. Surely I can't be the only one to put the very simple pieces together, so I'd imagine someone closer to her circle of friends probably clued her in, especially considering she hasn't brought the topic up again.   If Shapiro is a fake, it might be a more prudent use of time to nail him on that. Perhaps it'll shit on his mild rise in relevancy, perhaps he'll lose his job, perhaps his followers lose faith in their bullshit. And as for the rest of us who don't have youtube channels, it might be a more prudent use of our energy to simply ignore him and his rhetoric, because he might as well be cartoon character barely worthy of an eye-roll.   Or, you know, spam his videos with comments about his fake persona. That might be fun, too."
"i watched the 'mademoiselle POINT' moment 5 times over, it makes me laugh each time x]"
"I don't think what people are called in regards to pronouns is really up to them and the stance that it is or should be (some do hold that stance) puts an unfair burden on society. Ben Shapiro treats it the way he does in order to stir the pot (clearly). I''ll refer to a person as 'her' or 'she' if they present well enough as a woman. Regardless of what the biological reality is.   But if someone starts to correct me on what their pronouns are and I don't buy into it. It's not me being an obstinate hobgoblin. Because I'm not the one whose placing an imposition on someone (and it is an imposition). If I buy into that, I'm also forced to explain it to others. Which I really don't have the time to do and really don't care to waste the time of others doing.   I wouldn't say 'she' or 'her' to tell the whole story. Don't have the time or inclination to be telling people's whole story. I use those words so that other people get my meaning without me having to spend 5 minutes explaining things to them. If I see a woman and my buddy sees a woman. Then that person is going to be refereed to as woman. Someone might have to break it to someone else that said woman has a dick at some point.  But it's about clearly and concisely communicating to each other what we sense. That's what most language is for. So at least in  the day-to-day. Appearance is all that matters."

"Oh no, Contra's started transitioning into an evil candy monster!"
"Hi Contra. Just wanted to say thank you for again addressing something I've been uncomfortable with, and doing so in a way that doesn't shame me for not being onboard with it initially. Respectfully, I've struggled with preferred pronouns, namely non-binary ones, because they create a separation for normalcy that plagued me as a gay teenage boy. It was that 'not a boy, not a girl' mentality that framed a lot of the violence and bullying I dealt with growing up. So, when it came around that people actually wanted to be talked about like they weren't part of heteronormative society, I immediately held back and fenced off any discussion about it. I heard it as people actually wanting the violence I would have nervous breakdowns over on a monthly basis in high school.  I feel I understand that this isn't about the same culture. In fact, it's very much a protest against what I have believed would be me treated equally. While the binary is OK, and I do identify with my biological gender, respecting pronouns ultimately means respect for the individual regardless of whether they are 'man' or 'woman'. And that's really what I want. Not to have to be accepted within the framework of what people are willing to respect as equal, but accepted in the framework of being a human being with as much purpose and right to exist as any person given life.  Again, thank you for breaking the wall on yet another topic. I've said it before and will say it again: I used to despise you, but now I can't imagine how closed-minded I would still be without you. Thank you for being here. I truly appreciate your work."
"i dont care if they are biological male or female. if i perceive the person a male, i use 'he', if i perceive the person female, i use 'she'. the issue i have are non-binary people, i tend to just use the pronoun i deem closest to the male/female gender they look like to me and hope they dont go batshit crazy over the pronoun i use."
"The sudden decent into madness when Natalie suddenly realizes how she's dressed to talk about traditional womanhood is highly relatable."
"I really love your videos Natalie, but what is your deal with completely acting like trans guys don't exist? I get you're obviously not a trans guy- but you're not nonbinary or a drag queen either but still speak freely about them in this video. You talk about being trans as a whole but only address trans women and nonbinary experiences when trans men have the same core issues. I have no doubt you have seen the jokes about trans guys just not existing because no one talks about them and honestly you are contributing to that here. You have an entire video dedicated to pronouns where you go in detail on trans women, nonbinary people, drag queens, cis people.. but never once mention trans men. I have seen you mention trans guys a few times in tweets and I do understand you not wanting to speak for the trans guy community but I am irritated by the complete lack of inclusion in this video."

"I've always seen this as an issue of being respectful and disrespectful. I'm a cis guy, but I'm pretty passive and maybe even feminine for a straight cis guy. I had a boss who would refer to me as 'her', and then she'd laugh and and say 'I mean him'. The first time was just a mistake, but she did it quite a few times, and it felt annoying cause I know it was just a passive way of saying 'your not really masculine enough to be a guy'.  Now I know I won't ever be misgendered as much as any trans person, who could very well happen every day, but I can say from personal experience how annoying it is, but you dont even really need a personal experience to understand that it's rude, your disregarding someone else's gender based on your own standards.   I dont think my old boss should have been punished, even if I was trans, for making rude comments, but I also think we should strive for a society where we can treat each other respectfully. I dont think you can really enforce 'respectfulness' as a rude person is gonna be rude no matter what: personality cant be warped that easily from external sources it comes from the inside and from upbringing, rather I think it's up to those of us who are respectful towards each other to lead by example."

"I think the majority of people mostly have a problem with alien gender, ze, zer, xim, etc i couldn‚Äôt have cared less with people swapping gender, unless they are minors. I even remember rolling my eyes at the bathroom debate, because the majority of restrooms have separate stalls. However I am worried that people with vaginas are going to be thrown under the bus. Whenever a cis woman brings up the possibility of rape. Advocates are quick to chime in rape is illegal and should be convicted wherever it happens. Ok but what about trans women who were convicted of sexual assault and put in a female prison where she continued to assault and rape the inmates, which has actually happened. I realize women can still rape but the victim wouldn‚Äôt be impregnated, and depending on a trans person stage of transition they can still be fertile. I honestly don‚Äôt know the answer what should be done because i would never put a trans woman like Blair in a male prison, but i would really like contra to address this heavy issue."
"ok so here's how pronouns work my dudes of various genders: you tell me your pronouns and then i use the ones you tell me and move on with my life.  I'm actually gonna watch the vid when i have time but i mean- that's. that's literally it. just use the fucking pronouns someone gives you. it makes them feel like a human and it costs you nothing."
"Did someone say Laura Jane Grace?  Fucking love Against Me! <3"

"I wish I could just mainline you the feelings you make me feel because they're all so fucking nice to feel and I want that for you very much <3"
"Free speech means people are free to speak (their words).  If a literal-minded person thinks the accuracy of the primary meaning of a pronoun is important/hardwired/conditioned into them, and with more gravitas than your preferences of the words the come out of their mouth can tolerate, then you‚Äôre anti-free speech and conceivably an oppressor and have no virtue to signal.  Only selfish interest shareable with the likeminded.   Would I call you she or her?  To your face as a courtesy to or in reference to your performance, possibly but if I ‚Äòsocially error‚Äô in our encounter in this regard and you try to force it, you‚Äôre a failure as an empathetic human being.  People don‚Äôt grow up to be receptive to just your ‚Äòbrand‚Äô of ideation.  Be more open minded."

Like who gives a fuck Ben people are starving if someone who looks like a girl but has a penis you'll never have to see anyway wants you to call her a she just freaking do it like a decent human being. I don't get transgenderism and I don't need to, because I'll never fully understand what people who are go through anyway. Plus all this talk of 'well they were born a female/male' will okay but they weren't born with the pronouns he or she printed on their face, language itself is just a human invention anyway, like who. freaking. cares.

"To me it seems gender roles are made up structures/ narratives as it were. It also seems that non binary people feel this and don't feel like they fit into either structure which makes perfect sense to me. But I would go one step further; because these rolls are completely made up and most people wouldn't identify with what the prototypical he/she is, as in most people don't identify as football, america, jesus man or sewing shiny dress woman, really we should refer to everyone as they."

"I view pronouns as indicator of your gender role- how you present yourself. So I'd call someone who looks like a woman 'she' regardless of what they have unless I know that they want to be called otherwise. Pronouns definitely do not indicate sex, nor do the words 'men' and 'women' when used in the context of a gender role or identity. I tend to save the words 'female' and 'male' when talking about sex. Though I do think it would be useful to have a term to describe the sex of transitioning trans people so we don't get into silly arguments and I believe 'transsexual' has been used in that manner though I'm not sure- there may be some stigma attached. Regardless I think it'd be useful in health care setting"

"Just to further point how language is utterly meaningless, some languages don't have an 'it' pronoun so every single object out there is either male or female, I've actually had conversations with foreiners learning my language on, why it's a 'she table' and not a 'he table'. Why is the floor male or the bed female? Pure convention. Why do we correct people? So we can help them integrate in their new environment. Why LGBTQ people care about their pronouns? Oh look it's so they can feel integrated."

"I still have conflicts with your personal opinions but I overall understand what you're saying.  I think what proves your point in some ways is the existence of He/Him Lesbians who use 'male' pronouns due to their relationship with masculinity (being that this group largely consists of Butch woman.)  Which I guess is also relevant to the Futch scale.  Perhaps you should talk on this if given the opportunity.  (I also know some trans men hate this but as a trans man who is friends with many He/Him Lesbians personally it doesn't bother me.)   I do believe the goals of those who do not 'fit the societal standards' of expression perhaps eschew these standards with the specific goals of changing them.  As we all know standards of beauty and expression are not concrete."

"Serious question, the differences between a FtM, Trans woman, Drag Queen, Trap, Crossdresser, and Genderfluid?  I came back from a convention where they had Omni gender bathrooms, they had pronoun name tags for any who wanted, and although it was a small Convention of less than 900 people (it may have had over a thousand by Saturday) I don't recall hearing a single disturbance or complaint."
"I don't know about the rest of you, but there's only one Authority that I look to when referring to pronouns. His name is Alexander Andreas Armadillo.   Pronouns were simply used to take the place of a proper noun for ease of use in language.   https://youtu.be/koZFca8AkT0"
"The reason I love ContraPoints so much is that she could very easily build her entire career off of telling trans woman exactly what we want to hear at all times, but she doesn't. She knows that in being nothing but a shining pillar of affirmation she opens herself up for criticism from the right and her arguments will be too easy to dismantle and everything she puts out there will in essence, be useless, even if she is making money doing it."
"She instead takes a lot of time and effort to construct arguments that are way more tamper-proof by rhetoric on the right, but also opens herself up to criticism from people on the left who really just wanna hear her say 'you're valid', and honestly, that's braver than ANY U.S. Marine."
"Holy shit this is amazing. You're making the best point too, it takes no skin off anyone's back to use someone else's preferred pronoun. It's only respectful."
"Still can‚Äôt believe Ben is Mara Wilson‚Äôs cousin. And fuck me, that little gremlin has spawn?!"
"Amazing video as usual, Natalie! Your videos always make me think for a few minutes even after they end. For anyone looking for another genderqueer person to follow, I suggest looking into the beautiful and amazing Annie Elainey! They are super creative and give interesting insight into how their gender exists in relation to disability and ethnicity."
"I noticed you use clips from the Joe Rogan Experience. I'm a socialist trans girl who really enjoys Rogan's work, but he's become almost a guilty pleasure because he's said things that are so offensive to the community. I do think there is an element of masculine insecurity in his work, but I think he's a good, intelligent person despite this and I believe he is open minded. I don't like a lot of the guests he has on his show (Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Milo, etc.) but I'm glad that he (and the similarly problematic comedian) Bill Maher have shows that expose me to far right beliefs. It is almost like a vaccine. When I encounter people who think this way, I feel more capable of debating them because I have already considered their position and potential arguments. Your show (of course) provides a similar intellectual service.  This is a roundabout way of me asking you to talk more about where we on the left 'draw the line' as far as opinions we're allowed to express or people we should give a platform for."
"I've always questioned why it's such a difficult task to use preferred pronouns, and most of the time, I hear Shapiro's regurgitated argument. For people who claim to care so much about facts, they sure fuck up my pronouns all the damn time. I'm a biological woman that just happens to look like a sixteen year-old Mexican boy; stop calling me 'Sir,' if you give such a shit about being factually correct. Or just admit that you are being willfully antagonistic to people you don't understand."

"ANOTHER LIBTARD DESTROYED"
"I have an XX karyotype, yet was born with a penis. A glorious, dangling, penis of approximately average length. Even the doctor at my birth said I was male. Yet half a dozen blood draws and a needle to my hip stubbornly returned the diagnosis of De La Chapelle syndrome.  Does that mean if I slapped Ben in the face with it he couldn't claim assault because 'it's impossible for a biological woman to have a penis,' and thus could not have happened?"

"This is...grotesque. The bit with the guy who threatened Shapiro. It's obvious, Somebody may think Blair white is a woman so they'd instinctively use the pronoun she. Whereas the guy who threatened Shapiro looks manlier than him. 'She' refers to a female. We all know what a female is. Gender is a biological reality. You claim to not dispute this, but you do when you propose it is a malleable spectrum and a form of expression. There is no argument or debate after this point, nature assigns our gender not a doctor.  We can dress how we want, present ourselves how we want, but it doesn't change the reality that we cannot become members of the opposite sex. And there are not 'types of genders' as there are 'types of legal guardian'. If you had accepted gender as being a biological reality you would not be making this argument.  I'd call somebody whatever they wanted, she, he or they. but i doubt anybody who suffers gender dysphoria ever really believes that they are complete and that they have become a woman. My validation or lack of changes nothing.  Your bit about 'true gender' at the end is gibberish. You are describing a man who wishes they were born a woman. It doesn't get any more complicated than that.  The increasing number of people 'identifying'. Yes, Marxist claptrap is popular and spreads like wildfire among young people looking to carve out a more interesting identity than stale pale cishet whypipo."

"In my experience it's really natural to use the 'singular They' in all kinds of totally noncontroversial manners - is it a regional (I'm English) or recent thing to be unfamiliar with it? Or is it one of those things that is used widely (like 'she' for boats) but is specifically forgotten when attempting to perform anger about other people's pronouns?"
"The bottom line is, you can't dictate to me what speech to use. You may wish I would call you her, but I won't, and I don't have to. I don't have to acknowledge your belief that your gender has nothing to do with your biology. I also have the right to argue how my definition of gender is applied in society, ie. which restroom you should use.  There really is no point in discussing it further, because your point is moot. If I saw you in public somewhere, I would say 'look at that guy over there dressed up like a girl', and there really isn't anything you can do about it, and there is nothing that you can say to make me think any different."

"Strict social roles are key to conservative thought - that we allow the poor to become wealthy was absolutely intolerable to conservatives for a long time - protecting the established social order means keeping that order static.  People ‚Äúgetting uppity‚Äù and wanting to be more than peasants is a direct analogy here - Shapiro is protecting privilege because that‚Äôs what conservatives do.  That the poor aren‚Äôt biologically different from the wealthy (‚Äúnoble blood‚Äù) is something we still struggle with, and if Ben could find a genotype for wealth, he‚Äôd defend it as inherent biology as well.  Basically just eugenics, the idea that criminality is hereditary has a long history though - it gave us Australia!"

"I'm CIS and gay male and I tend to avoid pronouns unless I know.   I'm in the furry community and there are a lot of trans/gender fluid people and I just don't want to be rude.    I just stay neutral in my language unless told otherwise.   Also I try not to bother people about their gender as they likely have to deal with the question ALL THE FUCKING TIME and I imagine that tends to wear a person out.  I did have one moment about 2 years ago when throwing a party realizing my bedroom is now full of trans women and they were gossiping.    That was the moment I realized my life was now weirder than I ever imagined it to be when I was growing up."

"Myself, the impeccable image of an anime girl ordering at McDonald's: 'U-um, hi! I'll just have a large coffee, double-double please!'

Myself, now a pepe in a dress: 'Ok man.'"
"How does the singular ‚Äúthey‚Äù work in the restaurant  scenario? You know this is all sort of irrelevant; the second person personal pronoun is used to address someone-the third to talk of them. So even if your make-up artist presents as ‚Äúfemale ‚Äú but identifies as ‚Äúmale‚Äù it seems to be the mirror image of the Shapiro/White scenario if we use the restaurant analogy. It would seem rather impractical to refer to him as him, wouldn‚Äôt it? If he presents the same way as 90% women do, in the situation where you have to identify him to someone else then that defeats the purpose of a pronoun in the first place, as you may as well say ‚Äúhe‚Äù who presents as ‚Äúshe‚Äù ...and then it serves no linguistic purpose other than politeness to a person who may not be aware of it. With all due respect it seems somewhat lacking in self-awareness to criticise little Ben for his lack of understanding regarding the nature of grammar."
"The restaurant example is why I tend to laugh at anyone who deliberately refers to me as 'she'. Yes, you would be right in saying that I am biologically female, and if I were going to a new doctor, I wouldn't hesitate in telling them that I was born female because it is important to my general wellbeing that the doctor knows this. But if you needed to describe me to someone, it would be more trouble than it's worth to call me a woman since I look like one of the dwarfs from the Hobbit."
"As a bisexual, I found you gorgeous before and after your transition. You just stay winning <3"
"It's pretty weird that you would make this video now about what I'd call old news (dunno when the Blaire debate happened, I'm assuming it was more than a few months ago), when very recently, there was a clip of him answering a question about his opinion on trans people, where he said something along the lines of 'Of course, if I'm having dinner or whatever with a trans woman for example, I wouldn't go around calling them 'he' because that's just uncivil and rude, what I'm debating is the fact that I would be legally obligated to, I don't want my free speech infringed.' I'm sure you wouldn't agree that the second half of the statement is valid, I think you kind of missed the point with C-16 or whatever it's called. But I find it interesting that he says he wouldn't call a trans woman a 'he' because he doesn't want to be rude to them. I genuinely think this man has learned from his interaction with Blaire."

"Hmmm so i feel like Ben usses the thing to trigger people to show how uncivil they are and alot are. but when somone like you would debate him i belive it WOULD work out. I can seee both side. Biologicly trans women are not 'women' would i call you a she? of course out of respect. But  with the point of adoptave parent the most thing would be using the descriptor ah that trans women over there but isn't that a little off putting? it sucks because as you said words ARE jsut words and some people use words diffrently, What we need to do is have a discussion of what these words to mean to people hell create a new word for women in soceity if need be 'he and she' would be biological and xyz would be for pronouns thus also able to fit non binary people inside. as a more right leaning person it's hard to see both sides plug thier ears and not listen to eachother."

Rarely do I find one on that side of the spectrum who hasn't made it into their sole identity, where everything revolves around being so one-dimensional."
"I love this video because you're demonstrating how impractical the attempt at a prescriptive use of pronouns is.  Like, I'm a trans guy and I pass, so people will call me 'he.' No one is going to look at my chromosomes or in my pants to determine what to call me. They're going to make a snap judgement about my gender based on what I look and sound like, just like they would to a cis person. A pronoun isn't a scientific term used to refer to someone's genetic karyotype. Heck, I don't even know if my chromosomes are XX, although I assume they are."
"As a non-binary person, my 'problem' is that ever since I was little, I never felt comfortable with the pronoun 'she.' Whenever someone used 'she,' I either cringe, or I think, 'Oh yeah, that's me...' So I started using 'they' a couple years ago, although not many people know it yet, so I hear 'she' all the time still."

"I have a question that I have run into when telling stories of persons before they transition. Because, at the time, they were living as their assigned gender, is it wrong to continue referring to their pre transition state with that assigned genders pronouns?    To use your content as an example, I would say that 'in contrapoints video on white nationalism he says (so and so) and in a more recent video she said aesthetics is the language of fascism'  I am aware that these cases are probably individual in nature, and when the topic comes up I always try to ask to see if there is a general trend.  Love your content Cheers"

"If you think of Romance languages and their pronouns, you immediately realize pronouns are not about biology, because EVERYTHING has a pronoun. A table doesn't have chromosomes (lol), and still it's feminine. The sun doesn't have chromosomes (haha), and still it's masculine. And many languages have multiple genders for their pronouns too. Sweedish, for example, and Finish."

"On a serious note, Ben Shapiro's remark about his daughter makes me wonder. If your child is completely at ease with their designated sex, why do you think that knowing about trans people would make said child want to transition or cause some immense confusion? Did learning about trans people make Ben Shapiro want to transition? No. So why would his child want to or experience some other undesired effect from merely knowing a certain thing exists?  I am not saying his child is trans. It may be that said child is merely finding out that people designated female at birth are treated pretty badly particularly by misogynists like Ben Shapiro.  How often has he caused said child to say 'then I do not want to be a girl', I wonder."

"Ben Shapiro is a f‚Äôking twerp.  I've seen him in long form interviews, and he seems to espouse some sort of pseudo-conservative masculinity without having any value outside of navel gazing conservatism and weak support for his points. He really doesn't know the first thing of the vast majority of subjects he speaks about. Conservatives think he's smart because he regurgitates their bigoted opinions, but does so quickly and they mistake confidence, smugness and fast talking jive for logical or knowledgeable debate.  The reasons I've heard as to why people like Shapiro is that, 'He just makes sense' or 'You can't argue with his logic'. When really he just uses pithy quips and turns of phrase, talks at a million mph, and when you need more than a second to process what he just said he signals to his audience to laugh and/or acknowledge he won."

"I actually had been alarmed by jordan peterson's warnings about the canadian bill.  Or, maybe not worried that many people would actually be thrown in jail, but just definitely opposed to it on free-speech grounds.  I'd always thought that free speech was a cause-celebre of the left, and it really bothers me that a lot of young leftists seem to have no problem with using the power of the state to curtail the expression of heinous views... like they'll say that they 'believe in free speech, but not for nazis'.  That doesn't work -- the *only* test of whether or not one values freedom of speech is if one is willing to allow the speech they find *most* offensive.  Mind you when i push people on the right that supposedly share my position from basic principle, they often fail as well (like the youtuber who was jailed for praising al-qaeda attacks and the deaths of coalition forces -- the (alt-)right draws a line there even though that's 100% constitutionally protected)."
""
"Anyway, the way peterson described the C-14 whatever bill seemed plausible enough, with the restrictions on hate speech we see in other liberal democracies countries with generally similar rights to us.  Good to see that it was false alarm and the worst consequence of the bill (somewhat ironically) was launching JP as a beloved icon of the anti-SJW/alt-right crowd, or whoever constitutes his fan-base."

"As for shapiro, i think this take-down is right the fuck on.  Guy is a tool, and his whole shtick of being no-nonsense/objective, like so many of his ilk (milo, steven crowder, that tomi lauren (?), etc.) is... i dunno sometimes they have decent points, but usually they're going against a straw man, or recycling the same old select examples where 'SJW's are legitimately acting ridiculous."

"His stance on pronouns being based on karyotype is... well you said it all well.  He's not as grounded as he thinks he is.  And as a linguistics major, hat tip for doing a pretty good job of elucidating the difference between prescriptivism/descriptivism.  That issue and the rather unique status of english as having so many mutually *intelligible* dialects also plays into racism hard.  Arabic speakers (or chinese or even spanish... i believe most broadly spoken languages are like this), because it's dialects are so far apart, understand that 'modern standard arabic' is merely an artificial construct and that no dialect is objectively more valid than any other, but english speakers too often have this idea that black people or others merely 'can't speak english correctly'."

"For what it's worth (i'm sure everyone is dying to hear another cis guy's take on pronouns), i'm not a fan of the 'artificial' neologisms mostly because 'they' is a perfectly acceptable non-gendered singular pronoun.  Anyone who claims otherwise is either ancient (maybe), stupid, or disingenuous.  People use singular-they *all the goddamn time*.   A: An old friend from back home is visiting me.  B: Oh yeah, what do they think of the city?    A: One of my professors said X. B: How did they defend that idea?'  A:  I heard someone was able to Y. B:  How did they manage that?  I simply don't believe anyone hearing those exchanges (removed from the context of arguing about pronouns) would notice or think them strange, or really insist that 'he or she' sounds more natural.  I've even noticed that sometimes randomly people will use a singular 'they' for a referent who's already been established with a gender, and had previously and will continue to be either 'he' or 'she', like just a fluke in one sentence 'they' gets dropped, and it doesn't seem that strange. That being said, mandarin (at least when spoken) not having gendered pronouns can be annoying.  I thought my girlfriend was being sexually harassed by a creepy new boss for a couple minutes until it was cleared up that the boss, being a woman, was just jealous of her tits.  Or when i'm telling a story i have to decide at the beginning whether or not to clear up immediately 'they were a guy/girl' when it's not really relevant to the story.  And just... anyone who thinks that having non-gendered language leads to less sexism... no, that's simply not the case.  China isn't as bad as people think (stereotype of 'asian' women being 'submissive' is laughable, and not only because asia is pretty big and far from monolithic), but they're pretty backward in a lot of respects."

"11:02 wait, that's a trans woman? Damn, they're getting good at it"
"How do people feel about 'trans woman' being a distinct gender identity from 'cis woman'? I'm happy to use female pronouns, I know straight guys beat off to trans porn, that's all fine, but the more I speak to trans people the more similar they seem in character to effeminate gay men. I'm not passing judgement, I love the twinks, that's just my experience. Obviously there are biological differences between cis and trans women, and it seems obvious to me that there are psychological differences, although I concede to statistics"

Like a core and defining aspect of their calling that also includes specific unique contributions to the whole thing that can end up being a new part of the man woman fluid etc. thing so that individuation within a unity co-creation dance dynamic is at play."

So if my problem is with the misuse, or should I say the misunderstanding of language, whether it be my own or others, I'm not sure how to proceed. Because I want to respect other people's wishes but also don't want to blindly follow rules I don't understand...

I am a privileged individual that wants to be open and accepting of the experiences and hardships of those who don't have my privilege.  I am on the edge of being a voyeur into cultures that I will never fully understand, but want to respect and appreciate.

One's sex is also becoming more and more irrelevant as nowadays procreation is not a top priority, your sex is only important for medical reasons, something only doctors need to know. Society really needs to take the steps to abolishing gender roles completely and just let people be themselves, no more gender seperation for sports groups, public washrooms, etc...."

I want to be ambigious, despite my clothing style consisting of long poffy skirts and blouses and cardigans. But i go on birth control cause it hurts like hell and periods give me dysphoria, i still dislike my tits and is seriously thinking of having them removed someday. I hate being reffered to as a girl exclusively, like if i'm the only girl in a group and someone goes 'boys, and girls' and refer to me. It's a complicated mess that's different for everyone. In Sweden, we literally made up a prounoun for those who don't want to use she/he and to refer to imaginary people without saying 'he or she'. So instead of only having 'han eller hon' you now have 'hen' to use. Words change, and living in a country that incorporates many english words, but with a swedish accent, has made that easy to understand."

He seems to think so, but he sort of debunks his whole argument.    Adoptive Parents, as Contrapoints points out, by definition are not 'real' parents biologically, but are in every single other way absolutely so and thus are legitimized in that sense. At best, his argument could be that pre-op individuals are not yet 'Man enough' to be what they claim. That is still missing the point, but it would at least track with his argument."

Additionally, Genetic sex, gonadal sex and external genitalia are all developed independently of one another meaning a person could be born with external female genitalia, streak gonads and still be XY chromosome.

Now - specifically, after 'autogynephilia' - I feel like I understand transgenderism 51% and respect it 100%. Not only that but I'm actually really glad that trans people exist.  Also, in the video 'The Aesthetic', she says that looking like a convincing woman can be important in order to change people's minds. This, I think, is very true, because I'm pretty sure a big part of why Contrapoints's videos were able to convince me is that I had to admit that Contrapoints HERself looked good. And that she embodied a lot of what I considered femininity to be. I know that sounds SUPER shallow.   Anyway, I know nobody asked.

He's being a dick for the sake of being a dick, poking the bear if you will. I mean his catchphrase isn't empirically or literally wrong but that doesn't mean you should be an asshole to people. If someone ran around a ghetto street screaming 'Look at all these black people they're so poor!' they wouldn't be factually wrong but they sure as hell would be beaten up. It doesn't matter who specifically he hates nor does he care. He'll just keep acting like that. I'm pretty sure he has a dart board with whoever he dislikes on it and he just shoots at it randomly.   On a more bright note, I want to thank Contra for clearing up a lot of the weird jargon in gender identity. I can't say I fully understand as someone who's a straight male but I do understand more.

"as a linguistics major all the talk about language and descriptive and prescriptive grammar was amazing. oh and as an enby the section on nonbinary gender was cool too."
"I'm a cis woman, I've got some significant muscles and hair on me as I do not shave in a desire to not succumb to traditional social expectations of gender specific beauty standards, I cut my hair short and wear clothes that do not expose my XX developed breasts and there you go, people would probably call me 'he' more than they'd call a trans woman that 'passes' by conforming to the standard expectations of how a female should look. Pronouns are nothing more than a tool of society, and in society looks and expectations are way more important than your fucking chromosomes."
"Again, very informative video. To me the most interesting bit is the butting heads of cis-gendered transwomen and non-binary. Whenever I ponder these issues (I'm a cis-gendered man) I wonder a lot about how a transwoman (or transman) 'lives' as their identified gender. As you said, it's not all about passing as a woman physically, it's 'living as a woman'. But what does that mean? Transwomen (not all of course) seem to strongly emphasize traditional, even stereotypical expressions of femininity. Makeup, treated hair, 'feminine' gestures, ways of speaking, dresses, etc.    But these things are products of the society we live in. And even if there's some biological wiring that draws most women to some of these things naturally, it doesn't mean that women have to follow these things to BE women. I sympathize when the non-binary or feminist message that a lot of these behaviors are learned and don't make you any less or more a woman, socially speaking. So on one hand you have cis-gendered women saying they don't want to be called less of a woman just because they don't 'dress like a woman' or use makeup. And on the other hand you have transwomen who send the message that 'dressing/acting like a woman' is how you live a woman's life.    The two seem like they will forever be at odds with other each. I don't know who's 'right'. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer to it. I guess life is pretty complicated."
"All of this stuff about what it means to be a man or a woman and why it matters was very difficult for me to grasp until that comment which, I know was intended to be funny, about you not becoming a woman until your older female relative says 'maybe you should order a salad' Weirdly. It kind of all clicked for me right there. Why this is so important. I think it's about every day experiences and our role in our society. Maybe definitions, biology, reality doesn't even matter as much as just when you're in a restaurant with your female relative and you feel like a woman and you would love to feel normal, like the good the bad and the ugly that comes with being a woman. I honestly can't understand how difficult that must be but I am trying to imagine and even in my brief and limited imagination I could imagine how incredibly validating and right it would feel as a trans woman who feels like a woman to experience the world as a woman... Sorry I've trying to understand. Please correct me if I'm wrong or help me out."

"'Can our heroin put a stop to this?'  Well I mean, how much you got?"
"Yeah I've never felt like being nonbinary is an objective fact about me. It's a framework I find helpful for distancing from cultural expectations, internally and, when possible, externally. People are put in context of a gender, and I don't find that context pleasant or helpful. I spent a long time feeling like my height, temperament, appearance made me a Broken Woman, and I feel much more happy and comfortable being myself first instead of trying to fit into a social construct I feel very little connection to. Most of my friends use they pronouns for me, which I like way better, but honestly, I tell older people not to worry about pronouns. When discussing how I'm treated, I often refer to myself as a woman, because a lot of my experiences relate to how I'm seen, and I've never felt uncomfortable with the social roles of girlfriend, daughter, sister, etc. The language that matters to me is not being included in broad statements about how women are, calls to the sisterhood of feminism, etc, because I've never connected to these concepts. I think a lot of nonbinary people are a reaction to how restrictively we've defined womanhood. There simply isn't space inside it for a person, and even though I think people who fight those restrictions and expand the space are doing something important, I had to live too inauthentically to try and fit. The first people to complain about me not identifying as a woman were the first people to say I wasn't 'really' a girl on the school yard. When your womanhood is put into question when you fail to be motherly, well maintained, polite, feminine and a million other traits not defined by biology, you can't turn around and be shocked when instead of going 'you're right, I am biologically programmed to grow my hair long and like horses' some people are going to say 'well, if that's a woman, I guess I'm something else'"

"Alright, so let's talk about German. German has gender as a grammatical category for nouns.   All dogs are biologically male because the word 'Hund' is grammatically masculine, and the pronoun used to refer to a dog would be the masculine 'er' (he). All cats are biologically female because 'Katze' is grammatically feminine, and the pronoun used to refer to a cat would be the feminine 'sie' (she).   Extending this to inanimate objects, a table is a 'he' (der Tisch) and a door is a 'she' (die T√ºr). Yes, you may have been unaware, but inanimate objects actually have biological gender because Germans use gendered pronouns to refer to them.   The biggest shock about this is that a boy is a 'he' (der Junge), but a girl is an 'it' (das M√§dchen), the german neuter pronoun for which being 'es'. That's right, girls literally have no biological gender until they grow up enough to be called 'Frau.'  But then, there are languages (like Cree) that have no male/female pronoun distinction. I guess that means biological gender is a lie?  Edit: I now know that pronoun gender doesn't always match up with the grammatical gender of their referents (wrt animate beings). I wouldn't have to dig TOO long to find a swath of other gender systems in other languages that contradict his claims."

"You know, that part about 'I feel like I'm at odds with some non-binary people' with regards to asking-vs-assuming really got me in a way I didn't think it would. I actually feel very similarly, though I understand why they want what they want. I suppose it's a matter of me having pronouns that are frequently correctly assumed and being tired of being visible vs the frustration with no one assuming your pronouns correctly and being tired of having to be /uniquely/ visible. Like in a world where everyone is asked their pronouns all the time, cis , trans, and enbies who don't consider themselves trans are all in the same pot. Whereas in the current world it essentially asks anyone who's not 100% passing or gender conforming to open themselves to ire that we might just want to c e a s e because really even the most well-wishing cis ally will slip and only ask people who oooo they're not quite sure about. Even trans people do that. Something that struck me too, while writing this, was the times I felt comfortable providing a pronoun vs the times I didn't. Some of those times morphed from comfortable to uncomfortable with additional information but essentially it ran like this: when everyone was offering their pronouns to the group, it was comfortable. Cis folk gave their pronouns, trans folk gave their pronouns, I said 'he/him' and didn't feel like I was making a big stupid deal of it. The times when I didn't are when the cis folk and the 'passing' trans folk opted out. Or rather, failed to offer. We wrote our pronouns on badges at an LGBT+ conference but I noticed a lot of people hadn't and I felt exceptionally visible and alien. We introduced ourselves at an LGBT+ meeting and after a few people has given their pronouns suddenly the cis folk just stopped giving them and it got to my go and I had to suddenly snap everyone's attention to the fact that 1) they had forgotten to offer their pronouns because they've never had to think about giving them and 2) that I was making the mood uncomfortable by mentioning them and asking people to remember them. It's weird, really, because I sometimes feel like transphobes graze at issues that exist, but do it through hatred so do it wrong. Giving out your pronouns when no one else does, or even feels like they have to, feels /bad/. Not only because it feels like othering yourself but also feels so much like you're demanding something unique BUT in reality the reason why it's unique is that so many have the privilege to completely ignore anything but initial impression and don't have to deal with people constantly assuming their gender incorrectly. Urgh I'm probably making zero sense."

Rationality or a full spectrum of thought is classically split by logos, ethos, and pathos. I.E. 1/3 of the time at least facts SHOULD care about your feelings, because there are human truths, morals and standards we live by to have a society. What's more the implementation and interpretation of that data, or facts, is colored by how we feel about them. Saying you don't care about 'the feels' is trying to walk around 1/3 of existing human thought."

''adoptive parents''. but functionally they are parents and he agrees with that but doesn't accept that the same goes for woman vs trans woman. i swear to god this boy is just insecure about his sexuality because he can't accept himself being attracted to trans women so he needs to completely recontexualize them as men,"

"Serious question: is this pronoun business the transwoman version of 'white feminism'? You know, where transwomen of privilege rail on about their feewings while others struggle to overcome real challenges. Or is this just that a person raised as a white boy is so used to society prioritising them and getting what they want, that they are unable to prioritise grievances when they lose that white boy privilege. Shapiro is clearly a dbag but he is smart to turn the pronoun crap into the 'trans argument' and you lot are stupid for engaging. Every genetic girl or boy has at one point been misgendered, sometimes even intentionally. It's mildly annoying but who cares. I'd rather hear about how we can reduce the number of women (genetic and trans) forced into sex work. Or other real life challenges, not this 'boohoo, they called me a he' nonsense"

A sire doesn't have to be a parent; a sire can abandon the child immediately, and still be the sire of the child. The parents are the ones who raise the child.   A transwoman will never be a female. But she's a woman. Simple as. And while, in most cases, these words can be used interchangeably, they do mean slightly different things."

"Truly Lenora is Anton LaVey's favored child."
"I totally get binary trans. I‚Äôll call you whatever pronouns you want (within reason) because I‚Äôm not a complete dick. But I still don‚Äôt get the real difference between gender non-binary and gender nonconformity. Nonconformity I get. Gender roles are social constructs so there‚Äôs no reason to hold anyone to them. In my view since gender roles can be anything or nothing at all what is even the point of being nonbinary. Maybe I‚Äôm just ignorant but most people I‚Äôve seen who identify as nonbinary are rejecting binary gender roles or traditional gender indicators without really addressing gender itself."
"Lenora LaVey, Tabby, Natalie Wynn‚Ä¶ these are all characters. Facts vs feelings‚Ä¶ your comments tend to be nothing but sycophancy or abuse. I‚Äôm seeing no actual engagement with your ideas.  The religious analogy is apt. Pretend there is a god, pretend you have a soul, pretend you are a woman, what‚Äôs the difference? Pretend you‚Äôre a wolf, LARP as whatever gets you through life. The problem is when you ask others to engage in your larping.  The foundation of gender and biology is reproduction. Take children out of the equation and we‚Äôre all just people. There is no function to trans behaviour, it‚Äôs purely placeboic. Medical tech will probably make trans into reality one day, but we‚Äôre not there yet.  I hesitate to say this, because you seem cool, and fragile, and I do care about your feelings as much as I can care about any stranger‚Ä¶ but you are appearing more unhinged as you progress through your transition. You ask for reality rather than delusion, so that‚Äôs the reality. You‚Äôre unhappy as a man, you‚Äôve found people who will go along with your larping as a woman‚Ä¶ but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much future in it. Now you‚Äôre talking about having surgery to modify your skull‚Ä¶ will you be happy then, with your delusions carved into your face forever? Maybe. I hope so."

"If the dictionary definition of a word is one thing, and the colloquial use of that word is something else, it does not follow that it is incorrect or false if someone uses the dictionary definition. If a person is speaking a different language or dialect and uses a word to refer to something it doesn't refer to in the language that most people around them speak, it doesn't mean that they are incorrect or have said something false, it only means that they mean something else when they say that word. Furthermore, even if this line of thinking was correct, it would cut against your pronoun use since the majority of people use she/her to refer to a women or girl which people use to refer to adult female and juvenile female respectively."

"All this discussion of 'what it means to live as a woman' is making me think that it's possible that the only reason I 'feel like' or 'identify as' a woman is because of discrimination.  Like, I'm cis, I feel...fine with my assigned gender, but I don't really remember even HAVING a concept of myself as a 'girl' until I went to school and got told I couldn't do things because I was one.  And I feel kinship with other women because there's a certain shared experience there--like your salad example, or living with the constant fear of rape.  But if those things were absent--if I'd never had a concept of of rigid gender norms or threats based on my gender--would I even think of myself as a woman?  Would I HAVE a concept of my gender?  I certainly don't think I 'feel' like a woman in any interior, psychological sense any more than you do, so...yeah.  Mostly I just feel like shit.         Sorry, I'm rambling, and don't really have a firm point here.  You're video has just (as it often does) sent my brain spiraling down a hole of questioning my basic assumptions about my entire life."

As a college student in a kinda liberal area most people I tell try their best and thats all that matters to me. I agreed with what she said entirely otherwise. I'm not trying to make a new box for myself to fit in more that I'm trying to shake of the box I was predetermined into. I don't mind as much being assumed as a boy or a girl as I do people continuously holding me to one or the other's standards and expectations. I don't meet them and I don't want to."
"And what about TERF's argument that the whole concept of gender is misogynistic.

"Ben Shapiro doesn‚Äôt even understand biology.  This whole ‚Äúyour chromosomes determine it‚Äù thing is bullshit. To say that you‚Äôre defined by your genotype makes almost no sense. We don‚Äôt literally see your chromosomes (genotype), what we see is how the genes on them are expressed‚Äîyour phenotype. If your body is making more estrogen/progesterone/etc and has anatomical features we associate with someone who is female, you are female. We don‚Äôt call XY cis women ‚Äúmen‚Äù and XX cis men ‚Äúwomen‚Äù because it isn‚Äôt the chromosomes that matter. It‚Äôs how you look and how your body functions. And unfortunately for transphobes, trans people‚Äôs bodies function pretty similar in the most important respects to cis people.  Also chromosomes REALLY don‚Äôt matter because genes are what get expressed, not ‚Äúchromosomes‚Äù (i mean that wouldn‚Äôt even make sense). Again, this is why we can have XX cis men and XY cis women. And for XY cis men‚Äîthat X chromosome‚Äôs genes ARE being read by your body and expressed. Your Y chromosome‚Äôs genes just happen to cover that all up. You have the genetics of a female human in you whether you like it or not."

"As a guy who studied linguistic anthropology as an undergrad I squealed with delight when Prescriptive/Descriptive Grammar came up. I remember on the first day of my intro class, my professor broke down the types and definitions (along with Mental Grammar, which is the Chomskyan phenomenon, regarding how the brain arranges ideas) and said upfront 'now that I've explained what prescriptive grammar is, I'm jettisoning all of it. It's not what we're studying and it's a very facile thing to study, even if you're doing sociolinguistics.' I guess the fact that the video focused more on Prescriptive supports the idea I have about post-modern anthropology. It's a lot like philosophy, especially when you get into culture and social theory, but we have a tendency to stop and describing something, where philosopher's look at the 'should.'"

"My policy hasn't changed on this yet.  1. We are a sexually dimorphic species with 2 sexes and therefore 2 genders. Estrogen causes a human body to develop traits that we recognize as feminine. Testosterone causes a human body to develop traits that are recognized as masculine.  Androgyny and genital deformities don't make someone a third gender any more than my third testicle makes me more of a man.   2. Gender dysphoria is a real medical condition where someone born as one sex is psychologically the other. The condition has been studied for decades. It is supported by a great deal of science. One does not identify as trans any more than they identify as an amputee. It's a diagnosis, not a feeling.  3. The gender spectrum is not supported by science. Most scientist I've spoken to consider it a pseudo science. It has not passed scientific rigor. And I've yet to find anyone actually trying to prove the gender spectrum.  4. There are no laws against calling a trans woman 'He' just like there aren't any laws against calling me a 'Nazi' which anyone who believes in the myth of the political binary will do. That being said, calling a trans woman 'he' isn't much different from yelling 'ALLAHU AKBAR' at someone with PTSD from a terror attack.  5. People have as much right to identify as a third gender as they do to believe that they were a king in a past life. But it doesn't make them trans any more than a reiki practitioner is a doctor. And legislations based on the gender spectrum make about as much sense as registering self proclaimed psychics as espionage risk.  6. Have a nice day."

"It's giving me very weird thoughts about my native language German right now. German has three genders, throughout the whole language (as in, every furniture type has it's own gender) but we German speakers lack the convenience of being able to use a singular 'they' to refer to people.   Using a neuter 'es' to refer to non-binary people feels very derogatory (in practical language, for example, we avoid sentences referring to girls as 'it' even if it would be the correct pronoun for the word 'girl') so maybe I'm uncreative or should talk to trans people about this, but to my knowledge we don't seem to have any proper linguistic construction to refer to non-binary yet. In any way, apart from 'es', which I personally wouldn't use, because I'd feel like insulting anybody I called that  (like Gollum or something) I can't come up with a word that suits... And in the end it's the trans people, not me who decide what makes more sense to them, but as a person interested in language, I feel like this is a very interesting problem to which there must be a viable solution  Cultural differences (nice we to say we're backward) or my personal ignorance?"

"I have no problem understanding what ContraPoints describes what she means with her gender experience. Gender as an essence in identity apart from social interaction is so much harder for me to grasp, I just don't really get it. I like the futch scale, but again, I don't really get it in terms of identity, only in expression. And in terms of the expression, I don't really get why things have to be gendered as a thing in their own right. I only see some sort of social use for them, just like the distinction between adoptive/trans- and biological/cis- parents/people is only really useful in certain particular situations. Otherwise why not let people just live their lives, dress their bodies, express their professional interests, etc. like they want to and call everyone 'they' - I don't have a pronoun for one's class or race or political/religious affiliation. But I'm getting the sense lots of noncispeople find this very wrong, even offensive. I would love to learn more about this. Can someone help me?"

"Even biology disagrees with Ben! Your biological sex is not determined by the chromosomes, but by a gene (its called sry-gene). This gene is often found on the Y-Chromosome, but can exist on a x-Chromosome as well (because of crossing - over). That also means, that there exist Y-Chromosomes without said gene. It is possible to be a 'perfect normal' man or woman, as a conservative would describe it, with non - matching gonosomes. That would be a XX-man or a XY-woman, you would never know About that without looking at your own chromosomes. Thats what I learned this year in developmental biology at my university. I hope by using 'biological sex' I state clear enough that i do respect every sex and gender identity, i'm just not good at using words."
"That dig at anarchocommunist trans cat girls who just so happen to be into witchcraft is insanely accurate.  I've spent the better part of my Twitter presence stumbling across people constantly bitching about dysphoria when they made no active effort to mitigate it.

I had a phase where I somewhat connected to the whole catgirl weirdo movement, but now all it's become is a cesspool for acephobia, islamophobia, continued self-deprecation, callout culture, and the never-ending stream of purity checks.  I can't take someone seriously when they attack someone and the next day they're sobbing from being on the receiving end of which that they instigated in the first place."

"Mandarin pronouns are kinda gendered. The singular third person is just one word 'tƒÅ'. However, this explicitly covers all three genders separately. See, they are written three different ways: ‰ªñ Ôºàmale), Â•π (female), and ÂÆÉ Ôºàneutral). So, it is gendered on paper, but not gendered at all in speech."

"re: your point starting at around 29:52 I think the enbies are right here. When you encourage the assumption of gender by the viewer, you're effectively putting the power to define & determine gender into the hands of the (mostly cis) audience. When people ask for pronouns, they put the power into the hands of the person being asked, and for trans people, genderqueer people, agender people, and all many of other people gendered or otherwise, that's an extremely invaluable asset. If you leave the definition of gender to the cis, the definition of gender will always be what is most convenient to the cis, and thus whatever is least convenient to people who diverge from the paradigm that the cis build. Transphobia is a manifestation of and a retaliation to deviance from the current conceptual frameworks that cis people have constructed surrounding gender, so it is beneficial to both binary and nonbinary trans people to take that power away from cis people."

"As a lesbian, I do have to mention that the futch scale was a joke to begin with. Femme and butch don't originally form a spectrum, they're binary lesbian identities that complete each other by subverting traditional, western, heteronormative femininity and masculinity --not only when it comes to appearance (which most people assume), but mainly when it comes to navigating romantic and sexual relationships between women. For example, 'high femme' or 'stone butch' originally described how you had sex. Obviously, it's not wrong for the use of those labels to have evolved, but I believe their history is worth knowing, especially since lesbian history does overlap immensely with matters of gender identity, gender expression, and pronouns. ‚úå"

In fact, in most stories, the concept of genitals and chromosomes are never even brought up and may as well not even exist. At no point did J.K. Rowling have to establish the details of Harry Potter's penis and testicles before it became necessary to refer to him as 'he/him'."

After discussing it with them the deal we made was that in English I use they pronouns and in German I use either male or female pronouns depending on which one they feel best able to live with. I wish German was more flexible but sometimes with all the good will in the world you have to be pragmatic."

"_aS An iNteRsEx wOmaN_ it kinda hurts hearing people talking about gender and sex like a strictly biological thing. Mainly because I believed it. Had I not stumble upon trans rhetoric prior to the discovery of my *genetic* syndrome, I'm sure - like many women like me - I'd have gone down the rabbit hole of thinking 'Oh no! I was a man all along! Now I must perform like one. But I like boys so am I gay? but I can't be gay, so I'll start dating girls even if I don't want to.', people think and do crazy stuff to maintain their beliefs I guess. I know in the grand scheme of things I'm an anomaly, but I am a woman who has XY chromosomes and that's not changing because of petty black and white worldviews that are, well, plain wrong. No one sees our genes, no one can even know their OWN genes, much less from others. This whole ordeal is stupid and I'm tired of stupid people misusing science to promote their hateful ideas."
"the point about making the distinction between trans and cis people in medical contexts (at 13:49) is an important one, but often I see this point framed as being about trans people being treated as though they are a cis person of their own gender, which worries me as the implication is that being trans is a charade that needs to be put on hold when it comes to important issues. Because of this, I think it's worth noting that treating a trans person as though they are a cis person of the opposite gender can be just as impractical/dangerous. For example, some trans men can get pregnant, but because men tend to have narrower hips than women, it's better in most cases for them to have c-sections. In this instance, the grouping cis women and trans men into the category of being 'biologically female' doesn't make much sense, even though their reproductive organs are functioning in the same way. This comment is way too long but what I'm trying to say is that even in medical contexts, you can't base every decision on chromosomal sex."

There are genetic markers in the human genome for tails. We are, at least partially, related to bananas. Biology is not set in stone. All things come from similar  chemical bases so there is interrelated aspects to all things. To try and hammer it all down in some sort of trope like truth vs lie is well sophomoric and a strawman based on the sheer richness of biology itself.

"I get that this is mostly detailing your personal experience of gender and is maybe playing more to what would be rhetorically convincing than anything else. In the end though, the video does leave me with a really bad sinking feeling of having been thrown under the bus, at best '''''accepted'''''. I feel like the end message still ends up being 'fuck yeah, the gender binary is actually really good and works really well and describes reality in a pretty cool way that works for me and I love when people assume and force others into it and I don't get how anyone could not like this binary but I mean I'll call them what they want if they ask, because in the end it's all about pronouns, right? In the meantime, let me talk about how *real* gender arises almost purely as a function of if waiters 'sir' or 'ma'am' you'.   It comes off as extremely assimilationist and like it's giving a heckton of validation to anyone who thinks 'there are only men and women and I guess some other people claim some weird things and I guess we can humour them to make them happy but eh sounds fake'. Which becomes extra saddening because you made really good points about not wanting people to see you as a woman simply to humour you or to be woke, and I could really relate to that.   But I just don't see any way at all of reconciling actual real proper for realsies IRL gender being something that is dictated by how the prevailing culture views you with the notion that anything other than stereotypical men and women could ever exist. If the only lens we could ever have to think and reason about gender is 'women long hair do makeup, men strong muscle build house', how are we not simply cementing hetero and cisnormative ideas that will leave a ton of people behind in the gutter?"

The precident set, and potential for abuse, are important to bare in mind regardless of how many folks have actually been locked up this past year."

"Hey Contra, dunno if you read the comments, but I was wondering what your thoughts are on finding out Youtubers or streamers you watch use language like trap to describe trans people.  Lots of the content creators I love to watch, I've sometimes found them using the word trap to describe trans people, or sometimes in more extreme cases tranny.  I know that they don't explicitly hate trans people, or I wouldn't be watching them in the first place, but the language makes me uncomfortable. I really don't feel comfortable watching them, knowing they're ignorant and use that language, but also don't want to just stop watching them because I love their content, or I love other facets of their personality. Any advice from you, or any other trans people here in the comments for approaching this?"
"I'm surprised you didn't mention it, but Ben shapiro says that parents can be biological or adoptive. I immediately thought 'well a woman can be trans or cis' because that's exactly the same. Also, note that in english, ships are referred to as 'she' and not 'it'. Anyone tell me when they figured out where are the XX chromosomes of ships."
"Finnish is an interesting language to compare english to.

"This topic to me has always seemed ridiculous as a native Finn. As Contra mentions Finnish is one of the languages that doesn't have gendered pronouns, but it in fact goes even further. In colloquial speech most younger people don't even use the word 'h√§n' (he/she) to refer to their friends, but often use 'se' ('it') instead. And this is an endearing term, it's a bit difficult for for me to know why this is the case, and it's also dialect-specific, but personally if a friend was telling a story about me and they'd refer to me as 'h√§n' I'd feel odd, not because it's incorrect but because it feels too formal. . So I come from a language with non-gendered pronouns and speak a dialect in which the preferred way to refer to me in my native tongue is as an 'it'. I'm a cis-man and pretty much all of my close friends are cis-people and the same applies for everyone.  HOWEVER, if I'm addressing an older person in a customer service situation instead of saying 'you' when talking with them will refer to them as 'te' which is the word for 'they' (though not really actually it's the word for plural 'you' but since the singular and plural forms of you are identical in English the closest translation I couldn't think of off the top of my head that conveys the actual difference in tone is 'they'). This is because it used to be the case pretty much throughout the country to use the use the they pronoun as a sign of respect. That it, it was customary to call someone 'they' until you got to know them. However the custom has for the most part fallen out of use, and nowadays is only mostly used when dealing with older folks. Call a younger person 'te' and they will think you're being pretentious or are incredibly old-fashioned.  So yeah Ben, don't come and tell me language is not a social construct defined by usage you silly, silly boy. :D"

"Thanks for demonstrating that it's ok to challenge our own narratives as trans people! A lot of the language we commonly use as a community regarding psychological gender doesn't describe my own experiences in a satisfying way. I don't have some kind of ethereal, spiritual connection to manhood; I don't have a 'male brain.' I've just found that when I live in the role of a woman and think of myself and my body as female I want to fucking off myself, and now that I'm taking testosterone, having surgeries and being treated as a man I am a perfectly healthy level of miserable (and I'm 99.9% sure that isn't due to internalised misogyny). But when explaining trans issues to my cis friends I feel like I need to stick to this common, inoffensive definition of transness because otherwise I'm scared I'm throwing other members of the community under the bus.  I think as a community we have these oversimplified descriptions of the trans experience that we put forward to help cis people grasp it, but when cis people reject these narratives and challenge them they begin to unravel because they're not the whole truth. You're so good at capturing the complexities of the debate in your videos and I think as trans people we need to be more up front about the fact that we don't all agree and sometimes our ideas and experiences of gender are contradictory, but we can still respect and support each other."

"'Nonbinary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely- they're effectively trying to create the society that includes them', well *as a nonbinary person* I have never been able to put this feeling into words, but you nailed it with this. I feel like half my reasons for openly identifying as nb is with the political and social motivation to, in a way, raise awareness of nb identities, and the possibility of there being gender outside the binary, and this awareness allows for me to live as my identity with more ease the more I raise awareness of my own identity, like a goddamn gender ouroboros. It's similar to how me being vegetarian is half me not personally wanting to eat meat, and half of it is being another individual not contributing to the meat industry to raise popularity of vegetarian alternatives. I want people to use 'they' pronouns half because that's what I'm comfortable with, and half so I'm another voice expressing that they/them pronouns exist and so do nb people."

"Poor -old- young Ben's factual head would explode had he taken some time to study pronoun use in deeply gendered languages, which English is not, for most part.   Take Polish, for example. There's three main genders there: masculine, feminine and neuter, with additional subdivision of the masculine to male-animate and male-inanimate in singular and masculine-personal and masculine-non-personal in plural.   It isn't biological facts that decide a noun's gender and equivalent pronouns to use. In most cases, it's the last letter of the noun in singular nominative case: if it ends with a consonant - it's masculine; if it ends with an 'a' - it's feminine; if it ends with an 'o' or 'ƒô' - it's neuter. So a bear (nied≈∫wied≈∫) is masculine, while a ferret (fretka) is feminine, regardless of their respective reproductive appendages (that are not that apparent to a layman's eye). By the way, an animal (zwierzƒô) is neuter, doesn't matter if it lives in a forest (las - masculine) or a dessert (pustynia - feminine).  You can easily feminize a word if needed, by adding a suffix ending with an 'a' (thus a female bear would be 'nied≈∫wiedzica'); you can also neuter a word with a suffix ending with an 'o' or 'ƒô' (a baby bear would be 'nied≈∫wiedziƒÖtko'). You cannot virilize a noun though, without making it look and sound unusual. Sorry about this to all trans men.  Although there are some very notable exceptions, worthy of note. The Polish word for a man is 'mƒô≈ºczyzna'. So it ends with an 'a' and therefore is.... feminine? Or masculine? Well, it's both, kinda sorta. It follows feminine declension patterns (mƒô≈ºczynA, mƒô≈ºczyznY, mƒô≈ºczy≈∫nIE, mƒô≈ºczyznY), just as the word for a woman (kobietA, kobietY, kobieCIE), but otherwise is treated as masculine, so adjectives describing a man should follow masculine declension patterns and the pronoun is also decidedly masculine (on - he) not feminine (ona - she).   There's also 'mysz' (mouse). The word ends with a consonant, therefore its gender is... FEMININE. It follows feminine declension patterns, regardless of biological sex of a given specimen. Furthermore, its diminutive form is also feminine (myszka - mousie, a little mouse). So you can only imagine my childhood consternation when I found out that Mickey Mouse ('Myszka Miki' in Polish) was actually a male mouse, despite his rather effeminate voice."

"The entire karyotype argument falls apart further when you consider the fact that about 1 in 1000 are born with sex-chromosome abnormalities. There are women born with inactive Y-chromosomes, men with an additional X chromosome and men with two Y chromosomes. The list of possibilities is long and full of caveats. Biology has no place for the rigid use of  prescriptive gender pronouns."
"But I still don't understand. Gender roles aren't formal most of the time. If you want to e.g. wear a dress and makeup, whilst still having a dick, then you are a man. But you are of course free to do 'female things', though I thought you guys rejected gender roles, so in that case it doesn't make sense. If there are no activities that are male or female, then you could do things that are traditionally considered female or male, without it being so in your view. That's why I don't understand why you can't do these things without having to claim that you are a woman when you have a dick, or a man when you have a vagina. And I'm not trying to be an asshole here, I'm trying to understand, so don't interpret my post in the worst possible way."

I also think it was very wise to take the time to address the last video like this rather than in pannicked tweets, it gives you more time to phrase your response clearly and unambiguously.   I'm agender and I have to admit I was feeling angry about your tweets that came after the last video. But I think you've addressed it well here. I'm planning a big video about my gender identity (a more complex one than my usual so it's taking a while) because I get that the whole concept must be pretty hard for Binary people to understand completely; but also because a lot of my subscribers don't know yet and I'm getting a little tired of misgendering in my comments.

"I usually bring up one of the prominent feminist writers from the 50's, Simone de Beauvoir, when people argue with me about my womanhood. Specifically the famous quote from the Second Sex 'One is not born but rather becomes a woman. There is no biological, social, or economic factor that determines the role the human female will play in society. It is civilization as a whole that mediates this relation between the male and the eunuch known as the feminine'. AKA that womanhood isn't something that can be boiled down to one thing, it's (often) how society sees you and how you perform but even not solely that.  Another influence on Judith Butler was Lacan, and something Lacan said was 'woman is a myth and a symptom'. What he meant by this, I think, was that woman is a 'myth' in so far as 'what womanhood is' is subject to society's history and ideology and its changing shape, which has influence on the subject as a 'symptom', their identity and psychology about their gender."

I don‚Äôt like it and it makes me lash out against non binaries in a very harsh and confrontational manner. I find most NB's I've met to be an existential threat."
"It's a fact that you don't check somebody's chromosomes, or even what's in their pants, before you decide what pronouns to use. Not even Ben does that. People call me a she because I LOOK like a woman. And most of these feminine features could be changed more or less easily. Look at Contra Points... Definitely a she, right?  The point is, pronouns refer to GENDER not sex. Linguists have aggreed on this a long time ago. Chromosomes my a@@"

For me personally, I don't always need people to automatically call me 'they', but I'm bothered by being called a woman and I don't really know what to do about that. It's a long, complicated thing, and I think the way you talked about that aspect of gender identity here was great and I'm so glad you did. Like it honestly makes me feel more confident hearing you talk about nonbinary issues as a normal thing. Being normalized is huge for nonbinary people, especially those who aren't ready to full on fight against the gender binary as a thing so thank you for that.

"Thank you for the video.   I have a tough time telling genders in young people these days. I simply use Non-gender pronouns, naturally and change when requested. I also use one, one's, often as that is a singular non-gender.    I do believe the use of the third person pronoun is the user's word to describe what one sees. but the use of direct pronouns like Sir or Mam, must be accepted by the target as those are meant as a respectful/formal way to address an individual."
"I understand third-person singular 'they' has a long and legitimate history in English, but in everyday conversation, it is extremely ambiguous.   Ex: 'I want to ask out Jennifer, but I'm afraid of what they'll say.' Afraid of what WHO will say? It's not clear, and I think that's one reason to not use 'they' in this context."

"It is not the karyotype. It is the biological properties of a woman and a man that Shapiro is referencing. The 'he' and 'she' debate is ridiculous because I know my friend who would refuse to call anyone who is born man a woman and vice versa but the chance of him meeting one is about 1%. Shapiro only says she and he as a way to address how absurd it sounds to him that a man can identify as a woman, and vice versa.    Linguistic tradition would still dictate that 'she' refers to a woman and 'he' refers to a man, not the karyotype they have, that's the way you are framing it. A woman is a human with a vagina, a man is a human with a penis but to be more concise the common biological property of a man and woman. That's what a person back in 500 BCE would tell you as well.    The pronoun game is absurd to just because of this. The sole reason people want to refer to the sex they identify as is because they want others to acknowledge their identity for it to be true in their minds, but some people think they are delusional and refuse to do it. It's that simple. But we all know that in real life, if we know someone personally who is a transgender, or are friends with them, we will be calling them by their pronouns and we will care about their feelings.    All these dissections about the context of other words isn't to the point of what Shapiro thinks, which is, a man is a man and a woman is a woman, based purely on what body it is that they are born in.    TL;DR He and she are not biological imperatives to you but to him it is.   On that note I also would like to tell people that it is not up to others to acknowledge who you are, it is up to you to acknowledge yourself as who you are, most people who will get to know you personally wouldn't care either way. People who measure their worth and identity by how others see them seems to have low self-esteem and gets depression easier."
"As a Montana Lib, I‚Äôm still right of center, and have been having difficulty with the whole pronoun argument.  Thank you for your perspective.

Thank you, and keep opening minds and eyes with your fabulous pieces."
"One time I was hanging out a guy and his girlfriend and you know how people talk about you as if you are not there.. Well they started talking and saying she and her , I was/am not trans or look like a girl. I found that kinda insulting and weird. So I'm guessing its a similar feeling for a transwoman to be called he or him. Ever since then I started just respecting someones pronoun."

"My philosophical view on language is that prescriptive language is merely a subcategory of descriptive language, namely, at least implicitly, an expression of preference. 99% of all words are, in effect, describe a preference for convenience. For example, 'bachelor' is commonly defined as 'an unmarried man'. This is not a correct definition in some universal sense. It is simply the convergence of agreement by the ultra vast majority of people who use the word to use the word in that way for convenience. The vast majority of people stick to that definition because of convenience, and there is no greater convenience from deviating from that definition. If some married guy came to me and said 'I am actually a bachelor, because 'bachelor' actually means 'married man'.' I probably would not respect his definition immediately. I would ask why and if he gave me no good answer I would not respect his definition, because he is just being an annoying asshole. In doing so, I would be respecting my desire for the convenience of stable definitions more than I respect the novel desire of this person to change a word to mean the complete opposite of what it usually means, just to be an annoying little jizz twizzler.  Similarly, when that woman working for InfoWars tried to stump that girl by saying that she was actually a man, I would not respect her asserted gender because she obviously isn't sincerely expressing that gender in order to gain utility in the fulfillment of her identity, but to make a cheap political point. If some female who was outwardly performing womanhood, like with a dress and makeup and acting feminine and everything, but said that she actually identified as I man, I would sincerely ask her 'Why do you identify as a man, and yet you seem to do nothing indicative of someone attempting to perform manhood?' and he gave me an answer that, at the very least, indicated that he was actually being serious, I would start to identify that person as a man, or, at the very least, halfway fail until eventually fully succeeding. So when people say things like: 'Do you think you can just change the definition of words so that now words don't mean anything anymore?' I would say: 'All definitions of words tend to change overtime anyway, so much so that nearly every part of the English language that we use today is completely novel compared to how it existed centuries ago. So, while I would not like to change the definition of 99.99999% of words, it seems like this is a perfectly valid and very useful reason to change the definition of 0.00001% of words that we use today to fulfill a more functional role in society.'"

"I think Contra makes some excellent points here, but the analogy with adoptive parents is not an apt one.    'Parent' is commonly construed in two senses: 1) as a biological relationship (biological parent); 2) as a social relationship (person who fills the role of parent). If you look at usage (the 'descriptive approach', as Contra calls it, or a lexical definition), both usages are accepted and understood by virtually all competent speakers of the language.    Gendered terms (him/her, he/she, Mr/Ms, boy/girl, man/woman, etc.) are most commonly construed as 1) referring to biological sex (male/female), and less widely understood as 2) referring to social roles and characteristics associated with each sex.* If you look at usage, you will notice however that terms such as 'he/she' are employed not precisely along the lines of biological sex (as demonstrated by intersex individuals and, for want of a better term, 'convincing' trans folk), nor along the lines of social roles and characteristics (as demonstrated by gender non-conforming people and 'unconvincing' trans folk being called by the pronouns that appear to attach to their biological sex).    In fact, it seems that people decide to call someone 'he' or 'she' on the basis of BELIEF of biological sex - if someone looks to Alice like a biological male, then Alice will call that person 'he'; if someone looks to Bob like a biological female, then Bob will refer to that person as 'she'; if Cindy isn't sure whether the person she sees looks like a biological male or female, then Cindy will be confused and might ask a friend 'is that a man or a woman?' (by which she implicitly means 'is that a biological male or a biological female', but her interlocutor would of course only be privy to appearances, and their answer will be based on what the person's sex APPEARS to be rather than on what karyotype they are). That's why Blaire could be called 'she' appropriately by someone to whom she appears to be female and thus believes her to be female, and 'he' by someone who recognizes that she appears female but nevertheless believes that she is male.    There are complications. When Shapiro knows that Blaire is male but realizes that the waiter will think she is female, then it would be appropriate (or at least expedient) to refer to Blaire as 'she' rather than he, regardless of Shapiro's personal beliefs about whether Blaire is in fact male or female. And on the other hand, people who see 'unconvincing' trans folk and recognize that they are trans may call them by their preferred pronoun because: a) they believe it is the decent thing to do, or b) their ideology leads them to think that gender is a social role and self-identified, thus they believe that the trans person properly falls under their preferred gender category (this type of person is using definition 2 - but this can lead to confusion, since most people use definition 1). In discussions where people are talking about gender, but one person is using definition 1 while the other is using definition 2, there is a very real danger of confusion and talking past one another.    This is of course only talking about binary pronouns. Non-binary pronouns are ... different.    *If you don't agree with me on this, look up 'gender' in any major dictionary - Oxford, Cambridge, Merriam Webster, etc. The first definition is usually the grammatical one, then right after that is something like gender = sex, and then the third one is gender = social and cultural roles and characteristics associated with sex. The order of the definitions reflects frequency in common usage."

"From my experience as a trans woman, you can look past all the arguments that people like Shapiro make and find that really the reason they don't want to accept us as women is because we look weird. I pass very well, and many people from varied backgrounds constantly reassure me that I am a real woman. Some of my friends don't pass well, and people don't only insist they're not female, but spew death threats to them on the street. The only difference is our appearance.   Which is why I really need to say it: it's harder to take you seriously in silly outfits, and it's hurting your ability to convince people who disagree with you. Unless of course the purpose of your channel is to preach to the choir.  Also: you are one brave woman wearing that headdress around lit candles."

"(A preface) I am a fan of Peterson and a mild fan of Shapiro. I am on the political left but I‚Äôm staunchly against the new fangled authoritarian left which is often found involved in trans activism and the issue of pronouns.   I think i understand Shapiro‚Äôs stance and calculation when it comes to pronouns/transgenderism. He is a deeply conservative little man, in his mind the granular and immediate social cost of ‚Äúmisgendering‚Äù someone is less than the longview social cost he images will come about when society blurs the lines of historic gender roles starting with speech. Shapiro is in effect refusing to buy in to the slow degradation of gender and gender roles that is chipped away one syllable at a time when he utters preferred pronouns.   I personally have never misgendered someone on purpose. I‚Äôm fine with using whatever pronouns someone sees fit within reason. While I don‚Äôt think I accept that Contra is indeed a woman, I think what it all boils down to me is that I really don‚Äôt give a shit either way. I realize the issue of pronouns is very front and center for the trans community, but I think it‚Äôs worth keeping in the perspective of exactly how hyper-niche this issue truly is. Most humans on Earth through all of time have never given much thought to trans this or that, it‚Äôs truly irrelevant. In my understanding of how irrelevant it really is, I‚Äôm generally fine to cede that linguistic ground to trans folk and do my part to barely blur the gender norm line that Shapiro‚Äôs sensitive to keep as sharply defined as possible. I would rather blur than be a dick to someone for something so trivial to me. I just don‚Äôt care enough either way, much like most people, the social cost is very immediate and in your face when you misgender someone while the concept of our collective understanding and definitions of gender and pronouns and blah blah blah is entirely vague, amorphous, and undefined.   Shapiro‚Äôs shtick is repackaging his Bronze Age Jewish orthodoxy for the modern age through the filter of politics. Finding what he sees as sound and clever rationale to suit his otherwise baseless moral and political beliefs. This is likely the entire reason why he feels the way he feels about gender and pronouns and the grandiose emphasis he puts on the assumed cost all of our mortal souls pay whenever he utters in capitulation with the trans activists pronoun whims."

"As A NoNBinArY peRsON, the section on nonbinary genders is appreciated. Honestly I think a lot of us (nb folk that is) use the phrasing that we 'feel' like a gender because it's deeply difficult to otherwise articulate our acknowledgment of our gender identity. We don't have much social context for the extra gender (I say as a boring white af American, not speaking for all nb people) identities and thus lack the language for it.    I wouldn't say I 'feel' agender, but I know I am not, and do not feel, like a man or a woman. I know what I am but when it comes to facing the question 'well how DO you know that' it's hard to sum up that knowledge in a way I can present in words.    I just do know and it's not hard to use they/them so idk why other people care so much. There's so much else to stress over in this world than having to use they/them for the one (1) whole nb person they're likely to ever actually have to interact with."

"@ContraPoints - I'm wondering why you didn't mention that biology isn't clear cut in terms of sex. There are at minimum five sexes recognized by modern science (male, male-dominant intersex, full intersex, female-dominant intersex, female) and there are many conditions (such as androgen insensitivity) that can make a person's body develop as if it is biologically another sex. Two gendered pronouns seem wildly insufficient to capture this biological diversity (descriptively or prescriptively), so it seemed odd when you said that we all agree about biology. [This isn't meant as a criticism, but as a genuine question--you are killing it, girl!]"

"'There are no geneticists studying pronouns.'  BOOM.  Victory to Contrapoints. Case closed. Too bad Shapiro doesn't really adhere to logic. It's his feelings that are driving his catch phrase about facts and feelings, ironically. Personally, I will never forget the movie Gia. I graduated to a mature understanding of what we call femininity when the angry person in the support group who had tortured herself for not being beautiful enough, feminine enough, yells at the former model 'All this time I'm killing myself trying to look like you, and YOU don't look like you.' All this later was reinforced with Tyra Banks show ANTM when they took very average humans and used every special effect that Star Wars does to turn the contestants into the supreme version of 'feminine', a high fashion model rather than an Ewok or Wookie. It's the same number of steps just in a different direction but using all the same products and techniques. The whole show demonstrates it's all a perception often disconnected from reality. Presentation of feminine is perception. Presentation of masculine is perception. But that's only half the truth. Contrapoints time and time again points out the other half; the visible never negates the inner identity. Other's perception also doesn't negate internal identity. Neither does the power tripping rudeness of Shapiro invalidate an inner experience. What's visible, the presentation, the aesthetic, is only half of experience. What someone observes isn't always what the observed feels. 'Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.' I like to always say, never tell someone they are beautiful until you see them with your eyes closed. If you only use your eyes, you'll never experience the other half of everyone else. The more important half. After watching this video, I realize the same could be said about pronouns. High Five Contrapoints, you logical candy-girl, you BEAUTIFUL mess. Maybe Shapiro can eat some make-up, so then he can feel beautiful on the inside for once."

The pronoun ‚Äúit‚Äù is always available. And finally, your Cher impression needs work."
"I agree with much of what ContraPoints said, but Ben isn't entirely wrong either. Our sense of what is male and female is honed by millions of years of evolution, not just societal fads. The idea that pronouns are 'just words' is a little facile. If the definitions have changed so completely as she (see how polite I am?) suggests, why do so many of even the most politically correct people struggle not to accidentally 'misgender' their trans friends sometimes? It's because there's an added layer of mental processing involved. 'She' now refers to women... and trans women too. It's not as instinctive, and the differences between the two groups actually matter. No matter who you are, you want to find out the biology and sexual preferences of somebody you could potentially date as quickly as possible."

She says that she's not trying to invalidate anyone's gender, and I believe her... but regardless of her intention, to someone who has not or cannot experience these things that will supposedly elevate their gender from the 'hypothetical' to the 'actual', aren't these statements kind of unavoidably invalidating? Anyway, that's just what my human brain was thinking while watching, lizard brain saw the fruit colored wig and immediately started taking out the cutlery. It's the tide pod of wigs."

"When you ask a cis woman 'how do you know you are a woman?' the result is normally confusion. 'That's like asking, 'how do I know I'm human?'' they might say. To them it is an abstract, philosophical question. But as a trans woman, I ask myself that question every single day. 'Am I a woman just because I think I am? Am I supposed to feel different now? Will angels come down and sing once I achieve 'womanness'?' Every day. There is no objective answer. The only person who doesn't seem me as a woman (unless I run around screaming that I'm a tranny) is myself. I can see what they can't, my inner turmoil, my doubt. Even Ben Shapiro acknowledged that he cannot clock a trans woman every time and might accidentally call one a she until he figured it out and can start calling her 'sir' as God intended.

"Being non-binary, for me, in my life, is being non-conforming. I was thinking that I don't have body dysphoria, but remembering back, I had a terrible time when my boobs developed. I hated it. I guess that is more complex than I thought. Mostly I just absolutely do not identify with or fit within any established traditional gender roles that I know of. I am less distressed by the boobs now but being called 'woman' or other feminine labels like that has always given me feelings of dysphoria. I'm just not a woman. I don't fit. Being a woman isn't what I am or what I do. I'm between men and women. I prefer 'she' because it's what I'm used to, and because in my case other pronouns have only been used hurtfully. But I would love it if there were a widespread neutral term--not just 'they'--specifically and politely used to refer to people who haven't stated their preferences or who don't identify with he or she. I don't like 'they' because it feels anonymous to me. 'They' is imaginary, hypothetical or unnamed in most speech, and it retains that aura for me when it's used for NB people. If I were more comfortable with 'they' I would probably still not ask for it because it's not yet used in my workplace or local community, and I can't handle the fallout of inconveniencing people or attracting attention to myself."

And apparently, you think you're not a woman until you are a living breathing stereotype of what a women is. Why can't you have sexy abs and short hair while also being a women, huh?

"Another great video! This channel really is a journey of self discovery from me. I perform as a fairly typical man, but like you, I also never really understood the question 'what gender do you feel like?' I don't feel like any gender. Frankly, I wouldn't be horrified to wake up as a woman tomorrow. In fact, I'm sure there's a word for this psychological trait, but I get bored pretty quickly with the status quo, and want to change things up; routines, style, etc. If I could, I probably would make myself a woman. I just don't want to appear weird, so I have to continue to perform as a man. Which is fine. It's certainly not difficult. However (and this might horrify you, given past sentiments you've expressed), your transition has given me a little hope that I could be convincing. Not with present day technology and techniques, but maybe after another decade of perfecting it.  Since I'm in a revealing mood, I might as well also say that, while I would never have sex with a man as a man, if I were a woman, I'd probably be more inclined to have sex with men than women. At first I thought I might just be some kind of heterosexual absolutist, but now, I think my sexuality is highly influenced by what is socially seen as sexy. Then again, I am into little people (as they prefer to be called), and that bucks conventional sexiness... Man, I don't really understand me all that well.   One thing I do understand is that I would absolutely, without question, bury my * * * * in your * * * * * at the drop of a hat if you asked me to. I mean, as long as I still had it, of course. Anyway, I'm gonna end this comment while I'm still teetering on the edge of the range of acceptable discourse. #queen <3"

"Agender here. I've gotten actual courts to use non-gendered pronouns for me, after explaining that I found being gendered male to be offensive. Proof:   Published opinion: _Sai v. TSA_, No. 1:14-cv-403, ECF No. 172 (D. D.C. Sept. 25, 2018), at p. 4 fn. 1 https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ihsT2FZJngonjtffeGHvB1qfOe8Ynu8h  Request: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KfJ-99nrOgai8_pKaFmyqb4qh2Ku3sXM https://drive.google.com/open?id=15w2TCEhx8mNYCv_q4jb8iomcvFpzyxjb  For some reason, the government and court had simply presumed me to be male, though they had never seen me in person, and nothing in my filings ever used a gendered pronoun for me. (And my name, Sai, isn't particularly gendered either way [unless you're Indian].)  But Judge Moss is actually a kind person, was genuinely concerned when I explained that gendering me was offensive, and though there was absolutely zero obligation to do so, amended the opinion to make it non-binary. So now I have actual published, precedential court recognition of _courtesy_ towards my request for non-gendered pronoun usage. /kazoo     I wonder how many TERFs & Shapiroids have had a DNA test. It's not a common thing to do. Given the insistence on genotype based gender, wouldn't it be 'incorrect', or at least presumptive, for Shapiro to use _any_ gender label for someone whose DNA results he hasn't seen? (Plus, androgen insensitivity syndrome, etc etc usual contradictions.)"

My views still don't really allign with yours: I believe that we should fight for the world we want to live in, not for the world we're willing to bear. I don't think we should fight to be tolerated in a cisnormative status quo, just as I think don't think feminists should fight to make women competetive in a system that favours masculinity. I think that we should fight to break down oppressive systems rather than to succeed within them. That said, it's easier to see now that your views aren't actually horribly cissexist so that's pretty neat."

"I know I have a VERY different experience as a cis woman, but I relate in a particular way to the way you describe expressing you feminity. I am not as physically feminine as some. Giant feet, giant hands, small breasts broad shoulders, and I basically live as a third rate drag queen. I express my gender in a large and overly feminine way as a sort of coping mechanism, because in jeans and a t-shirt I don't come across as feminine as other women would in the same dress. So, in a way I'm much more aware of the way I perform gender every day, cause I'm actively performing it, instead of passively falling into."

"I had never thought to apply functionalism to this debate, but it makes PERFECT sense. And isn't 'I identify as a woman inside' somewhat of a phenomenological argument about the whole thing? I think that's why it's not convincing. How can you know 'what it feels like' to be a woman? If it simply boils down to a desire to emulate what you see, then the 'facts don't care about your feelings' argument can come into play. I guess that's what you meant by 'poking holes'. But, you're always talking about poking holes, so I could be wrong."
"I really like the way Natalie used the example of adoptive parents in this. I'm adopted, and whenever someone finds that out and asks 'Have you met/do you know your 'real parents''? I always say something along the lines of 'Yes, my real parents are the people who raised me from the time I was 5 weeks old. I met my birth-mother when I was 19.' But while those questions weren't meant to cause harm, questioning whether a trans woman or trans man is a 'real woman' or 'real man' isn't meant in the same way and does cause harm. The people asking about my parents weren't bigoted, hateful people with malicious intent or a hidden agenda, which isn't the case with people speaking about trans folk.  *Updated 11/12 to add the following:* OK, I'm updating this to make myself absolutely clear: I was adopted, and the people who 'parented' me for the last 37 years are my 'real parents'. The woman who gave birth to me is just that, my birth-mother. The only reason I wanted to know anything about my birth-parents was for purely medical reasons. The chromosomes didn't matter to me aside from needing to know if I had any potential hereditary diseases that I needed to be aware of (which is true in my case; I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which has severely impacted my life, along with a plethora of other inherited chronic conditions). My REAL parents took me in and 'did everything that parents are supposed to do' (and more) from the time I was 5 weeks old. All my birth-mother ever did for me was decide against having an abortion, and that was only because her father was a Southern Baptist minister. She may have given me life, but my REAL parents deserve all the credit for my survival after that. While I'm generally pleased that I wasn't aborted, that doesn't make my birth-mother my real Mom, and to be brutally honest, I really don't like her even a little bit. And after meeting my birth-mother, I was even more grateful that I was adopted by my REAL parents. Having to grow up with my birth-mother would have been an endless nightmare that would have resulted in my death at a very early age (like 11 years old). So, all I have to thank my birth-mother for is for not killing me before I was even born, and for a slew of chronic illnesses which I inherited from her. The fact she used amphetamines and other drugs while pregnant with me certainly didn't do me any favors. If my REAL parents and my birth-mother were lined up in front of a firing squad and I had to choose who lived and who died, the choice would be effortless; my REAL parents would be the survivors. I owe them my entire existence and there's no way I could ever even begin to repay them for all they have done for me. All this boils down to as far as trans-folk are concerned is that if they 'do the things' and 'feel the things' then they ARE 'the things', meaning they are absolutely real men and women as far as I'm concerned. Just like my parents 'did the things' and 'felt the things' that makes them my REAL parents. Trans women are real women, and trans men are real men. My parents never claimed that my Mom gave birth to me, and no trans person I've ever heard of or met personally will refute that they were AFAB or AMAB. It doesn't make them any less 'real' parents, or trans-folk any less 'real' men or women. End of. Full stop. That's it."

"i enjoyed this vid. something i feel keeps being missed in this conversation tho is that there's more than one way to get to the point where 'most ppl see me/call me as a [my gender]'. part of it is about how i individually conduct/present myself, but it also has to do with the nature of the community i'm embedded in, and the (changeable) views of the ppl i encounter and interact with. Contra says that someone's gender is hypothetical until they begin 'living as' that gender. but that might involve moving into different community spaces where my gender 'hypothesis' is more likely to be understood--or educating the ppl in my life about how to perceive and speak about gender differently. for many NB ppl, our journeys MUST rely on these strategies beyond changing ourselves, because the lack of an established 3rd gender concept in ie the US means there's no way we can 'seem like [our gender]' just by changing our own personal 'vibe', until the ppl perceiving us are made capable of recognizing that there's anything beyond 'man or woman'. it seems to me like 'society' or 'other ppl' keep getting cast as this more or less static environment that you just have to personally adapt to. but the world and 'other ppl' are not homogeneous, and not unchangeable. so yes, i agree that nonbinary ppl are kind of involving ourselves more in 'building the world they want to live in'. but core to that strategy is the recognition that *how* we choose to navigate and adapt to the existing world can be influential in the way that world's creation unfolds. i see that i *need* to wield my potential influence over world-unfoldment, because 'most ppl' currently flat-out lack a conceptual framework that would allow them to perceive me genuinely. adapting myself is not enough.  amazing job on the rainbow hairpiece!!! and perfect level of horror camp on LaVey. üòà"

(Age 17 I had long hair and would pluck out all of my facial hair, Age 18 I started starving myself to stop my male body development age 19 I injected pure ethanol into my testis to try and kill them) Psychologically having male hormones in my head and developing male attributes resulted in my mind breaking apart.  Non-binary is weird to me and I see what Contra is talking about, I will of course refer to someone however they want, but like with sexuality I can only understand these things through allegory.  Sex drive is like hunger... If hungry enough people will eat anything, (vaguely explaining how some of my friends have had one night stands with individuals that on better days would discribe as repulsive)  I do wonder because I hard and fast only classify or understand my transsexuality through the gender dysphoria. I intitally DIY'd it and only took hormone blockers and estrogens then went on to retrain my voice using spectrographics (I will gladly try to help you if your voice makes you dysphoric Contra.) The problem with this is after 6 months I didn't look or sound like a male or a female. And I Transitioned to simplify my quality of life and as my body changed further it became essentially to control my personal narrative (Bigots were even more unabashed 10 years ago)  Later on I suffered the sexist psychologists in my country (Literally using blanchard diagnostics and I 'performed my gender' putting on dresses and makeup (although I never do so normally)) to get approved for SRS only because I was concerned that US government crackdowns might significantly damage me.  Thus I try to understand non-binary as a demi-transsexual Perhaps this Female-at-birth identifying as non-binary female experiences dysphoria with only their voice but is okay with there breasts. (I myself felt intense dysphoria at my testis but only mild dysphoria at my penis)   But I do struggle to understand unusual pronouns that go with suggesting gender identities without point of cultural reference and increasingly I wonder if I'm getting the wrong end of the stick... It personally bothers me alot when Cis-persons conflate gender stereotypes as my reason for transition with my gender dysphoria. And when I mention this to non-binary individuals I've met I get mixed messages.  But yeah thanks contra for a good video... I think you express some anxiety about 'clockablity' I'm not trying to demean your feelings, but this is a 'youth' thing... I mean that as a Transwoman you've not been transitioned for very long and I myself expressed many similar anxieties about my own validity when I was 'young' Such is youth yay vanity. But now I've lived my life as a woman most of my friends have never known me to be anything other than 'Nixie the Biomedical Researcher Scientist lady' and obfuscating facts about my 'previous version' is a point of amusement for me nobody even knows my old name. I had an ex-once try to use my 'old name' to insult me only to get it wrong, then they end up sounding like a complete moron.  'Your an embarrassment... ALEX' 'Who's Alex? They sound cool can I meet them? prolly a better boyfriend than you...'  Time will come when you've lived a significant amount of time as a woman and doubts to your womanhood will sound absurd to everyone even yourself. Your a good girl so I know you won't but yeah just remember don't take any insecurities about yourself out on anyone else."

"Interesting video. I'm from Finland, and as you correctly pointed out, there are no gendered pronouns in the Finnish language. We only have one gender neutral pronoun that is used for men, women and children. We also have a different pronoun for animals and things, which is equivalent to 'it' in English, yet it's totally normal in the Finnish language to use 'it' to refer to other people if you feel like it as well, it's common language and not meant as any offense. The idea that pronouns are in any way linked to biology just sounds absurd to me, and it would mean that us Finns are just a bunch of genderless aliens. Which actually, suits me just fine."

"I'm well impressed if you can manage to read the comments enough to get to this one - honestly, I would give up :D  ...But yeh my little point to add (_not as a criticism_) is maybe people's 'psychologies' could in the not too distant future effect which pain medications would be most effective (and in the land of the free where you live, this could effect things like insurance) as already there appears to be a gender difference in which pain medications provide the best results (and it doesn't seem correct to just go by body weight when comparing males to females with dosages) - I mean Ibuprofren does f*ck all for me. And soon medical science could be using more direct methods of pain medication that target the immune system - of which there appears a difference in pain pathways between men and women...     Could there be a difference for trans people too? It's interesting that the vegas nerve appears to play more of a role in modulating pain in males than females - and could be an explanation as to why males and females have such different symptoms when it comes to heart attacks. And speaking of heart attacks, the drug viagra was initial prescribed for partients with heart problems - and yet viagra appears to be less successful in the arousal department for women than men. Does viagra even work on pre-medicated trans women? - likewise does it work on trans men? I don't know? I almost forgot about Ben Shapiro after typing all this - he's just some bizarre character from wonderland who probably has string beads for genitals."

"As a linguist in training, I would like to add a couple of points to the discussion on pronouns.    1) What I find oddly fascinating about the debate on the use of singular 'they' in English is the fact that everybody seems to be forgetting the fact that English already has genderless pronouns. The singular pronouns 'he' and 'she' are actually the only ones that have a gender feature! The argument that there would be a breakdown in communication if we started using singular they is comical. If the argument goes that the breakdown would be due to the lack of a gender feature, the obvious rebuttal is that we don't seem to mind this absence in 'I', 'you' or 'we'. On the other hand, if someone wants to argue that what would really spell disaster would be the introduction of ambiguity between a singular and a plural meaning of 'they', then once again make them have a look at English where 'you' is ambiguous between a singular and a plural reading. Yet, English speakers have been successfully communicating in this way eversince 'thou' fell out of use. Also, over time, new pronouns can arise that resolve this ambiguity as has already happened in some dialects of English in the case of 'y'all' or 'you guys'. Likewise,  Spanish went through a similar process that resulted in the pronouns 'nosotros' and 'vosotros' (originally meaning 'we/you others').  2) However, I would also like to give you a cautionary note about changing the use of pronouns. ContraPoints made an analogy with how the definition of 'marriage' changed over time to include same sex couples. Whilst I acknowledge that the overarching point stands, I would also like to bring attention to some dissimilarities between the two cases that if not recognised might cause some trouble in the fight for the adoption of the new meaning of pronoun/s. Linguistically speaking, pronouns (such as 'she', 'I' or 'it') belong to a different category than nouns ('marriage', 'horse', etc.). Whilst the latter is a so-called 'open category', pronouns are 'closed' word class. Open category words are numerous and new ones (whether nouns, verbs or adjectives) are coined all the time. Also, a change in their meaning can occur fairly quickly in a society. On the other hand, there is only a limited number of pronouns and any linguistic change in all closed category words is very rigid. There is also some research suggesting that pronouns are stored and processed in the mind in a different way from nouns. The point I'm driving at is that given these properties of pronouns as a linguistic phenomenon, change might be very difficult to implement. Over successive generations, surely possible, however I am rather skeptical about it in a shorter time frame."
"At 28:15 there is so much truth in that statement.  I myself ONLY identify as a male as that is how I was raised, it is how I am addressed in my 'normal' working life, and I feel uncomfortable being addressed in feminine pronouns even when looking like Siousxie Sioux, or Morticia addams.  I know I don't do things to my overall shape to appear more feminine (no pads or forms), and quite frankly no more know what it is to live as a woman, outside of the 'trappings' (fashion styles....which should not have gender limits applied,  mannerisms, ect.  People think me more 'feminine' due to how I use my hands in conversation....which utterly confuses me, I mean how is that gendered, but yea.) of 'femininity', but that is about it.  I know only that which I have been taught, and frankly I feel like one thing....me.   With a bit of dragon.  :P"

"Nicely done, the Bach music :-) Here's the original :-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W4PJUOeVYw"
"At the end of the day, Ben Shapiro is an opportunist, looking to capitalize on the societal 'norms' and conservative ideology of a base that's easier to wrangle into the same pig pen, where as, more liberal-leaning ideology can't similarly corral people into a lock step mentality. Also, he truly believes his own hype and rhetoric. The 'Pick Me' mindset I see among youtubers like Blair White and Tree of Logic noticeably wanes depending on how willing they are to go along with the inanity of the very base that elevates them but that same base is equally unabashed in holding them as lesser, defective individuals (Blair because she's transgender & ToL because she's black), so it's always entertaining/depressing to see how they then have to perform this sort of concession of personhood when confronted by peers who more perfectly embody the conservative ideal (straight, white and male)."

"I'm glad this video came out as I've recently had a talk with friends and it gave me a couple questions that i didn't ask because i was worried it would upset them. So if a person says they're trans but they don't suffer from gender dysphoria nor do they intend to transition nor do they attempt to show signals of the gender they identify as. Are they really trans? I still refer to them as the pronoun stay asked me to because we're friends and they asked and I have no reason not to, but are they still considered trans if they pretty much lack the things that most people say are what make you trans? I feel that having this way that they conduct and live their life is actually lessening the issues that trans people have. They told me not all trans people have gender dysphoria, is that true?"

And clearly people like Shapiro or Peterson have no interest in being civil and empathic. and 3. You're god damn hilarious. (10:34)"

Would you like to thank them?' So when I found out that people were confused by singular they/them I was equally confused in turn. I'm Dutch so I figured this way of using it as a neutral pronoun was just grammar I hadn't encountered yet, lol. And thank you for your insightful video- usually when I encounter discussions about gender identity everyone's (understandably!) focused on teaching the other party the basic empathy to respect their feelings, so it's nice to get some more in-depth discussion  of the topic :)"

"Has Ben Shapiro ever heard of any other language, say Germanic languages or Greek? These languages give genders (he/she), including gendered articles (the), _and_ gendered inflection, to literally everything, uniformly. What about languages that have no genders, or languages that have more than 2, to 10s of genders?  Is it that hard for English-only speaking people to get so mixed up about linguistic gender? How can someone like Ben, that can't tell the difference between linguistic gender and chromosomes, be expected to understand social gender? He's not even trying, is he? Oh, what am I saying, of course he doesn't."

Instead of getting better at spotting lies, it's like the more we are lied to the more we believe lies, even when they directly contradict each other."
"Excellent video, ma'am! You are consistently as entertaining as you are educational  I dunno how often this gets pointed out (I've not seen it at all yet in the context of the gender discussion), but it's something that always occurs to me: you know how in the olden days people used to call each other 'thou' and 'thee'? Those were second-person singular pronouns. Shakespeare heads in the audience will know that back then we did still say 'you', but only when speaking to more than one person. Over time it became the done thing to refer to individuals as 'you'. Contrary to those few brave pedants who insist that the English language will snap its axles if we refer to one person as a 'them', we've somehow gotten along just fine without 'thou'"
"Why does youtube always put 'Prager U' commercials before your videos lol??? Are they just being assholes smh?"
"I wonder what Ben Shapiro's opinion is on XXY biological men. And also on XXY biological women. He seems to love using chromosomes to determine how he should be addressing a person. Not that he's ever asked to see someone's tests determining their chromosome makeup. XXY men are rather common, and 90% of them don't even realize they have XX in their chromosome makeup. And XXY women are very rare, but they exist. I wonder how Ben Shapiro's worldview resolves that."
"I love you, Natalie.  This will make you sick, but here goes: I think you are a role model.  Thank you for your incredible work!"
"I'm happy you addressed the issues from your last video, it's more specific this time and less vague.  Another nonbinary youtuber i recommend is Ashley Wylde, who gave me tools on how to figure out why I consider myself as a nonbinary woman. Mainly it's more about asking yourself the why question on your gender. Like why you like presenting like this, why you feel good when you do a gender expression, etc. But more importantly it's for you to answer the why questions. Their gender resource playlist was very helpful and instrumental to help give me the language to better explain my gender to myself.   But nonbinary people shouldn't have to answer others' why questions. I know for me, and don't represent everyone under the non-binary umbrella, I just want people to accept and respect me as a nonbinary woman with no hassle. Even though hassle can happen."

I don't always want to me making a statement. Sure I'm your local queer nuisance but sometimes I'm just Schem and I want you to call me 'they' and not quiz me on NB identities instead of using fucking Google."
"I usually address people by their appearance (that also includes body language). So if someone looks like a lady to me I'll use female pronouns (unless asked to do otherwise!). If I'm not sure and their name doesn't give it away, I ask which pronoun they prefer. Sure, I am always a bit worried the question comes off as rude, but at least with their reply I can make sure to address them the way they prefer instead of going on a whim (which i think would be much more rude). It's not that hard to remember a person's chosen pronoun. Also why the fuck do people like Shapiro care so much about the anatomy of strangers? I mean, no one is asking about the (probably microscopic) size of his dick, either, just so he can prove he is a biological man..."

"Hi! Like all your videos this is absolutely superb. What you said about how pronoun usage developed before we knew about chromosomes prompted me to think about how, in languages with gendered nouns, nouns came to be gendered. The fact that the words are gendered, and that the gender of a noun in say french or German is often (but not always) quite intuitive, suggests that there is a ‚Äúgenderness‚Äù about a thing that people pick up on, despite the fact that a car or a rock clearly has no biological sex characteristics, or any biology at all. Come to think about it, I‚Äôd guess that even native speakers of non-gendering languages would have a measure of agreement if they were asked to assign a gender to a particular object. I would think of ‚Äúearth‚Äù as masculine, and ‚Äúair‚Äù as feminine, for example. Is this something you‚Äôve thought about?"

"Videos keep getting better"
"The idea that pronouns address biology never made sense to me. It's common to use pronouns to discuss inanimate objects or things in which the sex is indeterminable at the time. Furthermore, your phenotype¬†doesn't represent your genotype, and it is possible to be born phenotypical one sex but your genotype is another. So, if you want to claim pronouns are linked to the biology, then pronouns are locked off unless the person has given birth or had a genetic test revealed. This makes the definition cumbersome, demanding, and unrepresented in actual usage."

It's not hurting anyone.  But rather, if someone explicitly asks you to use a certain pronoun and you say 'no that's too hard' that makes you the dick here. If someone has come to you asking you to use a certain pronoun, that generally means they have a conflict with their current pronouns. By not using those pronouns, there's a good chance you are actually hurting that person."

"I think we (as in everyone) are making a mountain out of a mole hill. If someone on the street asked you to call him Jon instead of sir or Joy instead of sir or he or she or miss you'd just correct it and move on they and you wouldn't care or even really need to think about it. It should have been the same with pronouns. You just do it out of common courtesy and not care. I have known cis women that get miss gendered all the time and now it's even harder for those people in public now to. Not everyone is going to look like a barbie.  It's really not a big deal. Just ask them to use something different, just respect peoples dignity and you both stop putting sooo much thought into it. Before this whole thing became political it was actually easier to get gendered correctly. Now we've got everyone in there own separate camps and we're just trying to make life hard for each other but, we are all living under the same roof. It's so unnecessary."

"'You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology. The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words.'  Bravo. Thank you. The most concise summary of this entire pronoun fiasco.  It would be so easy to go against Shapiro on this point but people keep missing their opportunity. You just simply need to ask him why XY chromosomes make him a 'man', in which case he will be forced to go further into biological reproductive functions or something and you can simply keep on pushing ('Well, why does THAT make you a man?').  It's so hard for these people to deal with the fact that words don't really have definitions. Words are only able to function when people DON'T know their precise definitions. When people whip out dictionaries to 'prove' the correct use of some word you know that words are just 'sounds coming out of your mouth' without any metaphysical correspondence to the reality. They try to erase this basic arbitrariness of words by relying on some authority, as if writers of dictionaries had the privilege of being directly connected to the divine realm where all words have correct definitons and simply emanate from reality itself."

Socially speaking trans women are women. As far as biology goes - its only a matter of time.   What will be even more interesting is what happens when we develop the tools to augment our psychology and physiology. Maybe that's the world that gender queer folks are looking for"
"a small point on C-16: The primary argument wasn't people going to jail. Peterson did laid out the legal potential for someone to go to jail, but it was, let's say, an indirect path. You can potentially get jail time for an act of civil disobedience: not paying your fine, for instance. That is to say, the legal potential is there, but it's a very unlikely scenario. A more meaningful stat than '0 people have gone to jail' would be the number of people who have been punished for incorrect pronoun use, and thereby compelled by the state to express thoughts they don't believe. Seems like you either don't understand the argument, purposefully misrepresented it, or cut out detail to make the point more punchy."
"Apologetically just throwing this out there. How do people relate their gender to class?

Basically, I don't know how to gender them and it's kinda too akward to just ask them because they haven't come out officaly."
"Okay, that anaolgy about adoption that you use absolutely hits the nail on the head. In a different context than the trans discussion, it sounds like pure BS to me. I've got nothing to add there. Dutch also doesn't have an equivalent of the singular 'they', by the way. Closest thing we have is something that translates to 'it', and we all know that's being a shit gibbon because I'm essentially referring to a person as an object. I was playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and there's this one dialogue in Perikles' symposium where it became clear to me how disrespectful that actually sounds if you use it practically in social interactions. The character Aristophanes calls the main character you chose at the beginning of the game 'it'. And he continues doing it after Kassandra or Alexios reacts in a pretty insulted manner (for argument's sake, they're both cis for as far as I know). He even calls either of them 'creature of many names' if you choose a certain reply! I was literally sitting there like 'Holy shit, who invited this asshole?' For the people who played that quest: call me petty, but I chose the sweet wine just to get back at him. Dear comment readers, please give the dialogue a listen for yourself and decide whether that sounds a bit cringy to you or not. https://youtu.be/ePYP2D3KDwo?t=626  Also, can we just sit here and appreciate that glitter look with the silver eyeshadow and red lipstick for a minute?

My job, my life my hobbies, my friends all indicate that I am not a fit into a certain gender, so it makes me wonder if I am only passing as my biological gender due to my physical characteristics.

Ultimately just be nice to people. Life is hard enough as it is why go out of your way to upset someone?   Or just go with dude. Just saying if you really commit and stay consistent it works."

"Also, who says gender is all about 'feelings'? There must be some biological cause that makes people trans or nb.  You can't make a trans person cis by treating them according to their junk but you can make them suicidal. Even in bugs or birds, there's the junk and there is 'marking' behavior. Like a male bird or cricket making noise to basically say 'I am a dude!'. That's probably all gender really is, a drive to 'mark' yourself as belonging to group a or group b - 'How' you signal 'dude' or 'girl' or 'neither' is largely social and varies hugely across culture or times but you can't change a child's mental gender by raising it as another.  On a collective level it probably originated due to making mating easier, though of course on an individual level you can have a person who is an aromantic asexual but still dresses in cutesy soft pastel pink.  The genitals grow in the first trimester, the brain by the end of the second.They're almost independent processes, it's not strange that one might go a different way than the other."

I mean we are just as misogynistic and transphobic as all the other countries around us with genders in their language, or even more so. I kinda have a feeling that if you have less opportunity to address other people's genders, you also have less opportunity to question the culture that creates the gender system. It's still there we just talk less about it."

There's some proof that the third-person singular personal pronoun (h√§n=they) was made up when the rules for written finnish were being invented in the 19th century. Some regional variations or very formal situations not withstanding, it's extremely rare to hear anyone refer to other people as anything but ''it''(se)."
"'Don't be a shit gibbon' had me dead lmao"
"Your videos always crack me up. üòÇ this topic is interesting because when you think about it, you don‚Äôt actually see someone‚Äôs chromosomes when you meet them. What you see are their secondary sex characteristics (for ex, facial/body hair or lack thereof, body type, etc.). Then, judging from their outward appearance, you might assume their genitals and- if you really want to think about it that deeply-maybe their chromosomes. Philosophically, the question becomes: why is biology the end all be all when it comes to what is ‚Äúreal‚Äù-in this case, who is a man and who is a woman? Male and female have little significance outside their social contexts, after all. What it ‚Äúmeans‚Äù to be male or female is socially constructed, differs across culture, and changes over time. So at the end of the day-as you stated-it doesn‚Äôt really matter if a person has xx or xy chromosomes (or any variation of that) if socially, and thus, functionally, they live and behave as men or women (or anyone in between or outside of that binary). The parenthood analogy was great. If you adopt a child, they may not share your genes, but from a social standpoint they are your child because you raise them as such. Functionally and legally, you are still their parent regardless of whether, biologically, they are your ‚Äúoffspring.‚Äù Great (contra) points!"

Maybe some of them would, but it's only because their armor is spiky, they attack first so they don't get attacked.

"I think it's a flaw in the english language that gender is only used in the 3rd person. If you're using 1st person or 2nd person, you're much less likely to assume their gender since you know your own and probably the person they are speaking too. With that said, should 'they' be used for anyone, regardless of if their gender is known or not?"

"People like B. Shapiro seem to take the issue of trans people as a personal offense, somehow. It's as if he's shocked and hurt that someone might even consider rejecting their 'physical' gender and embrace their true self. How is this hurting you, B. Shapiro?

Why is he on a soap box, anyway? Who is this guy?"
"You had me at Grieg."
"9:55 Ben Shapiro (basically): 'Yes, I would refer to you as a she but you're not a real she.' So wait... when would you use he instead of she for this person you identify to others as a she? The point of a pronoun is to help identify a person without needing to use that person's name over and over again.  Ben Shapiro (destroyer of snowflakes, supposedly): 'That's not a great way to win me over...' So... you hate snowflakes but you think that people 'need' to win you over... Yeah... Like you said before, facts don't care about your feelings. No one cares how you feel about the topic. Ben Shapiro: 'If I teach my 4 year old girl that she can become a boy, that's not only lying to her, but I think it's damaging to her psyche.' Facts don't care about your opinion. There are people that grow up thinking there's a magical man that flies around the word giving presents to every kid after watching them all every minute, every second to see if they're being nice or not. But, yeah, thinking a girl can become a boy is damaging to the psyche. If that small thing is damaging to her psyche, she's a snowflake. 26:43 Okay I have to protest. There's no way gyrados is stone butch. In my experience, short of luvdisc, nothing does down quicker on that list than gyrados. Heck, whiscash is water/ground type, you'd need a strong grass type to take it down. But with gyrados, even without stab bonus, a single thunderbolt will take it down easily.  Eddie Izzard had a skit where he was talking about in languages like spanish, they put gender onto objects. Like 'Is this chair a he or a she? What do you mean? It's a f*cking chair? Yes, but is it  a he chair or a she chair? It's a chair!'  That's kind of my attitude about it. I don't really care what gender you are and identify with. If you want me to call 'Dane fluffy socks of cantegrapes.' sure, I'll call you that. Just know that the harder and/or longer it is, the more time I'll need to adjust/remember. If you're so trigger that people want to be called certain things but it's just too hard for you to remember which pronoun to use for which people, than you're a snowflake and need to suck it up. You don't complain insist that your relatives have too many individual names and that they should all simplify it to you."

"They say that fascism is the elimination of nuance. That explains their preference for proscriptive pronouns."
"But are those extra pronouns helping anyone? I don't mind using they because saying he/she is more taxing to anyone reading and hearing (and speaking for that matter). But adding new ones? What is the point if those can't be easily identified or explained. They don't add anything to the experience of living. I don't see why you can't be called a she if you are a tomboy for example. There is no need for a new pronoun. It's just a different expression of a 'she' (just like the parents example). I, for example, like the fact that the English language has 'you' as a gender neutral term because it makes interactions like this that much more tolerable. I see the importance of binary pronouns because it is useful at the end of the day, since we are afterall a biological species and our sexes do have visual and phonetical effects for a super majority of people, thus distinguishing between the two is helpful using a simple pronoun.  Also I'd argue that the 'I feel like a woman' is a completely incoherent argument since you do not know how 'a woman' feels because there is no such thing. There is a cultural context in which you identify yourself in fitting more with what the super majority considers a woman, be it in speech, appearance, mannerisms or even biology. That is not what 'a woman' feels. It's what a woman IS in your cognition and it's perfectly understandable why you could like it more than the alternative. 'A woman' means nothing except what it looks like in an individuals' eyes. If in your eyes, womanhood means having big tits and talking in a high pitched voice while making soft hand gestures, then a flat low voiced 'hard mannered' tomboy, would not be a woman to you. If there is enough similarity to what 'a woman' is rather than 'a man' (usually visual) then you'd still call that tomboy a she rather than a he.  Most people have similar bullet points (again usually visual) when it comes to addressing someone as a man or a woman, so the terms 'he' and 'she' are useful to us to relay a lot of information. If you ask me to call you a XOR or some other computer logic gate, I would not do that. It doesn't give me any substantial information to warrant it. It's not useful. If it makes the person feel better, is none of my concern. I'm not a therapist. I'd suggest such people either be neutral/non-binary (they) or one of the binaries, because those give a lot more useful information and are very easy to work with.  Very nice video Contra. A lot of great insight and showing how Ben Shapiro has no fundamental grasp of reality and FACTS. I'd say objectivists have a lot more to show in his misunderstandings of things, but this is definitely good enough and conveys this specific point of gender very well :]  Side Note: Language is there to reflect reality as one experiences it, not as others experience it, thus pronouns should be used the way one sees fit according to their experiences. If you want me to call you a man but you look like a woman (regardless of biology), then I will still call you a woman because that is what reality shows me and your proposition of calling you a certain gender does not reflect reality. Asking for people to describe someone (which is what pronouns do) by the way they feel is impossible. It's not something we can know at any given moment. It would require constant questioning which is completely unnecessary because it doesn't adding anything to one's life."
"I have a quick question for Ben and people like her that I feel is not given enough thought: What do you say if you do not know the 'biology' of a person? What if you are engaging in a conversation with someone who's gender, for one reason or another, you absolutely cannot discern? Someone who is androgynous and will not provide pronouns for you, someone over the phone who's voice is of indiscernible gender, someone over the internet who's pronouns are not apparent, someone who sent you a letter, etc.? Ben assumes that she knows  what pronouns are and what they mean, which is biology, but she does not understand that you cannot possibly assess the biology of a person a vast majority of the time. A lot of trans people have atypical chromosome structures, and so do a lot of cis people. This argument is not brought up to her enough, and it would shatter the way she thinks.   *She/her is used facetiously here, obviously."

I thought being a paleontologist would have me choosing which dinosaur I'd be riding. My choice was Stegosaurus--it has a Thagomizer (named after the late Thag Simmons). I grew up rather close to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology... it might have affected me as a child (made me fucking awesome is what it did)  But yeah... how you explain it to a child is, 'yeah... some boys grow up to be fire men... and some boys grow up to be women.

"The problem here, I think, is fundamentally that we can't really empirically confirm someone's gender experience, so people who haven't experienced, or don't have the capacity to imagine experiencing, non-conforming feelings of sex and gender, are walking around blind and probably feel they're being fucked with, and not in the fun way. If we can't ground an idea on very few basic axioms and observations, then even though it shouldn't be that complicated for human beings to maintain a consistent concept of something, things go to hell surprisingly fast because you can't expect that much from (relatively) hairless monkey 2.0s. People default to stuff like chromosomes because they're empirically observable, assuming we manage to kidnap you and probe you worse than aliens on South Park to confirm that you do, indeed, have XY chromosomes.

"I have one problem with using the proper pronoun in regards to what people believe and act. I am not the butch masculine type of guy, I think however that I still am a straight cis male .

I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong but that if I don‚Äôt get the benefit of the doubt by appearance then it‚Äôll be a guessing game where at best I‚Äôm using the right gender by guessing based on old stereotypes of men and women and at worst misgendering because I‚Äôm a shallow prick.   But a major portion of it should be that we need the benefit of the doubt - ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer she or her‚Äù ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll be sure to remember‚Äù is marked as this toxic situation where trans women are devaluated of their existence, however if we look at the cis-gendered person who grew up in Hicksville Arizona then at least the person is *trying* to adapt. That conversation should be a polite misunderstanding and not a fight against proving transgendered peoples‚Äô existence. And if the guy slips up again it‚Äôs not the end of the world, the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you and the guy just simply forgot. And if he‚Äôs a decent dude then he‚Äôll apologize sincerely if not then hey! You met another impolite person, big woop!"

"BTWWWwww when someone tells you that the 'traditional definition' of marriage is between a man and a woman, be sure to remind them that that *ancient* tradition is about 60 years old. Before Loving v. Virginia the definition of marriage was between a man and woman of equal race, and before that of a man and a woman of equal race and religion, and before that of equal race and religion and social status and before that it was race, religion, social status, and subgenre of death metal. An Obituary fan marrying a Carcass fan? When hell freezes over libtards!  Anyway, marriage has been redefined several times throughout even recent history and every time opponents to redefinition used the same 'muh tradishun and also god' arguments."

"I refrained from commenting on the last one because I felt a bit conflicted about my own personal take away from it. I think because it just hit a bit too close to home in a way that I hadn't expected (and it didn't feel fair to make a big stink since there was a proper warning right at the beginning, so it's not as though I was unprepared). It was partially initial upset at an inconvenient truth, and not realizing that it was less a concrete belief, and more a series of questions between parts of yourself. I appreciate the clarification on your stances and the discussion at large. At times like these, being seen and heard is a welcome relief."

"I think you didn't provide enough thought about the issue with non binary pronouns. Of course  singular they exists, but it is different from singular he/she. It has a grammar, it isn't arbitrary. You didn't reallly provide a solution besides 'be nice'. And I'm willing to do that, but this doesn't address the issue wether you should ask for someone's pronouns. As you said you don't understand this trend either, but you just lost one sentence about it and for me that is really the issue we have to discuss. If the discussion were only about individual actions and not about greater society changes it would be far less heated. I think this topic deserves another video.  And I loved your point that (binary) transness isn't just about looks but more about what kind of life do you live."

"It's impossible to use neutral pronouns in romance languages, because most words have genders. In that case, people who are non-binary often accept being referred with both male and female words."
"It's funny how in my country and probably most countries reactionaries couldn't have this debate if they wanted to, since there are no gender specific pronouns."
"We use language as a code to describe reality. Language itself is not reality.  Semantics use: 'the word for the thing is not the thing itself' and 'the symbol is not the thing that it symbolizes.'  Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic label for a mental illness, but all these other 'non-binary' social labels seem to be more of a counter-culture that don't understand that changing the symbols does not change the thing.  Changing your gender pronouns does not change your sex.  Performing the social gender-schemas for a female/male is not the same as being a female/male."

I want people to ask for pronouns because when your pronouns don't exist no one will assume them but GOD I wish people would just correctly assume my gender, ya feel me?

Or at the very least, should certain ways of acting be relegated to certain labels? Why is that necessary? It only serves to create an increasingly complex web of societal stereotypes and expectations which is frankly exhausting. I just want everyone to be ok with everyone else and, more importantly, for people to be ok with themselves. And a lot of this stuff seems like a way for people to try to be more socially accepted, but in my experience that's never the path to happiness."

"One of my first encounters with a trans woman that really marked me was in the subway in Paris. This very girly girl in a pretty dress, with long blond hair comes and sits next to me. Gave her half a glance, I mean, we're in the subway... And then her phone rings and she goes 'allo?' with the deepest voice, full of gravel... I was gaping. It was confusing and perplexing... And I think, if she was trying to pass, her voice must have been something she struggled with, though I hope not. So I can understand how it must be stressful, wondering how people see you and whether the attributes you think are very masculine about you will be picked on... What I don't understand, is why contra's video is so needed. What the hell, do people really need to be taken by the hand this hard in 2018? What does it matter that someone asks such a small request out of you that you might please not refer to them as 'he' but 'she'? I mean, I understand the debate was needed at some point, but again, isn't this bloody 2018? Why are so many people still so hellbent on making others miserable because of how they identify? Can't the conservative twat go focus on the very real effects of global warming? Because if we break our fucking planet in 20 years, his baby girl will get to worry about surviving rather than worry about trans people.  It's just saddening that this debate needs to happen. Hopefully the days are counted. The wheel of social progress turns, unstoppable."

"I can see the point of a lot of this, But the ... man... who dresses and appears very very femme... Would piss me off and Id likely not respect the pronouns.  It's obvious that pronouns are in large part coded by  biology.. Or at least how our brain translates someone's physical traits into a gender.   So someone who's strictly male, but presents female, I would suspect of being a very insensitive person with a high need for attention. To me, they seem like a person who who's a ticking 'Haha gotcha, bigot' bomb; someone who takes pleasure in making cis(or even non cis) folks confused and in 'need of correction'.  Because lets face it... Even if we DO get it right.And I call him he... it would be obvious to anyone, based on my age and the time I was born, that to me pronouns were taught as part of our sex. So even if I get it right, I'll have to spend extra effort each and every time I think about or refer to him, just to get it right. I have to run a constant 'Dont forget the pronouns. Dont forget the pronouns' mantra in my head.  Im sorry... But someone who subjects another person to that type of frustration is in my opinion... a dickhead.  So I appreciate when trans people actually bother to present as the gender they identify as... otherwise what's the friggin point even? We can just all agree to use random pronouns for everyone  all the time and remove their meaning entirely rather than this fucked up 'Hahaha Im just trying to make you stumble you nazi-to-be!'"
"This is not fair. I'm supposed to be able to tell 3rd rate and 2nd rate drag queens apart? And that's not including 1st rate!   Serious talk, I feel way too authoritarian personally and have stopped listening to the possible risks of that. What I'm observing these days is immeasurable tolerance to bullshit, scams and people's sheer stupidity regarding the important matters that I've lost patience with it. Of course, I'm not all knowing, will never be that, and ContraPoints is probably the biggest reason why I hesitate to indulge in authoritarian mannerisms.   Either way, their existence and validity are not up for debate. The reasons behind them might be an interesting one, but I'm not about to say they should be defined out of existence. What I find hilarious, though, is that people like Shapiro either want to do just that and have no reason beyond getting angry for language reasons (if they're serious about that anyway) or fear that such individuals might be predators, an argument so ridiculous it's actually better applied to men of all backgrounds. If it was up to me, I'd take up the latter as a reason to lock up all cishet men for eternity. Why not? They make up the majority of predators, murderers, terrorists and thieves. If any person of any background should be considered a risk for one of those, I say play it safe and lock up all cishet men."

"6:02 Actually, I DON'T agree with Ben on the biology here. about 1% of people are born with sex chromosomes associated with the opposite binary gender of that which they have been assigned, yet they are phenotypically identical to their assigned gender, meaning that your chromosomes are not determinant of anything, but also unless you have been karyotyped, you don't actually know what your sex chromosomes are."
"I already loved the video, it's so beautiful to watch, and also accessible and explanatory in such a way that you can actually introduce them to your friends and colleagues who don't know anything about trans-issues... So I was ready to just finish my tea and nod in a snobby, intellectual way after this great video until I see the messages at the end and everything is suddenly raw and visceral again. It's almost like you transport me to this bubble of calm debate about issues that the real, life-threatening situations out there - and of course, that there's passion and fear in you. Thank you for taking the time to be so calm and debate serenely about stuff, even when everything is catching fire around us. ( But seriously, you should have seen the scene, I was drinking tea and knitting while watching the video, so I did the biggest double take when the post-credit message started with the trans flag, and dropped my knitting needles when I saw 'fascistas n√£o passar√£o'... I guess this Brazilian still had a single tear left to shed over this situation)"

"Great video ! I've always been a bit confused about this whole pronoun thing, didn't understand why people could get angry when wrong pronoun was used, or why people get angry when asked to use correct pronoun, and I think now I understand it better.  For me, apparence is very important because it's the first contact, the first information you get about someone. There's a video about a french guy on a TV show that got offended because the host said that he was a man. Thing is, he acts like a man, he looks like a man, dress like a man, so from the outside, how are we supposed to know that he doesn't identify as a man ? That's maybe very cis of me, but the thing is I've always lived in a cis world so it can be very confusing when I hear things like that, it's a completely unknown territory for me, and unfortunately, I've never had the chance to meet someone who could explain it to me... Then after, I learned about the other pronouns and other genders, which made me even more confused. I've seen things like elderkins, something like light beings,... And thing is, how am I supposed to know how someone identifies if there's a contradictory first impression, and no actual physical clue ? I'm willing to use any pronoun to be honest, but IMHO more than 3 pronoun (male/man, female/woman, neutral) is going to make thing complicated. Best thing would be, like said in the video, to only have a neutral pronoun like in some languages. After this video, I think that people get angry when misgendered (is that a word ? English is not my mother tongue and I'm too lazy to check at that point lol) because it's already difficult to feel very different, and gender is kind of a group, a community, so by misgendering someone, you deny his/her/they belonging to that group. Just like why some men get angry when they get hit on by gays or trans : maybe they associate being hit on by a man means you're a woman, which is kind of weird actually, because why would the actions of others define what and who you are ? If a biological man has female attributes, acts like a woman, looks like a woman, dresses like a woman, well... I think there's no need to think further lol   Aaaaaaanyway, I'm going to stop here, already long enough, but thank you for the video, and you should think of you as trash :( You're really amazing, intelligent and beautiful (seriously, that might be a bit inappropriate but you look really good) !"

"I don't understand how that's a big deal. it's not hard, it's not much effort. If sb asks you to hold the door open or help them over the street, just do it. If they want you to use a specific pronoun, just. fucking. do. it. There should be no reasoning or argumentation needed, same as you don't argue with sb if they couldn't open the door themselves, put the grocery bags down for a moment, hurry through or take a different door. That's just way more work and you have to be particularly spiteful to start a discussion around it."
"So, I'm Finnish, and just like Contra said, there are no gendered pronouns in our language. I grew up referring to everyone by the same pronoun, but I couldn't do that in English speaking context, because it wouldn't make sense to English speakers and would just offend and confuse them. Just like if someone speaking Finnish tried to refer to men and women by different pronouns would not make any sense, because different pronouns for men and women don't even exist. Language is based on social contracts, not biology. This dude either doesn't know how languages work or he's a bigot who wholly well knows what he does doesn't make sense but does it anyway. I'm guessing it's the latter."

"Great video, but I was hoping you'd hit on new pronouns like zer etc. I have never had an issue with him or her when its obvious or changing it when its not, and I find they pretty easy and natural, like you said. The two things with pronouns I struggle to really get my head around is adding new ones entirely, or being told I should ask what someone is and not 'assume'. I have no  issue with being corrected and doing my best to stick to the correction, but its harder for me to comprehend completely new pronouns or adding another layer of social awkwardness by having to ask everyone their pronoun. You may say that its not an argument from biology, but if I have to ask you what pronoun to use it still feels to me like saying 'Hey, do you have a dick? Do you like your dick or is it kinda getting in the way?' And that is not something I normally ask at a first meeting, definitely a second though. Will you touch on these topics in another video?"

"I will say this much about pronoun usage.   I do make an effort to use the preferred pronouns for the trans/enby people I do know for a few of the reasons CP mentioned. It did take a little time to get used to, and I am truly grateful for the patience of these individuals if I accidentally use the wrong pronouns, but I didn't find the concept of adjusting how I thought of them in regards to their gender particularly difficult. Obviously I can't extrapolate my experience to others, but those people never get super-mad over me saying the wrong pronoun, and given how the non-binary community seems to have only recently started to gain a lot of prominence, I'm willing to bet that most other non-binary people will act in a similar way - a polite 'Excuse me, but I prefer to be called [xyz]' as opposed to a 'How dare you!'  I apologise if none of this makes any sense, but given the malleability of human society and how much societal norms have changed over the millennia, rolling with the time seems more logical than digging your heels in and going 'No, let me stay here! I'M SO RATIONAL'"

"'How do I explain this to my children?'  You'd be surprised what they understand and accept.

They're called transgender girls, and they should be treated with the same respect as all the other girls.'  There, simplified for a young child to understand."
"I feel like there were a lot of lines that could very easily be taken out of context by stubborn mules here (''You can identify however you like, but gender is also social, structural and interpersonal. So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man, then you ARE fully trans, your identity is fully valid, but until you begin living as a woman your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical' really stood out.)   Also I take issue with the phrase 'early in transition.' You've been extraordinarily lucky, I transitioned and started HRT 4 years ago and I still get gendered male by about 95% of strangers who gender me. I'll never have enough money for plastic surgery either, so, that's probably just going to be my life. I know I'm really picking into your wording but you're rapidly becoming a HUGE poster-girl for trans women and you've got to be really careful with what you say now. Statements like the above could easily be used either as truscum rhetoric on deciding who is and isn't trans enough and telling trans people they're not working hard enough because you've set a time-limit on how long it should take someone to feminize with those statements, respectively.   Speaking of truscum, I guess it served its purpose but wow do I not feel good about you painting Blair White in such a sympathetic light.   Still... Better than your last video. Blech."

I can somewhat handle ignorance,  when it's obvious that they genuinely don't understand something. But my 'friends' were just flat out cruel. Even when I provided resources, they still told me that I'm confused and need to stop pretending. Those who say stuff like 'Yelling at me won't change my mind' need to admit that even civil discussion won't change their minds either. In the end, it has to be a conscious effort. And that's difficult for everyone, at some point. It pretty much means kicking aside you ego and thinking that maybe you were wrong."

Without the economic liberation of the post-war era we wouldn't even be discussing the above as women would still be locked at home and men would pretend to be virile and demean one another as they buttfuck each other, as it's been proud Western tradition since the Trojan war. Meanwhile as the social contract of the Bretton Woods era erodes into a pit of self- aggrandizing cleptocracy, the bubbling pool of discontent it generates is rapidly turning the majority's attention to all those highly reflective brown and rainbow minorities who are clearly the true culprits of society's degeneration. It is my meek suggestion that by focusing like orbital satellite lasers onto the latter, one may, in the long run, be making a tactical error by pointing the zombies' attention to the delicious and defenseless flesh of the living."

I think what absolutely convinced me though was when I watched a couple of your videos and legitamitely thought you were a Cis Woman (and thought you were very hot). It wasn't until a few videos in you mentioned being a trans woman that i figured it out. And after that point it still felt really naturally to refer to you as a she [still think you're really hot ;) ]"
"to be honest, finding my gender identity was really a matter of finding the label that makes me feel the most euphoric. there's always the possibility that there will come a term for my gender that will describe it better than the one i use now, but until i find it, i'm alright with the one i've already found. basically: life is garbage, so if you find something that makes you feel happy and that doesn't harm anyone, CLING TO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT"

No, I just follow the rules of the German language that some nouns are gramatically masculine (like 'der Tisch') and some nouns are gramatically feminine (like 'die Lampe'). Pronouns have never been used just to describe biological sex. But they have been used to describe grammatical gender and even things that have no chromosomes at all can have that."

"25:20 Yes. Forexample Finns don't have gender pronoun, even if we take bride in gender-equality of our language.  Yet the finnish language still has strong gender segregation in languange by uncounscious bias by those who speak of it: Citizen is male, Judge is male, nurse is female, leader is male, coward is female and so on and so on.   This seems to be issue for lots of people who preach of gender-equality, but for me it just showcases depth psychological fact that there are femine and masculine things we define by their nature. Just like hard thorny/pointy things were considered to be from mars (=violence), watery things from neptune (=flux and undefined charater).    But it's an error to think that feminine = female gender, masculine = male gender, which to me seem to be major issue with-in society, all sides included, even amongst those who study gender. Forexample Peterson thinks that Scandinavian segregation of genders would be display of optimality between two sexes... I disagree, we as men may like to do masculine things while women prefer femine things, but there acutally should more pressure for men and women to come into touch of both realms: Men should take more care of their children while women should stand their ground more. There might be short term difficulties but on long term it helps to balance the individual and find his equilibrium."
"I mean in a way even ‚Äûbiological sex‚Äú is constructed, because we keep actively putting certain aspects of human bodies in ‚Äûmale‚Äú and ‚Äûfemale‚Äú categories...and biology isn‚Äôt even clear when it comes to chromosomes so it sort of is more about the conclusions we as a society draw from those ‚Äûfacts‚Äú...(I‚Äôm not a native english speaker so I kinda hope one can get what I mean)"

"As a cis guy I don't really understand a desire to be any gender but what I've always been.  And as such, that makes this shit easier to handle really.  I mean, I don't need to understand it.  You want to be called she, I'll call you she.  You look like a woman? I'll call you a she. You tell me it makes you feel happier when I call you she, I'll call you she. You want me to you call you xim, or call you judy? Sure, I'll do that too, if I remember.  If I don't, unless you're an asshole, I'm sure you'll forgive me and not send me to Canadian pronoun jail.   But that's the thing right? I don't really understand because I don't identify as anything other than what people expect.  So where's the harm? I mean, it doesn't matter how great you look, or how well you pass as a woman, I'm not going to start thinking I am a woman all of a sudden. So why do you want to when I don't? Who fucking cares! All I know is that it doesn't matter whether I call you she or if I am an asshole, neither situation would lead to me all of a sudden having the urge to take hormones or go through costly, painful, frightening medical procedures, and something that I'm unable to understand makes that seem like the right thing for you.   This isn't going to impact me, it's not going to impact my daughter.  This isn't some passing idea that you can get because you hear your dad call that lady 'she' despite her chromosomes. It does impact you, who is becoming more comfortable living inside your body.    I wonder if Ben Shapiro really wishes that he could present as female, and that's why he's so against it. He's thrown those dreams away, and the idea of calling another trans woman 'she' would invalidate his own struggle and suffering that he's had to endure to deny that to himself.  As a cis guy, I can't imagine anything making me want to be anything other than a guy, just like as a trans person, I'm sure the idea of not transitioning must be hard to endure.  But I can imagine being in a body that was different from the gender that I identified with, even if I can't understand the feeling myself.  And I do imagine that if I was in that situation, and I resigned myself to call myself a man forever and convinced myself that it was the proper thing to do, and all these bitches out here were getting treated like women, and called 'she'.  I imagine I would be pissed, and unwilling to let them get what I've had to deny myself.   So I hope Ben sorts his shit out. Whatever his issue is. I don't feel sorry for him, he's still an asshole.  But I hope he sorts himself out to become less of one."

"Every video you post makes me ask more questions than it answers, but it's always so rational, and from the left, I really appreciate your use of non-liberal philosophy, such as your rejection of gender essentialism. As a trans woman, I have no idea what it means to feel like a woman. I'm happier when I express femininity and when people read me as female. I don't know why I feel that way. I'm no psychologist. I just know I do, and I'm trying to learn to be okay with not understanding why.  I certainly agree with a lot of what you said. People use gendered language to reflect the gender they perceive someone as. On the one hand, there's that constant struggle to be read as your preferred gender. This struggle comes from the psychological phenomenon of dysphoria, either/both social or/and physical.  But non-binary people and trans people who don't experience dysphoria are really rocking the boat. Rather than conforming to society, they demand that society conform to them, that our societal interpretation of gender be changed. They say that I'm a woman (or whoever you are), not because society treats me as a woman, but because I say I'm a woman. While I don't invalidate the dysphoria I experience, there is something radical about refusing to conform and demanding society change shape. The change demanded is rather utopian imho because I don't see it happening through current activism and pushing people to ask pronouns. It requires something deeper. It's all very interesting, and I don't really understand as I'd like to.  While currently, psychological self-identification is an important part of trans identity, it is far from the totality of how our society treats gender, as presentation and passing are crucial as well. However, is it appropriate for us to push for social change in which psychological self-identification is the sole criterion for gender? I don't have an answer, and that probably boils down to one of the issues I struggle with most on a day to day basis.  I know I rambled a bit, it helps me clear my head."

"In the online world, discussion comes before gender. People read what you have to say and usually have zero bias based on what gender you are. However, I've seen it countless times that when somebody establishes their gender, people's attitudes change, and not just one or two people. Suddenly everyone perceives what you say in a different light."

"I think the definition of 'are' is something to be debated. As well as the reproductive system of the person in question. You can ask to be considered whatever you want, which is fine. Then comes the question of what you 'are' actually. Then comes the definition of 'are' which involves identity, role, quality, and so on. So what you 'are' can be argued if you are arguing semantics. I think generally a person's reproductive system determines what they 'are.' So then it really turns into a philosophical debate rather than anything else, and that makes it nearly impossible to decide who is 'right' or 'wrong' and honestly it's not something that can be either of those. Regardless, I'm about to go to taco bell"

"Pronouns like he and she aren't supposed to be something you think about. Your unconscious brain just fills in that gap of that part of speech based on what you've seen and heard. But when you call someone by their name, or a pronoun that doesn't fit your initial, thoughtless perception, you're using more active parts of your brain."

"The problem with the trans movement is that they're language idealists. Most people still don't even know the difference between sex and gender, male and man, female and woman, and don't consider it in their use of pronouns. Not only that, but theirs what defines the genders is transient like our naturalistic use of language, so they can almost never be in line at any given time leading to ambiguity."
"I'm gender queer and it's taken a long time to realize that? As a kid, I rejected femininity hardcore, but I grew up in the 80s being fed a steady diet of 'feminine = weak and bad', then when I got older I realized I have no problem with femininity and that I'd just been fed a bad diet. Then I realized that... I don't feel female... or male... Most would see me as cis female and I don't mind or care. I've been mistaken for male as well and that also doesn't bother me. It's easier to 'identify' as female (putting female on forms) but in my day to day life I feel complete ambivalence to annoyance when it comes to my gender.  I kind of wish I felt more female, just because it would literally make life easier. It's a weird and difficult topic.  Great vid as always, thanks!"

"Thanks so much for the section on non-binary identity! It really resonated with me as a non-binary person. I hadn't framed it in quite that way before but it makes complete sense- that by endeavoring to exist in the way that I feel most comfortable I am in effect trying to create a space for myself in society that doesn't really exist yet. I also really appreciated you acknowledging that binary and non-binary trans ppl often (not always, but often) have different end goals, like with the 'assuming pronouns' example you gave. Kat Blaque has talked about this, where she is aware that many non-binary people would prefer that all pronouns not be assumed until asking, whereas she does not prefer to be asked to clarify her pronouns- especially since cis people rarely in practice ask other cis people what pronouns they use. Ash Hardell has also talked about this recently and how it is impossible in our society for non binary people to 'pass'- so trans people who really want that and value that often find it really hard to understand that that can't really be a goal for non-binary people. I'm not quite sure what the resolution to this is barring 'just respect everyone and do what they prefer', but I'm glad it's being talked about bc I feel like it's the source of a lot of the division between binary and non-binary trans people. Anyways, much love from a non-binary friend who also feels like trash!"
"re: yr point about English being weird with pronouns: Idr the exact percentage but the vast majority of languages which have gendered pronouns are indo-european, & (all? if not most) non-IE languages which use them adopted the use intentionally from IE languages (Mandarin Chinese for example only started using a different character for 'her' in the early 1900's, after a poet saw that they did in some IE language & thought that was cool - they're still pronounced the exact same tho)"
"The grammar argument is a dumb argument. First you take it out of biology which is a losing battle. And try to play a majority rules grammar game where most of my friends are saying I'm a she therefore I am biologically a she. This is false.

"Hey ho, agendered dork here. Just wanted to say that while it wasn't covered here, some may be curious about how we work. Answer is, we don't. There's really no uniform to how shit works with us, and you'd have to ask the individual on that front.   So far as pronoun, they is always safe, but taking myself as an example, I don't mind he, she, they, or even it really, as my case is more about perception and clarification. I feel like my assigned sex or gender as a whole has literally nothing to do with my life and who I am, and prefer to live my life outside of the confines of it completely. I look at myself in the mirror and there's no dysphoria or anything it's just 'Hello flesh blob.' I neither hide, nor express my choice because there's no real way to hide or express nothing.  Some others detest the concept of gender altogether, some others feel that agendered is a gender in and of itself. It's honestly really confusing and I'm fairly new to it as well, only identifying this way for 6 months."

"Ben Shapiro is a terrible arguer. I read (there's a dollar and half an hour I'll never get back) his little Kindle pamphlet on how to 'destroy the libs' and he has a way of starting with a bad premise and then continuing with that bad premise. Not good, and he'd be laughed out of debate club. Jordan Peterson is a weenie. Also speaking of bad arguments, the whole tempest in a teapot about Bill C-16 could have been avoided if rational, thinking people took the three seconds to READ the damn bill! All it does is add gender identity to the list of reasons one is not allowed to discriminate against a person (other things on the list being race, religion, etc.). Pretty innocuous, and it really has more to do with things like someone can't refuse a person a job or housing rental because they're trans. It also has to go through the process of law and require evidence (etc. etc. etc.). Peterson selling it as the Thought Police are going to kick down your door if you forget and use 'he/she' instead of 'they' is disingenuous at best. Weenie!"

"Hi. Cishet wristcell here dropping the questions.  I don't quite understand exactly what meaningful experience someone like John Mclain gets from still preferring male pronouns. Not that I wouldn't call him that if he asked, but I'm sure if I saw him on the street, I'd assume he would opt for female pronouns. I suppose I'm after an explanation of what is left of the essence of gendered experience if one looks and dresses like a gender that is opposite of the pronoun they choose. I think perhaps that I may view gender as too performative maybe idk.   I guess I'm looking for an Aristotelian 'Substance' underneath the qualifying, performative aspect of gender that would make John's experience of gender as a man still meaningful in some way outside of the performative/social aspect of gender (which would seems to indicate woman). Like, what's left I guess?  Performative here means the visual aspect and social here means the relational aspect. I get the ideas that Contra puts forward about binary trans people, but I suppose I may be at the same place that she's at in regard to non-binary people (well, I'm sure I'm far behind, but she expressed that their experience is perhaps more difficult to explain I guess.)   I'm not denying the experience, I'm trying to add understanding into my current conception, which is lacking obo.  Maybe someone has some hot takes hmu ty"

"Saying trans women are 'objectively' men, is like saying that there is an objectively best book ever written.

"The Suspiria remake looks lit."
"IT'S ANOTHA MASTAPIECE!!!"
"You make some good analogies particularly for people who may be newer to the topic. But when you really get into your explanation about different gender expression you kind of erase the existence of trans men or women who identify as women but are expressing masculine traits. It makes it so your trans discussion is only about trans women and not trans men. I understand you are inherently biased since you are a woman, but that part of the video seemed to be more generalized/broad strokes instead of more personal...so it's kind of disappointing trans men were erased. I know you can't talk about every variable in your videos, but it seemed like a point in the 'conversation' where transgender was being spoken about in broader terms, so both genders should have been included. Especially when media constantly focuses on trans women and almost always erases trans men."

But I basically don't present in a way very different from a tomboyish cis woman, and I even have really long hair. One day I was at a museum and had my hair in a bun, and was wearing an army jacket over a button-up shirt. The person checking people's bags called me over with a 'sir'. Would I have gotten a 'sir' if they'd looked closely? Probably not. But it was still incredible. I loved it but I also thought about how weird it would be for someone who was truly just a tomboyish cis woman, to get that treatment."

"I don't see why people find singular they/them/their so difficult. At my last job, when setting up accounts for new members of staff, I often wouldn't be able to guess their gender from their paperwork due to a) the paperwork not asking for gender, and b) our country being multicultural and having a ton of unique and interesting names that were either unisex or I couldn't even guess the gender of. Using they/them/their to avoid jumping to conclusions was just...normal."
"As a 6'2' cis woman, I politely ask you to stop trashing our height, lol. Jokes, but really, I've pondered for years what it means to want to be as I am. I've tried to consider what it is about what I am that would cause another person to feel their own life experience lacking without. It's a difficult thing to imagine. It's also a difficult thing to discuss with the trans women I know personally. It's not like I can just go up to them and say 'like, why you so obsessed with me?' (jokes again.) I accept that I might not ever really get it, but I keep trying anyway. I have actually been misgendered. It happened sometimes when I was a lanky kid, stopped when puberty arrived with the gifts of wide hips and a generous rack. I think about what that felt like. It hurt, mostly because it felt like I was... I don't know... failing? At being a girl? If that makes sense. I knew I was supposed to be  something, and that I wasn't succeeding, and that that made me an object of ridicule. I honestly believe that humans are not built to deal with ridicule. There's something primal about the need for acceptance, a pack instinct. Yes, with age and wisdom you can learn to overcome it, to deafen yourself to it, but it never stops being something harmful once you let it in. Anyway, I appreciate your videos. They help me think about things from a fresh perspective, allow me to be a little kinder to the women in my life who may have had to work to earn that title. Thanks."

"I agree that Ben Shapiro (and by extension myself) is wrong on the utility point. Which is basically how  most of us use pronouns... If I met you in person I would call you she, because that is what you look like.  Yet for me the biological root has some significance, that only arises in the wake of the twentieth century and surgical and medical procedures that can make a man look like a biological woman and vise versa. So this phenomenon is knew and there may be contexts in which the appropriate pronoun of reference for you is he?"

"as a male in ever sense, (I despise using cis bc it sounds ridicoulous  and unnecessary imo) I dont care who or what you are just as long as I do the human decent thing and call any person by the pronoun they prefer. With that in mind Shapiro is just being a twat and contrarian for career and rigid flawed traditional religious reasons. Which he has the right to do, but it doesnt make him right socially or morally.  Dr. Peterson's qualm with bill C-16 has more to do with setting a horrible precedent for free speach more than fear of pronoun jailtime, or not wanting to call people by their perfered pronoun. I think this distiction is constantly missed by Peterson's critics and make having a conversation with them pointless, as they always misinterpret his intentions."

"i wish the futch scale had never gotten so popular. it started as a joke originally, but now ppl like take it seriously...and it completely undermines the whole point of what it means to be femme/butch. the futch scale assumes that femme and butch are based solely on aesthetics, with 'futch' being a middle point between masculine and feminine appearance. this isnt what butch/femme culture means to me at all, nor to many other lesbians. femme and butch are solidified identities in conversation with one another, that encompass so much more than how one looks. they're rooted in lesbian history (19th cent bar culture) and reducing them to wishy-washy aesthetics is completely ignoring their history and what they mean to actual butches and femmes.   TLDR; futch as a concept grossly misrepresents butch/femme identities and the futch scale is an out of control joke. it's cool, tho - i'm not mad at natalie or anything, lots of people don't know this! just helpful info"

"It sounds complicated when someone tries to explain it, although Contra does an amazing job of it.  But in practice it doesn't have to be complicated.  You just call a person by the pronoun that they appear to be.  If they politely ask to be called something different, just do that.  It really boils down to the simple ethical axiom of 'Don't be a dick.'"

"Found this very useful. Relying on the 'adoptive parents' analogy, and assuming that there will be varying utility in highlighting the distinction - depending on context: I am genuinely curious as to how people navigate the trans-women in sport issue? As far as I can tell, division of *many* sporting competitions by gender is useful in encouraging participation and fair contest."
"I don't think this non-binary thing is that hard to grasp. Genders are actually just a social convention, there shouldn't be behaviours that are perceived as 'feminine' or 'masculine', after all  they are all different kinds of human expression. I believe it is important for us as a society to bring down the binary norm, even transpeople go through a great deal of suffering and prejudice just to go from one extremity to the other, simultaneously rejecting and reaffirming a social construct that has long outlived its own usefullness. I hope one day no one will feel like they have to either be a 'he' or a 'she' and we can just be ourselves. Dressing, adressing and expressing ourselves the way we want, and people around us won't make a fuss about it.  I have lived my entire life 'kinda' identifying myself as a cis heterossexual man, but I have been thinking about it for a while now and I no longer feel the need to identify myself as anything. I know this is much easier for cis people, but I wish everyone could feel like this.  Like I said before, maybe this 'man or woman' thing is kind of outdated.  Great video."

Let's act like it. Peace!"
"Contra points you are a biological male with feminine characteristics. Who gives a shit if someone calls you ‚ÄúHe‚Äù. It‚Äôs still an accurate description as your biological male. However a good case could also be made to call you she as you do look like a woman. Personally I have no issues calling trans woman that look like woman ‚Äúshe‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a big deal if some people can‚Äôt see you as a woman, just don‚Äôt associate with them."
"Yeah, I'm starting to feel like these videos... aren't really for people like me. I know cis people who've really benefited from them, and that's great. I should probably stop frustrating myself. I'm honestly looking forward to CP moving on from talking about gender issues, because I don't get anything but pain out of the efforts to make transgender people 'politically correct' for the benefit of people outside the crowd. But they're helpful to a lot of people. Still my favorite of the Youtube skeptic community."
"I really like your videos because they're really entertaining, and not boring like most videos about social issues. But, idk why you are wearing drag make up for this particular video, and not one of your more natural looks? Your eyebrows are like in the middle of your forehead. They look so crazy. I think you look a lot better with a more natural makeup look."

"I haven't watched quite all of your videos yet and I wonder if you've ever discussed or thought about a possible conflict between the concept of being transgender and the movement/effort to subvert and erase the idea of gender roles. The conflict being 'if being a boy doesn't mean liking sports or war or anything, that is if there is nothing you can definitively say about the personalities of boys or girls, what would be the point in identifying as either one of them?' Put another way, I heard you say that one becomes a woman (opposed to hypothetical woman) when an older female relative advises one to watch what they eat. This example is hilariously pointing towards filling an embarrassing gender role. So without gender roles to fill, how does one show society what gender they are? I don't know, hopefully that's clear."

Also, I didn't like your 'just use the word 'they' and simply get used to it' argument. The amount of time you spent on the use of 'he' and 'she', you could have squeezed a little more time to give 'they' a better explanation.   I'll probably never have to say 'they' to someone in real life, since the only person that I've heard wants that is a particular Youtuber I sometimes watch. But just me imagining the use of the plural word in a singular sense, makes my mind go into knots. It also seems like 'they' is impersonal; not so much as 'it' is, but still has more distance to it than 'he' or 'she'."

"Thank you! Just... there is so much I can say, but it would boil down to. Thank you. I think the only thing I could contribute to, personally, would be the struggle of nonbinary pronouns. Many languages are starting to adapt nonbinary pronouns, and are creating new definitions and meanings (shocker, changing words!). For instance the lantinx, cicanx, etc. movement, which goes beyond the goals of nonbinary pronouns in Spanish and represents a breakdown of the traditional understanding of gender roles as simply la y el (she and he). There is much more to it, and while some see the movement as solely a deconstruction, many see it as a step towards greater linguistic variety in understanding ones identity.  However, I still get into debates with English linguists who believe more in prescriptive language. But we must recognize the etymology, the change in language, and the fact that language boils down to expression... feelings and society. Essentially: rules are a lie because they are simply connoted by societal trends.  I ramble, but I hope someone will read this and respond. I only briefly spoke and I know others can contribute more than me."
"A fact that blew my mind several years back: Anyone you meet can be trans. Anyone. Doesn't matter how they look or even what pronouns they use with you.    As a nonbinary person who constantly 'gets clocked' this is somewhat reassuring, actually. I could meet a trans person every day and not even know it. The odds are very very low but still. I work in retail forty hours a week. I see all sorts.    But the actual point of 'anyone you meet can be trans' is actually that because you don't know everyone's fucking life story or what gender struggles they're dealing with or have dealt with, it's incredibly important to use inclusive language, to not assume pronouns, and to default to the use of singular they. Not something I'm always able to achieve (just try living in the American South, work retail, and not call a seventy year old white woman 'ma'am'), but something everyone should keep in mind as they interact with the public. Also, using inclusive gender-neutral language eliminates that awful scenario of singling out the obvious trans person by asking 'what pronouns do you use?' Ick.    Anyways. Thanks for addressing the nonbinary elephant in the room ContraPoints, keep on rocking!"

"Part II gave me the inexorable urge to drive a kart down Rainbow Road."
"Halfway through the video -- I may edit this if you wind up saying the same thing -- I just wanted to point out that there's a bit of futility in arguing with Shapiro and most of his buddies: they all seem to be paid to hold their opinions. So no matter what their personal opinions are (they could be the same as the ones they espouse, they may be different) the ethics of these individuals is bought and paid for and they will say and believe whatever the money tells them to say and believe. So, in that oddly friendly exchange he has with Blaire, it doesn't matter if she had changed his mind or gotten through to him: his job is to retain the same opinion and the spew it out as loudly and aggressively as possible.  That said, what's great about the counter videos like this one and those made by others is that they show the inconsistencies and flaws in such opinions. And _hopefully_ they can make their way around to people who would otherwise fall for the BS that Shapiro and his buddies peddle, and those people will have a chance to _think_ and hopefully see the lies and disingenuousness for what it is.  ....  Despite being a cis-male, I feel like I share your view on a lot of this topic (but hey, maybe I'm wrong). First of all, English is a trainwreck of a language and most days it's a miracle we are able to communicate with one another at all, and it's a shame that most of us Americans are stuck with it because we don't have the time, means, or perhaps the interest to learn other more capable languages. Like Welsh. Anyway, this pronoun thing is a mess with zero elegant or practical solutions -- at least as it stands right now, culture at large will likely find some simpler solution eventually. I _want_ to be able to effortlessly use the right pronouns, I hate coming across as a jerk or hurting people's feelings for no reason, but in some cases the expectation of the desired pronoun versus what any reasonable person's natural guess at the right pronoun would be can be a bit impractical. To the point where the person needs to wear a sign explaining the acceptable pronouns or start every interaction (including the one at the convenience store or at the bank or in the drive through) by telling the person what pronoun is acceptable. And that seems like a great way to piss some people off (most people working behind a counter learn to hate social interactions) -- I personally try to keep social interactions to a minimum with strangers because they at times seem so quick to volatility and I'm not even making them jump through language hoops.  People are not psychic, so unless you look like the pronoun you want, there's a better than fair chance you won't get it from people you haven't already trained. And not because those people are jerks. That's just what's going to happen -- please don't get angry. It's like that sort of mind-trick game where you have words like Orange, Yellow, Blue, but they're written in a different color from what they say. And you have to say the color _without_ saying the written word. It's doable, but it's genuinely a challenge and some people are worse at it than others. Some of us will try. Others, like a faithful Shapiro viewer, will refuse to try rather than risk failure and look stupid as they fear they are. And some just hate anything that's different, of course.  When it comes to 'regular' trans people who have progressed enough to look/act like the preferred gender (even if not perfect), I think it can be easy to choose the right pronoun without even thinking about -- you have the visual cues to clue you in. But when you get into the more niche elements like gender fluid and non-binary is when I think you reach the point of people just being unrealistic and perhaps a bit too self-absorbed. I kind of think of them as the hipsters of gender -- and hipsters aren't often very likeable. Maybe I'm way off base there -- in a number instances I probably am and these are super nice people and I'm a huge jerk for even thinking otherwise."

"I actually kind of feel sorry for Shapiro's daughter. I was raised in a really weird way by my stereotypical militaristic, misogynist dad. When I acted girly (I am a cis woman) he would often patronize me (or just outright abuse me) but when I acted more masculine in order to please him (because that's what I do. I just want to be liked by everyone all the time.) his initial reaction would be approval until it hit him that I was still biologically female and then he accused me of being a lesbian (more than once). The point is, I guess, dads who are vehemently gender normative or who have veiled, misogynistic attitudes (like my dad) really are hell to live with. No matter what you do, you're still a just bitch. Needless to say, we don't speak anymore."

"'That's not quite the same as saying that a trans woman is a 'she' in the objective sense.'   It's true that trans women aren't 'she' in the objective sense. Neither are cis women. There is no such thing as an 'objective sense' when it comes to language, because language is subjective by its very nature. That is, it does not exist outside human perception; we determine how words function. There is no such thing as inherent 'she'-ness that makes the word appropriate for one person and not another. Come on, Ben, this is linguistics 101!"
"I feel like every time I watch Natalie's videos I'm put onto some new wavelengths. Like stuff finally starts to click."

"As always she has such such an interesting take and everything is super well made! Also, I have some input on what it means to live a non-binary life that I‚Äôd like to share as well.   I am a non-binary person who wants to medically transition, and to hopefully one day look as androgynous as possible, and I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs a lot of similarity between the situations of binary and non-binary trans people. Just like Natalie is transitioning to better look and feel the part if being a woman and because of gender dysphoria, transitioning and having a relatively androgynous gender expression makes me feel more at home in my body as well. It‚Äôs not the same between all of us, but my experience *natalie voice* AS A NON-BINARY PERSON hasn‚Äôt been only a displeasure with the gender roles I was assigned with my birth sex or a sense of wanting to stray away from them, nor was it entirely based on simply ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù like I was different. It has been driven by gender dysphoria, but conversely, MY dysphoria stems from longing for certain physical characteristics in a body that don‚Äôt naturally occur or exist, which I think is also why some non-binary people push so hard for others to always ask for pronouns rather than assume them, and why they encourage others to stray away from traditional gender expression. It‚Äôs a lot easier to be seen socially as non-binary than physically as non-binary. Any little gendered distinction relative to your looks that someone can assume about you will cause them to gender you however they see fit, but if you ask them to use different pronouns, it‚Äôs effectively asking them to see you a different way, and one that they might not have considered. And for a lot of us who can‚Äôt, so to speak, pass as a ‚Äúthey,‚Äù it‚Äôs easier to shift focus more to social transition‚Äîusing the correct name and pronouns‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs is a big helper in alleviating gender dysphoria when medical transition is unwanted or proves to unhelpful at alleviating it. Also, at least for me, since people do often judge you and treat you differently depending on whether they perceive you as a man or a woman, wanting to be seen as non-binary would theoretically eliminate this differential treatment, and if I feel people perceive me and act different towards me because they see me as a man or a woman, or call me by gendered pronouns and thereby make the assumption that I‚Äôm a man or a woman, and because of this assume that there‚Äôs a certain way they should see or treat me because of that, this can trigger dysphoria as well.   That of course is all just my input and true only to my life, but I hope it helps give a little more insight as to what it‚Äôs like to live as non-binary person!   (Also the whole ‚Äúassimilating‚Äù into female culture thing at 29:27 had me laughing so fucking hard üòÇ)"

"Hi Miss Points! I really love how artistic your videos are and appreciate your honesty towards political quandaries and arguments. I agree with you on almost every point you make. However, the futch scale is actually a joke made up by lesbians. Futch is not something a lot of us take seriously. You cannot be both femme and butch. As a femme lesbian who is engaged to a butch lesbian, the roles have a lot more to them than just masculine and feminine. The terms actually come from working class lesbians in the 40s, and were less about trying to mimic a heterosexual relationship and more to help blend in with society. You cannot be futch. You can be neither butch nor femme, seeing as not every lesbian needs to be. You can even be very feminine and not be femme,  or very masculine and not be butch. Futch was a joke that was taken too far and is used inaccurately. But also, trans men and women have had their history and terms misrepresented by the gay community for years within the LGBT community - so I am not mad. Simply educating. Stay sexy babe! <3"

"I don‚Äôt get the hype around singular they. I use it all the time when I‚Äôm talking about something someone could do because their gender (even limiting yourself to the traditional male female binary) is undetermined.  i.e. ‚ÄúWhy the hell would they do that? They could just do this instead.‚Äù  Plus every time I write something up for work, I use the royal ‚Äúwe‚Äù to mean ‚ÄúI‚Äù (in accordance with custom in my field, not arrogantly)  Charlatans, the lot of these antifems"

"It's not as though people choose their fans though. What if i made a ton of videos with clips from this video and capitalized words like destroys. Would people be in the right to use that as arguments against you ?"
"Could you please retire the old TV from your videos? The flickering hurts my eyes."
"Can we have a video explaining gender and nonbinary? I don't understand it at all. I guess due to me always having gender and sex as the same terms. I still cannot understand nonbinary and how do one realize that they are such.  What if you want to address them formally like ma'am and sir? I really want to understand them too."

"Jordan Peterson never plainly said you'd go to jail for misgendering someone. Rather that you can get fined for doing so, which if you then refuse to pay will land you in jail. So of course the number will be 0 since everyone will pay the fine. He was making the point that anything that gets put into law is subject to government force."
"Ayyyyy shoutout to the futch scale!!!"
"Thank you for standing for Brazil in the end s2"
"Did I hallucinate the flashing of the Golden One's picture :D? I think it's really important how you stress much comes down to  politeness, which would be my case regarding the make-up artist, for instance. I'd use him out of education, though I don't perceive nor feel that person as being a man, whereas I'd refer to as a she because I totally perceive and feel you as a woman. I'd apply the same rule to non-binary people, though some of them seem stuck in a stereotypical vision regarding gender. Anyway,  it's worth noticing how that croaking voiced guy claims to be civil and then disrespects other people because 'biology'."

"Hi, non-binary individual right here! The simplest and easiest way to explain to anyone who is interested how i 'feel' non-binary is this: I grew up being treated as a gender i didn't like. I in fact hated most things about it, from changing rooms to my name and pronouns. So when i changed those things and presented as the other binary gender, things were better, but not perfect. It still felt strange to me hearing people say the other pronouns and treating me completely entirely as that other. It felt like i traded one side of the coin for the other, and the grass wasn't all that much greener. I also felt i was doing a disservice to parts of my personality i wasn't expressing - the more... androgynous feel/aesthetic/whatever. Also, being pro gender-neutrality suits my more politicized beliefs on gender, rejecting this arbitrary divider that effectively treats people differently based on circumstances beyond their control, rather than treating everyone as a fucking human being. Anyway, now i have 'come out' as non-binary i feel so much more relaxed in knowing that, yes i might need to explain that way more than just 'trans' to people in general, but i also know that I'm not ignoring any facet of my personality publicly. That's what it means to be one's authentic self.  tl;dr Neither male nor female really suited me. Now i wrap myself in a flag comprising stripes of black, white, purple and yellow."

"FASCISTAS N√ÉO PASSAR√ÉO"
"Bill C16 goes against making anything a 'free speech zone'.  It does the opposite. And to those thinking 'Bill C16 hasn't done anything bad.'  1.) Peterson almost got fired from his job from voicing opposition to Bill C16.  On multiple fronts.  He has tenure, but it wouldn't have mattered.  The ultimate job safety net in the world wouldn't have mattered for VOICING YOUR OPINION on a matter. 2.) A trans lawyer in Canada issued a communication to millions of union workers in BC less than a month after bill C16 passed noting how it's illegal to call someone not by their respective pronoun.   3.) The entire Lindsey Shepard affair in Canada happened because Bill C 16 passed.  Even though they misunderstood the bill entirely.  That was the premise they pulled Shepard aside on. 4.) 'Law hasn't been enforced so why are people worrying?'  Apparently you learned nothing from the NSA, Patriot Act, the Dodd Frank wall street act and countless laws that are never a problem, until they are.   You don't make an enforceable law UNLESS it's going to be enforced.  People saying this have been absolutely asleep for the past 20 years. 5.) The law WON'T be enforced. - It's ONLY because of Peterson and the popularity that arose from the topic that it isn't.  Remember that lawyer from before?  They are VERY eager to use that law.  But they don't want a public outcry for a conviction.  Which is what they'd get right now.  Again largely thanks to Jordan Peterson.  Just because Ghandi existed and won, doesn't mean the English empire in India wasn't harmful. 6.) You can't go to jail for it - What happens when you don't pay your fine?  Or you can't?  That's right.  You go to jail."
"So many people immediately turn to the ‚Äúhow can i explain this to my children‚Äù red herring, as though their children came out of the womb with knowledge of all of the critical-theory-related nuances in modern ‚Äúwestern‚Äù society and telling them anything different from what they know will break them. Kids don‚Äôt care about learning things from a different perspective, because the information they gleaned from whatever perspective they learned from first hasn‚Äôt had much time to cement. And if you‚Äôve already raised your kids to think that information should not be questioned and that societal rules are concrete and without exception, you‚Äôre pretty bad at explaining things to kids to begin with."

"You set the bar so fucking high for content creators on YouTube, not just left-leaning political creators, not just political creators, but all channels can find some inspiration in at least one aspect of your videos.

"Singular 'they', the problem there is that the singular/plural distinction conveys useful information in ordinary speech. Gendered pronouns seldom do and often get in the way, especially when writing for an audience of both sexes or discussing actions by someone of unknown sex. Anytime gender actually matters in ordinary usage it is obvious from the context. The singular they thus defeats a useful element of the language to preserve a burdensome one.   The right answer is to start using he and she interchangeably and it has to be the queer community that leads the way, that does the work, because they're the ones who care and who stand to benefit. You want change? You've got to foot the bill; you can't bully or shame me into doing it.   I think what trans people really want when they try to change the language is not so much effective communication or social harmony but validation. That's why all their proposals are so clumsy. They want us bending over backwards for them to show that we care."
"Why did I get a PragerU ad?"

"10/10-filthy ConserCunt destroyed"
"Taking the video as a whole I remain unconvinced about conscious awareness to use preferred pronouns. It is a lie, we use pronouns generally to represent a biological reality, so if I happen upon a stranger that looks a lot like a girl but really has a dick, they will likely be called she. Why? Simply because it's a biological reality that women have feminine features, and I notice their feminine features right off the bat, it's all the information I have about the person, so even then you still base your use of the pronoun on biological reality. If I know someone is trans then I know the biological reality of their sex and thus will call them their true pronoun (yes I'm aware of the point that biological pronouns aren't a thing but they still exist to describe biological realities). To be aware of a trans person's biological sex and still refer to their chosen pronouns is to lie."

"Hey contra! Just wanted to jump in and say I love ur funky headpiece, together with the purple lightning it gives off a bit of Ursula vibes, it's great!"
"So... What do you think are the reasons to psychologically identify as trans? Like, this is all very interesting to talk about the recognition of one's presentation, but the desire for such recognition must surely come from an initial psychological identification, that the feminine expressions you take joy in are signifiers of something more innate. It just seems to me that you are a woman in a sense more deep than cultural, that from a biological standpoint the distinction between trans and cis people is ultimately a social construct, that expression and identity are inherently distinct."
"i love you"
"Natalie, I love you and you make me want to be more queer, smarter, and braver. Thank you so much for sharing with us. Also, you are absolutely a FIRST RATE Queen!"
"Having seen the objections your last video got, I actually agree with the... 'discomfort poisoned' worldview(??) that you present at 18:32 and 22:37 and I absolutely don't mean that as a pejorative. I *love* that it is a product of certain anxieties you (and many transpeople) have about the structural contingency of gender. It is difficult to get that message across at the best of times, and I think you did a great job."
"Also, relevant personal tidbit, after the recent decriminalization of homosexuality in my country (India), I was in drag for the first time last week and I had so much fun!!!"

"Had to pause the video to say : I FUCKING LOVE YOU SO MUCH OKAY? THE EFFORT YOU PUT INTO YOUR VIDEOS IS NO JOKE. I appreciate how it's organized so well, it flows so smoothly. On top of that, it's aesthetically pleasing and your makeup skills keep getting better. Whenever you upload, I get SO happy because I KNOW I will be entertained and learn alot.

"You're one of my favorite people on the web and also on of my favorite youtube channels. Your videos are always fantastic. Also watching your videos somehow helped me realize I'm bisexual so thanks for that too."
"Very insightful and thoughtful as always! I have a couple stories I'd like to share related to ways people can be misgendered in a professional context and why it sucks so much for the person experiencing it, but most of the details of those stories are confidential and not mine to tell. Instead, I'll share some of my takeaways from those situations, especially so that anyone cis (like me) who hasn't had these things happen to them can learn and understand some of the ways we need to do better.   -If you're designing a webform with a drop-down menu that has options such as 'Mr.' and 'Ms.' please also include 'Mx.' as an option. Many nonbinary people prefer this neutral form of address. -If you're designing a database that stores employee information including a) information about employees that gets displayed to their coworkers as well as b) information that has to match with the employee's legal name, please include an option to have a display name that is different from the employee's legal name so that employees do not have to share their legal name with their coworkers if they don't want to. Getting a legal name change can be complicated and take time or just not be possible for a variety of reasons. -If you work in HR or management and you encounter an issue where an employee is being misgendered and/or called by the wrong name due to outdated systems that don't take trans/nonbinary people into account, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consult the person who is directly affected and find out what solution they prefer. Let them know what the issue is and any possible ways you are aware of to address it, and bring your compassion, empathy, and humility to this discussion. (And of course confidentiality!!) Do not assume you know best, do not assume that a system change is not going to impact them that much, and definitely do not make changes to their personal information on your own without even so much as notifying them. Changing someone's personal information such as name or pronouns in employee records without letting them know will come across as extremely rude and possibly also threatening, whether or not that is how you intend your action.    For anyone who has been in similar situations to the ones these points are based on, I'm sorry you had to experience that, and if you have additional or different suggestions on how to be more respectful and inclusive in situations like these, I'd be grateful if you could let me know - I am definitely still learning."
"Even if 'sex' were defined by karyotype, that would actually create problems.  No one I know has had their genome sequenced to identify their sex chromosomes, so I would not be able to use any gendered pronouns for anyone.  Even doctors present at one's birth don't determine sex by karyotype most of the time.  They examine genitals, and the genitals are both ambiguous in rare cases (.05% of the population) and not always 100% in keeping the internal reproductive organs in other cases.  Here again, though, I myself have not examined the genitals of many of my friends, nor seen the records of their birth.    Clearly when I use pronouns I am basing my determinations on my observations and presuppositions about the outward appearance and behaviors of males and females, contextualized by what I have seen and supposed living in my own culture. That's ultimately subjective.    Since my subjective opinions are not preferenced over those of others (and since I myself would generally not want to be misgendered in a conversation), why would I not extend people the courtesy of using the pronoun they would select.  Even if I still entertained the belief (which I did when I was young) that what I mean by 'male' or 'female' is solely determined by one's sex chromosomes or based on genitalia at birth, the person I am addressing would have better information than I do about those matter.  In fact, though, I never placed any weight on the chromosomes or doctors' observations...I used those (seemingly objective) facts as a way to rationalize why my subjective determination of gender was 'really' correct despite others telling me that I was wrong with respect to transgendered people."
"Never forget that Sargon of Akkad got shit from his wife for mocking the Trans Community in his videos, but then would flirt with transwomen through private messages."
"Yep, it's not so much appearance that communicates gender, its mannerisms, vibe, the way you speak, the way you carry yourself basically. I think it also has to do with gaydar as well. I 'clock' some people as gay because certain mannerisms and their 'vibe' gives it away.  If a trans woman doesn't pass well, I 'clock' her physically as a biological male, but I also 'clock' her vibe, and so it connects that she is a she and not a he.  As with NB people.. well I think theirs is a more political struggle. The struggle to abolish traditional gender roles. So be they."

"Some doubtful claims here. This idea that pronouns can‚Äôt be biological, because pronouns predate the discovery of the karyotype, is silly. Language aspires to describe reality, and people have had access to their sex organs for a long time. We can agree on different conventions‚Äîhe or she could be any word. But what they describe remains the same. Maybe Shapiro ‚Äúmisgenders‚Äù people to uphold traditional values. But there is also liberal merit to being honest about this. Do you really think it‚Äôs fair to women that Caitlyn Jenner can declare himself a woman, become the prize of society, and upheld as an exemplar for women to follow? Isn‚Äôt it rich that a lifelong male gets to be treated as a better woman than most women? I know this won‚Äôt be everyone‚Äôs experience, but it‚Äôs par for the course when we decide to use language to facilitate the erosion of biological realities."
"Ben Shapiro should not be someone who needs to be debunked or fact checked in any way, but unfortunately has a large following. I don't know whether or not his fans get off to him speaking quickly in that obnoxious nasilily voice while not actually saying anything of substance. Personally I won't judge them for that...out loud."
"I don't find the historical usage of pronouns convincing because also back then you'd refer to someone with a vagina a girl and someone with a penis as a boy, you couldn't cleanly get rid of or replace those, nor could you pump them full of hormones to cause them to appear the different sex, so in a way, yes, him and her still refers to a biological reality."

"I think it might finally be time to unsubscribe from PewDiePie...  Also, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô6‚Äù, incidentally..."
"Came for the topic, stayed for the looks she served!!!"
"Wait a minute. You didn't disprove any of the traditional usage for 'he' and 'she'. The biology of the 20th century is supplemental evidence that solidifies traditional usage of pronouns since forever. Those pronouns were used to describe people based on their sexual organs. Furthermore, I think your rationale of political goals for use of language is a non-starter simply because it all by guarantees half the population won't agree to it."
"I tried to stay with it and focus on the details, but by the end of this I just wanted to eat Natalie's hair.  Just flown from the UK to New Zealand and haven't slept in two days so in a strange place mentally. The intro gave me a bad jolt. I got into it when she started hammering shit gibbon Shapiro though. He truly is a toxic little turd. Intellectual dark web my arse."

"You‚Äôre so important. Thank you for existing."
"Awesome as always. A big problem I have with guys like Shapiro is I believe they are completely aware of what they're doing. He knows that subjectivity is a thing. He knows that social issues can be complex. He only makes a fuss about all that where queer folks are concerned. He's not waiting for enlightenment or even seeking debate. He's employing a strategy. That's it. He has political goals that he serves by minimizing queer people. Money,fame,sexy coeds also included. He knows that if he presents himself as a serious man in a suit with a short haircut,he gets a bunch of free credibility that  our glorious circus will spend most engagements trying to overcome. It's conscious and tactical. You don't convince a man like that. You can't. The only swaying notion would be that these methods don't achieve his goals. But they do. The money is in his pocket. The appearances are booked. The co-ed's number is in his phone. You don't treat him like a philosopher, because he isn't one. Philosophy is not his ambition,any more then some meth dealer. Success is the ambition. If trans was popular with the masses and marketable, that's the side he'd be on. You defeat a man like that on the field. You do it by reminding him that he's a mercenary facing crusaders. You bust the con. Mercenaries quit the field when it cost too much. You extract a toll. When he looks into your eyes,he needs to remember that he's a coward. He needs to remember that he did it all because it was easy.  So you make it hard."
"Your approach to what makes something what it is reminds me of Marx's materialist anti-essentialism, which when applied to economics looks like this: 'A chair with four legs and a velvet cover represents a throne in certain situations; but this chair, a thing that is there for people to sit upon, is not a throne by the nature of its use value. The most essential factor of the labour process is the worker himself, and in the ancient production process this worker was a slave. It does not follow from this that the worker is by nature a slave (although Aristotle is not very far removed from holding this opinion), any more than it follows that spindles and cotton are by their nature capital because they are at present consumed in the labour process by wage labourers. The stupidity of this procedure, whereby a definite social relation of production, which is expressed in things, is taken as the material and natural quality of these things, strikes us forcibly when we open the nearest textbook of political economy, and read on the very first page that the elements of the production process, reduced to their most general form, are land, capital and labour.'"
"The distinction between descriptive and prescriptive language was a critical revelation for me. Before I knew the qualifiers 'descriptive' and 'prescriptive' though, I was able to observe how it seems descriptive language is the evolution of language itself and prescriptive language is typically playing catch-up by adding new words to the dictionary after they've been integrated into society.  Amazing work as usual! <3"
"If Ben Shapiro were to make a similar video, he would be making a victim claim for both himself and Natalie. He'd be the victim because he's in a society 'demanding' that he slightly adjust pronouns for a tiny number of people, whereas Natalie is 'playing' a victim as a 'man' trying to force others to warp societal expectations of gender. But that's Republican ideology 101. Always play the victim while attacking everyone else for being actual (although they claim you're not) victims."

I also enjoy contra points and do not agree 100% with either, because A: who does agree with every single thing someone else thinks and B: I'm a person, not a copy, so fight me.  My take on this issue, allbeit shallow, is that I look at how someone present themself and use pronouns accordingly. If there is some kind of uncertainty just go by their name to pick. If I am corrected I'll use the other. I Will however never use play pretend words for wolf-super-dragon-sparkly-vampire-kin-people, because I don't care if you howl at the moon Jimmie, you are a grown ass human and should be at your soul crushing desk job filing papers so quit your shit and grow up."

"Cool. So basically if we could all just embrace a person centred approach and treat people with a little more respect, then we could find new ways to accept others on account of their own self validation, instead of screaming at them because their idea of who they are doesn't fit with our idea of who we think they should be. Then we could trigger a post modernist gender revolution and all the videos on YouTube would be hypnotically beautiful and thought provoking and not at all smelly in a Jordan p way (coffee breath and mildew?) Then we would all be free to be ourselves truly without the need for apology or explanation as men, women or shit gibbons, without people feeling intimidated or fearing attack\ murder from said shit gibbons. I am totally in for this if it be the case, not least because it would possibly fool some folk into thinking the rapture was imminent and that would be adorable, especially if they make signs and get really excited; recreationally speaking. This sounds so much more fun than where we are now. I'm not trans, just bi, but these videos are educational  to me in a way that entertains me and gives me hope for the future.

"'My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity, as far as I'm concerned if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet - they are fully trans. I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience isn't entirely a product of how they identify.'   I really feel that. I /identify/ as a trans non-binary person, and I do really like the use of they/them pronouns, but I usually just tell people 'she/they' because realistically I know I still present feminine, wear makeup sometimes, and have a higher voice.  Luckily if I don't wear makeup I have a face that leaves it a little easier for people not to immediately read me as a ~lady~ but really, no matter how androgynous I try to be I essentially do still live life 'as a woman' medically and socially speaking. Even If I tried to drop all gendered traits I'm still chubby and have large hips and breasts and no amount of camouflaging that will change my body without extreme measures."

"It's funny how transphobic people will use the argument that because trans people can change their identity or de- transition back to being cis-gender, this discredits them as being delusional or undecided which to them means that it's not a 'real' identity... What is the minimum required time one has to be self-identified as something to become legitimate? Hmm maybe being a cis-gender for all your life means nothing in comparison to the void so does that mean this identity is unreal? In an absolute sense yes since he is no more (also you can argue than no-one actually is in this sense but I don't want to go into 'spiritual' or ontological territory) But in a relative sense the identity is true since we make the rules of language and what things mean for practical reasons."

"A friend who was questioning their gender asked me once how I know I'm a woman. 'Uhhhhhhhhhh....' Because I'm cis, but I don't like being shoved into certain roles even though I'm naturally an empathetic and caring person in a way that's expected of me as a woman. But I also like being strong enough to open my own pickle jars, fix my own furniture, wear clothing both sundresses and large jackets. So I like the aesthetic and freedom of being slightly manly, but I am comfortable being seen as female and I think I would be uncomfortable being seen as male. But I could not tell you why that is or if, should I magically wake up in a 'male' body, I wouldn't get used to it. Really the only thing that marks me as cis is a lack of dysphoria or discomfort in being seen as female. I just wanna be seen as a woman who can kick her own doors in, thanks. (Working on that, I'm about as strong as a wet blanket.)  This is as far as I can tell, basically what being cis is like. You just don't question it. So if you're questioning for more than a minute or two and it's stuck in your head, you're probably not cis?"

"1) You are way too hard on yourself.  You are gorgeous, super talented, and woman as hell.  2) I tend to be uncomfortable with the idea of genderfluid identities because it seems to be tying preference and choice into gender identity, which I remember as being kind of a big deal with those super conservatives who like to think they can 'convert' gay people.    What's your take on this?  Does the idea of periodically and voluntarily switching your identity run contrary to the idea that being gay or trans is not a choice?  Would such an insinuation be harmful to LGBTQ efforts?"

"As someone who went through a ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù phase by binge-watching anti-sjws and had my views moved to the moderate area (from growing up in a very liberal family) by Shapiro and crew, I really have to thank Contra for helping to inject some sanity and clarity back into my political views. I can say with certainty that if your goal is reaching and changing the views of moderates who were gullible and swept up by the anti-sjw wave that took over the internet, you‚Äôre doing a fantastic job!"
"love this video Contra. Just one thing that is scary to me - I live in Poland, speak Polish on a daily basis. As you know (because you are smart af) Polish is highly gendered. I had a chance to meet non-binary person and it was pretty hard to use gender neutral pronounce because even when we talk about things that dont have gender perse (like a lamp or death) the word we use is gendered. So gender neutral language is never used and it's incredible unnatural. And Polish is hard as it is. So my non-binary friend was addressing thyself (?) in gender neutral term but I was constantly shifting toward female pronounce, simply because they looked like a woman and had womans name. So English speakers have it easy, you only need to change one word. Other languages (including Polish) are almost impossible to get right. (or maybe Im an ignorant piece of shit, who knows)"
"My older sister recently came out to my family (excluding me because she came out to me years before because we both share similar progressive political views and because we're extremely close) and with our family being southerners and more conservative, they still call her by he pronouns and her previous name. My question is, how do I convince my family members to at least call her by she pronouns? This video seems to give good points and all, but how do I use those in a way that my stupid hick family can understand?  Btw I always love the lighting in your videos, you're probably the most aesthetic Youtuber I know üíñ"

"I would like to say that while I still use pronouns that correspond with my assigned sex at birth and live my life as such, when I, like Ms. Wynn, look into myself and ask myself what I identify as, I find entropy and degradation in its purest form. And, given that this is the free speech zone, I would also like to add that I firmly intend to instruct your mother on the proper way to suck on eggs, (we both have some experience sucking on things)."

"'She in the objective sense' omggggg Bennnnnn what are you talking about"
"I'm kind of puzzled by trans or nonbinary people who are overly concerned about being referred to as the correct pronoun he, she, them,  etc. That usually happens outside of the trans or nonbinary person's presence anyway. What should it matter to them (plural) if they're referred to as he, she, they (singular) when they're not present? They (plural) can make their preferences known during conversation, but they can't force everyone to refer to them as he, she, them, etc outside of their presence.  Also in the English language sentences like 'how are they today?' don't make sense when talking directly to anybody, trans, nonbinary or cis."
"This wig snatched me."

I rly dont feel like typing it all out but heres https://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943#/b2 a very nice very clean article, w references from actual, real biologists, genetists and endocrinologists, not conservative edge lords."
"I tap dat shit!"
"Wow that adoption analogy made me cream my jeans"
"So using someone's pronouns is not only being polite, but it also helps them be their gender. I never thought about it like that. Though there aren't a lot of situations where you use someone's pronouns when talking to them, only when talking to other people about them."
"Hmm, so if I were born a man, but had female chromosomes, by Benny boy's 'definition,' I would be a woman?"
"I think something that helps adjusting to 'they' pronouns is shifting how one thinks about those pronouns. 'They/them' can be thought of as not necessarily plural, but rather as nonspecific, both in terms of gender and number. This is how I've *always* used 'they/them'--something my English professors despise, but, even without speaking of nonbinary identities, there are some people, like me, who habitually use they/them when being nonspecific about groups and individuals. I believe this is enough evidence to say that the meaning of those words has definitely shifted with time. Besides, what other words am I meant to use if I don't know the gender of my subject? Am I meant to start calling people 'it?' That has a rather disrespectful and dehumanizing connotation, in my opinion."

"I've probably left this comment but my life is strangers calling me,' mis' and me spending 15seconds wondering if I'm wearing a shirt cause *how do they know* but also I'm not going to transition so I accept that's how I'm going to be gendered. Then I go down a rabbit hole of am I trans? I would be the guy who wears this romper, right? which ends with GENDER IS A LIE. At the end of the day, I'm me, and if I seem well adjusted it's probably because I live in a liberal city that lets me have the hair cut that makes me feel like me etc and I don't think work worry about 'passing'- if you work to make others comfortable with something as small as pronouns they can focus on other aspects of selfactualization which makes society better as a whole."

"I don't see why people have so much difficulty with the singular 'they'.  Pluralizing a pronoun is used to denote respect, including the royal 'we', when a monarch refers to their individual self as when Victoria famously declared 'We are not amused.'  In fact, pluralizing the second person became the default, and nobody uses the singular second person pronoun 'thou' anymore, since the middle class started becoming wealthier than the gentry, and demanded to be addressed with the plural form 'you'.  Pluralization to denote respect is still practiced in languages that do employ singular second person, by politely addressing people as 'vous' or 'usted', for example, until permission is given to use the singular.  The singular gender-free pronoun 'it' is used to describe inanimate objects and animals.  If you want to denote the respect due to a fellow human being, pluralizing it into 'they' isn't much of a stretch considering the English language has had plenty of practice."

Just letting you know, the 'futch' scale is not like....a real thing. it was a joke and meme perpetuated by lesbians among themselves, and eventually became so widespread that people took it seriously. There's no binary scale that lesbians have to fall under in terms of their presentation, theres femme and butch and if you dont identify with either of those labels then thats fine! (im bringing this up because im a young lesbian, and early on i thought that i HAD to fall under the futch scale in order to be a valid lesbian even though i didnt feel femme, butch, OR 'futch'. love the video, just commenting so other young lesbians dont go thru the same identity crisis that i did!)  all in all, futch and the futch scale is just a fun silly meme for swords and cartoons and not an actual term or scale of presentation"

"Politically incorrect legend ContraPoints destroys Ben Shapiro with facts and logic."
"One thing id add, in the drag community there has been a fair bit of discussion on what a person who identifies as a female outside of drag should be called; I personally prefer 'hyper queen' because it removes any emphasis on genitals or chromosome patterns, I see it was 'if you Id as a woman or femme when you're not in drag, you're a hyper queen' its mainly grown as a label in the drag community as some cis gay men don't see female queens as 'Real queens' and there's been instances of their oppourtunities being reduced because of this. Virgin atlantic in the UK was hiring a queen for an ad but dropped her when they found out she was a woman out of drag too. So like I'd group Peppermint and mself in the same group of 'Hyper queens' but like only if she wanted that label, again completly up to her and how she would identify. There's been some NB queens who Id as that, some cis femme queens who don't. but as a drag community where I'm in there's been an effort to reduce the use of the term bio queen and encourage anyone of any gender identity to try and interact with drag. Its seen as almost 'above' gender to some people. <3"

Sometimes some of the more... creative non-binary pronouns and an insistence upon asking people for their preferred pronouns upfront just seems to border on ignoring the whole point of having pronouns in the first place, however.   Generally I just assume where possible, and use singular they when I can't. If the assumption is wrong, I've got no problem changing the pronoun I use if informed to politely. Whatever makes someone feel they have the same opportunity to be as miserable and dysfunctional as the rest of us."
"So basically, Ben is that asshole that runs a news site that runs stories about adoptive kids but continually says 'adopted child' every time. Ok so I'm a cis man but I know my wind instruments. How is the trombone butchier than the tuba and baritone?"

"Once again excellent video!"
"The thing about the singular they being grammatically incorrect, we already have the singular you.    In French you have singular tu and plural vous, with vous also being the singular for those above you in status (I suppose it fits in with le nous royale)  In German you have the singular du and plural ihr, with Sie (which also serves as the singular third person for females and plural third person which in English would be they) serving as the singular for those above you in status (I guess Austria-Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire were femocracies!)  In English, the singular second person used to be thou, with you being the plural second person and the singular for those above you in status (due to us having the royal we)  So when it comes to acceptance of the singular they, English already have form.  We've already accepted the singular you to the point of completely replacing thou and someimes find it confusing to know when to use tu or vous, du or Sie."

"Despite not enjoying all the gags, skits, and cutaways I really enjoy this channel for its enlightening criticisms of debates, debators, and debating tactics. I really learn a lot and am thankful for it.  On the topic of the video would like to say I will address someone by how they present in all applicable cases, barring which I would ask them. My disclaimer is this though, I do not think there should be legal ramifications for mis-gendering someone. It should be up to the people in society to stand up for and shame those who are mean or rude to people, not the government. tl;dr I call it as I see it and correct myself if my eyeballs see red when it is blue, and that isn't any of the government's concern."

I still have a few problems with it, because it seems your need to express your personal experience is getting in the way of you understanding others', but it seems like you're trying, and I appreciate that."

"Using the wrong pronoun with a trans person will give you the same reaction as wearing non-Philly colors to a Philly sports bar. You better be a masochist with excellent health insurance.  And you know how the loudest homophobes are always in the closet? I have a theory that the loudest transphobes are so deep in the closet that they're finding all the Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa, and Eid presents they always wanted but their parents never got them. If they're not trans themselves, they're attracted to such people. A lot of these assholes secretly want to bang a trans person but are afraid to admit it because they're afraid it'll make them gay. It fucking doesn't! That's not how gender and sexuality work! Let's say you do get off to the idea of snu-snu with a trans person. If so, GOOD FOR YOU! There's plenty of dating sites and apps out there for you to use! Fuck, there's an entire genre of porn about it! Whatever gets your rocks off!  I'm a straight cis guy and personally don't know any trans folk. If I've ever met any, I wouldn't know unless they told me. If you ask me if I'd date a trans girl, I'd say 'Yes'. Why not? I don't care if a girl's cis or trans, it's no skin off my back. Hell, I'd personally date a trans girl even if it was just to piss off transphobes. Come to think of it, I always thought Laverne 'Dr. Frank N. Furter' Cox was hot. Ditto our Queen; brains and beauty? YES, PLEASE!"
"omfg the subliminal golden one flashes I'M GONE!!"
"God I love you mademoiselle! Even a cis gay man like me gets so much out of your videos on gender. Like, for instance, the fact I'm not actually a cis gay man but more accurately, a futch cocksucking faggot who uses he/him with heterosexuals and he or she with other gays! As far as I know you've never touched on how sexuality can effect gender/identity/expression, but you've gotten me to think in ways that allows me to connect the dots for myself. And I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart. Also FUCK I loved that look for the second segment! Fuck queen slay!"

"I do not wanna be mean but is that make-up supposed to look good?"
"Guys, gals and non-binary pals, please stand for the burning of the national flag!"
"My concern with pronouns is the same as Peterson's. I am opposed to required speech. I am opposed to the idea that me refusing to call you what you want could be considered hate speech. And at least some trans-activist does think that. See Nicholas Matte https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kasiov0ytEc&feature=youtu.be&t=1730"
"Wow, a Shaun video AND a ContraPoints video within 2 days?! So much for No Nut November..."
"As you said, I do think nonbinary ppl are looking for more change than you are, but I don't think as a group we're really unified on what that is. The fact that I'm interested in politically challenging and socially upending the existing gender binary (read: hierarchy) is only part of the truth. When I get misgendered or meet someone fundamentally at odds with my gender presentation, it can be comforting to think of my nonbinaryness as a political choice, and of gender as something I choose how to perform, because that makes it feel like I have control over the situation and makes me feel like I have some of the power. But I don't think it's purely choice or purely presentation or else I could choose to stop using they/them, something I can't imagine myself doing of my own volition. And because when someone disparages my gender presentation it feels like they're disparaging me; the two remain linked even when it might be comforting to separate them."
"I adore you"
"This is the best video you have made so far. You're awesome!"
"fun fact: i started realizing i was a trans guy after people kept accidentally using he/him pronouns due to the fact i mainly wore baggy pants and hoodies during my younger edgier teen phase"
"Just saw Ben Shapiro on Pewdiepie. What are the chances?"
"Your point about nonbinary people trying to create a society where we fit was totally accurate. My trans friend Andy (miss you, buddy) was binary but always asked people's pronouns anyway, and I loved that about him. No matter how 'cis' or 'passing' someone may have appeared. He spoke a lot in our area on gender and pronouns and trans issues, and he actively worked toward creating that kind of society a lot of nonbinary people would love to live in, where asking for someone's pronouns is as natural as asking their name or age or job, and where whatever answer you give, regardless of how 'made up' it seems or if it seems discordant with your gender presentation, that answer will be respected and used.   Thank you for respecting NB people. It is honestly so frustrating how few binary trans people seem to do so. You are really amazing!"

"biology is fake anyway.  Cause, you can be a XY woman if the testosterone that's supposed to trigger your development into a 'male' fetus never occurs, thus you have a phenotype of a girl,  though I think those people are intersex, and then you also have XX men, and then you get into the whole XXY and other chromosome abnormalities that occur during gestation, and the intersex spectrum . Determining someone's sex by their chromosomes is stupid af because of other conditions that exist.  Trans people are just as valid as others who don't fit into the gender norms."
"More incels and facists content, please and less transplaining. It only ever backfires."
"It's strange I've watched you for a long time and I feel like even before you expressed openly that you were trans I always saw you as a woman kind of automatically - maybe call it female intuition (lol jk that's a load of garbage probably) or perhaps that you have emodied what a woman is to me long before any hormones or treatments etc. Love the video as usual things just keep getting better and better on this channel!"

Nobody practically identifies a person's pronoun by their DNA, not even Snake Oil Shapiro. The man is a charlatan and should not be taken seriously by anybody.  Sorry I'll finish the video now, I just couldn't believe that was how he was claiming he assigned pronouns (though I haven't see Ben's DNA results, maybe I should assume she?)..."
"Has anyone ever asked Ben Shapiro what he'd call a person with only on X chromosome and no Y chromosome? Someone with two Y chromosomes? Someone with any other kind of deviation of X or Y chromosomes that aren't exactly tattooed to their forehead? Or does he make DNA tests of every single person before deciding on a pronoun for them?"

"I'm right along with you on just about every aspect of this video and the nuances of pronoun use, and the view of how NB people can be at cross purposes to ***THE TRANS AGENDA***. I was asked my pronouns by a trans woman who maybe clocked me, and like... I felt weird that I had to clarify that for her, when I put effort into my appearance specifically so that people *don't* question my gender when they see me.  But at the same time, I do have mad respect for the people who reject any predetermined boxes and forage out on their own, finding a unique gender expression that is uniquely them."

"I waited through every day in October to experience my first ContraPoints video publication (new subscriber) and it did not disappoint. I went back through many of the existing videos and I have to say that, though they were good, this channel has traversed an incredible distance in terms of production quality and content since it began. I think I will try to use these to get some of my more conservative friends and family members to understand the essential points of the mainstream culture war, especially as it relates to trans identity (which is something a lot of people I'm around don't seem to understand yet)."
"Natalie you are so uber talented. A true gem of our trans community."
"Second half of this video reminds me of a story my partner told me about when she went to a restaurant and the waitress  used pronouns depending on how she was sitting/body language.

"So, agender fella here (they/them). For me, there was a lightbulb moment when talking to a cisgender female co-worker, during a conversation on gender identity, where she said 'oh my GOD, if I woke up with a guy's body I would literally kill myself' and my response was 'huh. I wouldn't.' From there, I kinda recognized that I don't feel at all attached or connected to the gender I was assigned at birth, and would rather be a sentient cloud of mist than a person with a body and a gender. Vi Hart's video 'On Gender' also helped--Vi's general outlook is similar to mine, though I choose to claim a label where they don't.  I don't 'get' how people feel like a man or a woman, honestly. It's outside my experience. But it's something I can respect, for sure, pronouns and all."
"I'm perfectly fine with using the singular 'they'. It has entered my standard vocabulary. Where I'm unsure is when people demand to be called by other pronouns like 'ze' or 'hir'. Maybe someone who does or knows more can clear up for me if there is a difference between all of these pronouns or if it's just personal preference.  I've also learned of someone who is genderfluid and prefers people to use their name instead of any pronouns. That gets quite complicated grammatically in the language that person and I share, and it's not always practical - like in the preceding sentence; I wouldn't want to use anyone's name online without their permission, and I think in this case the sentence would have been harder to understand."
"I honestly had started feeling like I couldn't relate to any youtuber anymore. The ones on the left were starting to claim ridiculous and baseless things while the (self-proclaimed) rational skeptics often started being less rational and more hostile towards minorities and the left. I'm really glad to have found your channel because it's just as entertaining and funny as it's informative, balanced, rational and fair. Always waiting for a new upload! Keep up the great work :)"

"Also, here's my hot take on enbies (I'm nonbinary myself.) Assuming you can agree with the idea that there's inborn brain features which cement people's gender identity as 'male' or 'female', then transgender people are examples of a sort of intersex condition: female brain + male body, or vice versa. (I know not everyone agrees with the concept of 'brain gender' and it can be P R O B L E M A T I C when used to explain, say, why there aren't more female doctors. But I digress.)"
""
"But one's physical sex isn't always clearly male/female either. Multiple intersex conditions exist where the internal/external genitals are sexually ambiguous. In my opinion, enbies might be explained as people whose *brain gender* is similarly ambiguous. Basically, male or female body + intersexed brain gender."

My thinking was that they made up such a small percentage of the population that issues facing them weren't that important in the grand scheme of things.

"I do like JBP (except for his Jesus Smuggling) and the Intellectual Dark Web, and even some of Shapiro's messages. I completely agree with JBP that *legally* compelled speech is something we should fight against.  That being said, I am now completely sold about the social utility of gender pronouns. That and of course, the always good reason of 'not being a dick'. I mean, I never would've called any person by any pronoun other than his/her preferred one, but now it feels internally consistent too, so it isn't me just 'being nice', which is great.  Not sure anyone could've explained it better than you, Natalie! And to think I thought the Aesthetic was enlightening. :)  That being said, not as sold on 'they' as a non-binary pronoun. (Well, neither are you.) It is not socially useful, definitely not prescriptive, and other languages are not relevant as this is English. So basically, the other reasons all fail, and the only reason left is 'not being a dick'. Again, good enough for me, but not 100% internally consistent which is a shame. Perhaps a 'third gender pronoun' would be a good idea - but as it grows in popularity,  I expect be used with binary trans people as well. So, not so sure about it."

"Ben Shapiro talks about facts like he has them :/"
"Actually, talking about Ben's deep insecurity about himself and his need to combat that by being a evil little twat, it kind of reminds me of this guy I sort of dated briefly.  I usually go by 'Zane', but this guy I was dating refused to call me Zane. I didn't even notice at first but when I did I asked him why.  Basically he didn't want to call me Zane because 'that's a man's name and people might think I'm dating a man'. He was so insecure in who he was, that he needed other people to define him, so the  idea that someone, for one second, might think he wasn't straight, was enough for him to freak out.  That's what I see when I look at creeps like Ben. He rejects the idea that trans women are women, because it's too complicated, and he desperately needs the world to be defined by these rigid, simple rules, because that's what he's always used to define himself, without them he is only left with himself and he has no idea who that is."

A lot of woman who are new lesbians are trying to figure how expression fits into their sexuality, so the futch scale caught on.

Basically, butch and femme is not a spectrum as the that scale assumes"

"Ok I'm cis which has its limitations, but I have a very 'fake it 'til you make it' atittude when it comes to pronouns and recognizing someone's gender more intuitively. Whatever gender someone says they are, I've found that rather than focusing on *me* and trying to make it sense to *me,* the cis person who is not at any risk or trouble here, (i.e. the thing I used to do back in my transphobic days)it works better to just take it on faith that a person is what they say they are, and then treat people as if they were that gender. Eventually, after enough work, my brain catches up, sort of readjusts to it, and the person just seems like their gender to me. And the next person I meet it's easier with because of that adjustment. (Admittedly, though, this is only with binary trans person, as I've yet to meet anyone identifying as non-binary offline, so I don't know if it would be as effective a strategy there.) I feel like it's only fair that cis people put in some of the work to readjust how we see gender so that it's easier for trans people to, well, *be* their gender."
"**points...** n-no. No no no. Ive seen this flip flopping on the significance of *The Dictionary* and it's definitions down to minute detail and argued viciously to prove a point and then turn around and insist that it's *_NOT_* ' The Bible' of definition even though political arguments about specific words, meanings, and interpretations are used as a sort of bedrock of he resprctivd argument and often taken as seriously those who argue religipus scruptures and spend their whole lives researching it.  I declare the Dictionary and its use as a reference ok can only be just that  and not as a source to be vindicated as the need arises because your sudden strict adherence to it would debunk or weaken one side of the argument.  The dictionary is just that. Its the 1's and 0's.   The interpretations and applications on part of the user and not to be misconstrued. The lines are thick. Dark. And EASY to see.   Neither side should drag the dictionary into the argument.   The book of definitions doesn't care about shit and shouldn't be used as a giant hesko barrier for us to change sides and chase eachother around on"

When I say ‚Äúthey were mad at me for being late‚Äù everyone would assume I mean a group of people were mad at me. Is this problem the end of the world, no obviously. But I really think we just need a new pronoun for gender queer or non-conforming. As the word they is so necessary to describe groups without having to rattle off all the names each time you reference them. Also as a selling point for my case they is frequently used to mark out groups. So it‚Äôs really not the best choose for a group seeking more inclusion in society. Lets just make a new pronoun."

BASICALLY when i saw the title of this video i instantly knew it was going to impact me a lot and i got even more than i needed, so thank you for that"

"All that recourse to nature to prove terminology as fixed is in consequence denying yourself the right to have any opinion on any issue whatsoever. Those MUH CHROMOSOMES ideologues have a very weird aversion to concepts and terminology as, well, concepts beyond extremely reductive essentialism. No ideas shall exist outside of the ideas nature itself is conveying. Now someone who doesn't just swallow political propaganda but takes at least a few minutes to use their brain would notice something very basic: Nature doesn't have ideas. Nature doesn't use concepts or terminology. It just is, and any description of it happens entirely in abstract form. It's literally impossible to formulate a concrete description. I mean, you could believe that ideas literally exist in nature and the things in nature are shaped after ideas taken straight from the realm of ideas which is somehow more real than this one. Jordan Peterson seems to believe this, fitting his understanding of philosophy that never goes beyond manifesto level, and while I wouldn't want to deny a person their right to free speech for believing this logic suggests they should just stop that MUH SCIENCE bullshit. Somehow THEIR feelings start to matter more than anything in the world when the facts (or the theory of facts) contradict them."

"Yea, I'm a mess too, Natalie. I'm mostly biologically male, but appear very androgynous. Even my voice is somewhere in between most of the time. So people call me he, they call me she, they avoid pronouns cause they are terrified of being wrong. They avoid me in general because they are afraid of having to call me by a pronoun. The only cure to this is facial hair, but then people just call me he, and I'm not really that, now am I? I don't know what to do. Situations don't happen easily where you can casually just say 'Yea.. I'm nonbinary btw' without seeming like you call attention to yourself, and then the conversation is only focused on that. 'What does it mean?', 'Are you a hermaphrodite?' Man, it's hard. I think I'm just gonna get more androgynous clothes and do my makeup more pronounced. That'll show them. Heh..."

"It feels good to see someone talk about this topic in this way. It's annoyed me for so long how people constantly act like discussions on language are discussions on science, just so they can act like their opinion on how pronouns should be used is objectively ans scientifically correct. It annoys me how people never seem to call them out on this nonsense rhetoric even though it's so obviously nonsense.  Also it's amazing that Ben admitted that there are two roles with parents, giving birth and actually raising a child. It's almost like the same can be said for sex and gender... Yet I guess for some unexplained reason it's objectively wrong for pronouns to refer to gender and not sex"

"My mother tongue is french. It is really hard to be gender neutral in french. Every single noun has a gender. A chair and a table are female. An owl, a carpet and jewlery are male. It is a a fundamental part of our grammar. A lot of words are gendered according to the subject they are tied to. If you study french, you will often hear 'accord√© en genre et en nombre' (accorded in gender and number). When someting doesn't have a specific gender, it is usually accorded in the masculine form. For example, a group of mixed male and female things are always considered as male. If you have a group of people and only one of them is male, the whole group will be presented in the male form. According to our grammar rules, gender neutral people should be grammatically treated as male. Do you think it is a problem or do you think there is no problem since the gender neutral form of french is male?   Je suis francophone. Si vous pouvez lire ceci, vous savez d√©j√† que le genre masculin est utilis√© automatiquement √† moins d'indication contraire dans notre grammaire. C'est ce que nous avons de plus proche d'une forme 'neutre'. Qu'en pensez-vous? Trouvez-vous que le binarisme du fran√ßais est un probl√®me? Comment y rem√©dieriez-vous?

"Dear Contrapoints,  While you've already pretty much delineated that gender pronouns are not actually assigned to specific genotypes and the terms were in use far before sex chromosomes were discovered, I wanted to expand further on the fluidity of genotypes as someone who has studied epigenetics.  First let's start with the assertion that all Males have a XY chromosome and all women have XX chromosomes. In humans being male is usually determined by the presence of a Y chromosome. All of the genes required for maleness are actually already present on the autosomal chromosomes (or non-sex chromosomes) but it is the Y chromosome that contains the switch which triggers a cascade of processes for the development of male characteristics. However, it is possible for a phenotypically male people to be born with XXY or 'two X' chromosomes in what is termed  Klinefelter syndrome [1]. This person has double XX chromosomes which would normally be considered female, but also has a Y chromosome which would normally be considered male.  It is also possible for a 'women' to be born with XY chromosomes. Here is a link to a photo of Eden Atwood [http://montanakids.com/cool_stories/Famous_Montanans/atwood.htm]. You may notice that Ms Atwood is a very attractive women. Ms Atwood was also born with the male genotype of XY chromosomes but is phenotypically female as she was born with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. This means that while her body produces the male hormones as a consequence of the presence of the Y chromosome her body and cells do not respond to the hormone itself, making it's presence moot and developing as female. So this is a human who is genetically male but phenotypically is purely female via completely naturally occurring development pathways, as the development of secondary and primary sexual characteristics that we associate with maleness of femaleness is actually governed by the presence of hormones and not the genes themselves which may be thought of as the recipe book. So while Ms Atwood developed solely female characteristics she still technically possess undeveloped testis rather than ovaries. Usually women with this condition only actually learn they are genotypically male as an incidental finding where performing medical investigations for other conditions, or when trying to conceive.  When referring to gender fluidity there's also a curious biological case study worth looking at in a small remote village in the Dominican Republic.  5Œ±-Reductase deficiency (5-ARD) is a curious condition which is endemic to the village of Salinas in which genotypically male children are born which female characteristics and raised as such. At puberty (usually around the age of 12) however, the sudden rush of hormones typically causes the testis to descend and they develop male secondary sexual characteristics such as body hair and deepening of the voice. These individuals are again sterile, and may also suffer sexual dysfunction due to underdeveloped male reproductive organs [2].  [1] https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/klinefelter [2] https://www.sciencealert.com/remote-town-in-the-dominican-republic-some-girls-turn-into-boys  The point I'm trying to make here is that even biologically human physiology and gender is not as binary as people usually think.

"I love the way you say 'AS A TRANS WOMAN' in that scathing, mocking tone of voice. I'm always somewhat embarrassed to use this phrase or any variation of that phrase when talking about queer issues because it just seems so cheesy and I know that right wingers mock us for it.  I remember when Blaire White was telling that Bearing guy, 'I'm not like the other trans girls! I don't begin every sentence with 'AS A TRANS WOMAN!' Please like me! I just want to be liked!'  Every time I begin a sentence with 'as a queer person', I always cringe and think 'Oh, god, they're not going to take me seriously if I say this, but I have no other way of phrasing this sentence.'"

"As much as I am a fan of you I have always refered to you as a he. I can see how different contexts make different usages more appropriate. But I tend to try to keep my word usages as consistent as possible therefore I try to see the world is a scientific perspective consistently.For example I don't use 'theory' to mean hypothesis as most people do when outside of a scientific context. I am not a very social person (Asperger's, hello). So I have/do make the distinction between a parent and an adoptive parent, the only time I refer to the adoptive dad as 'dad' is after I have already used 'adoptive dad' to establish the topic of conversation. I don't think basing definitions on social conventions is particularly useful because of how amorphous they are. What will end up happening is the new word for females will be eggers, or vagina havers or XX havers, and men will be spermers, or dick havers, or XY havers. And we shouldn't need such blatant descriptions of men and women/male and female when those words do the job just fine now.   'no such thing as biological pronouns, this is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people' OR there is no such thing as gender and gender is a thing invented in the last decade to describe people of one sex behaves like the other. If gender is how you act out your sex then there are scientists who study the structure of the brain and are able to predict what behaviors associated with sex will be exhibited. What I find ironic about your mission to dissolve biological prescriptive definition of gender is that the very identity you have formed relies on it. When you say transwoman you are evoking the vagina having/XX chromosomal manner of behaving suggesting your brain is more similar to theirs in structure. Which while possible (although I doubt it, your thoughts are far too formal and organized. I'd bet money that you have the grey to white matter ratio typical of a man. Perhaps even more ironically, I prefer women who exhibit behaviors atypical of their sex, about a 5 on the scale.) is still reliant on the behavior/brain structure of XXers.  Otherwise womanhood is just a set of behaviors with no particular theme.    To me it seems more rude and insensitive to expect people to conform to your delusion. If I were a trans person. I wouldn't guilt someone into calling me by my preferred gender. They have their own way of using pronouns it would be more my duty to convey the traits necessary to meet each person's quota. I try to have as objective quota as possible, such that after assessing someone's masculinity to femininity ratio I can best guess their sex which is how I use pronouns. If you were to ask me to address you as female then to me that is asking me to assume all people who have a female to male ratio equal to or higher than yours as female. But if I used that metric now I am calling cross dressers she and I think that would cause more problems than it solves. But as you become more and more feminine there will probably be a day when it would make more sense to call you 'her' but it probably won't be on a day when you accessorize like a drag queen.    I think it would certainly be better if pronouns were neutral by default then we could add suffixes to it to indicate a particular trait of the person we want to refer to. I think if that were the case we would very rarely add the suffix for masculine or feminine unless it were in a context for dating because it just wouldn't be relevant. Imagine if this were the case and people insisted you add the suffix for masculine or feminine for them, to me that would cause concern about how much of their identity is related to such a trivial part of ourselves. Only people like the golden one and most trans people would fixate on such things. That would be the only thing that would worry me about a trans persons mental qualifications to do anything is how fixated they are on something that shouldn't really matter. Same reason why I'd be concerned if someone's skin color was just as important to their identity. Not that I am one to judge a persons mental aptitude (Asperger's, depression, maybe hypersomnia)   If I had a kid I wouldn't tell them how to use pronouns but I'd ask them why they are using them the way they are and examine how consistently they stick to that usage."

"shoutout to Turkish not having grammatical gender at all"
"Hey, you, in a free speech zone. I come from a country where three languages are used interchangeably, and in each of them every object  comes with one of three genders (from pencils (fem.), tables (m.), and workbooks (fem.)  to coffee (m.), soda (fem.), and milk (neut).) and children automatically learn the majority of gendered words in the first five years. Because of this, despite the existence of many critical theory writers and activist groups, the pronounce hear are not the issue since gendering system is complex enough already and nobody expects people to subscribe to new rules. Thus, I don't have a dog in your weird Anglosaxon game.  From this perspective, I would tell you that in any of the languages positive arguments for referring to certain nouns in a proper gender just do not work. In all the languages, 'coffee' is male according to a dictionary yet everybody refers to it as to neutral-gendered. On another hand, it is academically correct to refer to children according to children's genders, yet in my part of the county people traditionally refer to them as neutral-gendered, even when teachers are correcting them at such.  What I am leading to is that there are some implicit rules of pronouns that go beyond simple free choice and are cognitively framed. In these regards, a debate between users of pronounces and those who reject them are fundamentally similar that that between well-educated people who are irritated by a phrase 'its november now!' and try to correct it, and those who simply accept the poor grammar and perceive the argument primarily."

"I'm sorry, but I can't really stand by using she/her pronouns for cis male drag queens, and i certainly can't stand by 'you're not a woman until society treats you like one'. If the implication is that I'm less of a woman than trans women who can be more out or more visible...then okay, I can take that, I hear those voices all the time from myself. But the implication that my friends or my girlfriend are less of women than you? I really can't stand by that in the slightest. Those are literally tools that are used to invalidate trans women and deny us support, and it's very disappointing to see you pushing them.  I'm sorry if this comes across as overly angry or aggressive. It's just very disheartening and frustrating to hear you talk about people i know and love in a way that seems to imply that they're not women. I don't think you get to judge who is or isn't a woman, and i don't think society gets to decide that either.   My girlfriend is a trans butch lesbian. There's a lot to say about how butches aren't seen as women in general, and I won't go into that, but i think it's sufficient to say that despite being very openly trans, she'll likely never be perceived as/interacted with as a woman by the vast majority of society. That doesn't make her any less of a woman.  I don't know. There's more I have to say but I don't know how to articulate it. I'm just disappointed."
"I'm an agender person who was born female, but I use they/them, and wear both suits and dresses. But people always get confused when I tell them I'm taking testosterone and having top surgery! There's this strange stereotype where someone who's nonbinary doesn't really take any part in physical transition, especially assigned male at birth people who take estrogen, etc. Why do I need to do this? Because I experience physical gender dysphoria as a lot of other binary-transitioning people do. I don't agree the the societal roles the binary has, but I personally don't recognize myself when my shape is feminine. I'll still wear eyeliner and dresses while I have a beard, because those certain things make me feel nice (pre-transition gender expectations aside). It's only when I have worn those feminine signifiers pre-transition that I felt uncomfortable, because it reinforced the cisgender assumptions that most people had on me. I'm on the opposite side of the coin from you, wherein you take pride in someone correctly assuming your pronouns, while I usually ask. I totally understand it- the first time someone naturally used they/them on me without me asking them to was an amazing feeling! I think you're right when you said that nonbinary people's goal is to reconstruct gender in American society. I guess for me personally it's just that a lot of the signifiers (makeup, suits, any gender-associated thing) have been used to place certain expectations (and wrong pronouns, of course) that I don't want to be associated with. I want to wear a dress- but I don't want that to give people the impression I'm meek. I want to be physically buff- but I don't want to give the impression that I won't try my best to find a calm, non-violent solution to things. For me, wearing a beard and eyeliner- colliding signifiers- together gives something closer to the impression I want to give: that how I choose to present and the roles of the things I wear are insignificant to me as an individual."

(Youtube recommended you after a Lindsay Ellis video.) It is so weird to describe, but, as deep and avant-garde you present your videos to be... you also lay everything out so.damn.well! You've really opened my eyes to horrible things I didn't even know were horrible. At first, I felt so ashamed of realizing there is this whole group of people I've never recognized and possibly offended. I almost started pulling away like people often do, but the presentation of your videos really keep me hooked and engaged with learning more.  I guess I just wanted to thank you, as cheesy as it sounds, for all the work and effort you've dumped into these long video essays. I know how rare it is to change someone's opinion on the internet... while I still have a long way to go, I gotta admit, you really have opened my eyes.  Also, like... did you make that hat?

"Ooo I love getting to talk about how i experience gender **AS A NONBINARY PERSON** and since nat said she wanted to be converted??  I was born Dfab but dissociated my entire childhood due to *events* and didn't really stop dissociating until I got top surgery, since my chest was really really triggering. I don't really identify as fully male or female, but I don't really feel like something in between, either. I've gone with just 'nonbinary' to avoid people trying to screech that I'm a special snowflake, but 'agender' seems to fit the most.    I will say that my body being physically masculine makes me feel very at home in my gross flesh vessel. I have been almost 2 years on testosterone, got a little baby boy beard goin, started lifting to get the man arm look.... It's wonderful. I never really minded my junk, but the physical changes from testosterone have been.... pretty affirming, tbh. I like having a little bit of both parts, and were I to get bottom surgery I would not get rid of anything I have. I would say tmi but we're watching contra vids, so.... lmfao Anyway.... clothing and hair wise, I prefer something feminine enough that people will sort of question what I am... My physical form and the way I adorn it usually sort of balance each other out, as the more masculine my body gets, the more femme my closet becomes. I describe my style as.... 'aggressively nonbinary' a lot of blue and pink, a lot of ugly hawaiian shirts, rompers, and girl shorts."

"WRT whether or not creating a society in which gender isn't assumed is a valid goal, I honestly think it is, and I really also think that it benefits more than nonbinary people. There are trans women and men who will never be able to pass at all for whatever reason--either they can't take hormones or get surgery due to health conditions, can't afford to transition, etc. and by assimilating to a paradigm in which you have to meet a certain level of maleness or femaleness in order to actually integrate into society as your chosen gender, you will always come out the loser. That being said, I think as a nb person sorting ourselves into binary categories instead of making room for new categories for people who don't fit the paradigm isn't entirely a realistic goal we can achieve in my lifetime, but goddamnit I'm gonna try anyway. And for me, the end goal is to be so confusing to cis people that they're not sure /what/ to call me--if I'm not going to be able to occupy the social role of a nb person, then I might as well use my presentation to throw the existing societal roles into question. Plus I mean, intersex people exist so a society in which there are only male and female roles is disingenuous anyway."
"Learning can be fun!! Calling a person the proper pronoun takes nothing away from me yet for others it seems to invalidate something for them so maybe they should do soul searching instead telling everyone to behave in a way that makes them comfortable."
"Have followed Shapiro since his Breitbart days. On a host of other issues he's just as obstinate. And, there's a component in his schtick were he obviously just likes to be cruel. Maybe that's wrong to say, accusatory. But how and when is he going to change his mind? Try never. But yes, we still must have this discussion because it informs viewers just how mean the Shaprios out there can be.    Ya know, there is the option to be civil and nice and use people's preferred pronouns. It's not like my friend Michael didn't ask me to please not use Mike when addressing him. It's just being nice. It's really not that hard."

"I think the part of this vid that struck me the most was (and I'm paraphrasing slightly) 'I don't want to just tolerate non-binary people, I want to convert and actually understand why I'm accepting them.' I've grown up around progressive folks so I'm pretty on top of trans stuff relative to the average cis white yada yada male, but me being that does present a challenge in terms of actually understanding what people are trying to get at. It seems so hard to find resources that explain what all this stuff actually _is_ that makes sense in my head, so I end up feeling that my 'support' or whatever for all the people that are trying to break new ground is kinda just superficial -- better than nothing, but still not up to the standards I'd like to uphold as someone for whom this kind of issue is really important."

There is no real way to talk about yourself without using gendered expressions though ... unless you default to using the male and therefore 'neutral' version of words.

"I know this isn't the same level. But I just had a moment where... I enjoy piercings, tattoo's and coloring my hair. I have a lot of piercings and color my hair a different color every other month. My tattoo's make me smile whenever I see them, and all together I just feel right. I love my body when I go to look in the mirror, I see my piercings, my tattoo's and the shock of color from my hair. And I am beautiful.    Outside in my conservative town, to my conservative parents... To my employer... I am something that is a cautious tale of what your daughter can become. I am not beautiful to them, I am questioned why I chose to hurt my body with these things. I'm not trans, but for a moment I kinda got it. I too am most happy when I feel the most beautiful, and right."

"Love you so much cause this is honestly the best pronouns video I've seen. Only thing that kinda bugged me is the 'futch' scale which is funny as a meme, but as a lesbian it's rather insensitive because truly only butch, femme, and neither are the historical lesbian descriptors. Like, everyone can do what they want it's not like I or any other lesbians will try and stop you (probably) but being a cis woman and calling yourself femme, or a gay man and calling yourself butch etc, is really insensitive to lesbians and our culture. And also being a lesbian and calling yourself 'futch' or 'soft butch' or 'butchy femme' really kind of defeats the purpose of the original descriptors. Just like gay men use twink or bear or whatever else, lesbians use butch femme or neither. Like idk I guess there's room for debate here but just to me the whole futch scale meme thing really wasn't great because it allowed ignorant people to use it seriously and call themselves something god awful like 'cis butchy femme woman' or 'stone butch bear' or whatever else I had to witness lmao, because these people that saw the meme don't understand the long history of what butch and femme as identifiers/descriptors mean to the lesbian community. Anyway, I fucking love you contra you're a babe and you've put a lot of the opinions I have into very fancy sounding videos. Hope you don't read this comment and think it's an attack cause it's not, I just wanted to inform you and others how some lesbians feel about the whole futch scale thing"

"29:26 was actually adorable"
"I really liked this video, but I do have one major complaint."
"So Ben Shapiro is obviously of the belief that   1. biologically, there are *males* with *XY* chromosomes and *females* with *XX chromosomes, and that this is the most important, fundamental aspect of biological sex.    and   2. 'He/him' pronouns are for males, 'she/her' pronouns are for females, using pronouns in alternate ways is basically *lying*   Natalie does a fantastic job of dismissing the second part of the argument, but it does seem pretty remiss to completely ignore the first part given how easy it is to *ahem* DESTROY with FACTS and LOGIC.   So focusing on the female sex, Ben Shapiro has the idea that XX chromosomes are the *root* cause of 'female-ness' in the human body, as far as sexual dimorphism is concerned. That is, *female* human beings look the way that they do because every cell in their body has XX sex chromosomes, therefore the body develops in a female way.   This is a completely incorrect view of sex, and we don't even need to look at transsexualism to prove it incorrect. Intersex people exist. Women with Swyer Syndrome have XY chromosomes. If Ben Shapiro's ideology on sex was *correct*, then these women would, logically speaking, be *male-bodied*, because of their XY chromosomes. But no, aside from a few condition-related anomalies, intersex women with Swyer Syndrome are *female-bodied*, in fact many have actually given birth. So is Ben Shapiro saying that there are women *who have given birth* that he would still refer to as he/him?   But this also extends to transgender people. I really love Theryn Meyer's take on the issue (not sure if she's done a video on this topic cause her old channel is gone, but she's brought it up multiple times while livestreaming). I'm paraphrasing from memory here, but basically Theryn's take is- and while I'm sure she also agrees with all of Natalie's points- Theryn's take is that she has transitioned to the point where she is no longer *male-bodied*. That is, that a huge part of sexual dimorphism is, despite Shapiro's claims, *hormonal* in nature- that hormones matter way more than sex chromosomes. Theryn has stated that while she may be *chromosomally* male, biologically speaking she is a 'MTF transsexual' (Some modern doctors use the newer term 'transgender female'), which is a unique biological category of its own. And that *because* transgender females will develop *female* visual sexual characteristics, and that trans-females who start HRT before male puberty will pretty much always be visually indistinguishable from natal females, (And of course even post-pubescent transitioners can achieve this, especially if they're able to access plastic surgery to reverse the effects of male puberty as much as possible, as Natalie plans to do). Therefore, the use of she/her pronouns for trans women is descriptive of an actual biological reality, the reality of being a transgender female, something that people can clearly see.    I wish Natalie would've brought this side up, because when we're talking about trying to 'convert' people, I think Theryn's argument is incredibly compelling and definitely should be utilize."

"Also, not really a contradiction, but I disagree that we all agree on the biology (not sure if this was referring to Ben Shapiro specifically or to the debate in general), but as a person who occasionally does trainings on gender and anti-sexism, alot of people are still operating on outdated scientific concepts on sex and gender, nor any of the history of Non-Western concepts of sex and gender. I am always reminded of the line from 'Guess who's coming to dinner': 'You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it's got to be.'"
"I completely adored this video. You probably won't remember my irrelevant Linguistics paper and related survey I sent you last year, but when I decided to compare the issue of inclusive language in Spanish (a gendered language, arbitrarily as all gendered languages are) and English, I stumbled upon the other great question regarding language: that is, whether language molds thought or viceversa (the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.)  Now, after discussing gendered languages, the relatively ease of English as regards gender neutrality, the made-up validity of 'he' as a universal pronoun (arising from the fact that cis men used to be the only ones with access to education, so why the fuck would you use any other pronoun rather than 'he'), and the actual validity of singular 'they' (which has been found in Chaucer and Shakespeare; of course, not to refer to non-binary people back then, but it still provides evidence of its grammatically) my *GRAND* conclusion was 'lol I dunno.'   Spanish proves harder to 'gender-neutralise', due to the fact that gender is a grammatical category, so it affects nouns, adjectives and determiners (thankfully not verbs.) Spanish lost the neutral gender that Latin originally had, so people go apeshit when confronted to words like 'todes' ('everybody') instead of the 'generic masculine' 'todos' or the (marked) feminine 'todas', as if by calling a group of mixed (cis) men and women 'todas' made the men magically lose their penises, or if it 'todes' was A CAPITAL SIN AGAINST LANGUAGE THAT THE ROYAL SPANISH ACADEMY (yeah, we have to deal with a fucking ancient prescriptivist, colonial organisation) SHOULD ERRADICATE. But ask any woke teenager and they simply don't give a fuck. Nowadays I hear teens talking about 'compa√±erEs' and 'amiguEs' (proposed generic neutral versions of 'classmates' and 'friends') without batting an eye. The speakers are the language, and not the other way round. Funnily enough the people who lose THEIR SHIT over the proposed -E marker don't seem to mind using neologisms or foreign words...  Anyway, I've overextended myself and my question was rather about  your thoughts on 'made-up' or 'new' pronouns, such as 'ze' and 'xe'. Personally, since pronouns belong to a closed class of words (alongside prepositions, determines and conjunctions) I find that it's harder to incorporate them into the language.  This video was amazing as usual, and I'm so happy I discovered you almost two years ago <3! I usually post your videos whenever possible in the right context. I'd like to see you tackle the rara avis that is libertariaism. I think you'd make a hilariously insightful video such as the one about Incels.  Much love from Argentina."

I‚Äôm using your work as a tool to help family members and friends (yes, I have some friends who aren‚Äôt as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù as they should be in 2018) get an idea of ‚Äúwhat it‚Äôs like‚Äù to be trans, to understand trans existence beyond the garbage memes and bio data that‚Äôs made them ignorant. You provide much needed nuance that is legitimately very educational, and the fact that you have a sense of humor in all this helps immensely. I‚Äôm not joking when I say that you are helping people who think like Shapiro actually understand why they don‚Äôt understand, and opening their minds; I‚Äôve seen it. I have loved your work for quite some time for a variety of reasons, but now, more than ever, I appreciate it immensely bc it‚Äôs legitimately important.

"You know, I was always (I say always but actually since maybe freshmen year of High School because I was born and live in Serbia so there was high chance of me staying an utter fucking bigot) open minded when it came to calling a trans person the pronoun for the gender they transitioned to or using whatever pronoun person would ask me to use, but I was never fully behind the idea of genderfluid, agender or non-binary people since I never fully understood it and try as I might, couldn't fully empathise because of it. Now I see more and more that I don't need to fully understand it to empathise. It's enough for me to imagine Jordan Peterson telling me I'm a *voice getting distorted* fucking Christian because I didn't kill or rape anyone *voice starting to distort to the point of growling* even though I'm a fucking atheist because I don't believe the bullshit that he, church or the bible are selling *voice reaching full distortion* and I don't fucking care what he thinks I am because it in fact is what I am and no matter how much he and his butt-buddy Ben say that 'facts don't care about your feelings', it's actually they who don't care about fucking facts. *voice goes back to normal* Sorry, don't know what that was. Anyways props, another great video Natalie and thank you for further opening my mind."
"Two points I wish you'd hit upon: 1) There's plenty of atypical X/Y karyotype combinations that are quite common (X, Y, XXY, XYY, etc) 2) There's a pretty decent percentage of cis people who have a karyotype that don't 'match' their gender.  Many cis women have XY chromosomes and never realize it, some smaller number of men have XX chromosomes and never realize it."

I don't give a shit what pronoun you call me (granted, I'm a cis male that doesn't play with gender like at all), but if it means a lot to you it's my job as a decent person to make you feel accepted and welcome. My general rule is this: Don't be a dick."

I think you may have glossed over Bill C-16's lasting effects and the short-term repercussions. It was always stated that the violators would not be sent to jail, but instead fined. Jordan Peterson had questioned what would happen if that fine was not paid and the lasting affect that compelled speech laws would have in Canadian legislation. Instead of seeing how many people went to jail (obviously none) a better statistic to prove the point Dr. Peterson was trying to make is how many reputations have been tarnished, how many jobs have been lost needlessly, etc. It's a slippery slope, and that's what he was warning about."

"People like Ben Shapiro don't really have a problem understanding these issues. For all their talk of being purely rational, the way they approach topics like this tells me, that they are just rationalizing their feelings about gender and sexuality. They come up with supposedly logical reasons for being *opposed* to something, that doesn't fit in with their world view and which really poses no threat to them.  That's not rational at all.  If you are new to a topic like Transgender (like me) and you want to *understand* it, you have to sit down and actually learn and listen. I won't lie - I'm still not 100% clear about everything regarding non-binary genders, transpeople etc. But I have no reason to join the conversation being confrontational and judgemental.  Women, who were born as biological men pose no threat to me. Nor do any other non-cis or non-binary people. On the contrary: since learning about them, I feel like the world seems a bit more interesting and colorful."

"fantastic work, as always, natalie. i think, regardless of our own genders or identities, getting in touch with them and learning more about how and why we see ourselves a certain way is always worthwhile. and for me, (along with a lot of other people) your work (and ash hardell's *shoutout to ash* ) is a significant part of that motivation for self-exploration. so thank you. i will say, though, 'butch' and 'femme', are, socially speaking, terms that can apply to any wlw, as they were created and implemented during a time when the word 'lesbian' meant 'a woman who has sex with other women'--not just 'women exclusively attracted to other women' as we know it today. linguistics and all that. as a cis woman who doesn't always feel particularly feminine, there are times when i've questioned whether or not i'm non-binary. because the standard of androgyny that the mainstream likes to push as 'the non-binary look' is how i'm sometimes perceived. but like you said, appearance alone isn't what makes someone a man, woman, or non-binary. it's that innate feeling, and sense of self. that 'feeling', is for any given person, a fact.  speaking of, it's funny how 'facts don't care about your feelings' only seems to apply when it comes to their goal of denying civil rights to marginalized people. literally everything these talking heads do is motivated by their 'feelings' that 'special snowflakes' deserve violence and disrespect. show them scientific or linguistic proof that the 'snowflakes' are valid and all of a sudden they disagree with the facts. hmm."

ContraPoints is now top of my list for immediate watching upon posting. It's intellectually stimulating, beautiful to watch, darkly entertaining, and engaging as a fellow 'weirdo'. As for this video; I like to hear what other people think about us ( I'm 29  and nonbinary) and I relate deeply with my trans sisters and brothers in many aspects of your discussion, as usual, well done.

"Oof got a trump ad before this where he was screeching something. My head hurts so I don‚Äôt even care"

"Ok now this is epic"
"The style guide that Ben describes is ridiculous. Unless he has magical chromosome detection abilities, he's still taking people at their word about their identity (ie: as being trans) but using the opposite binary pronoun. If he was actually committed to his bizarre hypothesis about chromosomes being the arbiter of gender, the scientific approach would be to refer to everyone as *gasp* THEY (or another non-binary pronoun) until he received proof of their karyotype. Even then, it's possible that the person's genetics don't neatly conform to his binary conception of gender. So, as a devotee of FACTS over feelings, he'd surely need adhust his hypothesis. If you drop a ball 100 times and 99 of those times it falls to the ground as exepcted but on one occasion it starts floating up into the sky, you couldn't just write that off and continue to believe in gravity without further investigation."
"This is deeply deeply interesting. As a trans-masculine non-binary person (who uses he/him pronouns exclusively and is almost always read as male) I personally really feel what you are saying about feminine and masculine vibes/energies  (although i wouldn't consider those an entirely different thing from 'passing' as being read as a certain gender can very much be influenced by your gait, timbre, mannerisms etc. as much as physical appearance).    On a giant fucking tangent I guess I personally have found that as much as male coded language is normally much more comfortable for me, I don't mind and even sometimes enjoy being referred to as she/her/'gurl'/whatever by fellow gay or queer men who are using it, not to denote being a woman, but more to denote queerness and/or femininity and feminine vibes."
"Ah fuck. I play clarinet and also would ideally fall in the realm of butchy femme to femme. I feel called out by that one meme."
"A person who wants to be referred to by they/them pronouns has to ask for that first, don't they?  Can they honestly expect to yell at someone for not recognizing what they identify as at first glance?  When you glance at someone, it is move obvious to quickly split people into two groups (male, female) based on their appearance.  I can't gaze into their soul and psychically know they think they are two things at once.  Okay, you can yell at me for that, just know, I think you are being unreasonable."

"language is a group effort, if the majority believes in something and uses language and functions around it, that thing is a legitimate to the fabric of society, no matter what the minority believes in or is rooted in. Language also has a delay to how it changes based according on this very phenomenon. In 10 years or less, i believe, people who refuse to use proper pronouns will be the overwhelming minority and will probably receive  backlash if used in public, kind of like how we respond to racists, homophobes, etc. now."

"So here is a question I have and I am wondering what your opinion is.  Can we just forgo the 40 or so pronouns and just use he/she/they?  I would gladly use he for male transsexuals and she for female transsexuals and if someone is non-binary, I could use they.  I'd rather just use someone's name instead of one of the new invented pronouns if they aren't comfortable with they."
"I call trans women 'she' and if I was a trans woman myself, I would insist on being called 'she', 'her', 'woman' etc.   To hell with grammar, it is just a matter of kindness and respect!  Nobody (with minimal knowledge in biology and logic) is saying that trans and cis woman are the same kind of human being. Obviously they are not (chromosomes, brain structure, past experience living as a man, an experience obviously 0% of cis women have etc.). This is a just a scientific fact with its pros and cons.  What I dislike is the myth, that it would be possible for a man to 'become a woman' - no that isn't possible! But a man can become a trans woman. This distinction seems important to avoid false hopes and expectations for people considering a transition.  Yet the 'delusion' of being like every other cis woman is probably healthy and helpful, once the trans woman has realized and accepted, that she can work towards this goal, but will never reach it - be it only in the eyes of others or on the display of a medical apparatus.   Although in the end above might not matter much at all, when finding a new way of life, a new balance, going a different and courageous path in life."
"I am a so called cis-male and all that, which is why I am following this channel, to broaden my perspectives (although I am quite conservative in most of my views). I remember when I, as an arrogant teenager, was poking fun of this gender identity wave which was at its peak when all of these figures of Blaire White, Milo Yianopoulous and Ben Shapiro were on their edgy peak, and one of my friends responded with the words 'don't you identify as a man?'. My response then was along the lines of 'I have no idea what that means, because I don't know how I would be different as a woman except that my habits and thus my views would have been moved by the biological processes that women are exposed to that men don't experience, but those men who identify as women have never experienced menstruation or female puberty either'. I am actually still confused, because I have no idea what it means to 'identify as X'. I don't think I identify as a man except for the fact that I apply the pronoun 'he' to myself. Other than that I have no idea what I would do different. Even on my most feminine days I am just a socially less masculine man, or a feminine man, not a woman. These videos dive deeper into the subject and are very interesting to me."

You really want to be right, but you are not. You've got some info, but not enough to make your claims valid.  You infer political motive where there is none. People in the center and right just want things defined correctly so that the words can be used precisely. If you, a trans woman are called woman, that is not enough distinction between you and real women to have utility.   It's not because people don't like you, it's because people want you to stop being ignorant and trying to mess up precision that has utility.  Words are not useful if they don't accurately describe things.   Prescriptive definitions are important so that we can have a stable and useful language that distinguishes one thing from another. Without that we end up with conflation and that causes a lot of problems. Especially when trying to describe humans. If we start changing the concept of midget to mean anyone that is under 6 feet tall, that would be a  giant problem. If we started calling any truck a semi, that would cause a lot of problems.  Distinction is important.  The marriage example is NOT what is going on here. Of course homosexual and heterosexual couples should have the same term for a union such as the word marriage. When you fuse any two things together you can call it a marriage. You marry components, chemicals, etc. together for instance."

"Does Ben Shapiro know that English isn't the only language in the world, and that some languages do have neutral gender pronouns or no gender pronouns at all? Does he think those societies therefore don't have chromosomes??"
"Okay, I am pretty  conservative on this one. Meaning that He/She/It/They is more then enough in my opinion. Although if someone wants to use made up pronouns [well  all words are made up but you know what I mean] they should be able to. Meaning that nobody should force another person to use pronouns they don't want to use to describe themselves or others. TL:DR I think what we have is enough, if you want to use other pronouns do it. Don't force anybody to say shit they don't want to.  We will see if she is able to convince me otherwise."

"If you sit a female bullfrog on top of a male bullfrog and dress the two in a Jacket, is it a he or a she or a them? Or is it just Ben Shapiro croaking? In my opinion the right way to go is to consistently misgender Mrs. Shapiro. How should I know if it's XX or XY? Do I look like her doctor? Maybe she just produces a lot of Testosterone??  I'm just joking, I'd never misgender on purpose. Because the feelings of other people matter to me."
"i wanna give a really sincere thank you for addressing the issues nonbinary and gender non-conforming people had with the last video, because it did kind of feel like we were thrown out in the cold. the clarification is definitely much appreciated!! and this video was a godsend (satansend?) once again."

"What's wrong with Jordan Peterson though. Seems like you're supporting the same position but you frame it in a way like he's, wrong or something I don't know. Great video though."
"Ben Shapiro's argument is just stupid. Does he expect every human on the planet to have their sex confirmed with genetic testing and then go through life wearing a giant MALE or FEMALE button on their chest so others know which pronouns to use? Because -- surprise -- that's what would be required to uphold his chromosomes = truth argument, because genetic abnormalities exist and sometimes people are born with genitalia that's ambiguous or doesn't match their genetic sex. No, of course he doesn't expect us to do this. He's been selecting pronouns for people based on their appearance his whole life (probably interacting with some trans people without knowing it), and the only time he calls this practice into question is when he's AWARE that he's interacting with a trans person. He should just call a spade a spade and admit that his bullshit argument is entirely driven by his discomfort with external gender ambiguity and non-binary gender roles. In fact, he likes the system of judging a book by its cover because it's that very system that provides him the cis-male privilege he's enjoyed his whole life. If he admits that gender is fluid and sex isn't always binary, suddenly his whole stupid world comes crashing down."

"The Queens of the desert are shaking."
"Ok... Stupid question probably but when does it comes in play the use of third person pronoun when talking with someone? In practice it never happened to me in the US (granted I refer to people with the gender they want when I'm talking ABOUT them, but I never need it happens when I talk WITH them).  This is different when I was in France or Italy, where the language itself has feminine and masculine adjective when referring to people (bello, bella, buono, buona, professore/professoressa, etc...).  Language is already pretty neutral in English. (Also as a foreigner I understand the problem with they, it's not just the pronoun, is the fact we tend to use the wrong conjunction of the verb, I would prefer something like xe, that maintains the structure of the third person singupar conjunction)"

"Glad to see you got laid finally contra, or at least your character did"
"I thought up some stupid comment, like 'hey Mlle. Points, when is your posthumous autobiography coming out, I need to make a plan for the rest of my life,' but seriously, I've really loved your content for a while now, and have struggled with the two competing urges to get really high on a weekday afternoon, draw the blinds and binge all your content in my underwear, and to recoil from things that poke the angry anal cyst that is my gender dysphoria that I need to anesthetize to focus on living the ultimate nihilsitic twink white male undergraduate neuroscience lifestyle.¬†  I know you're going to get an outpouring of good feedback, and rage, and rambling stories by similarly tragic repressed queer liberal cucktards like me, but I wanted to note that this video has particularly good timing, as I'm in a stressful moment in my life and after a few years of convincing myself I am long-term okay with inhabiting the mild-faggot 'bisexual male' aesthetic I tell my friends I am juuuust fine with, I feel like what has kept me pinned under my dysphoria are those often-unspoken social fears of what it means to be a trans woman, how I am perceived by people around me, by future relationship parters, employers, women!?¬† While carving into that hot chunk Benny Shapiro and taking a bite, you honestly, comedically, beautifully addressed the struggle with gender, pronouns, epistemology, being a faggot, and being a mess from an angle that I not only resonate with (and feel admittedly somewhat validated by), but one that I feel comfortable sharing with a variety of people around me and others that are supportive, but don't really understand.  You're beautiful, perhaps simultaneously what I am scared of becoming/terrified I can't become, and I hope this whole youtube tranny leftist venture you're running pays out BIG BILL$ from George Soros, because it's the business model I plan to steal sometime in the next few years. Thank you very much."

"hi! enby here! i see nonbinary-ness as. very complicated i mean i'm considered basically fluent in 'SJW MOGAI' language and such, but here's my view on this first: you asked, a good enby youtuber is thom avella. what a great fella. doesn't upload all that much but their videos are aight. second: my personal identity. i identify as nonbinary and genderfluid. i do feel a connection with the identity of a woman sometimes, it's rare. i hesitate saying i'm male, but it's more often i feel that way. for a while i felt like i was agender, but i didn't feel comfortable with that... i feel like i DO have a gender, just no word yet, so 'nonbinary' fits, i guess. the reason i identify this way is because i, in general, feel disconnected from everything. my own body, society, existence... and i feel so comfortable being considered this now, view on pronouns: i think pronouns are complicated. it can reflect identity, but you can, as you stated, use different pronouns than what you identify as. like he/him lesbians (lesbians who use he/him pronouns because they feel disconnected from womanhood) now: nonbinary in general? it's super varied. i've seen labels of agender or nonbinary used to also more express disconnect, as there are agender girls or nonbinary boys. how there's alignment to gender. it's either, again, expression of disconnect, or a connection to something else as well. like how one can be both man and woman, someone can be a man and some 'other gender' there's also something interesting. there are some nonbinary people who identify as 'political women', meaning they're still nonbinary, but 'politically identify' as women, since that is what they're recognized as to the world, and seek to fight for women's rights. gender's like, super complicated. and i make no sense. sorry. but hope you understand in some way"

"A rubber duck is not a duck. It is a rubber duck. To claim something without it's clarifier is to be calling it something else. It is YOU that does not understand language.  Regardless of how you dress yourself up or look, you are still your biology and you should be called what your biology is in public scenarios. In private scenarios such as between friends, call you a trex for all I care. In public though you need to refer to people as they are. You can go with trans woman if that is more preferable then being called man.   To be perfectly honest, I do not want any trans woman called a man because that detracts from what a man is in public contexts. It also makes it hard to ID the person in public. To call them a woman also puts them in a category that is unsuitable. I am sexually attracted to women, not trans women. So if you lump trans women into the woman category, that just doesn't work.  Language is important and you don't seem to be understanding it. So no, it is not Ben Shapiro that doesn't understand language, it would be you."
"Oh my god... amazing video!!!!! I loved this!"

"Good one lady!"
"You are a man. And you look like one"
"I really hate the use of 'they' as a singular (yes I know there is some historical use of it), but I grudgingly accept it because we don't have a better term that doesn't come with baggage. Honestly 'it' would be the best if we as a society didn't have a history of using that word to dehumanize people. I'm all for a new non-binary pronoun if we could agree on a single one. I envy languages that have well established gender neutral pronouns!"
"Honestly, you come across as a woman to me. I've watched your videos before and after your transition too. I still see you as a woman."
"YES THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED YESSSSSSSSSSSS NATALIE YESS I LOVE YOU"

"Well from a descriptive perspective, people clearly DO put an article before a pronoun, to obtain a certain meaning"
"I am non-binary and, shit, I don't get it either! I ask myself do I feel like a man or a woman and the answer is 'Nope, none of those'. I then ask myself 'What do I feel like?' and the answer is a blank void because I have absolutely no idea how to define my gender."

"Shapiro is just giving a perfect example of post-facto rationalisation. Step 1. He feels uncomfortable about trans people and getting pronouns wrong. Step 2. He comes up with some convoluted nonsense to justify his feelings. Step 3. He covers up the funny-tummy feeling by chanting ‚Äòfacts, facts, facts‚Äô."
"Dark Mother ContraPoints has uploaded again!"
"The first time I saw one of your videos i started doubting 'hey she isn't a cis woman????' after 10 minutes, from now on I will start googling the chromosomes of everyone to not make the same mistakes, thanks for the advice bennyboy"

"'The traditional female garb of my culture' XD hahahahahahaha"
"The whole 'she's biologically a man and therefore a he' arguement seems strange. How do know what her chromosomes look like? Are all English speakers going to have to test for and display their chromosome makeup? What if it's xyy? Are you going to refer to someone with Jacob's syndrome as something different than he? How would you know in a noninvasive way what pronouns to use if the only way to know which to use is biology?"
"Thanks for calling me, 'they.'  And also everything else you do."
"Strange... After seeing this video, I can't stop thinking about The Golden One."
"great video! one minor thing - non-binary isn't just an umbrella term. it can be the end of sentence when describing your gender. it's like the word queer, which can be both a label and a term for an entire community. I identify as a non-binary person, I'm not agender or grey gender, I just don't fit into the model of a gender binary."

Which I‚Äôve honestly been assuming for 35 ‚Äòish years; or the majority of my talking life.  So I‚Äôm trying to remember primarily; when comes to introducing and addressing someone; is to first remember to ask their preferred pronouns to use.  I know it‚Äôs not gonna happen overnight, but I think first for me, I  have to realize the issues I‚Äôm not doing the best at in life (for anything not just pronoun issue), before I or anyone can go about addressing steps to go to making it better."

"Ironically enough, the biology _does_ matter... just, not in the way that transphobic individuals want it to.   Relying on chromosomes to determine sex is a false dichotomy that ignores the vast array of chromosomal variety out there.

"Actually, we don't all agree on the biology. There are so many misconceptions about sex determination in humans it's ridiculous. 'A woman is only a woman is she has XX chromosomes'. Well, we're not chickens and in humans sex is not determined by chromosomes, but hormone levels. Hormone levels are of course to some extent determined by sex chromosomes, but there are too many exceptions to say that it's the XX that makes you a woman. And hormone levels are continuous, not binary (duh). Therefore biological sex (which also has a link to gender, because there is some biological basis to gender identity) falls on a spectrum. You can have a chicken that has 50% cells with male chromosomes and 50% cells with female chromosomes and half of it will be a hen with typical hen features and half of it will be a rooster with rooster features. That's possible because in chickens sex is determined only by chromosomes. If you however had 50% cells with XX and 50% cells with XY, you could be either a woman or a man, depending on your hormone levels, but you wouldn't even know that literally half of you has female chromosomes.  This is a huge oversimplification, but the point is, biological sex in humans is binary, which scientists have known for years. If you're using 'you're only a woman if you have XX chromosomes' as an argument, then you're a misinformed bigot."

"I don't know what else I would call you but she... I mean, it's just not worth the effort to misgender you when the only thing I'd accomplish is hurting your feelings.  So I think there's definitely something to be said about your interpretation of Shapiro's motivations.  He really does just seem irrationally dedicated to enforcing strict conservative gender roles (it doesn't really make sense to call them traditional since I'm not even sure what specific tradition we'd be talking about).  You've made the the best 'reals before feels' argument I've ever seen here though... Which I mean, isn't really terribly surprising.    Of course it's easy for me to accept this and accept you.  I was raised to be a pseudo hippy science nerd.  Even when I was religious I was always taught Jesus loves everyone, period.  So I'm not sure how much my admiration means in the greater cultural context.  You better believe I'm going to use the ideas you've presented in future discussion though."
"Why is Ben Sharpedo not part of the fish pok√©mon joke? Argh, you were this close to the best worst pun."
"I do believe gender dysphoria should be discussed more. But I also think it's ignorant to not respect someone. I've been studying business for awhile now and Canadians ( yes im a canadian) are protected under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Meaning sexually orientation, and gender are classes that are protected, and as Canadian's we must uphold this act. But this doesnt give minorities more opportunities/rights (as this is a equity issue). So when these protected class members demand more, it creates tension. And that's why Ben shines, because people protest him to scare him off. This just helps him even more. It hurts the liberal message because the left is not open for a discussion. I do agree this is a well develop video, and I think to when two brilliant minds clash. We can see which message is more academically correct. I do find that Ben is ignorant and this issue, but people cant change his mind since they don't come prepared/ they become ignorant themselves. As someone from a neutral-right leaning standpoint.  Good video."

"Really good video as always, your perspective is so eloquently put into words that it's hard to comment on it lmao, especially the REKING BEN SHAPIRO part, and the whole he/she 'dilemma'. The non-binary part of the video I find a bit more lacking, but understandably so since you are not non-binary.  Regarding non-binaryness, socially (and legally and shit) I'm a man but I've asked myself several times if I really am for various reasons, without really reaching any conclusive argument against me not being a man so I roll with my overwhelming masculinity (xd) without much worry. Maybe it's that lack of worry what makes me lack empathy on non-binaryness, but I think that rather than that being the issue, and I might be misquoting, but what you said perfectly sums up my viewpoint, 'they are trying to cast new societal forms from the ground up'. I don't take issue with that from a moral viewpoint, but more from a practical sense. Once you open up the fence to constructing new categories problems arise.For example, if you want to be inclusive and you create a new gender equivalent such using the term non-binary itself, you're getting into messy terrain because non-binaryness is opposed to binaryness which isn't a gender itself. It's incomplete, it seems like you have to say something else after declaring NB-ness. I of course wouldn't mind and would use requested pronouns, but I  still wouldn't think it's practical to do.   Nice bit at the end btw, fascistas n√£o passar√£o, hope shit gets better somehow, brazilian Contrapointers"
"It's really interesting, as a non-binary person myself, how binary vs non-binary trans people see pronouns. I've thought before about how, I would love it if people asked my pronouns because they/them is not the social norm right now. Really though, I would LOVE it if people assumed and used they/them automatically. Unfortunately there isn't any concrete way to present as non-binary and in order to accommodate for the inevitable gender revolution (tm) people would start asking everyone's pronouns, which I'm always anxious would hurt binary trans people because DAMN the ecstasy of having strange people use your proper pronouns must be GREAT. Asking everyone's pronouns would be great but how are we gonna get all english speakers to pull that one off lol"

"I think a good way of arguing Shapiro is basically explaining language is arbitrarily attempting to make things non ambiguous. Like everything in french is gendered, but it doesn't follow that keys now have XX chromosomes. It's simply an arbitrary distinction that attempt to streamline communication to effectively transmit the ideas in my brain to your brain."

"29:26 is a fantastic moment.  An unexamined point: none of these biological prescriptivist views of gender ever seem to acknowledge the variety of intersex conditions that occur in humans. Like, is someone who's XXY female because they have two X's, or male because they have a Y? If it's reproductive systems that define it, then what about people who are hermaphroditic? (I don't know if that word is exactly correct, apologies if it's outdated) You can't honestly claim to be all about the facts and while ignore the very real fact that, y'know, intersex people exist.  And also acknowledging a person's experience by changing a pronoun is a trivial effort and also language changes all the time because it is a tool. The intersex thing is just something I don't see talked about a lot in regards to gender."

"I think you miss something important in your argument...  Genesis 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  English translations of the Bible and Torah... both refer to the first man as being created both male and female and uses the pronoun 'them' in the singular.  Eve doesn't come along until Chapter 2 (and it is worth noting that she's made out of a man)."

"In the interest of fairness, I shall now list all the things Ben Shapiro has ever been right about.  1: Whiskey is gross, smells bad, and people shouldn't drink it.  And that concludes the list. You may now return to dunking on the little idiot."
"This is just pure spectacle of the latest variety. Ben Shapiro speaks on behalf of the capitalists who view women as their property, who have the most of wealth and private property and who command the institutions using violence to protect the private property ownership as such. Contrapoints speaks on behalf of the internal oscillations of the former cohorts of the capitalist class, the convenient buffer between the working class and the capital owners. Being both removed from material production and ownership of large capital, this gives rise to various phenomena, the colourful variety is shown in this video.  There is no identity, only circumstance, inner truth is inner oscillation of neurons and if disconnected from the outside information, it can be like a delusion. All thoughts are heavily dependent on input information. Those that are not are called hallucinations.  The reality of working class people is that they play with the cards life dealt them. If you are unfeminine woman or unmasculine man, you just deal with it, go with it. Because you know there is no alternative for you. Your internal struggles with identity like having to pretend to be a man because you feel unmasculine, unable to internalize the role, and it becomes insignificant compared to work you have to do in order to put food in your mouth and have a roof over your head. And then you develop a keen eye and compassion for those who visibly suck at being the gender they have been socialized into their whole life. Well that is life and sometimes we suck at it. Who the hell has time and resources to redo this socialization? Only those who are somehow connected to the schemes of surplus value extraction from working class of the world. And those guilty of this luxury are not even aware of it, because in their snowflakishness they became autistically self-centered, because their life is so comfortable and they have the time for navel-gazing.   I have no objection to the snowflakes except them being the middle-class buffer, and I have no positive feelings either. You know that you are being tolerated by those who have to live in poverty. How dare you shift the discussion to something insignificant as pronouns being something more than a signifier for the appearance, that you argued for in the first part of the video.  My objection is that Contrapoints is a part of american middle class, and is just as guilty of it as any other middle class pretentious person, oblivious to their role they serve to the capital owners. The hands of the middle class people are like sealion fins, unable to operate tools and machinery. You just clap the fins in front of other or in front of camera and are awarded for your visual performance, not your actions on material which is the only way value is created.  Your pronouns will be internalized and adopted by other middle class people, but merely tolerated by those who cannot afford to go one month without a wage, who cannot afford medical insurance, food and rent all together. Checking your privilege will not absolve you of your culpability."
"It‚Äôs so bizarre to me how many cis people believe that just calling trans people by a different pronoun is the biggest inconvenience of their life. People like Shapiro, Peterson etc whine about ‚Äúspecial snowflakes‚Äù but they‚Äôre really projecting. Great video!"

"I'm always so fascinated by the discussion of gender pronouns that native English speakers have. My native language, Armenian doesn't have gender pronouns at all, we just have a plural and singular they. It makes things simpler I think, and additional it makes it hard to take people seriously when they say it would make conversations more confusing if you just use they as a general pronoun, cause there's a whole ass language about a thousand years old that literally doesn't have he or she and we're doing just fine"

"I really appreciate you making this video. As a trans enby, I have to have this conversation so many times a day. It drives me crazy and it‚Äôs so exhausting.  Hearing the argument articulated clearly by someone with authority makes me feel a lot better, that maybe shit will turn around soon."
"you: what does it mean to live a nonbinary life? me, nonbinary: shit, what DOES it mean to live a nonbinary life but in all seriousness, to me, because i'm nonbinary, i view everything i am/say/do as nonbinary as well. that's what a nonbinary life is to me. i don't look androgynous, i 'look like a girl' because that's how i was assigned at birth. but despite the fact that i know i'm read as female i can't for the life of me see my appearance as anything other than androgynous. i see all of my actions and habits, which probably fall more on the traditionally feminine side of things, as androgynous as well. others won't see me the way i see myself because i feel no need to change my appearance or behavior to be more androgynous (but really what does it mean to look or act androgynous anyway). what i'm fighting for is a world where you can look or act any way you want, whether it aligns with traditional roles of your gender or not, and have your expression interpreted the exact way you want it to be interpreted. sadly, humans are humans and communication is always gonna be funky, but it would be nice, right?"

"I really liked your video, but I do have one question to ask. How am I supposed to navigate the world of gender/pronouns as a gender non-conforming trans woman? Like, I definitely want my body to be as female as possible, but I wear suits as often as I wear dresses, and I don't like a lot of the societal notions of how a woman is supposed to act/behave, and so I do not follow them. I guess I disagree with your notion that being a woman comes down to behaving/appearing like society expects women to, especially being a lesbian and being primarily around cis women who disobey this exact notion every day."

"Linguist here. Putting an article before a pronoun is fine, it just turns it into a noun. You can do it with any part of speech, actually. You can have a building, a pink, and a wow. I am not happy with that slip on your part, and doubly unhappy that of all places it had to happen in the bit that is expressly all about descriptivism. You end up not only prescribing something, but prescribing something that goes against how English actually works. That's a shame. Other than that, a lovely video as usual. Peace out."

"24:30 that's what Shapiro brings up a lot when he talks about his schizophrenic uncle.  Shapiro argues that gender dysphoria is a type of body dysmorphia. 99.7% of population identify with the 'gender assigned at birth' and that's why there's not much point arguing about using pronouns for such a small number of ppl. Language serves the needs of a majority and shouldn't be changed to accommodate 5 trans folks average person would meet in their lives. I personally believe that Natalie is a beautiful human being and she deserves to be called whatever she wants to be called, but she wouldn't pass my radar. I don't have any problem using pronouns a person would ask me to use. Gays were called crazy, so... Idk."

"Nitpick: you refer to two-spirit as 'traditional' in your video, but it's actually a modern umbrella term. Different North American Indigenous groups had different third/fourth/etc gender traditions (and some did not even have rigid gender roles). The modern umbrella term caught on as a way to promote solidarity between different (gender)queer indigenous groups with different traditions, who felt out of place in the Western LGBT community."

You are fantastic, and I love this video (and all of your videos), and I appreciate that you not only acknowledge the difference with nonbinary folks and trans people, but also that you acknowledge your own struggle with understanding nonbinary folks.  It isn't easy, but you're at least trying, and succeeding much better than many amongst both the vocal critics like Peterson and Shapiro, but also even more than many of our so-called allies, whose alliance includes awkwardly adding a letter to an acronym (when reminded) or making an acknowledgement of our existence with that tone of voice that conveys 'I'm talking to a child or an idiot as if I'm playing along but we all really know that this person I'm addressing is simply stupid or deluded,' which is oh-so-appreciated by us, and yet we're supposed to lavish praise upon such people like they'd take a bullet for us.

"Kids in my homophobic high school were using singular they before it even had a purpose, it's just a pragmatic fit for English. I had to unlearn it in college when I worked part-time for the language department, and then learn it all over again later to be supportive of nb friends and acquaintances. But yeah, basically this totally matches my experience, I use pronouns for identity out of politeness, but many people _seem_ their gender (including Natalie, I didn't realize she was being sarcastic when she 'came out' in the middle of the Incel video since that was the first one I saw) and that makes it all the more meaningful. It's interesting when people are in the gray area of transition and I am simultaneously 'transitioning' them in my mind by actively trying to change how I think about them to fit their new social identity."

"A contradiction from Ben is that he believes chromosomes are the sole determiner of gender, yet also believes there are only two genders.

"Just a PSA: The futch scale is like... a joke, within the lesbian community. It's not a thing we seriously use. We don't even use it anymore as a meme because people unfamiliar with butch and femme think its a real thing. See, there's butches and femmes, but 'stone' and 'high' are related to sex and nothing at all to do with appearance, and futch isn't an actual identity. Someone could look extremely stereotypically butch but not be a stone butch, and vice versa.   It's considered a joke because butch and femme are about more than just how one looks, and are very intentionally opposites. There can't identities inbetween as it just loses meaning. Though how they're defined varies in specifics, generally: butches reject femininity, femmes embrace it - both do so not for men, but for themselves and other women. That's why these are terms for lesbians: They're very intentionally not for men. One goes against what men typically desire in women and the other is what appeals to most men, but both reject them anyway - or in other words, one doesn't even garner their interest, and the other rejects it in favour of women's.  The futch scale is just a meme that was fun for those who understood it wasn't serious, but then got taken seriously by people unfamiliar with our terms."

"Is it helpful to just treat someone the way they ask to be treated? And to observe that if someone is clearly presenting as a particular gender, they are, in some sense, asking you to treat them accordingly? I don't like guessing games about things that might be very personal to the person I'm talking to. So if I'm in doubt, which hasn't happened more than a handful of times, I just ask, 'how are you most comfortable being addressed?'"

"Ben Shapiro doesn't seem to know that intersex people exist. He is saying that pronouns depend on fucking chromosomes. He need to take more time reading and less time being a douche-nuzzle. Trying to make everyone fit in 1 of 2 unchangeable gender boxes is hurting not just trans people but intersex people. There are surgeries performed on babies and minors- who can't consent to medical procedures- that are not performed to prevent or treat cancer but to make them fit into 1 of those 2 damn gender boxes. Variation IS the norm, humans need to accept that."

"Honestly ok, you get it better than I thought you did and yeah there is something to the whole drag queen analogy of last time.  Just as a drag show asks its audiance to suspend their disbelief and buy into the idea that these are women (who sometimes are, and sometimes aren't), and musical theater asks you to suspend your disbelief and buy into the concept Patti LuPone could ever die (the court is still out) and just let yourself experience things with those things as a given, even though they may clash with what someone's gut instinctual reaction is (Patti is an immortal sculpted from the golden core of Jupiter's moon, the only women I know of are only ever always forever women).  Being nonbinary and trying to present as nonbinary is mostly an exercise in 'OK, lend me your hand and let me take to to a magical place where I'm not a man or woman, that's a thing that exists, I'm all these contradicting and mutually exclusive things in your head, just 'yes and' then we can just move on with this interaction without pulling teeth.' And sometimes we try to appeal to different architype to -vibe out- and be picked up on rather than -man- or - woman-. We try to maybe feel like something else to people in a similar theatrical kind of way.  These things don't really actually exist as more than an architype, like 'Fae', 'dyke', 'sweet transvestite', or 'divine faggot goddess'.  The logic is mostly:  ‚Ä¢woman and man are basically just architypes anyway ‚Ä¢it's not like 'nonbinary person' is an architype that exists in the public conscience we can project. We're just trying to build with what we've gotüíÅ"

I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about.

My life would have been completely different. I feel more free to be more of who I am because you and people like you exist. xx"
"27:44 OMG LIKE WIIIIIG"
"It's amazing how badly Shapiro failed to debunk Blaire's parent analogy, like she wasn't even trying to argue with him really she just made a weak as hell case for using correct pronouns for trans women. He couldn't even contend with that."
"I recently asked someone what pronouns they prefer for the first time. Afterward, I realized why it is such an unusual thing to ask someone. You have to be talking about someone in the 3rd person while they are there and know they are trans, but not know them well enough to already know their pronouns. That doesn't happen too often.  She answered. I used her pronouns as she preferred them. No problem."

I don't take hormones nor had surgery and don't want to I think.  I know I mostly don't pass as a cis boy.  However, I'm seen and considered as a boy by many of my classmates, by my boyfriend and even tho I'm rarely calls sir, I'm also rarely called madam.  I am not seen as a cis man 90% of the time. Definitely. But I certainly don't live nor I'm seen as a cis woman either, even to people that have no clue what cis or trans might be.  How people perceive gender is definitely not binary, I can telle from my experience, even tho most of them have no words or concept to express that. It still happens. Because gender binary just doesn't fucking work in the real world. Fact."

"Damn, you must be a pot, gurl, cuz I think you just made me pan. That said:  2:52 Civility doesn't require hypocrisy. Refusing to be complicit in something you believe is a lie isn't rude in and of itself, passive-aggressively attempting to guilt someone into doing so is.  7:02 Just because our understanding of biological sex has become more scientifically in-depth doesn't mean gendered pronouns weren't historically exclusive to referring to apparent biological sex. Deferring to karyotypes as a more scientifically definitive indicator of biological sex than genitals is still etymologically consistent, since 'he' and 'she' has always been used to refer to observed biological sex and karyotypes are an extension of our observational abilities. That's why this argument dishonestly misrepresents linguistic tradition. Excellent piece of sophistry, though.  10:18 The full dictionary definition of parent is inclusive of non-biological caregivers, but that part of the entry was edited out for this argument. This is deliberately misleading. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parent  12:20 It's misrepresentative of that exchange to cut the part where Zoey condescendingly dismissed Ben as ignorant of genetics, in an unsound argument that even the host tried to save them from. Before then he had never directly addressed Zoey, so insinuating he initiated the combative tone of that part of the conversation, for whatever reason, is dishonest.  I'm gonna go back to watching the vid without typing crazy long comments no one will bother reading, now. It's been hard enough typing even this much one-handed. So, so hard."

"I hate to bring this up, but I am genuinely curious. I do feel there is some tension between your previous video and this one. If gender is primarily a psychological matter in way that completely disregards the role you inhabit socially, wouldn't that lend itself to the classic critique of right-wing goons mockingly trolling 'I sexually identify as an attack helicopter'? I frankly feel that the social component works better as an overarching framework that furthers understanding, not just of trans people, but nonbinary people as well: traditional masculinity and femininity serve as poles of a spectrum in which people can incarnate a variety of behavioral traits in different ways *because of how that behavior is widely recognized*. I find that saying 'I am this even though I don't show it in any recognizable way' meets far too many epistemological obstacles to overcome. At least, I don't see a way past it... any thoughts?"

"oh shit nice this time you didn't make a video I felt compelled to defend on reddit and go many night sleepless because of worrying about that. here's something semi-relevant I wrote back then in response to someone saying everyone should be treated as valid and that you now confirmed  'i mean, I think natalie does agree with that. but outside of queer circles, the truth is a bit different and (warning, don't read farther than this if you don't want potentially dysforia triggering uncomfortable stuff) way more nasty.  the truth is, most of the world sees gender as binary. which is, of course, a thing we should all strive to change, but for the time being, it is, in my opinion, completely understandable for a person with no experience with these types of subjects to see gender as binary. this is probably the most controversial thing here, but i somewhat agree with her on the enby point: functionally, people who see gender as binary will, outside of subjects who are completely ungenderably androgynous, see people, even enbies who have come out to them, as either of the traditional binary genders. that does rise the question of the functional outbound meaning of non-binary genders.  of course, another thing i think natalie should have or at least should go into is the function of self-identity as coping with dysphoria. while it may not change the way people treat you, self-identity and the perception one has of themeself and the world is everything there is to an individual. this, coupled with things like selection bias and other psychological phenomena i've forgotten the name of can make a person feel valid even if society does not see them as such, which is a good thing.  the dilemma this puts me at, and the dilemma which was also the main subject of the video, is this: who is the arbiter of validity? if it's society, then the outcome is extremely nasty (warning 2: definitely don't read the next paragraph).  if society and social perception is what gives validity to gender, then functionally, only those who pass as either binary gender are valid. which is, again, hella uncomfortable. i personally think it's a bit of both: you shouldn't care about what society says and just do and be whatever feels good. but if what makes you feel not dysphoric is passing to people, then the only way to go is to conform to the boxes that are already there.'"

That way, everyone everywhere will be wrong, awkward, unhappy, and confused like God intended. Equality at last."

"I don't think it is really a binary.  There are people who don't fall easily into stereotypical sex/gender types.  'Trans' is part of this small subsection of 'non-binary' individuals.  There are trans people in many cultures and no one actually thinks they are women.  Trans doesn't mean a female in a male body, it means a man who thinks he a woman.  Guess it depends if you think the mind or the body is the more definitive condition.  The dominant philosophical positions say the mind is changeable and is therefore less real than the physical.  But because all perception is mental, some people argue that consciousness is more definitive.  That seems to be the basic argument here."

Thanks for taking the time and effort to put into words what many of us know and can't explain ourselves, and doing it more elegantly than we could. Thanks also for getting it, as even sometimes allies don't always get it, but you've definitely mostly got it.  Also, I should definitely check out some of the channels you cited. That would be nice. I should definitely at least thank you for that, and for sharing these channels with a broader audience."

"Calling someone by their preferred pronoun is just a non-issue and basic level of respect. I bet these alt-righters, conservatives, republicans etc would bitch even louder than the left if there was a widespread trend of calling them dickholes or whatever is inaccurate but would feel accurate to the person saying it in the public space. Imagine school referencing Ben Shapiro as dickhole, then he goes to the doctor and she says 'Which patient? Oh the dickhole over there?' and then he reads articles referring to him as dickhole."

If all the people who felt like they are a different gender were to respect facts, don't get triggered when doctors ask their biological sex, don't get triggered when people don't use pronounces that aren't defined in the language or choose not to use them, freedom of speech whatever. And if all the people who are claiming there are only two sexes and that somehow has anything to do with your gender would just put away their definitions aside and let people be who they want to be. Life would be so great. As an onlooker, someone who will not care what you want to be or how you want me to call you (I like laid back people so someone demanding such a thing is not it, so I just would respectfully not talk to you) but someone who will definitely care for you to say your biological sex to a doctor because it actually matter to a lot of treatments, I don't think any side is good.

Though the second part seem's mostly to be an answer to the backlash of the last video whitch I feel kind of dragged on for a bit too much. Now in fairness, I'm just a random white dude, so it's probably just because I feel less invested by contra having to explain her specific attitude toward every variation of the rich and diverse NB community."
"You forgot to point out that there's a shit ton of non-standard karyotypes that cis have.  As a Mexican-Irish peep I grew up with a very Mexican view on gender, where there's the divine feminine and masculine and places where they meet (muxes! :D) and that what you are depends on the energy you have (kind of what like you think!) and that energy doesn't always match your body because biology and spirit aren't always the same thing despite often being intertwined.  Spain did a lot to help screw that up, but more and more we're learning to see things like that again and I grew up seeing it like that, though well, I used to be a shit about sexuality when it came to trans people but then I got smart and schooled about it by smarter, more gender intelligent people than me and learned. ^.^    That being said, OH MY GOD I WOULD SELL MY SOUL FOR YOUR COSTUMES.

"You know... with all the talk by Blair White about 'not being a victim'... I actually really pity her. Like, not even because she's conservative! I don't pity Iron Liz, who is a conservative trans woman. And I DEFINITELY don't feel an ounce of pity for Caitlyn Jenner. But I pity Blair White because she herself admits she feels compelled to engage in this bullshit. And she almost always looks like she's on the verge of tears when she does. She is literally victimizing herself and feels compelled to, apparently.   That's actually really SAD. And I can actually relate, because I've often felt this way about Jewish issues where I found myself engaging with anti-Semites and feeling compelled to 'explain' the Israel problem. And it always makes me miserable. And resisting it is hard, but less damaging than giving in. So yeah, I am sorry, Blair, but you do make me pity you. Not for being trans. Not for being conservative, but because I see you always engaging with people who treat you like shit. I really would rather NOT pity her. But I can't help it. I do."

"I'm not done watching the video but I really wanted to talk about a movie I saw the other day called Girl. It's about a young transgender girl named Lara during her transitioning. Lara wants to be a ballerina but her body doesn't comply with the art. The actress is transgender too I think (unless they went out of their way to use CGI to add some ... stuff). It was really interesting to see her and all the struggles she went through and the way she managed to stay strong.  It is a very intimate movie, we get to see her naked quite often in order to visually understand how she feels about her body because Lara is very shy and avoids talking about what she really feels to her therapist.¬†Those scenes are in fact way more powerful that way. No words, just her in front of her mirror.   We really got to see her day to day life. A few scenes of microaggressions particularly stood out to me. On the first day of class, after she was done presenting herself, the teacher asked the other girls if they were ok with Lara using their Locker room, they all agreed. All the girls in her ballet class went on a field trip, they were all sleeping in the same room except Lara who was made to sleep in a different room. Little moments like those were particularly annoying because I just wanted to scream 'JUST TREAT HER LIKE EVERYONE ELSE! GOD!! SHE'S NOT A FUCKING PREDATOR!!' and Lara was visibly upset.  And to top it all off, the other girls forced her to show them her 'dick' under the pretence that Lara never undresses in the locker room even though everyone else does so she got to see them naked that means they ought to see her naked too. This argument is, of course, stupid as fuck and would still be stupid even if she wasn't transgender. I found it really interesting that the movie doesn't show the clich√© bigoted attacks that we are used to hearing but instead show casual acts that make her feel 'abnormal'.  It felt ... real and authentic.    It was a great movie in my opinion. I think it's Belgian, but it's still in theatres here in France. Unfortunately, I had to go to fucking Paris to watch it because I live in a small town, the cinema is far from my home and I don't have a car, and they always play that movie around 10 PM!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!!!  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were a great number of people watching this movie even though it had been in theatres for a few weeks. I thought it was a great representation of the experiences of a trans woman, but of course, I cannot possibly know what it feels like to be Trans so I'd love to hear what Trans people thought about this movie. I don't know if you can see it around the world, but if you can, it's definitely worth checking out."

"do you read comments? i really hope you read comments.   i was glad that you clarified your points from the last video, because i understood what you were getting at, but it was difficult to try to explain to folks whose head it flew over. i'm a nonbinary trans person, who is intending to transition in a way that, hopefully, will make people see me as the binary opposite. transitioning is both affirming AND makes me want to scream and pull the skin off my body. those feelings are caused by the unfortunate fact that i am both agender and masculine. it's a nightmare.   i'm in a unique position of these two constantly warring states of being. i want to be nothing and nobody. i want to be a man. i want people to see me as nothing and nobody. i want people to see me as a man. believe me when i say that this isn't some self-imposed closet situation where i just haven't accepted i'm a binary trans man. i tried that already. it made me miserable. ignoring the part of me that's agender makes me absolutely miserable.   anyway, the point of that ramble is that i understand your point about social perception of gender, and i agree. one of the ways i unintentionally torture myself is by ruminating on how people See Me. it's something i have to actively ignore in order to not lose my god damn mind.   however, from the perspective of a nonbinary person, your way of seeing things tends to be unhelpful, and i think most nonbinary people i know also think it's unhelpful. specifically, it's unhelpful to us because we aren't, as you said in the video, trying to assimilate. we're dealing with the psychological horror (or at least i am!) of having absolutely NOTHING to model ourselves by. i mean, agender people and non-masc/fem people. we have no gender model to follow. it is absolutely harrowing sometimes. maybe that's just me, though.   so in conclusion, i desperately wish i was able to assimilate because the idea of not being normal and accepted bothers me to extremes, and yet no matter what i do i can't change who i am. wait, that's not the conclusion at all. this is just me typing out my sorrows now. god, if you're out there, can you please zap me into a man, but like, all the way this time? thanks jesus. amen."

"You used to be pretty good about leaving space in your videos to describe the ontological meanings of things. Now, it seems like you're discarding some rather important facts in exchange for more acceptable arguments, while doing a better job of being true to your own personal experience as a diadic binary trans woman. And honestly, it's not bad, I still enjoy your content and your viewpoint is valid, but I find myself frustrated at what appears to be projected ignorance of the science and history which by its existence supports non-binary identities. And I am especially saddened that it's for the sake of appealing to people who won't listen to those facts."

"Just want to tack on something about the descriptivist/prescriptivist language divide. If one chooses prescriptivist, then as you said, that implies that there is some way we 'ought' to use language. Usually that involves deferring to the experts.

"The objection to the singular 'they' has always seemed absolutely dumb to me. It's been a common thing that people have used with no problem way longer than trans issues started becoming more prominent. This issue has already been agreed on for probably hundreds of years at the least! It's a common way to refer to someone when you don't know their gender (often because you don't know enough about the person, not necessarily because you can't tell from first glance), or simply when their gender isn't important to the conversation. I bet all these people who have such an aversion to the singular 'they' have probably used it themselves hundreds or even thousands of times without even thinking about it. Just goes to show how hollow and dishonest the whole position is."

(I was a lot less discerning about what youtubers I watched back then). And that led to me being afraid to say the wrong thing around trans people... that fear became resentment... and thankfully, I caught myself before the resentment became overt hostility. That said, I have social anxiety, so the paranoid fear that people around me are just waiting on bated breath for me to commit a social faux-pas so they can laugh and exclude me from normal society is something I fight with pretty regularly. In a way, my anxiety makes me particularly vulnerable to the vague threat of speech policing that conservative pundits claim the left engages in, because it feeds into pre-existing irrational fears.   But, you know, take this for what it's worth."

Ignoring the muddy debate of personal identity and what it means to identify as a particular gender, I do find your argument of gender performance to be a very practical take when debating with (I don‚Äôt want to say assholes but I am failing to find a better word right now) people with certain political agendas.  In day to day life it makes no sense to resort to ‚Äòbiology‚Äô in how we relate with one another.  When I dye my hair red people don‚Äôt resort back to the fact my real hair color is a gross muted color of dried mud blended with warm highlights, they simply regard me as a ginger as much as they‚Äôd regard a natural ginger as a ginger.  For all intents and purpose, I am a ginger.  When interacting with a woman or man who happened to be born the opposite sex, it makes no practical purpose to call them by the sex they were born as instead of the gender they present as (ignoring the cases where they present feminine but identify as male, ofc it would simply be rude to purposely misgender them)."

At least linguistically speaking?"

This video more than any other has helped me greatly, I feel like you've explained things in a way that finally makes sense.

"Ben is FUNDAMENTALLY wrong on the topic of Transgender people. Pronouns are used to describe Gender NOT sex. His claim is that we as a people determine pronouns from sex chromosomes. Which is False. Already, proven from your last video, Gender is performance...your pronoun is peecieved by people based on  whatever you are performing. Anyone who did not know someone like Gigi Gorgeous prior, will automatically assume she is a woman and hence would use SHE. Which is 100% correct. Those that go on a rant in her comments with tge 'YoU wIlL nEvEr bE a wOmAn' do so out of arrogance to irk Gigi. Actually what they meant to say is, she will never be Female since all they reference is her XX chromosomes, which is TRUE. But she is already a woman, since she performs womanhood. No one checks for sex chromosomes to determine gender. i have found myself in positions where i was confused by someone's gender because they were 'performing both'....... i did not use pronouns at all because i couldn't figure out if the person i was talking to was a man or woman. Just look at ' Hard Butch Lesbians' They are female and identify as girls, but i've seen some that get mistaken for men all the time. Why? They act and dress like cis men and hence are percieved as cis men. it's literally that simple."
"You are God"
"The topic of pronouns is so interesting, and I honestly think you covered it kind of perfectly. Now I'm comfortable with basically any pronouns, but when I was younger the invention of neo-pronouns was really important for me because of their lack of connotation (I think? I just didn't feel comfortable identifying with any of the main three). I personally always would look up long lists of them and picked out the ones I thought were aesthetically the best, and that made me super happy. I think because of of newness and high number it's a lot easier to identify with them."

"I think the point about the desire for cis people to have a visceral 'this person is a woman' reaction hits on something very real, and I think it was pretty brave of you to be so honest that some trans people don't do that for you. But I think it's also a flawed way of looking at it; it puts the responsibility on the trans person to convince us to believe they are truly the gender they say they are, and standards for each person are bound to be different. Instead, cis people and allies of trans people going through early transition can train themselves to have that reaction by reframing gender and their transitioning friends. I would recommend trying that next time a trans person doesn't give you that knee jerk 'they're a ~gender~' reaction."

"If Ben Shapiro was so in to truth and facts he‚Äôd not have permitted the side by side image of him and Blair appear like his face would ever be level with hers. The truth is he‚Äôs basically going to be talking to her navel, and to represent things any other way goes against his professed commitment."

"Facts don't care about your feelings... but we don't structure language based on facts alone. In fact, humans never have. Language has always been used to talk about figurative things and myths as long as if not before it was used to talk about real things. We structure language based ON feelings. Language-making is primarily about building social relationships. We use it to cooperate and build societies. Refusal to deal with trans pronouns or insisting that trans people be referred to by the pronouns you prefer, is saying 'I refuse to be open to the possibility of socializing with someone who is not cisgender, someone who doesn't conform to my view of gender, that I see as the only correct one'. They're the ones imposing their political agenda then, not the trans or non-binary people."
"FASCISTAS N√ÉO PASSAR√ÉO!!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
"21:20 >There gender no conforming men who use pronouns...  Let me stop you right there. I have never in my life used pronouns to describe myself. This isn't about what pronouns they use it is about which pronouns they'd like us to use.  I'll use whatever seems to fit your gender because you are correct to say gender is performative.  But if your gender is questionable and you aren't around to hear it I will use 'he... she... it? idk...'. And so are probably many others. It was time you learned that."

"So that's it for no nut November"
"While the right constantly cries 'Orwellian!' at the left, they refuse to acknowledge gender and sex as having separate meanings. The tactic is to erase language that could allow for honest discourse. It is literally Orwell."

"'they, their, them' do exist as singular pronouns in English. It's called 'Zero person' and literally used in academia (and I've heard people just around in the real word as well), to be respectful towards a hypothetical situation when you don't want to gender a hypothetical person to include anyone. So it exists and it exists in its intended purpose, but when people put a name to it, suddenly, what was so common place before, is now 'offensive'."

"Perfection"
"Yours is becoming my favorite youtube channel so fast..."
"Nice meme"
"Above the definition of words is the culture in which those definitions arise. I would argue that Sonny Boy Shapiro's objection is not so much to using someone's pronouns how our culture, admittedly, currently allows them to be used. Rather it is to the forceful update to that culture and to the agenda of those behind it, as he does not feel it is sincere a reflection of the feelings of the population in general. By forcing those pronouns upon him you are somewhat proving his point. That being said, what's the harm in letting someone who passes pass? I miss the good old days where transsexuals were a little less cluster B and a little more self-actualizing. Present company excluded of course. =/. Keep up the good thinks!"

"im sick and stuck in bed, and this video was a godsend. my asthma has cleared and my breathing has returned   i'm nonbinary and i often think about how the world i want - one that includes nonbinary people through asking about pronouns, etc - is at odds with what many binary trans people i know want, which is to be integrated in society as a man or woman. i do think, however, that it is possible to have a world thats more accommodating for binary and nonbinary trans people. it does... it does rely on cis people doing a lot of work, though."

"Contrapoints and Shaun in one day!? Bless you Dark Mother!!!"
"Lovely stuff"
"Never been this early..."
"BLESSED"
"God, finally!!"
"The descriptive approach is going to give varying answers by place and time, because language is not universal and unchanging.  And I'll bet that for most speakers of English dialects mutually intelligible with yours in most places and times, 'he' and 'she' are used to refer to sex, not gender. (Genital sex, not chromosomal, because most people in most places and times have no idea what their chromosomes are, or what a chromosome is).  And for the places and (mostly recent) times that they are not, that is as a consequence of prescriptivist campaigns to change the language."
