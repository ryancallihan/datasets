"That's an M. Night Shyamalan twist right there! Bravo!"
"Jesus christ, how do we wake up the lizard people??"
"I remember when I read 'State of Fear' by Michael Crichton as a teen. Had me in a state of climate denial-ism for a while, even if only from a position of doubt and not conspiratorial thinking. Glad I got over it."
"One argument that I've seen pop up a lot recently is 'Well, most of the CO2 emissions are coming from China now so even if our government did something about it it wouldn't make a difference, because they won't'  and tbh i don't know what the solution is there, either"
"everything is on the cob!!"
"As a person from South Florida watching this, I got scaredüòÇbut seriously this is worrying"
"If only Al could've done it in a 'non profit' kinda way. The Buddhists were on to something with that 'the dharma should free' thing."
"Was it really 58 degrees when you shot this video?"
"the poppers bottle in the fridge......"
"11:08 even when editing videos your transitions are great haha"
"Just a friendly reminder that you can lessen the environmental impact of your diet without committing to absolute veganism. You can have meatless mondays or you could eat meatless at home but when you go out treat yourself to a burger. A lot of the times I think people feel overwhelmed by the suggestion of totally give up meat to create a positive impact but you don't have to. You can still eat meat, just reduce how much you do"
"Nick's (who goes by 'Natalie' now) power hunger and manipulation know no bounds. Society should (nee must) view men who claim such as a women; society should (nee must) ascribe to his or Al Gore's assessment of the environmental situation.   Wake up. All current environmental problems are the result of capitalism; i.e., humans' automation of production in pursuit of efficiencies and profits during and after the industrial revolution. That was the cause of all modern conveniences, including vehicles, factories and everything digital. That revolution also led to the vastest gains for humans in terms of health, life expectancy and standard of living ever known. The solution to externalities will be found through the same means. Stop your power hungry alarmism."
"Did you buy a speculum for this video??"
"Had to stop watching this, I'm getting so very aggravated having imaginary conversations about climate change with Donald trump - getting me all riled up before work üòÇ the money hungry fuck üòÇ"
"... so is this lewd version of the sea our mother? because this just became way more degenerate than i'm comfortable with if that's the case."
"can I wife the sea goddess"
"i‚Äôm honestly so terrified and angry! this entire video i was literally just saying ‚Äúfuck fuck fuck fuck...‚Äù out loud while my cat was staring at me. it sucks to feel powerless and if anyone has any suggestions on what can be done besides voting trump out and being vegetarian (i mean i guess i could take it a step further and go vegan) and trying to recycle more please let me know because feeling that i‚Äôm not doing enough to combat our impending doom is not good for my anxiety!!"
"Wow...fucking thanks for your contribution to the 1 degree, Trump you dumbfuck."
"Soylent Green is people."
"I'm just hanging out in the comments waiting for someone to hand me my GODDAMN SMELLING SALTS!!!"
"Talking about stopping climate change with 'political action' without mentioning that this 'action' better include you nuking China, India and every developing country with coal deposits for good measure or your attempts won't work seems ill-informed or disingenuous."
"For those who are allergic to a lot of vegetables like I am.  You don‚Äôt necessarily have to go vegan, hunting is a good way to get a source of red meat without hurting the environment. White tail deer populations are at an all time high so you would actually be doing the world a favor by thinning out the herd.  It‚Äôs an environmentally friendly way because the money you buy for deer tags is 100% given to the department of interior and you‚Äôre depriving the industrial farming market out of hundreds dollars of profit every year.  I don‚Äôt usually agree with contra points but this is a huge existential threat proven over and over again by science."
"This was awesome"
"Hi, I'm just here for the red flesh."
"Nice musical choice at the beginning. I love me some Tristan and Isolde!"
"Nailed it again!!!!  LOOOOVE ContraPoints."
"What is it with you and watermelons"
"Well now I want watermelon :/  (And to like save the earth or whatever)"
"‚ÄúAll the ice caps are melting the tide is rushing in. All the world is drowning to wash away the sin.‚Äù ‚Äî Tiny Tim"
"i mostly agree with the topics execpt veganism... there IS actually a scientific truth behind why you should eat meat. And its population control over livestock... its basic ecosystem upkeeping. I know its a 'human' generated system as cows would obviously not mass produce in the speed they do, but currently due to human intervention there is just overpopulation...if you would let all the livestock go they would harm our generic ecosystem as it is. Its like when there was a japaneese city that competly eliminated a type of bird to be killed - then the bugs got overpopulated and ate all the farmers green stock :D so humans almsot starved to death... ecosystem is a bitch and once humans fuk it up its very hard to recover it without consequences. Altough I agree that if someone is a vegan I personally have nothing to do with it. But I fail to see actually what are the benefits of being a vegan besides being thin and being able to claim that I am 'vegan'... to me it adds no value to the way of my living. I can live healthy with or without being vegan so its just something humans make up. But the truth to be told ecosystems are not to be fuked. W e really were designed to be predators for a reason... we - even though we fight a lot not to - should be fitting into this ecosystem... but being vegan is not the way. Being restrictive and not abusing the system is... but no one preaches that... cause that would actually rob money out of economics :3"
"PragerU shoot A SERIES of videos around March 2017 to cause confusion and try to instil stupid bloody denialist propaganda. If you want to do one thing now, help me report them so this channel will eventually be closed. These people make me so mad and angry GRRRR"
"10:14 Sigh. One does not _believe_ in Science as though it is some competing philosophy, one _accepts_ the evidence from common observation of experiments via the scientific method."
"'this is what the earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife'"
"This is useful historical record for future generations."
"How many will die when you cut the energy supply to about 10% of our current usage and cause de-industrialization and massive food shortages? Wind and solar can't meet the world's energy needs without massive depopulation."
"I truly love the sea, but to think of her as an antagonistic, nymphomanic shore-whore is quite awkward. ~As a gay guy~ i'd apreciate it, if she would'nt put me inside her... Time to buy a Prius~"
"That Tristan chords in the intro music omg"
"I live i shithole fucking Bangladesh and those that know of global warming don't deny"
"'This is what it would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife'"
"god USA is fucking dumb"
"I'd rather the planet die than agree with those OTHER Americans"
"This video should be mandatory in grade 8 of high school across the planet"
"The ocean IS Ursula"
"I adore South Park, but I gotta say that Al Gore episode is pretty concerning in this context. Especially seeing as until this video, i had no idea who he was outside of his ridiculous south park caricature."
"Just signed up to vote this year ‚úÖ  can't wait to kick that MF out of office"
"'There could be muslim mexicans for all I know' me I'm mexican muslim LMAO #AmericasWorstNightmare"
"Natalie: *drinks Mo√´t*  Me: KiLlEr QuEeEeEeEeN!"
"I think my favourite part is 16:44"
"I watched Al Gore's movies. And I was so touched about the agreements that took place in Paris until I remembered that a certain someone pulled the US out of the agreement...üò§"
"The whole part of needing a villain immediately reminds me of the new Grimes album... It's about the personification of climate change"
"This truly is the scariest issue of all and I really don't understand why these right wingers insist that climate change is a hoax. It's just frustrating"
"I used to want to end climate change with my leftist vegetarian lesbian ways, but now I want to fuck the sea, so #MAGA I guess"
"It's not the apocalypse until it's actually happening."
"Was that a bottle of poppers?"
"Amazing video just one thing that annoyed me. IF YOU DONT NEED A NEW CAR DONT BUY A ELECTRIC CARS JUST BC ITS BETTER THAN NORMAL CARS ITS MUCH BETTER TO WAIT TIL THE CARS U HAVE STOPS WORKING BC OF HOW MANY EMISSIONS MAKING A CAR MAKE okay bye love you"
"im a harmless libertarian socialist at heart but climate change has turned me into a Stalinist tankie."
"ah fuck"
"Nothing is going to happen to stop climate change, let's be honest, that why (*sung*) we are all fuuuuuucked"
"Oh my God your scientist look is stunning üòç‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üíñüíñüíñ"
"such clever content"
"holy crap youre entretaining"
"People said Churchill was an alarmist too."
"We‚Äôre all gonna die."
"19:18 just 100 companies (100 ceos) are responsible for 71% of global emissions. Time to find out who the 100 ceos are and raise some nonviolent hell with boycotts, strikes, protests, petitions, and unrelenting pressure on our political representatives"
"SUPPORT THE GREEN NEW DEAL!!!!"
"Sorry but the words you use betray you.  You are just another religious zealot.  Those who disagree with you are not skeptics they are deniers.     The consensus does not say what you think it says.  Science does not say what is good or bad, that is the domain of ethics.  Science does not say what we should do about it if anything.  Again that is a philosophical question.   I do love the fact that you used a watermelon as your prop.  I assume you did it for the whole green on the outside red in the middle thing."
"Hahahah! The irony of Big Oil begging for money to safeguard a Fucking oil plant from rising sea levels due to global warming!!"
"Nerd"
"Dislikes are from Koch brothers alternate accounts"
"Natalie my province is on fire oh god oh fuck please help I am going to die"
"The term Climate Change was in use before the term Global Warming. I think there was one Conservative Politician to adopt the term instead of Global Warming because it was less threatening. Maybe it was Karl Rove or maybe it was Newt Gingrich idk I mix them up. But you're right. They do mean different things.  But it was also partially political on the conservative side  https://skepticalscience.com/climate-change-global-warming.htm"
"Fuck this dumb c***, she is talking about the impact of unsustainable economy. How dare she point out the flaws of my ideology. China is making America dumber by puting fluoride in our toothpaste.' - my dad"
"a lot of people going on in this comment section saying we are all going to die. we aren't going to die, the climate will just be a bit more fucked up and it will drastically change a lot of things and the way we live, but we aren't going to die because of this."
"what was the white powder sent in the mail to michael mann? anthrax or heroin?"
"I‚Äôm scared mommy"
"This is my favorite contra"
"I once invited a friend to eat pizza, I paid for it because that was what I said I would. She did not eat it because it had pepperoni. I was not going to wait another 15 minutes for an overpriced pizza. My point is that, the arrogant vegan steroetipe (like in the movie Scott Pilgrim) has its reasons. I mean why the fuck couldnt she eat the pepperoni, the fucking thing is death already and its not like she had religious reasons for it. At the same time she is pro third world inmigrants but will only have kids with an european. In short hipocracy at its best. Like your videos, btw."
"T H E  R E D  F L E S H"
"I'm a European nationalist and I hate right wingers who don't accept the reality of climate change... Here in Europe, no one denies it..."
"'When I was a little girl I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon and I'd stare up at the stars and wonder: Where did they all come from, you known, what does it all mean? The cosmos, humanity, our little time here on earth... And that's why I became a scientist: So I could spend my life studying... toposhperic trace gases.... *sad violins start playing*'   As someone finishing up their PhD (Solid State Physics) while being on unemployment benefits (which are rather generous over here in Germany) and being just completely disillusioned with the whole system of science, this was just tooo real, Natalie ^^"
"Aa a part of a long-term goal to convince my dad that global warming is real, I have been compiling a list of republican-friendly climate change action items:   1.

"What the hell could be the downside of less pollution? I mean I get that it's somewhat inconvenient to jump through environmental regulation hoops, but it's also inconvenient to have food and fire safety inspections, and neither has never been a political issue."
"It was 97 degrees Fahrenheit all day in Berlin yesterday. The avg annual temp this time of year is a high of 75. I've never felt more urgently that we've got to make monumental changes (and by that I mean throw ungodly amounts of money at the problem) to fix this shit."
"I love that the contents of the fuckin mini fridge are just champagne, soy milk, and one sad lone popper"
"Wish I'd watched this video before I joked about climate change and my coworker said she didn't believe in it."
"Isn't  making money from you tube, capitalism?"
"Poppers!!!"
"I mean we could always drown the deniers. They're even sitting in the bathtub. Drown them before their inaction drowns us?"
"+1 for having an additional scale using SI dimensions, ¬∞C!"

"Filthy Rich Woman: I guess I just need a villain.  Grimes:     I got you fam."
"'this story has no villain' lol"
"I love your videos, Natalie, but I wish you would stop using the Lizard motif. It's really dangerous to put that in the vernacular of impressionable young people and has a long history of being an anti-semetic dogwhistle."
"This was a lot funnier and a lot less nihilistic than I expected.  I admit, I've been highly tempted to just ignore the problem (I'd rather spend my last years gardening than arguing with Republicans), but Natalie is right, that's just another form of denial. We're not up against a hard end date here, we're fighting to keep ourselves and each other from sliding down the far side of the bell-curve of human suffering."
"The Ursula Sea Bitch Goddess bit is fucking fantastic! I think I love you Contra bb üçâ"
"The poppers at 0:24! I‚Äôm deceased."
"22:28 all hail"
"Just my 2 cents here. I know it was said sarcastically by your 'mother nature' character, but I'm really sick of hearing this 'Climate change might kill humans but _the Earth_ is going to be fine' argument.  Like yeah, the actual ball of rock that comprises most of Earths mass? That's going to be fine. That's not really the important part though. It's the thin film of life that's spread across the surface of this ball of rock that should be the focus here, and if you think that somehow this 4-billion-years-in-the-making cosmic chemical miracle is magically immune from utter destruction, you're kidding yourself. There's no pre-destined plan here. This isn't a dress rehearsal. What's to say we can't kick off some positive feedback loop that turns Earth into Venus?  The planet itself surviving isn't really a consolation prize if it just ends up like all the other countless number of lifeless planets in the universe, is it?"
"I would say that CP is barking at the wrong tree. Despite what US republicans are thinking about global warming US CO2 emissions are on the same level now as of 1990. During that period  China, India, Saudi Arabia have increased their CO2 output 400%. US produces approx 5, China 11, India 2.5 Gt per year, EU combined 3,5 Gt. EU has decreased its CO2 out approx 25% since 1990. World total output per year is 37 Gt. It was 22 Gt in 1990."
"I like this very much and this question is just because I am confused (what I mean is that this is in good faith): 15:09 what is up with a confidence interval of ¬±216.2 on a prediction of 132.5m people exposed to severe drought at 1.5¬∞C (same goes for ¬±276.5 for a global population of 194.5 million at 2.0¬∞C)? Or is that supposed to be in thousands?"
"Completely agree. I frequently get frustrated anytime I hear people (especially  politicians) deny climate change. But I think the vegan bit isn't a good analogy. Mainly cause I've never once met a meat-eater feel guilty about eating meat."
"Owo"
"THE NAILS ON THE GLOVES   not to take away from a very Important video, but i cracked up so hard"
"Where have you been all my life !!!!!!"
"sexy sCienTist. do i know what this is about, no, but I now feel an intense desire to take a bath. Also CUCK is my favorite word ever invented. Use it more."
"You wear a bra in the bath?"

"Hmmm....... save the world or get hate snu-snu from the goddess of the sea? Decisions, decisions."
"'The world is not ending, it's just getting shittier.' üë†üåéüíÖ  *And don't worry, sustainable meat & dairy appear now to be part of the solution. Reducing portions & frequency of certain meats is advisable at this time, though. Sourcing is key, as well as encouraging innovations like lab cultivated meat. But sustainably-caught, grass fed, & pasture raised animal products are part of regenerative agriculture, and naturally compatible with certain ecosystems."
"''- ...Another excuse for BIG GOVERNMENT to take away MY FREEDOM--   + What freedom? Are you an oil company?   - Oh what if I sexually identify as an oil company? Isn't that what you liberals think? MY. IDENTITY. IS. VALID   + No it isn't!   - Bring me my smelling salts!   + Watch the goddamn video''   Probably the best depiction of a youtube comment section ever written by humans"
"Another excellent video. Thankfully more people are beginning to take the climate issue seriously. Still too many that think it's a big 'liberal lie.' :/"
"YES TRISTAN UND ISOLDE!"
"'Asian cities will be worst affected' I think Donald Trump found a fun destructive loophole to solve his problems with China."
"There's no way to say this without sounding butthurt. But South Park apologized in the first two season 21 episodes. South Park and its creators quit climate change denial."
"this kid in my class said climate change isn't real because it's cold in the winter, and my science teacher is possibly a denialist of climate change, oh boy"
"The reference to Shihuangdi made me chuckle. Nice vid."
"my dad: why do you care about cleaning up trash when MY God is gonna come and fix everything? mom's bf: when I was in school they were teaching us about global cooling me: why does my mom have such bad taste in men?"
"The misguided belief that all opinions are valid and 'equal' has led to this anti-science movement. Some opinions are just fucking stupid and should not be taken seriously. As someone that works in IT, I would expect my opinion on how to preform an open heart surgery to be completely ignored."
"The stalkers come for the red flesh"
"How tare you use science to prove a point."
"Donald trump is Shinra confirmed"
"These guys need to listen to Earth"

"Thoughts on Mr Garrison transitioning?"
"i sexually identify as an oil company, don't attack me like this"
"Dude , you are a homosexual man in a dress who's been brain washed with joo sexual degeneracy agenda.  LMAO !!!!! lololololo, idiot. lolololol."
"Watching this video, because I'm making a presentation on my English class (I study it as a foreign language). Should I take a watermelon with me? :)"
"God doesn't need to flood the Earth again. We'll just flood it ourselves."
"I would like to note something said in this video that isn't necessarily true. Driving a hybrid or electric car will not help with carbon emissions just because those cars don't produce emissions. The electricity running those cars most likely came from a power plant burning coal or some other fossil fuel. Since nothing is 100% efficient, excess carbon emissions are produced when you get your electricity from a power company that is then transported (which also wastes energy) to you. The point is, your carbon footprint driving a hybrid or electric car is actually larger than if you were to drive a regular car. Before electric cars can truly become green, we need to produce electricity in a clean way."
"No chance anyone's going to read this at this point, but the 100 companies thing is kind of deceptive. That 100 companies represented the 71% of all INDUSTRIAL emissions, which was left undefined, by did not include agriculture. In fact it seemed purely to be composed of energy companies. And well those doobies need to do much much better and stop trying to cover their asses legislatively, we need to recognize that they are us. China coal (the largest producer of those companies), provides electricity to people in China by burning coal. The less energy Chinese people use, the less they will emit. Same goes for all the other companies listed. Too much coal or natural gas? We're to blame. Too much oil? We're to blame. We can't ask for shit and then get mad at companies for providing it."
"I desperately want to kick it and chat with this gal: brilliant woman."
"23:53 shit fuck now it's 12 years"
"I know I'm late saying this, but if the ice age was 4 degrees Celsius lower than the preindustrial average, would we call it the fire age or the flood age when we reach 4 degrees above the preindustrial average?"
"according to my parents, they believe in climate change but people have been saying that the world was ending before (overpopulation, etc) and its less of a big deal than it is made out to be   they suck"
"I don't deny the science, I deny the economics. I fully accept that the world will warm by 2-4 degrees by 2100 and that we are the cause. I simply deny that 2-4 degrees warmer is a big deal. Let Florida fall into the sea. We'll deal with the refugees when the time comes. Our grandchildren are going to live in technological and social utopia compared to what we have today. It's only fair that along with biological immortality, mind uploading, interplanetary colonization and decades of social progress they also inherit a couple of problems to put their cybernetically enhanced brains to work on solving."
"Best video ever!"
"Why did I have to born in this time? I don't want to deal with this bullshit, all the older generations did the damage why do i have to be the one to live with the consequences."
"This is the best video I‚Äôve ever watched on YouTube"
"omg are you vegan bc now i love you even more"
"The music in the beginning is the prelude from Tristan and Isolde, by Richard Wagner, in synths and that tickles me."
"In one of the sited papers, it states that 97% of scientist agree with the statement, 'Human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperature.'  Don't think many would argue against this position.  However, the statement reads, 'significant contributing factor', not the absolute cause of anthropogenic global  warming (AGW).  I believe that the AGW stance has been over sold, and in doing so allowed some to question the whole idea of AGW.  The IPCC has been found falsifying data to support the idea AGW.  I wish we could have a reasonable, truthful discussion about this situation without resorting to lies and misleading statements."

"how dare u indulge in soy products when the cultivation of it is messing up the soil's fertility, how dare u not take responsibility for all the extra floating nitrogen that is required for a healthy microbial enviroment"
"Listen, there's a way to get people like Jackie to care about climate change, it's ugly and problematic, but it'll almost certainly work. When you mention hundreds of millions of refuges, mention that those refuges are brown people, that will IMMEDIATELY get them to go even farther then the green new deal. It's depressing, but it'll probably work."
"what if we stop those industries by stop buying them products we don't need that much stuff"
"These videos are amazing!"
"One thing: E-cars don't really help the environment. The manufacturing of the car batterie alone emits as much as normal cars do. Also, being vegan harms the environment as much as eating meat every day. The best thing you can do is helping the development of hydrogen cars and make sure you find a diet that can be vegan, but if you really want to help the environment, you should especially keep an eye on where the food is from and make sure it is a bio-product."
"0:33 Woof !"
"That's a man, baby."
"I have a very fatalistic point of view on this regard. I'll be clear: Big companies and the great economical and political responsibles and culprits of the climate change won't do anything untill the water reach their throats, and even if in that moment there is something someone can do somewhere to revert the situation, they will probably try to make some economical profit of it or of its supossed solution which means that probably millions will die or suffer. We are going in a slow decline shit road. In this 100 years ride to a somber hell we or our sons will see a lot of shit, and not much relief unless something REALLY drastic is done."
"This is going to sound stupid, but does anyone wonder if we will have the ability to eventually reverse the effects of global warming in the future?"

I was really hopeful that it'd be available here in Australia. Sadly, this is not the case.

"As a vegan I have had the 'Animals were killed farming the vegetables you eat' card played on me so many times...."
"Our overwhelming demand for meat and diary and eggs is the very reason these industries are so big. Little or no demand means no business. Why everyone should go vegan or at least try to whilist advocating for political change. I think saying you are an environmentalist while supporting these inductries is hypocritical and laughable. Along with fast fashion"
"the name of the classical piece playing around 12:37?"
"James M Inhofe (guy who brought the snow ball on to the congressional floor) represents the 1st congressional district in Oklahoma, which is gerrymandered so awfully it looks like a god damn handgun.

"Among other reasons I mostly fight against climate change because I know that whenever there's war and hunger, women suffer the most because of men's  increased frustration and aggression. I once spoke to a female refugee that told me that on the journey from Lybia, almost every woman is raped. Let that sink in. The thought still makes me shudder. Women in third world countries already have it especially bad, they don't deserve a future that's even worse."
"It's astounding how people whose entire careers are founded upon smart investments can't make smart investments."
"You'd think society would realise how bad it is if it makes 18 year old teens like me decide to never have children because I don't want to be responsible for the potential suffering they might go through. I don't understand why people allow governments and oil companies to do this to our planet."

"I am not a denier by any means. However, unfortunately things are a little bit bigger than just science or just politics. In my opinion, I believe that perhaps both sides of this issue or in similar situations. I think that people who believe in the future catastrophes from climate change might be taking it a little too extreme, but I also believe that people who think it doesn‚Äôt exist don‚Äôt take it seriously enough. It is funny the hypocritical nature of using science to invalidate transgender individuals but at the same time not use it to validate the reality of climate change.   All of that being said, the reason that there is such an intense debate about this is because it is hard to know what is the truth. Conservatives aren‚Äôt stupid. Liberals aren‚Äôt stupid. We are just unfortunately tied up in misinformation and out right dishonesty, all of which are used to progress certain agendas. Climate change isn‚Äôt going to be solved by just voting Democrat. I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be solved at all.   Humans are too preoccupied with themselves and what they want and what the political environment is to really truly care. We are self-destructive. I believe that it will get to the point where humankind is at risk for extinction due to Climate change before anyone takes any kind of genuine action. Most actions right now by the people who can enact this type of change are politically motivated and don‚Äôt have genuine support. And all of that aside, this requires the cooperation of the entire World. That means China would have to stop what they‚Äôre doing with their industrial ambitions. That means India has to progress drastically faster than they currently are. Look at the Middle East, they regressed in 50 years faster than they progressed to where they were in the 70s. I of course am referencing areas like Iran and Iraq, and not the entirety of the Middle East.  Look at where America is now. We spent a long time trying to research renewable resources only to come up with virtually nothing, and coming up with technology that is actually worse for the environment. I will of course do everything that I can to support the environment of the planet because I do respect the earth and nature. However, it is na√Øve to believe that we are going to be able to make these changes that we drastically need to make while still being practical with the reality of the current time in order to prevent the catastrophic results that may result from continuing to behave the way that we are in regard to the climate. It‚Äôs like expecting world hunger to be solved. It‚Äôs never going to be solved. There always be groups of people who benefit from the starvation of massive amounts of people and thus True change can never really occur. This is also because people have the wrong idea about how to solve these issues. We just simply do not have the capacity or tools to prevent what will be the inevitable. As much as we don‚Äôt want that to happen."
"After the better part of 2 years fighting to make people aware that we're all gonna die I'd they dont do something I've basically decided...fekk it.  Humanity has proven it isnt worth saving and I'm too sick to survive until the disaster happens anyhow so enjoy your destroyed world Deniers.  ^_^"

The air and the water will recover,  the earth will be renewed. And if it‚Äôs true that plastic is not  degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new  paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesn‚Äôt share our prejudice  toward plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees  plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason  the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted  plastic for itself. Didn‚Äôt know how to make it. Needed us. Could be the  answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question, ‚ÄúWhy are we  here?‚Äù   Plastic‚Ä¶ asshole.'  --George Carlin"

"to be fair, veganism and vegetarianism can't really fix climate change, worldwide-scale plant based diets aren't sustainable and even reclaiming and forming the utopia required for a plant based diet on a planet scale would still require further deforesting, the thing about cattle is that condenses a fuckton of food into a small package; a cow is (give or take) 300kg of food, and 300kg of vegetables occupy a lot of space, also cattle doesn't have one use; it can still be used for leather, milk (which i know isn't neccesary for post adolescent development but still I really like cheese and yogurth and you're gonna have to take it from my cold, dead hands). Recient developments have transformed the methane from dung into fuel making cows and pigs (the most notable methane producers from our food supply alongside fucking rice) a source of energy. BUT consuming less meat is very good for the environment (and health, the medical recomendation for meat is a piece the size of your hand 3 times per week or beef and the 4 remaining days fish or chicken, which very few people follow), it would bring a balance to our food production by requiring less farm spaces, and could reclaim a part of the food supply used to feed cattle (80% IIRC) and use it for more sustainable, more green alternatives than soy; also it's good for our health, since (and this is an issue vegans love to ignore) B12 vitamin deficiency is a very real issue that takes place a lot of time after mantaining a vegan diet, and lifetime B12 supplements arent really nice (or having cereal for breakast your entire lifetime, which is awful) and it's such a late complication (and the only serious one) of veganism that by the time it sets on (the body contains a reserve for 15-20 years of B12 ) you don't really think the issue was caused by veganism."

Studies have shown that cows fed a grass based diet supplemented with a yeast like digestive enzyme can reduce methane production by 50%, so there are possible solutions.

The politicians are just protecting them fat lobby checks while hoping they make enough money to set themselves up to survive the hell on earth theyve helped create, they all have SHTF delusions of grandeur.  A self fulfilling apocolypse fetish for the religious nutters. They will claim it proves their god exists. They hate themselves and humanity that much, mostly due to a lifetime of the self abusive beliefs.  This is why i call abrahamic religion 'the slave religions' since the scriptures are mostly excuses for bullying, sexual predation and using terror to enforce a culture of obeying cruel illogical tyrants then praying for an imaginary friend to 'fix' the suffering their obedience causes, usually via more suffering.

However, (yikes I‚Äôm being a however person), as someone who is a strong believer in capitalism, I have to disagree with the notion that capitalism is unsuited to fix this issue.  Only pure capitalism where the government does literally nothing to businesses will fail.  However, if the government would create incentives for companies to reduce carbon emissions (essentially carbon tax), and start mass funding businesses that will create a renewable energy alternative (with bettering electric/hybrid cars and growing renewable energy sources), we will have a better shot at lowering our effect on the climate.  Incentivize business practices that will make businesses want to change their ways, don‚Äôt force it. The problem really is that so many politicians are corrupt idiots that won‚Äôt do anything at all.  I wouldn‚Äôt even say explicitly vote Democrat because a lot of older Democrats won‚Äôt even do anything about it.  Research into your representatives and hold them accountable!"

"It's called 'climate change' and not 'global warming' because as the Artic loses ice, Antartica gains ice. Why have 'scientists' only placed 8 thermometers in Antartica... where results were the opposite of what their models predicted... and almost 2,000 in the North? Shouldn't the South Pole be studied as much as the North Pole? Shouldn't we have more than 8 thermometers there? For all your talk about the right evading science... the left really hates talking about the South Pole. They also hate simple facts like 'avg temperature' is not the same as 'temperature'. Tell me how many thermometers we need & where they should be placed on Earth to give us the real 'temperature' of the planet. You can't. That's called science. Science is always far more what we don't know, than what we do know. 90% of the 'science' we believed 100 yrs ago it's all been proven wrong. 90% of the 'science' we believe today will be disproven 100 yrs from now. For all we know the magnetic fields control the climate more than greenhouse gases. And water is the principal greenhouse gas. NOT CO2. Another fact liberals hate. Water exists as a solid, liquid, gas. CO2 exists as solid and gas. CO2 can also be oxidized by ozone unlike H2O. So tell me liberals, after we remove all the CO2, or just a portion, and the temperature doesn't come down which it won't... will you start protesting water vapor? Why not? Why aren't you protesting water vapor right now? Because WATER is also the main byproduct of combustion, not CO2. There's always more hydrogen in fuels than carbon. Why protest the oxides of carbon, and not hydrogen? Answer me snowflakes."

"I'm a tree hugging environmentalist who was angry (... albeit mostly about corporations dumping toxic chemicals on neighborhoods like mine) who  hated an inconvenient truth because Al Gore took work that was (mostly) not his, attributed it to himself and put the truth into a political campaign.

Now watch  me not discredit the argument with interjections about me. oh- I see you've watched three seconds of science. why don't you swallow it down with more probably untrue stories about ME'   He didn't make it political, but he did very much use it to get attention to himself and turn the entire movie, including very fucking important information! that would have been great for a wide audience to see! into a god damned commercial.   ... and south park was not good about discerning  the narcissistic rambling of Al Gore and the fact that he was presenting an important problem.

"Change... it's what the climate has always done.  Climate is not a static thing.  Remember the last Ice  Age?  Probably not, but I'd rather see global warming than global cooling.  The thing is, whether you believe that human activity has made a significant change in the climate or not, you're assuming that we can just 'change it back'.  We can't.  There are just too damned many of us, and we all need to eat, and stay within a temperature range conducive to life.  We all fart, and exhale carbon dioxide, and yet there is only 4/100's of 1% CO2 in our atmosphere.   Ironically, had it not been for fossil fuels, there would be far fewer humans walking the Earth today, and far less human impact on the planet, but such is evolution, and human evolution includes the development of a carbon-based economy upon which we depend for our very survival.  Try to imagine the social and economical impact of tearing apart the very fabric that sustains us and tenuously binds us together.  You mention climate refugees, yet nearly all refugees today are due to war or economic reasons.  Anything that significantly disrupts our modern economy is guaranteed to have people rioting in the streets.  It's already happening in France and other places.   The only thing that remains the same, is the fact that everything always changes... and we learn to adapt and evolve.  We do not and can not control our destiny on a global scale.  Nature has many self-regulating systems that come into play when things get too far out of balance... like human overpopulation has.  Nature will take its course in due time."
"Oh boy, one I never got to use before on YouTube! -As a scientist-  even though I'm not a climatologist people will occasionally come up to me and say 'so you're a scientist, all this global warming stuff, is it really that big of a deal?'

Because at least that would be an understandable reason based on need.  Rather than the entire reason our world is on the brink of disaster being... money. Not even money to do anything with, money for the sake of money. The richest people in the world rarely spend more then a fraction of a percent of their net worth yearly. What do they use the rest on? To make more money. To do what? Make more money.  Because to them, rather than life or death, peoples well being, the health of the planet we live on, and even basic moral fiber are meaningless against the game, the *sport*, of simply acquiring more wealth."
"tl;dr: 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions. They have a lot of money. They give money to politicians to protect themselves from government regulations. Politicians misdirect the public with conspiracy theories so we don't rise up and demand regulation. If you cause enough confusion people don't want to bother to think about the issue anymore, and decades go by while the problem gets worse and the business make $$$. If you don't believe in climate change, follow the money. Was the person telling you climate change is a lie given money to side with businesses? The funny thing is, there IS a conspiracy, it's just not the one the politician is telling you to believe in.   It's scary how easily we let companies manipulate us. They know they're hurting people, but as long as they make money they don't care. Look at fast fashion, look at sugar and processed foods, etc. They'd rather pay off politicians and fill consumers minds with conspiracy theories. And sadly people fall for it every day."

"waterworthkane@gmail.com Call for action:"
"Reform of Gene Technology Act (2000) and Gene Technology Regulations (2001)."
""
"The net result of the Act and Regulations is an over cautious prohibition of action on environmental and economic imperatives. While caution is warranted in protecting human health the Act and Regulations are unsuitability for the modern World. This lack of timeliness has been highlighted by the Regulator itself pointing out the law being irrelevant to the modern world. Furthermore competing policy perspectives across jurisdictions, government and stakeholders and multiple committees resulting a mere deluge of recommendations that are rarely put to action. The law fails the environment, the economy and ultimately the Australian people."

"Environmental imperative"

"Australia faces an unprecedented environmental challenge in the effects of global warming and accompanying extreme weather events. We are experiencing unprecedented drought, bush fires, calape of entire ecosystems (Darling River System and Great Barrier Reef), unprecedented melting of Artic and Antartic ice sheets (warmest winter temperatures in 115000 years). The ultimate extend of this greenhouse effect occurs on Earth‚Äôs nearest planetary neighbor Venus. On Venus a runaway greenhouse effect makes all life impossible and surface temperatures melt metals. We can only assume that we are headed this way."
""
"The only proven way to reduce global warming is to improve photosynthesis. A Global cooling event occurred around 49 million years ago through more photosynthesis. Australia should allow improved photosynthesis which can be achieved through GMOs. GMOs should be used to reverse global warming an economic incentive to achieve this can be in built through crop production."

"Economic imperative"
"Australia‚Äôs economy has traditionally been said to ‚Äòride on the sheep's back‚Äô referring to the economy dependence that Australia has on the wool industry. In the 1960s this was disrupted through synthetic fibers such as nython and Australia suffered an economically crippling supply glut and falling export prices that lasted over twenty years. However a problem like this is a mere ripple compared to the tsunami of synthetic biology. Bolt threads (US) has sold spider silk beanies and risen $230 million in capital, and now acquired ‚Äòbest made‚Äô retail company (they are gearing up for something big). They can mass produce spider silk through fiber proteins using GMOs and fermentation extraction.

Sure our electrecity is not 100% clean.. yet but there is a lot of changes. Stoping eating meat is not a solution, but reducing it, is a thing. Eating a chicken that comes from less than 100km instead of a fish or a lamb that comes form New Zeland or an avocado that comes from central america. (I'm from those that won't stop eating meat because if the entire planet went vegetarian it wouldn't change a thing, methane and carbon dioxyde are not the only thing that makes the temperature rise. A vegeterian planet is not a solution)  But all those efforts don't change a thing, the temperature is still rising faster and faster every day. Why?  Because the biggest countries don't take the responsability of it. The companies are responsible too. Principally USA and Brazil. China making actually a huge progress in ecology even if it's still not enough to compensate they're coal/charcoal industry, they are making progress. India being to poor to do anything. I'm not saying at any point that Europe hasn't a part of responsability in the climate change, I want to make that clear: Everyone has to do something!

Don't get me wrong, I love the pleasures of western civilization and I'd like to keep all the good and shiny things I own. But in my humble opinion, we can't have it both ways.  We can't have smartphones, makeup, plenty of clothes, coffee, a Prius, fulltime jobs, enough money to buy enough shit and still stop 'The Apocalypse'.   I'm 37 years old and I have worked for 3 years of my life. The other time I spend mostly living off around 600‚Ç¨ a month, I never owned a car, the last time I've been flying was over 20 years ago and I basically wear my clothes until they fall apart.  There were times in my life when I had money (earning >3k‚Ç¨ a month) and you know what I did? I bought shit. Because, fuck it, what else should I do? Shit that was produced by people who drive to work by car (emissions!) to earn money to buy other shit that was produced by other people, also driving cars (emissions).....you get the point. It's this neverending circle of working, manufacturing, delivering, selling and buying shit shit shit.  Now I know I don't make a difference. And if I had money I'd spend it on pleasures. But I don't and I can't be bothered to work for a living to basically sell my life to buy shit.  What I can do though is ride my bike to go by the river to read books, play the guitar, all for free."

"Rebuttal: Ich muss nicht vegan leben, weil ich Vegetarier bin und mit einer Veganerin zusammen bin, scheint mir der Dislogismus der Welt zu sein, #throbacktoteun  Daf√ºr gibt es eine hier legitime: 19:18  DJ-ing.  Wenn ich dieses Semester irgendwas noch mehr verstanden habe, dann dass die Geschichte der Philosophie ein dauerndes Scheitern ist, Skeptizismus zu widerlegen.

"Gore is not 'right' cause he makes a ton of different claims which, claims based on speculation can't be lumped together with claims based on evidence.  -Climate change has been happening for many many years. And scientists have known about it for all this time. Its not new. -People that claim that releasing carbon into the atmosphere over many many decades doesn't actually change the greenhouse effect are as ignorant as people that claim that fairies are real and the earth is flat. No hate. Just sayin. PHYSICS, like thermodynamics, can't be argued with. But the actual effects of those physics on our way of life? That actually can be argued till the day the outcome happens.  -Al Gore is trying to get the public to change its ways all while getting MASSIVELY wealthy from the very thing he's supposedly fighting against. -Al Gore is a hypocrite when his houses and private jet travel FAR eclipse ANY carbon emissions from ANY individual from the 'lower classes.' Why can't he fly commercial? Even business class? Cause....well....EW! right?...rich people are assholes.... -We have NO idea what the REAL effect climate change will have over the next decades. We can make models. But factors unknown will come about. For example, what if additional rain makes plant life thrive opening new carbon sinks that would make our current models incorrect? what if new aquatic species form because of the salinity and ph changes which also become a stronger carbon sink than todays models predict? WE DON'T KNOW what will happen.   Anyway Natalie, great video as always. I wish I could side with liberals. I like liberals. They hate religion and I believe they honestly just want people to have good lives. I just can't. Liberals are wrong about so much. So are conservatives. But conservatives are correct about economics and that effects EVERYone. Keep your gay marriage, abortion, etc, and stop trying to change the capitalist economic system to a socialist/communist thing. That's all I want. The carbon tax thing will not end up a free trade thing if liberals have their way (visavie the 'new green deal'). Make it a free trade thing, like a market where carbon credits are traded openly and transparently, I'm fine with it like they did in Australia. But if liberals had their way, the government would simply tell the EPA to go close any company that is a 'polluter.' Keep the government out of business. They shouldn't be doing anything but making rules everyone can live with and enforcing  those rules. But climate change, at least right now, is an excuse to fuck people up, take yet MORE of our income, and that is not a good thing."

"Have you ever read 'A State Of Fear' by  Michael Crichton  (HarperCollins, 2004)? A year and a half later came Al Gore's 'An Inconvenient Truth' (2006). Both are fiction although Crichton makes no claim otherwise. He does, however, list some data that Gore would likely find inconvenient. Personally I think that mankind has little to do with the climate, and can do very little about it. More CO2 will contribute to more plant growth and if more trees were planted, more oxygen would result. No mention is made in IPCC regarding the role the Earth's orbit and axial tilt play in how much sunlight reaches the northern and southern hemispheres. It only notes that the amount of sunlight reaching Earth is constant. However due to the axial tilt, the light that reaches the northern (and southern) halves varies as the earth orbits the sun. And the orbital path varies in in the shape of the ellipse it describes, from more circular to lengthier. I find this argument more compelling than blaming CO2 as a greenhouse gas monster. Water vapor has the most significant greenhouse effect. Just FYI. Aside from that I really enjoy your videos. Keep 'em coming for as long as Dark Mother allows."

"hello, i love your videos! I dunno if my comment will be seen by anyone but i just want to talk about something i'm very passionate about- which is the future of agriculture! i know you mentioned going vegan to reduce your carbon footprint on the planet, but did you know that animal agriculture- if done right- cannot only regenerate farmland killed off by intensive crop farming BUT can create carbon sinks to reduce carbon in the atmosphere http://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/animalsciencesdept/2016/06/22/cows-carbon-neutral/ rotational grazing of cattle on pastures will increase the fertility of the land, which in turn can be used for growing produce in a rotational manner. this not only maintains the health of land, but eliminates most use of pesticides and fertilizers (both of which contribute to the death of many native bee populations and run off into bodies of water). these are just snippets of the solutions ive learned in school- there are many agriculture solutions to this, and i believe they can be the first step into turning our global plight around. We will always need to feed our population- so why not first make sure we are doing so sustainably"

"Reactions to veganism demonstrate what is perhaps the greatest disparity between the harmlessness of a practice and the anger it induces in others. You'd think vegans were eating aborted fetuses and not simply excluding one type of food from their diet, the way every vaguely-right-leaning shithead has it out for them.  Yes, I've met obnoxious vegans. But they seem to be for the most part recent converts who almost always give it up after a while."

"Came to a revelation while watching the video.  Why do we think that 'shareholders' of companies only care about short term gain and are not concerned with the long term affects of their recklessness and irresponsibility. Because there is a mentality that exists for, I would guess, a LOT of Americans that if you are rich, you can avoid being affected. That if you are rich, you can avoid the consequences of your actions.  And it's no wonder people have this mentality, we CONSTANTLY see rich people not held accountable for their actions or not being punished to near the same extent as less wealthy people who commit much smaller crimes. I honestly believe that changing this mentality by making sure that rich people are as accountable for their responsibility will go a long way to making people care more about long term consequences of short term actions.  Personally, and this may seem ridiculous to a lot of you, I see this disregard of consequences is in the video game industry. Shareholders of video game companies are more than likely not interested in the industry, so the short term profit that leads to the destruction of the industry in the long term is of no importance to them because they do not participate in the industry, they only make money off of it. By the same token, I think a lot of people don't think they participate in society, so they don't see societal problems as something they care about.  Idk, people like this really upset me but I don't know what to do about it."
"I think my favorite (read: worst) part of the average climate change denier's rhetoric is that scientists HAVE to publish reports backing up global climate change in order to keep getting funding, a position that they probably picked up from a piece of propaganda created and paid for by big oil companies who have by FAR more money involved than any climatologist. The mental gymnastics is astounding. If mental gymnastics was a sport, the gold medal would definitely go to climate change deniers, the silver to flat earthers, and the bronze would go to poor people who support Republican fiscal policy."
"Ooof, was not expecting Ted Cruz in this video. Always a killjoy."

Living in the UK, away from the stuff going on in America, Russia and China and completely unable to affect it, surrounded by oil companies that just won't die. No matter where I put my vote it doesn't seem like anything substantial will ever get done. 12 years isn't long enough for the climate change deniers to die of old age, they're going to keep not caring because it won't be their children dying in these catastrophes but it will be mine."

In fact it's not really that hard of a problem to solve, we have the technology.   The dumbass politicians and evil lizard capitalists can't do anything about it, if they do they won't get elected or consumers won't buy their products.  All the young people, who climate change will affect the most, have to do to stop it is vote.  Just get off their asses every couple of years and vote.    They don't even need to be convinced climate change is real or that we should do something about it, they already believe that.  Young people are big enough portion of the population that they could easily swing elections if they would vote.  But they don't vote so maybe we should blame climate change on them."

Right now to stop it we would need to return immediately to pre industrial emissions. To save the glaciers anyway. We're past the point of no return on them. We've had a good fifty or sixty years to do something and the generations before us decided they'd be dead before they had to worry about it and money needed to be made.  The good news is. The earth will be just fine. Totally fine. It will still be here. The bad news is... Well it just may not be habitable for most species to go on. It won't be the first mass extinction and probably not the last. So yeah. We're screwed."

If you live in a nice place like me you have no good selfish reasons to care about climate change.   I care mostly as an excuse to incentivize green tech.

The I.R. would have never happened if not for digging up and burning dead dinosaurs (coal) in the first place. And it continues to this day..."
"My problem with climate change is that it seems really difficult to understand unless you study a ridiculus amount of papers and have a scientific background. I sometimes watch different points of view, but there's always a guy that has a counter argument. What I would like the most is to have a lot of debates about it between knowledgeable people, so I can see them better resolve the arguments. I've tried looking for debates but they are scarce, and the few there are, usually the person who fully supports the climate change stance is less articulated, and frankly has worse arguments.  Still, from what I've gathered, it seems that there is such a thing as climate change, and at least a portion of it is caused by humanity. How much climate change? not sure. How much a portion is caused by humanity? not sure.  And above all else, what the fuck do we do about it? When it comes to actual policies and measures, there are some reasonable arguments that what we have to do is A LOT, so much, that all treaties about it do essentially nothing even if followed. At least today, it seems we can't support anything close to a modern way of life without fosil fuels, that wouldn't cost a whole lot more with other energy sources.  I'm all for trying to solve problems, but suggesting stuff that doesn't do anything just because we want to feel good about ourselves doesn't seem a good plan to me. There's probably a lot of things we can do, that collectively contribute almost nothing. I want to know what are the things we can do that do make a difference, that can actually reduce or stop the problem in a significant amount.  I heard an economist say that the best we can do for climate change is invest in research for alternative energy sources, so they can become viable mainstream. Most other things seemed to do so little or have such negative side effects they are unrealistic.  By the way, I'd love to see a debate between the main exponents of each side, if anyone has a link."

"I'd like every self-righteous vegan in the comments to read this article from Contrapoints' own approved source, Skeptical Science:  https://skepticalscience.com/animal-agriculture-meat-global-warming.htm  Animal agriculture in the developed world provides only a small fraction (6% in the US) of carbon emissions, and most of that is beef. If you live in a developed country, cutting out ALL animal products from your diet would have a negligible effect on the environmental impact of your nation compared to cutting out beef, and only a minor effect compared to not doing anything (even assuming everyone did it).  On the other hand, cutting out fossil fuels alone would be enough to make your country almost fully stop contributing to climate change (the source is the linked article above that estimates developed country GHG emissions from fossil fuels at 80%, as well as the EU Roadmap 2050 (http://www.roadmap2050.eu/project/roadmap-2050) that sets the goal for a sustainable economy at 80% less GHG emissions).  TL;DR: Veganism is completely unnecessary to stop climate change, and it doesn't even help that much."
"great video"
"I wpuod argue that most people who deny climate change also believe in gravity (which is technically a theory developed by physisists, experts in their fields of study, while being backed by evidence) it is incredibly ironic that  they don't believe in man made global warming (which is technically a theory developed by climatologists, experts in their fields of study, while being backed by evidence) it blows my mind how much of an idiot our president is, he might as well be a flat earther"
"I support and have always supported the EPA. I'm not a climate change 'denier,' at all, but the end of this video is weak and highlights the huge issue we have today about climate change. It basically supports the idea that we are helpless. For years, I have been saying that it doesn't matter that much whether climate change is 'true' or not; what really matters is what solutions are being proposed and how much will they help us or hurt us. I got excited when this video mentioned that it would actually tell me what I can do. And then, it basically told me that I couldn't really do anything that matters. What is the real answer to 'just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions'? How do we reduce the emissions of those companies without giving up what we want from what those companies produce? Could we get real about practical solutions?"

It's part of an orchestral piece, I think, but I honestly can't temember if it's from a soundtrack or if it's a classical piece, or what!  I really want to recall the name of the piece I'm thinking of b/c I LOVE the full piece and I want to look it up & listen to it.  Gah!  Does that segment of music (repeats several times) remind anyone of a tune whose title they can recall?"

"Hi! With regards to a massive general strike, I noticed you were in contact with the #EarthStrike movement in preparation for this video. It's a promising new organization that has been endorsed by many prominent leftists including Noam Chomsky and David Graeber. We're only a few weeks old right now, and we're still trying to get off the ground and spread our reach. To this end, you've built up an impressive following among our primary target demographic - young, leftist, and online - and an official shoutout from you, maybe in the video description, would mean a great deal. We're organizing three global protests for 2019, culminating in a general strike on September 27. Our mission statement, list of demands, and information about national and local campaigns can be found on our official website at https://earth-strike.com."

How did I not find this channel before? Well spoken and reasonable, and don't get me started on how much effort can be seen you put into every video. Kudos."
"I've always believed in climate change and thought it was a serious issue, but watching this video made me realise how serious it actually is.  The main reason I've recently decided to go vegetarian is because I can no longer eat meat without thinking about where it came from and wondering how much the animal suffered to bring me this food, but watching your video definitely gave me more reasons to do it.  Even though I'm not going vegan yet (though I would like to try it in the future), I would like to reduce my dairy intake and have been trying different kinds of milks that aren't made with dairy.  I've also been trying to just be more environmentally friendly in general by reducing the amount of plastic I use.  I've even recently been considering buying a bike for some of my travelling around town instead of using my car so much, though I live in Australia and it's summer now so it is bloody hot outside at the moment.  Anyway, thank you so much for making this video.  Making content like yours can't always be easy, but I'm so glad you do it."

"South Park even admitted they were wrong about that one. They later had an episode where Gore turned out to be right. There are actually a lot of people coming around on this.   Even Stephen Crowder is slowly changing his view over time. He hasn't fully accepted that humans are responsible, and he's a die-hard libertarian so the idea of regulating companies is a bit hard for him to take. But the point is: the facts of climate change are becoming so clear and so apparent, that even the most stubborn climate change skeptics are coming around. Hell, I was a denier until around 2004ish."

"Dude, I'm vegan and I'll admit steak is fucking delicious.  Let's be honest, being vegan is not an easy choice and is one you have to make cuz you actually want to based on your own belief system. I went vegan not cuz I think eating meat is murder (and i would never tell anyone that because it is a very opinionated stance). I am vegan cuz i think the quality of mass produced meat is gross as well a cruel (which is different from thinking its murder). Same with dairy. I dont believe its good for you.  There is a reason why many people are lactose intolerant. But again I will say, everyone needs to come to their own reason as to why they stop eating meat. If not, it will be a short, inconsistant diet. So decide to become vegan or vegetarian based on an informed and individualistic belief. Whether it be because of humane reasons, health reasons or cuz you really want PETA to blow you. Just dont shame anyone for having a different belief please."

"Thank you for your videos. I'm vegan for environmental reasons, plus for my own health and the animals themselves. Other changes individuals can make are using bamboo toothbrushes, resuseable bags for food shopping, menstrual cups and enjoying the clothes you currently own instead of regularly clothes shopping. I agree that we need to target the big companies (I plan on doing so via activism) but I think we can couple this by making changes in our own lives (changes I've been pleased to realise that simplify my life and save me money- happy days).

"Can we please learn what the word 'theory' in scientific contexts means. 'Theories' are the graduation of scientific models when sufficient attempts to disprove a hypothesis fails. It is as confident a statement as is possible within the scientific community and everything we know and use in science is a theory. Theories are only broken when something disproves it and the disproof is repeatable and verifiable. So to be abundantly clear, a theory doesn't imply uncertainty, it is the word given to models and explanations of the highest degree of confidence that the scientific method is capable of providing. If you're going with the argument that 'X is just a theory', then you may as well throw out everything else we know about science along with it because everything we know about it is derived by the same methods."

"@Contrapoints:   I genuinely enjoy all of your work here quite a bit.  However, I find it difficult to agree with you on this issue not from a general sense ('Hey, we should definitely care about our actions and their effects on ecologies, local & global), but in a specific scientific sense - we just don't have enough data currently to predict anything at all about future climatic structures.  I say climatic structures, because it is very possible that we are seeing a fractured climate compare to the normal, with warmer arctic areas, and relatively unchanged tropics (which is what is currently happening) with very different weather, but rather similar climate (ie, big, stronger tropical storms, but generally similar tropical temperatures).  For instance, Siberia, prior, and in some areas even during the last ice age, contained massive prairies, and sustained ecologies strong enough to feed herds of mastodons.  Is that good? Bad? For who? How?  Also we rarely take in account the role of the Sun in our climate.  Many scientists are claiming that a future cool down of the Sun (temporarily) is coming, per its own 'weather' cycles, which will significantly affect the amount of heat which reaches our planet in the first place.  Again, good?  bad?  no one knows because we severely lack the necessary data to predict this.  Are oil companies shitty?  Of course.  Should people be vegan? Yes, for many reasons.  Are we all going to die in an infernal climate change apocalypse?  Not at all likely unless an incredibly specific number of instances occur over the next century, given absolutely no change in our technological capacity, and assuming current if not larger growth patterns from economic and population stances....  it is very very much an idea with a basis in reality, but not a tested, tried and true theory.  Buttttttt all in all, I love this page and all of your thoughts, and I can't wait for the next one!"
"I had a conversation with people on climate change and how were all gonna die becuase of it at the world's going to end.

"That ocean hat is amazing."
"Please, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't reducing our emissions just delay the 'apocalypse'? Or is it a way it could be stopped or reversed?"
"So we went from the 'Greenhouse effect', to 'Global Warming', to 'Climate Change', all in the space of 30 years.  Every single climate science prediction has been incorrect on a grand scale.   I remember learning about the 'Greenhouse Effect' at school, when I was 10 years old.  My teacher told me that scientists has proven that by the year 2010 the earth would have warmed by 5 degrees.  Utter nonsense, as it turned out.   I am not claiming that humans have no affect on the warming of the planet, I believe we do.  I simply don't believe we are to blame for the whole lot.    If you look at the worst offenders, China, the USA, India, and Russia are disaster zones.  The country I lie has very low carbon emissions, and I will not take on collective guilt for what a minority of countries are doing to the planet, when I have nothing to do with these countries.     Instead of putting a blanket carbon tax on everyone, we should consider that cattle produce a huge amount of Co2, and if we all went meat free it would have the most positive effect on the planet.     Also taxing gas guzzling 4x4's like Jeeps and Land Rovers should be a priority.  People should be driving small, semi electric cars unless they can prove they need the vehicle for their business, or they have more than 3 children in their family under the age of 18.    For those who want to drive around in a huge 4x4 Land Rover or similar with only one person in the vehicle, new laws should be made taxing the hell out of them.  People need to be more responsible in their choice of vehicle.    These two measures would make a massive difference to the planet.  Knowing that 2/3rds of the non-ice covered land mass of the planet is used for animal agriculture (and food in general) is disgusting!     On the same amount of land it takes to 'grow' 1 kilogram of beef you can grow 100 kilos of potatoes or tomatoes, and use FAR less water.  We also would save energy and land growing all the grain that the animal agriculture industry needs to feed the cattle.   This land could then be used for growing non-meat products, and we would have about half of the land left over for green energy usage like wind turbines, solar panels and other (hopefully better) forms of green energy.  I believe nuclear energy is a much better option than crude oil and coal.  We should be spending money on developing Thorium nuclear reactors because the current 'green energy' options are simply not good enough to sustain us as a species.     Carbon taxes just hurt the poor though, and are a terrible idea.  Tax private jets.  Tax 4x4 vanity vehicles, tax luxury products which use a lot of energy to make, and start finding alternatives to fossil fuel based plastics (like hemp plastics which bio-degrade).     Also, stop blaming the everyday person.  Blame the governments in conjunction with multi-nationals who don't give a rats ass about the planet, as long as they can make some short term cash."

Drinking straws are an accessibility measure, necessary for people who have defects that prevent them from drinking directly from a glass or people like me with overly sensitive teeth.  The amount of plastic waste produced by drinking straws in negligible.  Meanwhile I can't even buy the simplest of products at the store without it containing massive amounts of plastic packaging in addition to all the plastic grocery bags.  The burden of fixing these problems can't be on us because we are left with few to no options.  We can attempt to be conscientious with our purchases and bring reusable bags to the store, but more often than not we simply have no option but to either get the products we need and increase plastic waste or go without.  The burden must instead be placed on these companies producing these products to choose different materials without increasing the price point for us. And yet despite all of this, a pointless band-aid fix of banning straws just punishes the consumer and disabled people.  The system is broken from top to bottom because in order to do the change in materials like I said, it would increase manufacturing cost.  I say don't push that expense on the consumer, so the companies will take it out on employees.  Meanwhile, the owners and CEOs won't see a single change in their salaries.  It's all bad.  Revolution at this point really is the only option.  Revolution over straws, yes, I really did get to here from straws.  I will make my sign out of straws."

"'Damn Republicans politicizing the issue ‚Ä¶ Also, vote Dem in 2020 !'. Niiiice.

Kinda made people not want to give an inch. Also, No matter how convinced people are that yelling 'DO SOMETHING !' is a plan in itself, it isn't.

Really, its Multinationalist energy corp.s that run the show, im pretty sure the hand full of giant container ships that bring goods from china to usa emit more co2 than all american cars combined, so one really cant blame the middle class republican driving a Hummer,  when we all buy stuff made in china.

"One small critique/frustration I have.   We are still so locked in the battle with lizardfolk about the existence of climate change that there isn't enough (any) attention being paid in the public discourse to the need that we need to look past carbon emission reduction and towards carbon reclaimation/capture solutions.   This is a message we created and we (humans I mean) are on the hook for cleaning it up as well. That's a positive message that has the potential to energize people even more than AOC and the Green New Deal can.  I just discovered your channel yesterday, Natalie, and have been binging (and now supporting) your work. So please know I'm very, very impressed with your work.i hope you'll hear this as a hope for more information in the future and nit any sort of demeaning criticism of this video."
"The problem is climate scientists aren‚Äôt engineers.  They only can present the cause of the problem, not the solution.  Presenting problems without also having solutions in hand tends to be a turn off.  What we needed and still need is engineering solutions to reduce emissions without an increase in cost and without compromising on quality of life and comfort.  Elon Musk is a good start with the Tesla, but we also need Manhattan project level funding of nuclear fusion, and development of carbon neutral    Farming technologies and development of carbon sequestration technologies.  Instead of living in vegan teepees, we need to use science to science our way out of this mess.  Of course the problem is that many people with lets just say left of center political views see climate change as an opportunity to try and impose change that has little to do with addressing climate change and more to do with dismantling capitalism which they see as a cause of climate change so why not kill two birds with one stone.    This of course is dumb because it hardens moderate and yes conservatives hearts from wanting to take any action.  In this way leftists tend to be unhelpful at times in terms of actually building consensus and getting anything useful done.  Your passion does you credit, but it‚Äôs often overkill."
"'To name Gaia ‚Äì that is to say, to associate an assemblage of material processes that demand neither to be protected nor to be loved, and which cannot be moved by the public manifestation of our remorse, with the intrusion of a form of transcendence into our history ‚Äì ought not especially to shock most scientists. They themselves are in the habit of giving names to what they recognize has the power to make them think and imagine ‚Äì and this is the very sense of the transcendence that I associate with Gaia. Those who have set up camp in the position of the guardians of reason and progress will certainly scream about irrationality.

"Great video, but the ending seems indicative that you're in favor of pandering to the right and creating a climate narrative suited to their worldview which is the very cause of our crises in the first place. The problem, just as much as the specific 100 companies, is capitalism's systemic antagonistic outlook on nature. If we want to solve this problem, we can't just craft a bipartisan bridge by using their own rhetoric, because that exact outlook is how we got here; we need to fundamentally change our cultural outlook on nature to one of mutualistic synergy instead of exploitation and domination. Yeah, sounds vague and abstract as fuck, but there are projects to do exactly that in (oh man, Appeal to Rojava should be documented as a leftist informal fallacy) Rojava (Make Rojava Green Again in particular), in order to repair the wartorn, terrorized landscape and preserve the other pillars of their revolutionary project including cultural preservation, gender liberation and radical democracy. Maybe I took the ending too literally, but that's how it came off to me. If we want to give people an enemy, it should be institutionalized hierarchies and those who protect it for their own personal gain at the expense of the rest of the world."

"No one wants to go nuclear or study hydrogen production. Not even the left understands the correct energy solutions to this problem. If you think a lithium battery solar power grid is the solution you haven't actually done proper research either. Solar is cheap, Nuclear is not, Lithium is expedient, Hydrogen is not. The left is giving token amounts of funding to the wrong areas and lording themselves over the right. If something is worth doing it's worth doing correctly, especially saving the fucking planet. And no, driving a hybrid or electric car doesn't reduce emissions, driving a used, a small car does. You know people who buy electric cars constantly replace those things right? Those cars have such a shitty resale value because they don't fucking last. Again, lithium batteries are dog shit when hydrogen doesn't degrade over time. See you're not doing the research either. This is why I won't sign on with the left as a moderate, even though climate change is a huge issue for me, the moral superiority of not actually fixing the fucking problem is obscene."

I have always loved your use of multiple characters. The Sea Mom was really awesome in this vid. I... don't love your use of reptilians in the context of them being a dogwhistle for antisemitism. Whether you are Jewish or not (and if you've ever mentioned it, I haven't seen every video), I really think it would be responsible to address this. It's obvious you aren't trying to seeeecretly instill antisemitism into your viewership, but how you use reptilians seems to just be putting the caricature on a powerful group of people without addressing that it's a caricature used against marginalized people. I'm saying something because you are very talented and influential and I adore your content and want to see it continue being influential among leftists. The current culture - maybe the same as it's always been - is extremely critical and I know you're getting a lot of heat from all sides, so I hope my message doesn't come in too hot.

"You had me up til the 'Pure, clean, natural foods' comment. Love your work and will continue to be a loyal viewer and yes, commercial ranching is highly problematic but so is commercial farming. The hard shift from 'Eat less red meat' to preaching the virtues of veganism was jarring, especially after criticising meat eaters for the same behaviors. There are legitimate arguments for eating meat because we are omnivores.  There are also legitimate arguments for plant based diets so long as that diet includes appropriate vitamins and dietary supplements. If you are going to advocate a plant based diet please also advocate the use of high quality dietary supplements. While most B Complex vitamins and Omega 3 supplements are made from animal biproducts there are some decent synthetic supplements on the market.  While I'm sure this comment will either be ignored or treated as an assault against vegans this is an important issue. In fact it's the most important issue humanity has ever faced since the advent of the atom bomb. The potential end of human life on earth can not be taken lightly. As you clearly stated, the overwhelming majority of C02 production is the result of a handful of major corporations and separating one's plastics from their aluminum and going vegan, though making us feel better about ourselves, aren't going to make any tangible difference. What will, also as you clearly stated, is getting involved politically.  Just a few thoughts, keep up the good work and thank you."

People immediately panic and get defensive when they even *think* about not everyone having infinite babies. One child (and the cost of raising it) contributes 58.6 tonnes of carbon per year. Yet no one wants to talk about having less kids. Luckily, the rising cost of living has had an effect on global birth rates."
"Ok, I'm from Australia here, and I literally didn't even know there were people who deny global warming until Trump was elected. And it's pretty disgusting that someone is willingly putting the US above hundreds of other nations.

"I agree sith the vast majority of this video, though the pushing veganism thing kind of discredits the video as a whole slightly. I agree that people need to be more conscientious of what they're consuming, but removing all animal products really isn't the answer. Removing some could help the environment, but some are honestly beneficial and we would be worse off without them.   A lot of vegetable farming relies directly on animal farming to be efficient, or benefits from it greatly. Livestock consumes a lot of wastes that we dont use from farming, like corn shucks and stalks.Using manure is better than fertilizers in most cases, as manure releases nutrients gradually and has less destructive runoff than chemical fertilizers. Making clothes from cotton and wool is much better for the environment than various synthetic plastics that break down slightly every time they are washed and release particles into the water that will never break down.   Not to mention some animal products are able to be used without harm to the animals if it is done ethically. Animal consumption will never stop. And honestly, it shouldn't. Its much more effective and realistic to advocate for the consumption of more ethically and responsibly acquired animal products than it is to advocate for them being removed entirely. Like acquiring eggs and meat from local farmers or companies that are more responsible. Boycotting all animal products just gives more power to large industries and makes smaller and less destructive farmers struggle."

We don't control the world we only live on it. At any point a disease or a natural disaster could pop up and wipe us out. So if fifteen percent of world or The West wants to do something about we have to deal with countries with Billions of people that have no real interest in doing ANYTHING about improving the environment. And we can't make them do it short of holding gun to their head. Also it's hard to pay attention to anything when it's coming from a half naked chick in a bathtub."

"Denialism is hardly the real problem. The problem is the scope of social change required to stop man made climate change and the lack of (political) will to do so. Even if every Paris goal was met, warming would only be kept to an additional 3 degrees, and no one is on track to meet their goals. If anything the denialism is a consequence of this, not its root cause. As Gore said: the truth is inconvenient. Companies polluted on consumer‚Äôs behalf. Ultimately it is consumer‚Äô fault."

"Great episode as always! I think the only thing I might object too, as a certified poor person, that eating pure vegan is less expensive. Things like lentils and beans are absolutely cheaper but a lot of the other types of food like barley, brown rice, and quinoa especially can be astronomically expensive due to market factors, pricing out the poorest people out of a vegan diet, especially when consuming a vegan diet requires a tad more monitoring of certain nutrients that you might miss out on if you're not careful. I don't disagree with the premise that  you should go vegan if you can, but I think the principle should generally be to do the most good you CAN do, since especially in the age of super mergers and international conglomerates, consumer choices are not as impactful as before and, as you said, corporations produce 71 percent of emissions so consumers can't make the difference alone.   I personally try to pile what vegetables I can and tend to go for chicken and eggs over fish and ESPECIALLY beef, but when I have to choose between a filling meal (or whatever the food bank provides) and a measly amount of vegetable, I'm going with the option where I don't starve.  As I always say, money doesn't buy happiness but it buys choices. Especially consumer choices to make bigger individual contributions to help reduce the effects of global warming."

"It's still bugs me that the ManBearPig episode caught on the way it did, I think it did have a pretty big effect on how a lot of people view climate change (and Al Gore).  I generally like south park, but that episode always made me furious,  Al Gore was SO over the top and so annoying.  But south park and its creators did issue an apology earlier this year about ManBearPig, and made an episode this past season addressing how they were wrong, and that climate change is a real threat (the episode is about how people are still ignoring it despite the fact that it's a huge terrifying undeniable monster at this point.)   I think Al Gore is still a doofus in it, but ... well, it's still good that they admitted this."

"12:27 It said 'On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground' not the Earth. Contrapoints debunked."
"There is one piece of good news here: public health has already been looking into the 'Angry Jack Effect' for years now. Of course, that sector has its own name for it: reactance. The knee-jerk response which results from any perceived restriction on personal freedom, no matter how well-meaning or minuscule. Turns out that if you're looking to make somebody quit smoking, one of the worst ways of doing so is to tell them, 'you should quit smoking.' This is especially true if you are in some position of authority, even nebulous authority; this is why doctors regularly face this. After all, they are in the business of trying to improve people's health, but faced with what could be seen as a limitation on their freedom from an authority figure, the average smoker's response is hostility, even doubling down on their habits. That's what I think is the great tragedy of climate change: a poor understanding of reactance has contributed to climate change denial. But the good news is that doctors have spent decades trying to figure out how to work around reactance, and they've figured some things out. That gives me a bit of hope: turns out you can actually convince somebody to quit smoking, if you know what you're doing."

But i recently lived in Alberta (Canadian texas) and found that the attitude there was completely like you described. People sit in their gas guzzling trucks and get mad at others for simply driving an electric vehicle. 'They think their better than us' 'oh yeah well I bet they do other things that hurt the environment' etc. I was kinda shocked tbh. I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian, and I certainly dont drive an electric car or use solar panels. But I'm striving towards that and I'm proud of the people that do. We should all strive towards being that 'pretentious vegan rich electric car drivin hippie' cause they are the ones literally trying to help the world. I'm sorry that makes u insecure.

You see, a lot of people narrowly define hedonism as drinking a ton of booze, sleeping with anyone who lets you, and eating tons of sugar, etc etc.. but that stuff leads to being hungover, STDs, and getting fat if you aren't careful X.x so, true hedonism would be pleasure seeking, but tempered with pain avoidance: Stuff like carb-loading before drinking, visiting a doctor and exchanging blood test results before fucking your potential lover,  and not eating/drinking sugar more than a couple times a day :0 if you define hedonism this way, then all the world's Christians seem as hedonist as they truly are for seeking heaven and avoiding hell :P"

"Don't just rush to replace cow's milk with non-dairy substitutes (in particular almond milk, it takes a tonne of energy and water to make), as these can also use a lot of energy, which currently comes from fossil fuels. Instead, work to reduce the amount of milk, cow's or otherwise, in your diet and diversify the milk you drink, perhaps try sheep's milk or goat's milk as well as soy, rice and oat milk, especially if you live somewhere in which sheep+goats live/rice, soy or oats grow easily while cattle have to be kept in sheds to survive."

It really struck me a few years back when a friend showed me some video of us from 1995. There's gawky, seventeen year old me wearing jeans and long sleeves on a June afternoon in Fresno. That outfit is unthinkable now.  In May of 2004 I was at an event on the San Joaquin River and the temperature was around 105. We talked about how hot it was, at the time it was still unusual for the area to be so hot that early in the year. These days that's normal. That one stands out to me because it was the first time I noticed, I was thinking about how we'd dread the heat of August when I was a child back in the 80s, and here was a day like that in May.  My whole life I've watched the summers get longer and hotter, while the winters get shorter and colder. When people my age or older say they don't believe it, I'm just at a loss for words."

"If this is so dire (and it is) why isn't anyone clamoring to just do it already?!  We could transition to clean energy a lot faster if the government would just sit down a group of experts and have them figure out the most efficient way to position renewable energy plants and storage facilities as well as electric car manufacturing plants to generate all the clean energy we need and then some and to have more than plenty of storage in case of the cloudiest windless conditions, and then the government buys up the land and resources it needs with eminent domain and starts building them, and as capacity grows then the government could order the closure of fossil fuel plants and fossil fuel car manufacturers and recall fossil fuel vehicles (while giving the owner a new electric car) by force of law.  Yet even the most vociferous proponents of a clean energy transition only propose things like subsidies, taxes, and maybe a few small mandates such as California putting solar energy on every roof of every new house.  This is an emergency. We cannot rely on the market to deal with an emergency that threatens our very existence! A top-down planned solution, informed by expert opinion with the objective of total replacement of dirty energy with clean energy is what we need. I'd even support of requiring people to work on jobs necessary for the transition (such as construction workers) if there were a labor shortage. We have jury duty so why not 'save your species from extinction duty' as well? Granted that could compromise efficiency and slow the project down due to people who didn't really want to be there, but it could speed up the project due to better labor supply too, so I would favor allowing experts to come together and make that decision based on what ever the math says will cause the transition to go faster."

I can do these while pursuing my interests at the same time. I also realized it‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt know what to do. We DO. It‚Äôs just that we have people in charge who won‚Äôt do it. I think the problem can be remedied. Will things get worse first? Probably. Could it require more extreme means? Yes. But I think it‚Äôs doable. The Paris agreement was proof of it.

People tend to overlook that China runs on coal and as industrialization increases in India, they will be pumping out even larger amounts of carbon. Yep, I know that is is in fashion to make the U.S. the center of the Universe and the eternal bad guy, but lets have a little perspective and accept that we are not the only Country burning fossil fuels."
"Almost every climate change video gets a lot of dislikes I also shared this video on a right wing climate change deniers channel. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt get to much hate and changes minds instead!"
"Also, and perhaps more importantly, there are a lot easier ways to reduce our impact on climate change than electric cars. For example, choosing to buy products that come in cardboard, glass, or ‚Äúnaked‚Äù, buying fruits and veggies loose instead of wrapped in plastic, refusing single-use plastic like produce bags, cups, and napkins, using ‚Äúun-paper towels, small dish rags, and old t-shirts for cleaning the kitchen, dishes, and bathroom instead of disposable paper towels and sponges, shopping second-hand instead of new (especially when it comes to fast-fashion), even eating one less burger a year helps tremendously."
"Natalie jesus fuck stop it, YES 100 companies are responsible for etc., but you know that that's STILL the result of fossil fuel use and meat farming and overconsumption, right? Look at what those companies ARE; absolutely individuals changing their consumption can have a huge impact!"
"'Everything is about the apocalypse, except for climate change, which is about power'  In a way it's perversely  impressive how the (especially, but not exclusively, American) reactionary mind somehow manages to believe in the imminent threat of ever apocalypse imaginable, except the one with the singularly bad taste to be supported by factual evidence."

"This channel is one of the most impressive I've seen in a while. Keep it up!"
"As a longtime fan of this channel I love this video.  I've been hoping Natalie would tackle climate change at some point, and this video did not disappoint. As usual, production values (especially for youtube) are through the roof, and the subject is extensively well-researched. That being said, I do want to push back a little against Natalie's insinuation that adopting a vegan lifestyle is a necessary component of fighting climate change. While a vegan lifestyle certainly _can_ help, it's also totally unnecessary. It seems Natalie has (at least somewhat) bought into the false dichotomy presented by most vegans: that you either go vegan _or_ you're a careless meat eating polluter who is actively helping to destroy the earth. The thing is, there totally are sustainable alternative animal farming practices that not only produce little to no carbon emissions, but can actually reduce emissions in the long run. Do a google search for 'adaptive multi-paddock' or 'AMP' grazing. Vegans conveniently ignore the fact that it has been totally scientifically proven that we can continue to eat meat _and_ reduce carbon emissions from animal farming to net zero. We don't have to stop eating meat at all, we just have to change our farming practices. But vegans pretend this isn't a thing because it goes against their _real_ agenda of 'don't hurt the poor widdle animals'. So they pretend their lifestyle is all about saving the environment when in reality it's all about the fact they have the mindset of children who think 'Charlotte's Web' is a goddamn documentary or something and the idea of poor little Wilbur getting sent to the slaughterhouse makes them cry. Not to mention the false dichotomy also lets them feel morally superior to meat eaters. It's a win-win for their egos! If they *really* cared about the environment they would promote animal agriculture _reform_ rather than abolition. It's a much easier stance to get people on board with, and much more practical in the long run. But as long as vegans continue to see animals as a bunch of lovable furry buddies instead of the walking biofuel for our stomachs that they really are, they'll continue to conveniently ignore the more practical and achievable alternatives"
"THANK YOU!!! This is why my partner and I are low waste, minimalist, and partially vegan. We are always trying to encourage our families to buy only what they need and to reuse the things they already have."
"Figured you'd like to know, PragerU managed to advertize on your video."
"So the takeaway here is that Trump is right, and we do need to build a wall along our southern border. We need it not only against today's few thousand immigrant invaders, but we need it to protect us from 2100's millions-strong hordes of them. I have a whole new appreciation for Trump now. He's not just thinking of what the US needs now, but what it will need for centuries."

"The only thing I've learned here is I have a disturbing  crush on the ocean now."
"Wish you'd speak about the Greek issues about Zack/Zackie"
"Yeah I have to say I'm with Marie on this one. As an anti-natalist, I know I'm the last in my line, so I have no children that I need to protect the planet for. I also know that the true consequences of climate change won't be felt by me in my lifetime. Since any individual action I take is ultimately meaningless, I just can't be bothered. I'll just keep being a hedon until I die."
"I think I love the milk scenes a bit _too_ much."
"Natalie remains a powerful triple threat- excellent at costuming and set design, a great writer, and transition goals"
"Eating 'Murdered' Animal Flesh =/= Natural Murder Animal Flesh comes from animals. Animals can be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. Carnivores and omnivores can eat meat. So.. by the logic: Carnivores and Omnivores =/= Natural. ... I'm sorry, but um... how is it unnatural? And before you say 'Humans aren't meant to be omnivorous', explain why we have canine teeth that are designed to tear into meat."
"We also need to keep in mind that are more people in the US are not hard-headed racist Trump supporters. Beyond your well infromed liberal and leftist, politically unaware and inactive people would more than love to hear about climate change destorying the world and their future exlude them from the conversation by wasting time trying to debate neo-Nazis, anti-vaxxers, and climate change deniers. Lets build coaltions rather than fight oppositions (for now)."
"Natalie please this is too sexy for youtube"
"Your video style is so strange and interesting."

"I agree with everything; I just think a mistake is made on a general level with asking too much of people. (Granted we need drastic change so like....) For example asking everyone to go vegan. I support veganism but it's to me incredibly unrealistic to ask on a general level that people just cut meat entirely. The only way they would ever listen would be if the world were on fire. No hate, just don't want to fuck up the earth anymore :("

"Its not just the US. its many other countries. China isnt cutting back on fossil fuels,  its increasing them. So what are we suppised to do, if we demish our use and hurt our global standing only to watch china rise to global power. We will be at their mercy Then we are all at the seas mercy. What im trying to say is, were fucked"

Also, my girlfriend is wondering if you have a kink for pouring milk on your girls or is it just ersatz-ejaculatory imagery? Your video on the aesthetic really influenced her towards putting more effort into presenting or passing at work, or at least into believing optics and image are a part of politics in that they allow you to exert identity in an accessible manner.

"If the European people have some sort of hypersensitivity to temperature, making the post 'little Ice Age' climate unpalatable to their oh-so-refined tastes, the easiest solution would be to just mate with people of other races. It would create a people who could carry on the cultural lineage of Europe (quite possibly in a more humane way) while also being biologically capable of thriving in hotter climates. There would be no need to artificially alter the temperature of the planet. All efforts to do so would bring utter disaster to all of us."

I agree that capitalism is ill equipt to solve climate change because even though it's in the free market's best interest to take it seriously and adopt prevention measures but the people running the free market such as the Koch brothers are so short-sighted and only see short-term gain but no long-term consequences because these measures cut into their bottom lines and thus inconvenient."
"I love you üíô"
"This is great video, but I'm a little sad you didn't mention the current best solution in combating climate change. Injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere is an actually feasible solution that will counteract the affects of carbon dioxide as sulfur dioxide absorbs shorter wavelengths of radiation (which is primarily what's coming from the sun). We have already seen examples of this working from volcanic eruptions, mainly the Pinatubo eruption. Real Engineering recently did a video on this that does a fantastic breakdown of the idea.  I don't want to assume you didn't know any of this, and I think you're just focusing more on the politics and sociology surrounding climate change. Which is completely fair, we still do need to kick our reliance on fossil fuels eventually, but I think it would have been a good point to bring up to try and bring people over to the side of actual climate science."
"As a biologist and vegan for environmental reasons, I absolutely loved this video. I really appreciated a fellow liberal that didn't just use vegans as a scapegoat for 'we're at least not like those hippies' and didn't downplay the impact meat and dairy have on the environment.

"This is a very interesting and well-made argument video. Well, 'argument' may not be the proper word, since there's really nothing to argue about. We know all too well what's happening to our planet, yet millions of people waste their energies on denying the evidence. And mainly (if not only) in America, mind you. I mean, you don't hear these things over here in Europe (though our politicians are not better than American ones). It's kind of...disheartening. But you're right. Our individual contributions alone are not sufficient anymore. There must be social action, political action, regardless of political orientation. We're all in the same boat, after all."

It makes me sad how people call one of my favourite artist a racist because she said a few racist words on Twitter a few years ago, and since then she said she's sorry and she's changed. And I believe her cause she seems like a beautiful soul. And I know what it's like to be surrounded by racists and homophobes and transphobes in childhood. I don't really remember if I had some racism or homo/transphobia in me, but it's possible, though I've always been kind of a tolerant person. I'm homoromantic so I should never be homophobic, but when I was 8 and every kid around me was calling each other 'dyke' or 'fag' as an insult, who knows what I was thinking, because I didn't know yet that I was gay. Only now I remember how I was attracted to girls in early childhood, not knowing it was a bigger attraction than other girls felt towards each other."

Climate change being just one. 7:13 Yeah and it seems we are once again going to have a snowless Christmas here in southern Finland again. :( I wonder what Trump would say about that? It didn't used to be like that. I'm 34 and when I was a kid, we took it for granted that we would have a white Christmas. 10:15 Good for them!

"Congrats on the video (came out on my countrys 100th anniversairy too, thanks for that), I do however feel the need to point something out: Veganism is murder too, because after all, plants also count as living beings. If you really want to be a truly ethical consumer, your choices are limited to organic products which can naturally be recreated: milk, eggs, fruit, most vegetables, etc. keep that in mind at your next debate"

"Oh God, you did it! You cited Cook et al. The Cook 'study' is so full of holes. Consider: The Cook study was a study of abstracts of 11,944 abstracts on articles published between 1994 and 2011. 66.4% of these expressed no position on AGW (anthropogenic global warming), 32.6% endorsed AGW. .7% rejected, and .3 were uncertain. Thus '97% agree' is actually more like '97% of those who expressed an opinion agree...or 34.43% agree...whichever'. Then there's the problem of the sample size, as 11,944 papers actually isn't many, given that N=43,548 papers over the same period. Then there's the problem of the methodology...this 'work' was done by 12 volunteers (it was....ugh...'citizen science'..conducted by the Skeptical science website and this group of nerds have an innate bias. At least the Cook study was honest enough to acknowledge that bias by stating 'the volunteer raters endorsed the view that humans cause global warming, thus they may have been more likely to classify papers as sharing endorsement'. Then there's the idea of abstracts themselves...they're so ambiguously worded and require so much interpretation...There's more....there's so, so much more. I'll just repeat 'OH GOD YOU DID IT! You cited Cook.' I love you, CP, but daaaamnan. . ."

"Best video yet Natalie! I actually agreed with you pretty much 100% this time, but really it's the WAY you laid out your arguments that was the crux of your success here, as I said in my FB post, 'This has the best costume and set design yet...

"Sorry, but this one wasn't my favorite video. Low hanging fruit. Even while your videos about Incels and white supremacists are also low hanging fruit, you offer analysis which is engaging and interesting. This sounds more like someone reading the climate report with a wig and some theater."
"I acknowledge that climate change is real.But why do you quote the angry jack B.S from Anita Sarkessian? -_- Also,yes,Al Gore was right but the problem was that he was using the issue to gain public light instead of being interested of the problem.Wisecrack did a good video about the same topic.But good video."

"here we get to the really disgusting part, the oil companies demanding tax payer money to protect them from the catastrophe they caused instead of demanding that they take accountability for everyone. we have deep systemic problems that a tax, which is likely to be regressive, does not adress, and as al gore, while we're speaking of him, points out in earth in the balance, climate change is only one of many serious environmental problems we are facing"

Also a tip on your timeline: check out what #ExxonKnew in the 1970's about climate change. In their internal documents (which have been released as part of ongoing legal action against them) it shows they knew damn well what they were doing since at least 1978, and they then knowingly carried out a massive propaganda campaign to prevent action on climate. The complacency and denial we face is not only the product of blind social forced, our inaction was largely engineered. https://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken"

"If the whole climate change issue were framed a bit more like this, people would probably start listening!  As people are rightly pointing out, the capitalist class is so infinitely more responsible for this crisis in terms of emissions per person, that climate change can be viewed as a crisis imposed onto the majority by the tiny minority. If it's described like this, it has the potential to get people a lot more riled up! If we fuck them, up we win!  On the other hand, the liberal view of 'humanity is destroying the Earth - we are all responsible' breeds pessimism and inaction. Who the hell wants to take a long hard look at themself in the mirror? Not me! Eat the fucking rich comrades!"

"Seizing the means of production don't mean much if production has to stop. I like the vid, but the idea that ' immoral corporations' are how we got here, that 70% of carbon dioxide emissions is their fault, arg. They are not throwing tires on a burn pile, and having money fall out of the sky. 'They' are making widgits, and dodads, that 'we' buy. I built electric vehicles in the 90's and 00's. The most common question I got was 'can't you just put a genny on the front wheel and charge the batts?' Energy has no correlation to economics. Energy is about physics, economics is no better than astrology, when it comes to making predictions. Example: an average human can produce about 2kwh in a 'work day'. I can buy 2kwh worth of electricity for less than 40 cents.  If the right is willfully ignorant about science, the left is  near as dumb about scale. Mmm, everybody is dumb about scale. Food has an energy cost near equal to it's caloric value, because we no longer(for the most part) make it with human labor. We use machines. Your laptop uses more energy than YOU do. A car uses magnitudes more energy than a sack of meat and bones. Could humanity replace carbon-emitting energy with sun-beams and tree farts? Perhaps, but it is a daunting problem of scale. Not the economic kind of scale, but one of physics, where 'we lose money on every one, but make it up in volume' does not apply.  Science can inform us. even recommend  'what'  should be done, the 'how' is a sonofabitch. Anyway. thanks for your vid, I enjoyed it, even if it triggered me a bit, keep doing what you do."

"Your bit about the accused vegan at a barbecue reminds me of a woman I dated. In one of our conversations I said I try to shop ethically and she was all like 'me too!' I asked her where she'd like to go on a date and she said a coffee shop and asked me to pick one. I said any of the ones that actually pay their taxes and she lost her shit, accusing me of thinking I was better than her and saying it was 'concerning' that i factor ethics into choosing where I send my money.   I didn't think I was better than her; I'm not very judgemental and after all, she had me under the impression our shopping habits were similar anyway. But I did hypothesise that her reaction was one where she had lied about her ethical shopping and she thought I was better than her and didn't like it and took it out on me."

"Anthropogenic climate change is true, that being said, 'An inconvenient truth' is trash, full of gross overexaggerations and outright lies. Al Gore gave the deniers a significant amount of easy 'debunk' material with it and overall it was a great disservice to the world."
"its not capitalism the problem, its the government giving away money to company that is the problem. In a capitalism system without intervention of government, oil industry would have to pay these billion of $ protection themself. Just from that video thats 61 billion + 12 billion = 83 billion $ because of the global warming. Let them pay themself that and they will search for an alternative that cost less, so they would probably try car to cause less c02 emission, fix oil refinery to cause less c02 etc, just because in a capitalism system, it would cost them less to do so then paying 83 billion $ themself, or probably even more. Disaster event like flood, tornado etc can cost a lot in a capitalism system"
"I feel shame and dont eat meat eather. :D but Im peoplepleaser a.f."
"It would not be that difficult to deal with global warming through a transition to other forms of energy, including but not limited to nuclear. Instead, what has been promoted is creating a new type of financial instrument (the carbon credit), which reeks of the potential for circumvention and scamming. Likewise, improving public transport and funding the electric car would not be difficult, but what has been put forward is blanket taxation on fuel, which disproportionately affects the poor. There has also been little sympathy extended to coal miners, who have been instead berated for being racist and essentially told to 'get a job' by liberals, or dismissed with cries of 'let them eat opioids', instead of reassured through the creation of new jobs, campaigns of reskilling, or the proposal of universal basic income."

"As someone who loves your work I‚Äôm actually quite underwhelmed by this video. It really comes across as a ‚ÄúThe Earth is dying so vote dem and impeach trump hurr durr‚Äù and does nothing constructive to really corner a climate denier and make them accept facts, nor provides real solutions. You should have said for Republicans to demand their own lawmakers to address climate change and make this an issue both parties undeniably agree on.   Also, voting democrat will literally do nothing to address climate change. We need REAL progressives in Congress and Executive branch so we can actually have a green legislation agenda. That won‚Äôt happen with the current Democratic Party.  Disappointing video in my opinion."

"2 things ( if you're this far down in the comment section, 2 more won't matter): 1. Al Gore only began his 'Inconvenient Truth' thing after he 'lost' the 2000 POTUS election. He was an average center-right Democratic Senator from Tennessee before that (contested to this day) 'loss'. 2. Know who ELSE thoroughly believes in climate change? A company called 'Swiss Re'. They're the biggest insurance companies in the world's--insurance company. They insure the insurers. Nearly all of them. That means they do the actuarial risk numbers for everything their clients (who must insure hundreds of millions of homes and businesses between them) insure. Not folks in the business of 'guess and hope'; much less 'ignore it, and it'll go away.' If THEY think it's gonna happen; you should, too."

"First of all, I believe you shouln't be following the egocentric way to call your own country 'America', by saying 'America' has often denied global warming, I mean, considering your persistent lecturing PC tone (as much as you try to disguise it). America is a Continent, not a country. Second, as you proudly left the school and now fool yourself thinking a youtuber is the same as (or even better than) a real theorist, you probably won't be interested in talk about something we actually don't know, because many of us are bored to hear Trump is the enemy, or Global Warming is a fact, at least the people following you and many others with common sense know that since, like, forever. The only people who deny those things are the very ones that will never gonna take a glimpse of any of your videos; so why don't we start to think in real questions for a change, here, huh?"
"Ur over reliance on sexuality makes me wanna throw up."

"Yawn, who cares? American culture (of America's English origin) is all that's good for people like me, without that there's nothing to live for. As America is increasingly diluted with foreigners my traditions/conventions are replaced so I care less and less about the future. I'll enjoy what's mine for as long as I can at the highest possible volume while progressives deconstruct everything and suck everyone into their homogenizing shit-sthetic of humanitarian neoliberal globalization. This new digitized multi-ethnic borderless culture powered by Netflix and social media fucking sucks and I will ruin the planet as much as I can to undermine the monstrosity that is currently trying to dismantle Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer. If Americans (of historic stock) can't preserve their traditional mode of being then I will do my best to sabotage all ecology in hopes of making this 21st century experiment unsustainable. Ethnic differences/race are a proxy for genetic similarity and humans are just animals existing on a particular frequency through their genome experienced as the extended phenotype. As the frequency I live on becomes more generalized the good parts are ruined in favor of tasteless garbage like Ariana Grande music videos and the politics of Mark Zuckerberg."
"Have you seen the recent South Park episodes? Al Gore and ManBearPig are revisited. It looks like they might have changed their opinion a bit on that. They still portray Al Gore as a self-centered pr*ick, but it turns out ManBearPig is real and its murdering its way through South Park, yet people standing right there, while its happening, are still considering whether they should consider to begin to consider starting to consider to have potential concerns."
"Can I lick your whole body?"
"Oh my god, Your Dark Mother, The Sea!!!"
"Pretty good effort. Only thing I‚Äôd say is that I think we need to be getting away from partisan positions on climate change. Perhaps, as a non-American, that‚Äôs a little removed from the reality you currently face, but I think you‚Äôll get my point. You basically reinforce the idea, at the end , that everyone should vote democrat as a solution to the issue. It isn‚Äôt a solution to the issue. It‚Äôs a solution to Trump. Let‚Äôs be clear on that distinction. If the democrats get in then they‚Äôll still be pushing neoliberalism and supporting those world-bashing companies. If you look elsewhere in the world, you can often see left/right consensus on climate change. Look at Germany for example. It‚Äôs important to build that and not alienate half the voting public from the discussion. And it‚Äôs also important to forge a new politics that criticises both sides for gross inaction. You wanna get radical change? Don‚Äôt tell people to vote democrat. Except do, because Trump. But it‚Äôs more complex than that. I think you get what I mean..."

"Hi Natalie. Love this video, like all your others. There are some additional points that I think you could've raised here. 1 - A more thorough discussion of the intersection between class and the ability to practice veganism. While a vegetable-based diet is on its face cheaper than one that includes meat, I think it's worth mentioning the existence of things like food deserts, people without access to cars or public transport to buy groceries, people with disabilities that may not be able to prepare their own food, etc. While these may not apply to the majority of people, I still think it's important to take into consideration, as I have seen many of my own leftist friends act in a way that I think is borderline classist and ableist in discussions about the environment.   2 - This is more of a minor point, as I'm not sure if this line was meant to be satirical or not, but when Doc mentions eating 'pure, clean' vegetables', I'm a little bit wary of that wording. The assignment of moral value to certain foods can be a precipitating factor for individuals with eating disorders (myself included). I think the point would serve the same purpose if you'd perhaps worded it like, 'think of all of the vitamins and minerals you'd be getting from eating more fruits and vegetables!'  That said, this is an excellent video as always. :)"

"Hi, do you think people should just give up? Cause lately, I‚Äôve read a lot about torturing in jails and concentration camps so I really don‚Äôt understand why should we try because human nature is just really screwed up and whatever we do we end up murdering, starving each other and so on so Schopenhauer was right all along.  How can you function as a healthy human being knowing that this very second someone is dying in a camp being beaten to death and no one can help them and nobody really cares?  It‚Äôs just that they all are shouting in pain right into your ear and then you have to eat and sleep and move on? That makes no sense. Yet it feels like making it a big deal and demanding it to stop by all means necessary is somehow considered naive and stupid even. They always tell you that there's nothing you can do about it and they are right I guess. But if those people were tortured in our sidewalk, wouldn't people postpone their business and immediately come to an aide? They'd be angry and appalled and demand it to stop.   Why then if something is happening in distant places we can just forget about it?  It's still happening. We know it's happening.  How can we live with that?     I know that I can. That's sick. Could it be that so many awful things happen in the world all at once that we just numbed ourselves? I can not blame working people who struggle to feed their families for their lack of concern for Korean prisoners and children prostitution in Thailand. Yet I feel helpless.    Donating shit to world organisations is clearly not enough. For me, it's just clearing my conscience. I also don't believe that starting bloody wars and revolutions can stop the sufferings of people. The only thing I want is to stop being part of it altogether. The worst part is that I feel like we got used to that somewhere in time and now being really upset and demand an immediate resolution to a problem is naive and silly.  It's like being born into a world where everyone is already a rhinoceros so freaking out and asking questions are just impolite and bad.  I'm sorry for such a long text. It has zero meaning, I just wanted to write it off."

"To give people an idea of what regular people on the Right in the United States are about, I, a reasonably typical Global Socialist, have been accused of being a Rosenberg and supposedly Global Warming is a left-wing conspiracy to harm the capitalist engine of economic growth.  The American populist Right isn't just scared of the federal government, as they stockpile weapons and prepare to battle Washington, they are terrified of reality itself. Anyone foolish enough to try to talk to them as if they are rational is in for a really bad time.  There's nearly no connection between reality and the American populist Right. When the left talks about the 'coming dark ages' as the educational system is defunded, it's sadly naive. The educational system has never been good - it's an ideological hell-hole regardless of funding. We've been living in the dark ages the entire time. That leftists continually express surprise at the Right 'not getting it' regarding climate change indicates that the profound ignorance of the modern Dark Ages doesn't just apply to the right."

"We don't have a 'pre-industrial average' on temperature. All of our most accurate instruments were created during and post the industrial revolution. Also, our best data begins at the end of a time that called 'the little ice age'.   None of this 'debunks' theories on climate change, as it shouldn't. But much of the problem with climate change denial comes from the fact that there have been holes and misleading information used by the pro climate change community. Just be honest and honest with what we know and don't know. For example, we have such little data on climate when we consider the age of the earth. But no one says that when defending climate change (because it sounds bad). Just be honest."

So, people clapped and welcomed him but it was just a general feeling of 'You're preaching to the choir, buddy' I sorely resent South Park's creators for the ManBearPig episode, because healthy sckepticism is is fine, but good sense (like regulating carbon emissions and better industrial practices) is better as a preventive principle.  They recently recanted, yet I can't help but think they carry a lot of the guilt for the developed world ignoring or even ridiculing those allerting us to this issue.  In any case, regardless of your stance on this, I think it's universally agreed upon that polution is bad, and getting your energy from free sources like the wind or the sun is good.  We could also use a little less meat in our diets. Not all of it, but cutting in in half wouldn't hurt - in fact it would be a lot better for our individual health. EDIT - Just for those doubting the US is the only major nation activelly trying to discredit the claims that this is happening and pinning it on conspiracies to make liberal scientists further their agendas aimed at ruining fossil fuel industries, the very oil-wealthy middle eastern super economies are investing heavily in renewables, specifically solar. _The people with money comming out of their ears because of oil are changing to solar_ .

"Trump knows about Climate Change but the reason why he pretends to not believe in it is because it helps his political agenda. How could he 'bring coal mining jobs back' if he assumed the other position? The fascinating thing about Trump is that he mostly says things that are not really true because it bodes well with his voting base. He's not as dumb as you might think. As a matter of fact, if you analyzed 'young' Trump you'd realize that the 'current' Trump is a persona."

If you're in the United States and school, talk to your peers about it, write papers, make presentations about the trial, or whatever else you can do. This trial is for the benefit of the youth of not just the U.S., but the rest of the world not able to have a say on this matter. Also, if you're really into climate change and environmental issues you can go to college for a degree in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies."

"Nothing in this video is wrong. But it's just kind of...pointless.  Trump and the GOP are ludicrously bad on the climate, of course. But no alternative that is remotely politically plausible is a whole lot better. Yeah, it's bad that we've pulled out of the Paris Agreement, but that deal was feckless to begin with. It was non-binding, and even if everyone who signed met their obligations it still wouldn't be enough to keep us under two degrees global warming. At least that amount is already baked in. And there's a growing view that even that (rather arbitrary) limit was probably too much. The Paris Agreement was better than nothing, but it was pretty damn close to being effectively nothing.  Something that's been consistently true about climate change predictions is that things keep happening both sooner and to a worse degree than most of the predictions say. Conservatives aren't driving us towards a cliff because we're already over the edge.   It's no longer about preventing climate change; now we're into the 'mitigate how bad it will be' stage. And to do even that will require a WW2 level of mobilization. But we can't even get a real carbon tax in most places, something that should have been imposed universally at least twenty years ago. No one in mainstream, viable politics is talking about serious plans to meet the monumental challenge before us.  Of course, that assumes there actually is anything we can do at this point. The positive feedback loops have already started. The Antarctic ice melt is now self-sustaining, and the Siberian permafrost appears to be increasingly vomiting up its methane. We likely don't have time left to accomplish any kind of Green Revolution, which has serious limits to what it could realistically accomplish even if it were robust (and a lot of what is being trotted out under that label is band-aid stuff at best).  I don't quite adopt the Guy McPherson view that humanity will be exinct by the end of the century, but I genuinely think we're looking at the end of globalized, industrial civilization as we know it. It's happened before, it can happen again."

"Was that the revelation of the lizard brain at the end there? The real reason people maintain their disavowal? Regardless, thank you. This is a fantastic video."
"The problem isn't 'capitalism', it's industrialism. It's the entire industrial system and way of life. It's based on fossil energy, all of it, the USSR was too. I don't think we have the tools to fix this easily - certainly LED bulbs won't help any more than flourescent bulbs helped - they just encourage more use of lighting since it's cheaper per unit, ultimately leading to more energy use. There is no easy way out."
"Good video. My only gripe is you mostly disregard our own individual responsibility in causing climate change. Obviously one persons choices won't make a discernible change on the planet but they do matter. It's dangerous to suggest otherwise. Some changes in society don't happen all at once, sometimes it's from individual actions. Animal agriculture won't disappear tomorrow but if gradually enough people stop eating meat then we'll have changed the world."
"Of course climate change is true. What is there to deny? What worries me the most is the fact that many second tier leaders are hiding behind Trump, in not doing enough to stop it. Sure Trump is an idiot, we all can see that. But because he is denying it, he gives a reason for weaker politicians not to act as well. And we stumble on towards >3 Celsius temperature rise...  And sure, am I doing enough? Probably not..."

"I know that right wingers watch this channel, so consider this: The Syrian refugee crisis has been caused, in part, by a draught in Syria which has resulted in famine.  If the thought of Syrian refugees coming in by the millions of freaks you out, consider what will happen when Bangladesh goes under water. And that is just one country. Hawaii is already having to figure out how to deal with the climate refugees coming in from the disappearing Islands of Micronesia.    And consider that the vast majority of big cities in the world are located on the sea. When those cities are washed away, the majority of the world's population, which lives in them, will have to go somewhere.     If you really don't want the west to be flooded by huge waves of immigrants, you need to help insure that the rest of the world in not flooded by huge amounts of water. Oh, and also, the west will also be flooded, so there is that."

"74% of Americans can't even adequately prepare for retirement.  Combating global warming is essentially asking everyone to start a savings account (go with the typical concept of deposit % of paycheck somewhere to gain interest and prepare for retirement, I'm highly aware savings accounts suck).  Its a hard subject for me because I think even if everyone in the US believed in human caused climate change, we would still have to deal with our representatives never doing or attempting to do what we hired them to do.    I have Vegan friends who are constantly pushing veganism and it just isn't an achievable goal outside of a Military Government taking over the world and forcing everyone at gun point.    I think we are at least on the right track.  Tesla's are popular on the left and right.  LED's are industry standard and typically required to meet energy code.    I do wish Inhoffe would die. Its hard for me to think of him as an actual person.  I think I might be even angrier at him if I did.  I live in Oklahoma.  Our politicians are the worst.  We rarely get anyone we want elected. In the last election, out of 20+ some odd positions elected, I think 3 of the people I voted for got elected.  And most of our democrats are basically just republicans (dem gov candidate was anti-recreational marijuana and also an ex-cop, dem lieutenant gov candidate is against homosexual marriage and adoption, etc).  Scott Priutt was our attorney general and tried to sue Colorado multiple times over pot and also the EPA over climate change.  Tulsa is becoming a lot more liberal at least."

"So are you vegan or not? And why?"
"yeah... we should try our best to fix it but... the reality is, it probably isn't going to be fixed. lets be honest, we basically need the world cooperating with each other to fight against something we can predict is coming through science and stuff... but while there are plenty of people who are smart enough, there are more that are apathetic enough. power > whats right. power is always after the short gains, and makes people blind to the long term. You think the 'republicans' don't know that climate change is real? they know... they just don't care... and are using their power to get what they want now.   So eat meat, or don't. Vote or don't, go protest in the streets with your cute pink hats and memeworthy picket signs... or stay home (at least you didn't burn fossil fuels that way). the game is rigged anyways.  and the inevitable is coming. so I suggest moving more inland."

"I feel like your same explanation of  why people hate 'moralists' also goes into why people hate LGBT and idea of post modernism. Instead of just accepting that people can live differently or have a different worldview, you have to bring out irrational ideas that 'more people will turn gay' if some people are allowed to be gay. Somehow your way of life is now invalid because some people choose not to live it like you when in actuallity, no one us saying that.

"How do you not panic though? How does anyone not panic? Not just in an 'I'm a pragmatist and I know it won't help anything' sense. What about this scenario isn't nightmarish? Scientific logic has become an inherently political decision. We humour people who pick and choose how reality works as a child chooses sweets from a pick 'n' mix. We exist in a time when empirical logic is optional in globally-important policy making! I feel like I'm on a train speeding towards a cliff's edge, and some passengers are rolling their eyes and denying there's a cliff, and some won't look up from their cunting smart phones. On a sheer, primal, physical level, how do you not panic every day?"

"I'm sorry but anyone that preaches climate change while continuing to use as much emissions for their daily life is more then a hypocrite, they are a contributor, there's is one simple fact, progress for man equals the destruction of the environment, the more of us the less the earth can tolerate, if you want to stop pollution on a mass scale we have to revert ourselves back to the simplest of civilisation....."

A vegan propoganda 'documentary' came out talking about the *methane* in cow farts. Which is ridiculous because animals fart, it's a natural fucking emission. And besides they took the amount from all agriculture and blamed it all on cows, when rice paddies is the biggest producer of methane emissions by FAR.   Also I'm pretty sure my Canadian ass getting produce shipped up here from California, Mexico, central and south america causes more carbon emissions than getting milk from Ontario cows and beef from Alberta and Ontario cows.  Also plant based meals don't cost less here jfc. They might for you living in a state that produces produce for most of your own country and several others, but on the other side of the continent in a country that's frozen half the year?? Yea no!!  (Also colonizers slaughtered bison in North America en masse around the agricultural revolution, and Canadian cows are mostly pasture raised on what was originally grasslands - and still fucking is. Grasslands are carbon sinks. Happy ecosystems - complete with large hooved animals for soil aeration. Unlike the monoculture hell that's destroying several ecosystems through killing all the local fauna and flora and drying out everything with water intensive crops like avocado and almond üôÑ. And even the ones that aren't: desertification through THE most inefficient means of growing ANYTHING. Fucking permaculture that shit! Use a greenhouse! Hydroponics!! Hell use aquaponics, and have farmed fish for eating and there ya go two problems solved in one go!!)"

If everyone enters hysteria mode and say it will bring apocalypse, it will diminished the reputation of the argument. It‚Äôs better to observe, record, measure the ongoing impacts to present the possible impact of climate change. What you need to understand is the republican do not want to spend money on something they fear would not bring concrete result. The main emission is still from China and soon the developing world, whose reach is outside of the US and main drives is the world consumption habit. There are efforts into researching solution to cool the earth artificially to buy time for society to move away from carbon but those research are being seen as taboo. Those efforts are the one should be on the front page instead."

I rarely meet other vegans irl but when I do, it's inevitably an older white mom suffering through some kind of ridiculously complicated no oil, no salt, no sugar, no soy, gluten-free, low carb diet which she will no doubt fail at in a blaze of bacon-fueled delirium. I have to say 'oh really? I had no idea,' as they earnestly warn me about poisonous oats and mutant corn. Just be vegan. They make vegan icecream now. It's fine. The planet and the animals don't care if you eat salt. No one will judge you for throwing a bag of Gardein sizzling Szechuan in the oven."

I like to think of climat change as a wildfire and Our carbon emmisson as throwing wood into it. Even if we didn't start the fire it is dumb to throw more wood in.   And even without climat change are fossilfuels not a reliable source in the next 100 years. We need New ones anyway and they are going to be a huge business. So to invest billions in New energy sources that are the future and will create tons of Jobs and have the sweet side effect of saving the earth sounds really good to me..."

Why is the struggle to counteract climate change and protect the environment so overwhelmingly middle class and white? we know that the first communities impacted by climate change globally and poor people of color, so why are pipeline protests soooo fucking white. I've been to several and its always about 300 white people representing different kinds of activist weirdos ; mermaid people, otherkin, parrotheads, anarcho-freegan crust punk, polyamorous locksmiths, that one gen x mom with the tattoos who makes puppets out of paper mache for every protest, and then theres the sad token native american who comes out in regalia so everyone feels like they're in spiritual union with the earth mother. every single one I have been to was nuclear meltdown at the sewage processing plant on a scale of 1 - shit show, all have pretty large attendance of out of towners with a few anarchist direct action people who have like a plan to get arrested in some showy way.  In this century, the left has not made much progress providing leadership and organization in any sectors of the class struggle. Wether by the NGO's or bourgeois democratic organization we are allowing ourselves to be pushed out of key areas of struggle by those who provide no solution for proles, who will suffer the consequences of our inadequacy down the line..."

"Ugh. I got a degree in environmental science, and I have to say I'm not emotionally strong enough to be an environmental scientist/activist. You have to be a really strong person b/c nobody gives or wants to give a fuck. It's similar to mortality. You have to forget about your impending doom far into the future in order to live your life. Also american culture is so toxic towards it that even if you do become a scientist your work is ignored. Like, is there any point to me studying something that I won't be able to use? It's an effort in futility. I also have depression, so maybe it wasn't the best choice to attempt to get into such a dismal field, so I'm gonna find a job elsewhere... but can you blame me? You'd have to be a masochist or extremely motivated, even a little crazy. Not everyone can do that."
"Electric cars are really far away from being a solution to climate change as it still requires rare metals mining, that are deeply polluting some regions of the earth. It makes their inhabitants slaves because of the high market demand; their condition of work are terrible, dangerous and less and less cost-effective for them. It is not by making a product look green, that it will be the go-to solution, especially when an innovation is only making a change in which technology we use and not in how we use technologies. A car is still a car, as it needs mass production to fulfil the ego of the individual. It is an illusion to promise the rich that he is actually saving the planet and to reassure him that he can still continue living his way of life, in a bubble of luxury, without having to watch the dirty poor people who actually enable him to buy stuff that cheap.

Meat; new cars (INCLUDING ELECTRIC ONES); even things like gym memberships. The carbon economy exists largely to make mundane things, so if you care than you'd best stop buying those things until the transition to renewables is made."
"Great video!   I gotta ask though, can technology add some borrowed time to this whole thing, as it were? I know there's companies and the like heavily investing into green technology, carbon capture, etc.   Like, are these reports based on the assumption that technology to combat this threat won't improve in 10-20 years? That's rather disingenuous.   Speaking of which, I believe that 10-20 years is a bit too broad a timeframe to be making predictions like this. Yes, of course, what you guys mentioned is perfectly plausible and is a serious threat. But tell me this, did anyone back in 1991 know that the World Trade Center would be attacked _twice?_ Of course not.   Time is fickle, and we can't with 100% certainty predict what will happen. These issues happening? Could be 99.9% true, though.   And that's why I adopt this phrase: _You never know._   Helps me relax.   But yeah, good video, this'll definitely get people interested and engaged, and that's what we need more than ever."

Also climate scientists disagree on whether the warming is catastrophic or just a mild change, and they do not agree on how much humanity contributes to climate change.

"@contrapoints - Everything you say is true, but I think there's a better way to go about this.  If we want conservatives, who are notoriously concerned with masculinity, to be concerned about the environment I think the easiest route is to point out the drastically declining sperm counts and testosterone levels in men in western countries[1][2]. It's one thing to brush off a future disaster, but to find out they are already having their masculinity taken away from by corporations is something I think could be a real motivator. Though these changes haven't been pinpointed to the environment, xenoestrogen chemicals are considered a likely culprit and enough to make people doubt.  1-https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/10/sperm-counts-continue-to-fall/572794/ 2-https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120623144944.htm"

"When u finally make people see that the theory of global warming is factually sound the true work is convincing people why they should care. You did a good job with the symbolism of the sea, but instead of making the enemy the 'other' side you could say that human survival doesn't effect people based on politics. And that the polices of the American government aren't negative because they are chosen by a republican leader, but by a person who values money over the future of the country he was elected to serve (which isn't simply a republican sentiment). So with the divisive points set aside this can be said, if people don't want to care about the earth they *can do that, but in the end the earth cares even less about humans, it has been here before us and it will be after, so humans will not benefit or 'win' by not caring, they will kill themselves. And this may make a difference, bc we all know that people sure as hell care about dying. Great video Natalie ‚ù§"
"If corporations are people, can we please bring back the guillotine?"
"One thing I find alarming is really that 'not being able/wanting to care' that you mention around 16:00. I live in Europe and here the consensus is that climate change is real and dangerous and that we should do something about it... and then we did nothing about it. There were some attempts around 2010-2015 but it's negligable. I feel that the refugee crisis ( let's use that term despite the connotations) came almost as a relief. At least now there was a topic that could redirect the attention and everyone jumped into it forgetting that objectively, concretely, global warming is a far more relevant topic."
"I take solace in the doom of capitalism.  America is its biggest bastion and it blew a tire in 2008 and refuses to admit it's broken.  The Republican sleep-walked into it.  From 2008-2016 the Democrats did jack-all about prosecuting the parties responsible.  What little banking regulation Obama did manage to pass where dismantled by Trump.  Trump and the Republicans have doubled-down on neo-liberal, trickle-down economics.  'America first', withdrawal from every global treaty and trade barriers means America is leaving the global stage.  Good riddance.  The new and sole super-power China has a decades long record of eliminating poverty having rescued 700 million of its own from grinding poverty in 30 years.  Global leader in solar energy.  Global leader in railways.  A serious research program into safe nuclear and thorium MSR.  BRI investments in Central Asia and Africa will rescue them from the ravages of capitalism.  A vigorous internal program fighting corruption.  America is on the down escalator while China is on the up escalator.  In 15-20 years China will be buying America for pennies on the dollar."

We would have to turn almost every political, economical and social system everywhere on Earth inside out within the span of 3 decades. Changing the way BILLIONS of people live their lives on every level in 30 years. 30. Fucking. Years. And good luck finding a way to make sure everyone toes the line, because we can't afford any screwups.  And the funny thing is, this mindbogglingly gargantuan feat wouldn't even be enough! 'Cause the carbon that's already in the atmosphere is enough to support positive reinforcement cycles (like polar ice melting, or forests being wiped out by extreme weather events) so we would have to scrub it away using technology that doesn't even exist. Technology we would have to research, develop and implement all the while not allowing a whiff of CO2 in the atmosphere. This is not even climate fiction anymore, we're balls deep in the realm of delusion. I'm sorry if I come across as excessively confrontational, but I just find it childish how we're unable to accept that we're fucked and Capitalism robbed us of all of our agency as individuals to fix things. It's depressing, but the genie is out of the bottle on this one. This is a conversation we needed to have 40 years ago, now we just count our blessings and prepare for the worst. Because it is coming. Still, if you wanna do some activism or change something about your lifestyle, by all means do it. I'm a vegetarian myself, but I've accepted it's a little masturbatory thing I do to feel a little better about myself as we all walk into the apocalypse. Nothing wrong with that, but let's all be honest with ourselves and about what is inevitably happening."

"We'll change when the consequences come to our door. When there is real survival at stake, we'll get crafty. I love survival stuff, went to school for primitive survival and got into a natural gardening obsession initially with the idea of growing all my own food. We might have to make biodomes, allow sunlight in but keep poisons out. Feeling drawn to the walipini underground greenhouse as a good start, would have to figure out air/water filtration. Nuclear fallout would SUCK, sure hope it doesn't go that far. If nothing else we can go underground, perhaps wire solar/wind/water power production down from the surface to grow lights. Chickens would be great down there, help speed up composting of our food scraps while producing eggs. Separate human urine/feces and mix the pee with ashes as fertilizer and mix the manure with carbon waste like shredded cardboard to compost properly and eventually use in the orchard. So many ideas, it'd be really hard. I'd probably fail and die, even with all I know from years of obsessive research and practice and the help of many other people. Something very attractive about all that, part of me hungers for a vivid life, real survival. Life feels kind of empty when it's this easy. I've never been in danger of starving, I fast intermittently because I live in a sea of excess nutrition and the things statistically most likely to kill me are heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes. We're drowning in success. Maybe we're subconsciously trying to make all this collapse so we can go back to survival mode because our brains are hardwired for it."

If the general population and it's leaders recognises the problem and wants to make change to fix it change will happen regardless of the political structure."

But here is a thought: Would not ANY environment, be it howsoever wretched, be infinitely more tolerable if only one were not ' surrounded by fxxxxs'? My own will to live is sustained by the conviction that I am surrounded, not primarily by fxxxs, but by people with whom I disagree, and with whom a mutually respectful dialogue might ensue one day. This is wishful, but not utopian thinking on my part. It is tragic thinking, but not hopeless thinking. Peace. Out."

"the exchange at 16:55 doesn't accurately reflect the attitudes of people who know this is coming by the way.

"We had a drought in my country over this summer which destroyed a lot of crops. There were also huge forest fires which lasted for days.   I don't think our politicians were prepared for that. They are right wing, which in my country means they want to privatize and sell off our welfare and infrastructure, while funding big oil and encouraging car and plane travel.   Soon enough the news were telling us to go stock up on canned foods and batteries and how we should all be prepared for a 'crisis' cutting us off from water and electricity. I thought it was pretty scary, but I felt like everyone around me was like, 'oh yeah that makes sense, we should probably all make doomsday kits' and I'm like, 'that's not the point though, our government could do something on the climate front and they won't, and now they're just leaving us to our own devices'.  Our climate here will probably get worse over the next few years, and I don't know if caring hurts too much because I can't really find anyone who seems to take it seriously. Like, even when we're facing wildfire and food shortage people just shrug and keep on travelling by plane and supporting irresponsible, racist right wingers like nothing even matters, like the idea of death by fire and starvation doesn't affect us. I feel like I'm going crazy, like everyone around me is one of those lizards in the bath in the video. What do? How fix? I want to find a way to end this comment but I can't find a conclusion or silver lining or anything, so.  Good video? I'm glad we get to see more of the scientist character?

"We are a society of crisis managers. The reason is because if we prevent something  we will never know if it would have happened in the first place. Therefore as a manager taking preventive actions, you will take all the blame for the consequences and get none of the reward for preventing the thing. Politicians and managers prefer to manage a crisis so they can get all the accolades of managing the crisis well. This is at every level of society for most preventable problems.   For the record US oil output skyrocketed under Obama despite the rhetoric. The US now outputs almost as much as Saudi Arabia. Not saying Trump isn't worse, just saying that Democrats won't save us."

"+Natalie, Contrapoints, Mademoiselle Pwah"
"Oklahoma Transwoman here. Senator Inhofe's campaign should come at no surprise, most of our economy is based around the production of oil and natural gas, it pays for our schools, our roads and is a large source for jobs. God forbid, the alumni center at my college was paid for by Phillips 66 and the football stadium paid for by T. Boone Pickens , hell I even went to the same high school as one of the granddaughters of Love's Travel Stops (the Love family was distinguished enough as supporters that Trump appeared at their home ). People like these usually have oil in common and have a major influence over the state's interests, the state wants those tax dollars, and clash with the federal government on policy. Under the Trump administration their have been rollbacks on regulations for drilling new wells, some protections for animals and their procedures for dealing with them have been decreased allowing for more wells to be placed. Federal Policy can have a large impact on the lives of the people here, and of course our legislature reflects that. So we have to ask ourselves is the cost of saving the environment work giving up our economic prosperity worth it? Why of course it fucking is, you just run into the problem of telling those people they no longer have jobs because we have to cut back our oil production. I've personally seen it, my dad works in industry, and I've noticed the fluctuation of policy influencing the production of oil. And that production of oil trickles down to other industries, namely transportation, but closely the aerospace industry here in Oklahoma. The inception of OPEC led to increased gas prices in the 1970s which eventually led to GM to reducing labor cost, and recently outsourcing its labor and in the process Detroit becoming a barren wasteland. Policy has to walk the line of appeasing both sides ideally, but realistically coming up with a solution that works. But you've touched on the fact people are more likely to support things that make them money, they're interested in that new car because they like shiny things, and I feel I need to re-watch whats wrong with capitalism."
"As for electric cars the are several misconceptions on their impact. Electric cars are very expensive to produce as of right now, the amount of precious materials required to produce a battery for one of these vehicles is staggering, just the copper alone, but also there is a large environmental cost, the materials have to be mined, shipped and then produced which requires a large amount of energy. The costs put them out of the price range of the average consumer and their intended effect does not meet a large enough population to have an effect. Tesla is not the greatest at this, they hold a monopoly on the market and do not sell extra parts, and good luck trying to fix it Tesla doesn't want that to happen either, its either send your car back to the factory to be fixed at a rate of $180 dollars an hour or stick your thumb up your butt. Not to mention green cars still rely on energy plants to produce the electricity to charge them, where does that come from? Coal. Really, the better option would be to keep our current cars and maintain them, many older vehicles production impacts on the environment have been recovered, we waste more energy producing newer cars. But this model is hard under capitalism."
"Older cash for clunkers in effect took running vehicles and disabled them so that you could get a discount on a newer car, that's the problem, they incentivize the consumer to buy and buy new, not great for smog, but good for the economy (but didn't have the intended effect)."
"Trump has been successful in stimulating the economy, and that can't go overlooked, but what is the cost of this short term gain? Well, you've covered that. We just face the dilemma of alternatives. What we should be doing is working towards efficiency, and recycling to cut down on our energy requirements. With that being said, if my rambling was even coherent, even though I disagree with these two points I still enjoy your videos and have for a long time, they have in a way connected me to a sharp, engaging and intelligent transwoman, if your autogynephilia video had existed when I was in high school I probably would have transitioned earlier. Anyways, the intro made me weak, you're prettier than you think (fucking gorgeous actually), please date/(f*ck) me and keep up the good work."

"I have never commented on one of your videos before, but I believe your approach is not necessarily the right one. The solution to the problem, it seems, is readily available but unlikely ever to occur within the time frame specified. The  problem being that no one will risk economic instability to cut carbon emissions quickly . I think that it is best not to even confront those who deny climate change because there is too little time to worry about whether they understand the necessity of cutting carbon emissions. For example  by say  presenting subsidies on sustainable energy production as a viable way to create jobs and to lower the US dependence on foreign oil , you could convince people to make some of the changes necessary without ever having to take a position on climate change. As much as I appreciate your excellent video production and  the validity of all of your points, I believe that in an age of mass hysteria a more subversive approach is necessary. Essentially don't even bother trying to reasonably convince people to do the right thing on this issue, trick them into doing it instead."

So yes it's perfectly logical for someone to say fuck the air 20 years from now cause I am hungry and poor and need a job now.   Besides the pace of change is neck breaking and exponentially increasing.  Why assume embracing this can't lead to an engineering solution?

It's not really a partisan issue whether it exists or not and whether something should be done about it, parties only disagreed on the specifics of what to do. Which renewable energy sources to build towards, the specific trashold of emission caps, that sort of stuff.

"Thank you so much for making this video.   I work in multiphase modelling for environmental systems, and largely work with the same equations that model climate change (RANS with different closures). They're literally conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with averaging operators. RANS are somehow reliable and non-political for pipeline scour and fluid catalytic cracking (i.e.: protecting oil's assets), but as soon as I mention climate change, all of a sudden I'm a liberal forcing my political views down people's throats and somehow they know more about this than I do. My mom literally told me that, while she didn't understand the tools I used, she still didn't believe me. I can attest that being in this line of work has been a detriment to my mental health.  The first paper on human made climate change was published in 1896 (my research group was actually talking on Friday about forming a journal club and doing this article first). It's been over 120 years later, and I don't feel good about the future."

He is greedy, he is trigger-happy, he is loud, he is willfully ignorant, and he thinks he's exceptional just because he's been told so his entire life.  I'd wish for his death, but then Pence would be president, and he's actually a competent politician (but he's still a fundamentalist idiot).  At this point, I find it unconscionable to vote for any Republican, because any of the one's that are actually reasonable won't speak up out of fear of being marginalized by the establishment GOP, which is now Trump's bitch.  The Democrats are by no means perfect and there are plenty of scumbags among them, but they are the only ones with the ability to stand up to these short-sighted fucktards.     Americans, if you value modern civilization, vote Democrat."

But that is probably because I don't live in the US. I don't think South Park was even saying it's not a real thing, just poking fun at how he was portraying it to the public. The reason why people in the US don't take global warming seriously is not an episode of South Park but the fact that your education fucking sucks."

"What are the 100 companies responsible for the 70% of emissions? I can start drafting strongly worded, yet non-defamatory, letters."
"Imagine you were serious enough to talk so seriously about the environmental issue that you were prepared to suck up the moral opprobrium that must entail whatever your proposed solution. The proposed solution MUST have something to do with a smaller global population with a smaller carbon ( and other stuff) footprint. Imagine you do not want to say ' let Malthusian war and nature take its course'....not such a stretch right? Imagine you wish to protect the lives of everybody alive..not such a stretch. That means you wish to feed them on a non meat agricultural basis. That means you are committed to industrial agriculture and all attendant evils until such time as global population is small enough to be fed on a pre nitrogenous fertiliser and mono culture basis. Everything is composed of inconvenient truths that please nobody. Complacency does not help...but rage and despair are also no great panacea. Sea walls are not ideal....but nothing practical ever is eh? Irreducible complexity eh?"

It might even make it worse.  There's a 10 minute video called 'The Story of Cap and Trade' on YT.  10:32  Add to that that Trump also believes in climate change.

I get that it's all suggestions and this isn't someone saying 'Everyone should be vegan', and eating less meat overall is probably better for individual health anyway,  but it *feels* unfair to add that in as an option for personal changes one can make. That and electricity is still largely generated by fossil fuels, all you'd be doing with an electric/hybrid car is adding more steps until more places start using renewable electricity sources."

But this isn't true for a lot of poorer folks who don't have the time, resources or energy to cook for themselves.  Thanks for pointing out that there isn't much we can do as individuals, though we do try and keep our impact down. Because we ultimately live in a society which profits off global warming, it's like trying not to get sand in your shoes when you live on the beach."
"Contrapoints, I'd be cool for you to band together with a few dozen other youtubers with as wide a global reach as possible and organise a strike. The strike could also be on YouTube - for instance, if hundreds of youtubers stopped making content for 2 weeks or so and instead all posted a short video explaining their activism, that could really make a difference - possibly thousands of content creators all over the internet could join in and it could spread to be a general strike."

"Brilliant as always. The shot of the moonlit sea is sublime.         At the risk of waxing philosophical, I have the feeling this all comes down to the death of God. Now that we all know (even those who deny it know it in their hearts) that God is dead, the only thing left to do is have as much fun as possible, or to try and expand our knowledge and attempt to become immortal by leaving great works behind. Thus a relatively long-term problem such as global warming is always going to appear unimportant when compared to the most important thing of all: our maximum expansion within our individual lifespan on earth.         I wonder if it might be possible to better link the left to this idea of individual expansion? What if opening our minds and hearts and taking action on all this stuff doesn't mean we would be holding ourselves back from doing what we really want to do (by not eating meat or using planes) but rather that we would be getting bigger and stronger and smarter? Not austerity but more power... And yet, there will always be the instinct to not let that power be dispersed among the crowd, to retain the right to be the rock star being worshipped on stage... This seems like an unsolvable dichotomy. And perhaps rightly so...      I suppose it comes down to the pleasure principle versus the reality principle. And what makes your videos so strong is that, more than a lot of other YouTubers, you're prepared to go into the appeal of the pleasure principle and of a certain right-wing energy and world-view, to pay your respects to the Devil as well as make fun of his followers."

"To tell you the truth, i don't actually believe in climate science. Carbon dioxide is more soluble at lower temperatures. When weather is colder, more carbon dioxide dissolves into the ocean, when it is warmer, less dissolves into the ocean and remains in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures correlate with higher levels of CO2 because it's the temperature affecting the CO2 levels, not the other way around.  Or, maybe i'm wrong. We probably should reduce carbon emissions. It's better to be safe than sorry. The funny thing is that oil companies will be better off in a world that uses less oil, the world won't be weened off of it's dependence on oil so quick. The rate that we consume oil is unsustainable. They can meet a reduced demand with a reduced supply, selling less oil at a higher price for the same profits over a longer period of time. I'm sure we will get there eventually, regardless of the science.  Lets just hope that i'm right. It would be nice."
"I find this easy to fap to.  F: Follow A: Articulated P: Points  In all seriousness, a great video. I do feel, however, there was one 'counter view' I feel you missed: Employment.  While on vacation, I stopped by a small town of about 10,000 people. In the hotel, the the town's tourism department had placed a brochure talking about the town. In that brochure they had listed the top 10 employers for the town. Six of those ten employers were Coal/Oil/Natural Gas companies or a power company that used Coal/Oil/Natural Gas. The town's government took up two spots on that list, and the final two spots were filled by the town's single chain grocery store and its single Walmart. From the news articles I've read, these coal/oil/natural gas jobs are often the only reliable way someone in a small town can make anything close to a wage to support a household; after seeing that brochure, I believe it.   Ninety-seven percent of scientists may be right about man-made induced climate change, but I can imagine it's much easier to listen to the three percent that say 'you can keep yer job'."

"It's weird to me that people think it's 'lots of meat all the time' or 'veganism' when they defend eating meat. Like you can cut the amount of meat you have in half and it probably wouldn't even come close to being vegan. Just slowly start cutting out meat, you don't have to go all the way. Anything effort is better than none."
"1) Great video. I'm from Europe so I don't really meet any climate change deniers irl but I often argue with them on the internet. They come up with the same 'liberals are hypocrites because they're part of the same system waaah' bs without realizing that I eat meat very rarely (and get soy milk with my cereal), buy most of my clothes from thrift shops, recycle, use public transport and all that 'hippie shit' they hate so much. 2) That white bikini is cute as heck, I'm jealous."
"South Park actually just made a 2 part episode apologising to Al Gore for not believing him. They still stand by saying that him being so fervent in all of this was a desperate grab for attention after losing the presidency, but baby steps have been made. They agree that climate change is real (fucking finally) and that we need to act now and stop being so goddamn greedy. The example they gave was giving up red dead redemption 2 and soy sauce to appease manbearpig on a metaphorical level (with the people of south park being too selfish to even give that up) but its clear that they believe that we need to give up lifestyle choices that have those effects of the environment or else the consequences will be cataclysmic, and they doubt that anyone will. A pretty cynical way to look at it, but not one i particularly disagree with. Humans are suckers for luxury and dont like giving things up. Case in point: the backlash against vegans that you yourself explained perfectly. I use my anaemia as an excuse not to go vegetarian even though i know its better for the environment and a cruel industry that i would rather not support. When really the main reason is I fucking love meat, and my iron levels are just an afterthought. Though i'd go a step further and say that we need to do more than police our lifestyle emissions. We need to do something about industrial emissions. But i'm glad more prominent moderate and conservative voices like South Park's creators Trey and Matt (who are both pretty centre-right and have a lot of influence on the general public) are changing their tune on climate change. Hopefully it'll help sway a few more."
"There is a real solution but it involves murdering the KOCH brothers and burning down the animal breeding industry.  Sadly the left are a bunch of pacifist cucks and wold rather feel morally superior by buying ethical stuff (vegan local is of course something we should all be doing anyway) that achieves nearly nothing, rather than learning how to fire an AR15, and this is why the capitalists are able to use state violence so effectively to prevent democracy or a green resistance from making any real difference.  If you aren't prepared to murder corrupt politicians and greedy capitalists then they will have a free ride to murderer our descendents.  As long as was isn't declared on emitters and promoters then they simply win without a shot being fired.  Good we are a bunch of ¬£ucking losers who doing deserve this amazing world!"

"The fashion industry actually IS a big environmental problem, with fast fashion culture creating absurd amounts of waste every day. Among other problems, farming the materials creates unhealthy soils and harms workers and surrounding communities; treating and dying fabrics pollutes waterways and again harms communities; and synthetic fabrics requires oil for production. Unfortunately, buying environmentally and socially ethical/sustainable clothes is also often prohibitively expensive. However, I am optimistic that there is change happening in the fashion industry and its culture from the inside. It is hard to be so optimistic about climate change when we see world leaders being purposely ignorant and misleading. Never have I felt such a sense of doom as watching 12:15-14:21 as though it were a history documentary called When It All Went Wrong."

"I really doubt we can stop or slow climate change with consumer choice and just limiting the corporations emission.   The consumer choice is helpful but it focuses mostly to developed nations and ignores the desire to rising living standards.  How can I say to developing countries to choose green while they focus on just getting by and trying to reach similar living standards as us. We would probably  collectively have to accept some sort of living standards decrease to solve this to be this globally. This problem will no doubt bring conflict and political turmoil. In France for example currently there are protest against fuel tax rises which could be one of the concrete problem solving methods but are clearly really unpopular.    Limiting the emission of top 100 polluting corporations, which are mostly fossil fuel companies,  means we would have to solve energy requirements with renewable energy and while I see it as possible to some extent there are many industries that I can't see it to apply such as defense/war and heavy transportation.  Also the globally energy question is also inherently political to many nations as they form a fossil fuels form large parts of economy. In their national self interest using fossil fuel is good and brings them wealth. Thus any serious disruption to global state of order is national interest question. I think these countries will pay lip service to climate agreements but when push comes to shove they won't disrupt their source of wealth.   Main problem I see is that as climate change is a global problem we will need global solutions but they are notoriously hard to do. We would need countries to act against majorly their self interest on the sort term so we would need major economic or political motivators to ensure this. Economic motivators will be hard to do since even as little or simple as some foreign aid can be really unpopular and that is only if rich nations even want to commit some economic self harm in revolutionizing their industries and then helping less well of nations. And the political motivations would of course in this case be forceful and lead to conflict, disagreement and possible war.   The nations of the world would have to make really unpopular decisions and a method to enforce them. This enforcement would have to have actual teeth compared to most international organizations like UN. Sadly this will be impossible peacefully in current state of affairs as nations won't give any of their rights to enforce some global treaty which will only benefit them in the future and not to the present. We will be prisoners of the our desire to keep our living standards rising and keep the current state of affairs going even as the world crumbles before us."

"At this point, there is no way to stop global warming. What we should be doing in stead is investing into nuclear energy, hydroponic agriculture and vat-grown meat. That will solve literally all the (human) problems of global warming, without necessitating the mass immiseration of the proletariat. Also, veganism isn't natural or healthy. Nazi Germany did an accidental natural experiment in the 30s, restricting consumption of animal products and attempting to compensate by increasing plant consumption, in order to achieve economic autarchy.  Yet despite rising wages and falling unemployment (due to the armament industry boom), mortality rates skyrocketed and children became stunted, at a time when the rest of Europe was seeing widespread mortality reductions in all age categories. What is more, by far the worst affected group were not adults - whose suffering may have been affected by a harsher working conditions, due to the destruction of independant trade unions - but children between the ages of 7 and 15. Even the suffering of the Jews is not even close to big enough of a statistical factor to explain such massive anthropometric decline. https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo_wp800.pdf"
"The lifestyle changes mentioned should be facilitated by collective action; for example, campaign for public transport to improve so that it's a more attractive option to the public. Also, it's easier to reduce the amount of meat you eat if there are ready-made vegan meals available. Say what you want about how 'selfish' people are, it's not going to change the fact that there is only so much amount of personal sacrifice most people are willing to make, even if the world is ending. So, strategically, we have to try and minimise this amount."
"This was great. I'm glad that towards the end you emphasised the need for both consumer change and political change.  One minor gripe: It's somewhat wrong-footed to use the '100 companies cause 71% of emissions' stat as a reason why consumers are not very responsible - because of course, these emissions are produced to meet demand from consumers. See this interview with one of the co-founders of the research institute who produced this statistic: https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17967738/climate-change-consumer-choices-green-renewable-energy Still, given the overall conclusions this video comes to this is only a minor point."

"Truth to be told I'm a bit fed up with some of the individuals in my leftist corner always saying things like 'Well we need to bring down capitalism to do anything about climate change, therefore my actions aren't to be held responsible.'  If you do this, you're basically just the left equivalent of the apocalypse shit-lords.  Do they actually think the revolution is going to come *anytime* soon?  There is nothing stopping you from fighting for your ideal political landscape while also being responsible for your own actions. The two aren't mutually exclusive."
"Holy SHIT ALREADY. 21:49 minutes in, and the video is perfect... minus this vegan bullshit.  My fiance is on the Autism spectrum with IBS. She can't live off of vegetables. Red meat . . . 'Murdered animal flesh' (give me a break) is not a problem because of the scores of red meat eating lower class people who should just stop being so cruel, and heartless. It's a problem because of rich bourgeoisie motherfuckers eating 200$ steaks (those are the cheap ones I hear too) in meals so god damn extravagant that I'd sooner eat my own shit in protest that participate. I mean for fucks sake capitalists will eat GOLD just to snub starving people in the 3rd world.  Try telling an Inuit to go vegan, and see what they have to say about that too. Lots of climates, and lots of peoples don't (see couldn't) support vegetable only diets, and many people would literally just die slowly and painfully without meat proteins because they can't digest vegetables the way other people can. There is absolutely no moral superiority to being a vegan. You do NOT have to be cruel, or wasteful when it comes to consumption of animals."
"One of the best parts of this was the push back on accepting apocalypse as being itself a form of denial. I guess I always just thought doing the thing even in the face of imminent destruction with the hope that something good might come of it was a decent motive to fight acceptance, but lumping acceptance in with denial is a great turn."

"Is this about voting Democrat or about preventing climate change ? Would you vote Republican if the democrats were de climate change denialists in 2020 ?  I also wonder, world wide, is it always the right that's climate change denialist ? Or sometimes the right sometimes ? It's hard to tell, and I'm legit curious. Here in france we dont have climate change denialist as far as I'm aware off, but sometimes it's hard to know who to rely on. The green party in the few past years was happy to announce some nuclear powerplants closure, ignoring the fact that coal mines re-opened to meet the new demand of the coal and natural gaz powerplants that will have to increase their energy output. So there is that for climate change  Also, for the diary industry, it's not about CO2, sorry to nerd out here, but it's about methane emissions, wich are well, green house gases, so it's similar, exept that methane is way more effective than CO2 at well, green housing : P if I remember correctly 1gram of CH4 (methane) is equivalent to 4 grams of CO2 I dont know how to say it in a way that's not aggressive, and I dont know if anyone else agrees on this, but you sound quite illiterate on the subject talking about CO2 on diary farms (then again, they do produce CO2 on transport and stuff, but I mean, Amazon does too, that's not a specific diary farm problem)"

"I think ContraPoints is misrepresenting South park. The man-bear-pig was supposed to be a strawman argument from the start. In fact the characters on the show are so naive that anything they learn at the end of the episode is supposed to be the wrong. Unfortunately too many took the show at face value. The Daily Show has put a video of Al Gore reacting to South Park a few days ago."

Tout va bien jusqua ici....but the water gets hotter and hotter as you get sleepier and sleepier. But...again....this is only a description of human life itself. Life IS carbon based and warm. It DOES place demand on the ecosystem. If you want to be serious ( deadly serious) about that then you have to talk about population numbers and birth rates and population....management?....control?...engineering?....solutions?...pick any word that does NOT chill your spine. Pick any left or right or centrist political perspective on the issue and try NOT to end up arguing yourself into saying something radically absolute and inhuman and evil.....or flippant and silly...it ain't easy.

That is the most hilarious thing I've ever heard. Kinda reaffirms that they're not blind, just strategic. Welp, voting with climate as a priority is something I've always done, I regularly forego meat and use public transportation 90% of the time. It's not hard. Still, let's see what more I can do. Otherwise... the ocean swallowing us back up would be a poetic full circle. Thanks for all you do, Contra. You're a gift <3"

"words matter... and talking about 'climate change' instead of global warming is already a victory for the right and denialists.  Just like imperialism is now 'globalization', or capitalism is now 'market economy', or opportunism is 'pragmatism', or exploited countries are 'developing countries', or revolution is 'terrorism', etc..., so too global warming is now 'climate change'."

The frustrating truth is that it is just not possible to isolate any human contribution to the record of temperature change; Assumptions, possibly false, must be made.   (Recent warming could even be attributed to a recovery from the 'Little Ice Age', as it is called).

Thank you so much !  Ps :  you got one of the best yt channel"
"Loved the video! However, pointing fingers at the oil/coal companies is also denialism. The impact of lifestock is a major threat to the environment as well: it pollutes the waters (eutrophication), destroys habitats/ecosystems and their biodiversity (30% and counting), it is the number 1 reason for deforestation (kettle feed and pastures), not to mention the methane emissions (methane is 25 times more potent than CO2) and yet, no one is willing to make individual lifestyle changes. I'm sorry, but if we are all in this together (which we are), it is going to take 'sacrifices' from both sides. Much love from the Netherlands ‚ù§"

"people who eat meat are the enemy"
"Honestly this video is a mess. A stylish one at that though. Saying consumerism is not the solution, but then everyone should buy this and that and vote democrat, otherwise they are evil. Not that it would be better to agree on the goals left and right. Not that there are good conservative reasons that keeping warming under 2 degrees is a good goal. And all climate scientists must be democrats too, otherwise there can't be consensus, right? If anything this video shows how dysfunctional the debate is in the US, without adding any much needed sanity."
"Capitalism is the issue, not individual consumption. When every real decision that impacts us is taken by corporations who only calculate the cost and benefit to them.   If a production technique makes them $1, it doesn't matter if it costs the world $1000.   Socialism changes this by enabling us to calculate the REAL costs and benefits of production."

At least I'm sure the world has faced far more catastrophical catastrophies and they are pretty much the reason we are living today (not implying that this is inherently a good thing though, I know what kind of people you are #notall) so yes many living animals and plants will die but no the world is not gonna end, it's gonna change. And even if the ecosystem is destroyed a new system will emerge. That's how I look at it. And you should look at it this way too though, I mean what except for a global catastrophy could else damage a global system like capitalism? You little misanthropists should view it as a chance.

"We all saw what we wanted to see in South Park. Yet even at 12 years old I never took Al Gore to be Alarmist.

Anyway the solution is not to save everybody. It's to kill the right people. Manbearbig must be stopped."

"Fact is, in 500 million years there will likely be no trace whatsoever that any of us existed beyond whatever gets fossilized. There has already been numerous extinction level events, some of which resemble the catastrophic predictions of global warming science, and more are coming. Greenhouse gas emissions might have something to do with the next mass extinction, but regardless, the sun will expend its core hydrogen, it has been slowly increasing in luminosity for this reason, and in 1 billion years or so the evaporation of the earth's oceans will be well underway. But before that time it is statistically inevitable that there will be a volcanic supereruption or meteor impact that will devastate the biosphere, and that's irrespective of whether or not humanity manages to avoid initiating a major nuclear war. Climate change is only the tip of the iceberg. Eventually the atmosphere of this planet will resemble present-day Venus, and very little of that will have anything to do with human emissions. Even if you could anticipate some way out of that for terrestrial life, the heat death of the universe after the Dark Era will be the unavoidable kill-switch of reality somewhere beyond 10^2500 years into the future.   There's a reason the universe is not awash in the radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, they probably are rare but even more importantly, they probably do not last very long; it has only taken us around 100 years to go from the development of radio technology to this flirting with self-destruction, nuclear or otherwise...

I'm starting to think that direct action needs to be financially impactful if it's going to get anybody to listen. There has to be a way to significantly hurt the bottom line of those 100 companies and force them to re-evaluate the profitability of what they're doing."
"I‚Äôve just accepted the fact that humanity probably won‚Äôt make it to 2100 and I‚Äôm still living my best life. It‚Äôs no sweat off my ass crack, everyday is a blessing my dudes.

We need bold progressive change in Congress and we need a Green New Deal. We do not have the time to negotiate with Pelosi and Schumer about what is 'realistic' or 'practical' in terms of Washington DC and their corporate donors.  Please for all of our sake folks, get out and vote in the Democratic primaries, they are seriously important to the outcomes that we get in Washington and even more important now than ever  to the survival of the planet.

Also I live in Central europe in a country that's considered 2nd world... And our government is completely insane, we're watching helplessly as they try to bring down democracy, ... let alone attempting to make them do something that's about a picture even bigger than this...

If our governments could agree on a worldwide price for carbon at the point of extraction or importation, and if they would stop subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, then market forces would drive UP the price of fossil fuels and make lower emission alternatives cheaper. Please see Citizens Climate Lobby for more information on how we can all make this happen to reduce emissions and create jobs in the green tech industries."

The production of said cars has as much of a global warming effect as the continued use of a combustion engine one has. I think the more viable alternative would be an easier access to public transport."

"Why...do you have a speculum?"
"Great video! That said, the 100 companies statistic is misleading-- if you read the original policy document, the 100 companies are just the 100 biggest sellers of fossil fuel, based on the assumption that all carbon emissions are ultimately from fossil fuel and somebody must have sold it to the people who burned it.  The other 29% of emissions aren't from individuals or other industries, they're from smaller companies with less market share. This proves nothing about the efficacy of individual action, nor was it meant to."

"Yeah, this video reminds me of a few political parties over the years who have petitioned to save the soil. Shame they've been so violently opposed. When I was an edgy teen, I used to say 'kill people, save the planet'. Nowadays I think it's a bit late for all that. Unfortunately, getting everyone to care about climate change is pretty damned unlikely. I've been trying since i was an edgy teen and the only people I've been able to convince are hard left or hard right. Centrists have too many 'creature comfort' concerns."

I try for my part to have a healthy lifestly that doesnt shit on the earth but the simple truth is I cant afford all of that. What do you say to mililons of people like me?

I hope Al Gore chokes on his jet plane exhaust, because the planet sure as hell is. I would say that Al Gore's hypocrisy and his profiteering off of 'awareness campaigns' have done more damage to the climate cause than advanced it.  Dr James Hansen has raised the need for unilateral action on climate change, irrespective of a globalised carbon trading 'market' by pushing for carbon fee and dividend. His supporters have put together a citizens climate lobby for legislated CFD that would provide an incentive for people to switch away from fossil fuels, and that does not require global agreements all too easily scuttled by commodity price cycles: https://citizensclimatelobby.org/ He, in conjunction with other climate scientists like Barry Brook, Ken Caldeira and Kerry Emanuel - all highly cited and lauded people, has put forth genuine solutions for breaking this log jam. Promoting the secondary benefits of decarbonising, like avoiding 7 million annual deaths from combustion particulates. Promoting GMOs that are less fertiliser and water intensive and can use no-till farming that would otherwise lead to greenhouse gas outflows from agriculture. Promoting nuclear power that has historically been the powerhouse behind decarbonisation of economies like Japan, France, Sweden and Canada. (And now China, UAE, Korea).   This sermonising video does little to advance the conversation of how we decarbonise our economies. It is in fact a repetition of the same tired conversation that has led us to this entrenched stalemate and has destroyed any sensible dialogue we could have about climate change. Discussing _whether or not climate change exists_ when it is used by deniers to stonewall conversations about _solutions_ is as harmful as climate change deniers themselves. You are lowering yourself to their level.  Climate deniers _love_ to talk about 'the science'. They would love to debate the validity of the hockey stick curve, RCP 2.6, the Gulf Stream, the temperature record. There's an entire website for it called theGWPF.org ('The Global Warming Policy Foundation'). The problem with trying to debate on their level is that they will bring you down and beat you with experience.  What we _should_ be talking about instead, and what can break the logjam between conservatives and liberals, is: - The sensitivity of our economies to commodity price fluctuations in coal, oil and gas. The OPEC cartel proved in the 60s that they could crash the global economy by turning off the taps in the Middle East. We cannot allow foreign commodities to dictate domestic economic activity. - Corollary to this, domestic trade surpluses and deficits are due in large part to the cost of energy. We need to make clean energy cheaper than coal, oil, and gas, and as reliable and as portable. The industries that grow to displace them will employ our future generations and massive R&D needs to start today - That we spend billions of dollars in healthcare costs due to asthma and other respiratory conditions brought on by fossil fuel particulates. Fossil fuels have funded our economic growth since the Industrial revolution but now we need a cleaner alternative and to eliminate that pollution brake on health and prosperity  Do NOT engage with their denialism. Engage instead with their principles of growth and prosperity. Sidestep the science and talk instead about post-carbon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwTiN9enSUY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1f4BKsFrCA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CBuRga5xxk  Anyway, let us go forth and make war upon the sea."

"as a regular person, what can people do? I know that foreign car companies have for many years been producing cars with almost zero emissions. I don't even own a car. I use the bus rarely. AS for food, I can barely afford meats, so we - as a family - eat meat one meal, 2 times a week. The rest is pasta or mushrooms or potatoes, anything affordable. Meat production costs the environment so much, and in the end I do pay for all that. I HAVE to live within my means and that's fine. I know I am doing all that I can by changing mine and my family's carbon footprint, along with supporting all claims to climate change."

"Ms Wynn, I would be careful with one of your later assertions that suggests that capitalism is ill-equipped to handle this problem. The self-revolutionising capacity of capitalism can be attributed, if David Graeber is to be believed, to its ability to sustain a state of mind in those who live under it that capitalism has an end. This was the case in the development of damaging bubbles in newly industrialised Britain, Holand and France, where capitalism was assumed to exist forever, and, consequently, irrevocably damaged and almost destroyed their monarchies. This was also the case during the Cold War, where the possibility of being replaced by a Soviet-style 'degenerated workers' state' strengthened capitalism around the world. Capitalism will use climate change as a way to continue itself, maintaining the system of inequality while claiming to be a force for good. The large opportunities to be had in the development of renewable energy reveals how government action towards the expansion of the energy industry is directed towards the interests of Capital, not away from it.  What the Americans, and the people of the world, need to be careful of in the pursuit of a more equitable economic system is not to treat the voices of the scores of individuals who wish to abandon capitalism as a legitimate show of movement away from Capital, for they make the strongest case for capitalism in the minds of the sedentary public. Rather, they must understand that capitalism has answers to the problems of climate change, but that these answers do not care for those who cannot, would not or do not (want to) join capitalism's rhetoric involving 'equal opportunity' and the  'free-market' metaphor."

This means newer cars and in working order always, can't afford 2 cars now so congratulations, trucks are now daily drivers. Elderly and disabled that used to get cheap smoking heaps to drive to bank and grocery every or every other week and maybe do 2-3k miles a year now have to work part time to afford a newer car and all the upkeep to keep compliant.   Everything is politicized and reduced to single dimensional caricatures of the real issues, this is why most policies have the opposite of intended effects.

There is going to be the mother of all crunches.    Part 2 Reptiles - u can reduce the Reptile theme down to controlling your own currency & the people who do control it realise they have to keep society disrupted & incoherent (evil?) to maintain their position at the top of the pyramid.

Putting a lot of mirrors up in the stratosphere would work and there are lots of far better ideas."
"Land use issues, such as deforestation, play as much a role in climate change as emissions do, because forests (especially tropical forests) are a massive carbon sink and vital source of oxygen.  Deforestation continues in the developing world (including large countries like Brazil and Indonesia) due to a combination of population pressures and demand for land clearance for agriculture, mining, or other economic activity."

The drought is a huge reason for the exodus of ppl from Honduras and Central America. When we talk about climate change we need to talk about DHS."
"Unlike other Natalie videos where the dialogue between characters take up a significant time in the video, this one had Doc explaining a lot of already established science on climate change and including the deniers in between. I think it's primarily because many are unaware of how seriously wrong the denier position is on climate change, scientifically. But in other cases, like feminism and other issues, we have rationale approach rather than alluring to the science and its right to do so because the issues are social in nature. Overall, it's brilliant as always."

"Libertarian here.  Honestly, I think one of our biggest problems is the fact that the government subsidizes the oil industry at the expense of...literally everyone. The amount of oil the U.S. is in possession of would actually kill all of us if we attempted to burn it all, or even most of it (not to mention we got a lot of it from countries we shouldn't have fucked with in the first place).  Our economy itself is actually fully ready to go mainly renewable. In fact, we've been discovering more and more ways to REVERSE the effects of climate change. Once abandoned trash dumps are being revisited and used to recycle into clothing, technology, and more. The black forrest in Germany has been revitalized to be as lush as it was in the 1800's. More trees grow under the paper industry than they would otherwise, and even if this weren't the case (which it is), the flash drive has saved more trees than greenpeace ever has.  We're AWARE climate change is an issue, it's common knowledge, it's taught in schools, and U.S.A. civilians are prepared to go renewable . The only problem is that we have forced reliance on destructive corporations all because of corporatist policy out of our immediate control.  Now I'm not here to place the gov't as the boogeyman and say there's no hope. There absolutely is, and I urge anyone reading this to make sure their tax dollars aren't being used as blood money.   the inherent eroticism of the ocean is immeasurable and beautiful and I hope I reflected that in this comment."

"Contra, there is a crucial 2018 PNAS paper about something called the Hothouse Earth trajectory that I think you should look into if you haven't, which deals with tipping points of about 15 positive feedback loops at play that scientists have verified so far.  Also, the IPCC's 12 years window of action is entirely predicated on old data, some of which is 10 years old.  Nothing new was generated in it.  Field observations of the rate of Arctic melt, for example, is proving to be outpacing the IPCC's models by 25-30 years, with the first ice-free summer Arctic expected to hit around 2023 or so, according to the data.  We need to act now, and you should consider promoting the crucial currently active movements EarthStrike and Extinction Rebellion by name in your future videos."

"Don't forget about climate change's infinitely more dangerous cousin, 'ocean acidification,' also being directly caused by having too much carbon in the atmosphere. Around 75% of the Earth's population lives on the ocean shore, and most of them survive off of their local fishing economies there. Well, if there's a cataclysmic global extinction event in the ocean's food chain because the lower links on that chain are LITERALLY being dissolved by an acidic ocean before they can even breed, then a PERMANENT global economic collapse followed by a PERMANENT lowering of the planet's carrying capacity is inevitable for our species.  And what has history taught us about human beings when their food production infrastructure and economic security utterly collapse out from under them in a short period of time? That's right. Warfare, genocide, mass migration, social distrust, and an inability to reestablish civil human society for several centuries afterwards. Believe it or not, humanity has been here before. Just look at the 'Late Bronze Age Collapse,' a civilization destroying event back during the Bronze Age initially brought on by mass starvation. An event by the way, that humanity didn't manage to fully recover from, for over 600 years!"

"As a small note on the election of Trump & Climate change: It's an unfortunate detail that the Republican party is going to be a continuous poison for this issue. A climate change denier would be the nominee regardless of if they nominated Cruz, Rubio, Jeb etc.   This isn't because they are all complete loons, ex Rubio and Jeb seemed to be aware that yes, global warming is a major issue (and deciding that nothing should be done about it); but rather because the Republican base is chock full of conspiratorial loons (who primary anyone who doesn't ape them). Essentially this issue is going to be a recurring one every election until the Republican party is rendered either irrelevant, or is forced to undergo such a massive realignment that it's base is essentially evicted from the party."

We all know where the hate and darkness lives now we need to for once rise up and beat it back while we still get a vote.

"I was taught about climate change and the greenhouse effect at school in the UK in the early 1990's when you were still in diapers probably (maybe you weren't? - you're kind of smart I guess). I resented how, effectively, the adults of the time were basically pinning the solution all on us school kids - not concerning themselves with people in power like Trump who are their age. People of my generation are still not the one's in power: information is power - and only a select few have access to it."
"Everyone talks about how detrimental meat is to the environment but no one talks about how avocado farming is fucking with Central America or regions or Africa (not just environmentally either, but in regards to slave labor), or about how palm oil is irreversibly destroying ecosystems in the Amazon, or about how harvesting and farming algae (spirulina) is not sustainable? Shipping in tropical foods from all over the world to make smoothie bowls and shit is bad for the environment. What will help climate change food-wise is destroying big ag and eating and farming local. Everyone should be supporting local farmers if they have the money and means to do so."

"What a great video to relax in the bath with"
"It makes me think about this sketch of SNL, *Vote Fraud Cold open*. There was a list of things Kate McKinnon (in the role of Laura Ingraham) presented like this :  'You can't dismiss that idea because it isn't true and sounds insane. In fact, let's add that to our list of feel facts. Which aren't technically facts, but they just feel true.'  And of course, there it was : 'If the earth is so warm, then why are my feet cold ?'  I laughed hard during all this sketch, between this and 'Latinos can have a baby every three months'. Then I realized that yeah, some people actually believe all of this. it sobered me quickly.  - edit - As an afterthought, in France we had a climate denier as a president, Nicolas Sarkozy who claimed : 'It's been 4 billions years climate is changing. Sahara became a desert, it's not because of industry. Only an arrogant like mankind think we changed the climate'. He's not anymore president, but his views are not exactly isolated right now :/"

"This is always going to be a hard sell. Most of the people I know aren't even sure they want to be alive right now, let alone in 20, 50, or 100 years. Even the ones who are all about living that sweet, late capitalism life are too scared of losing their creature comforts to actually do anything beyond the superficial. And last, the vast majority of the control over whether or not things actually change is in the hands of the wealthy elites who are fully convinced they can buy their way into surviving it all, Elysium style. That's not even an exaggeration. Look at Elon Musk. He thinks he can build a colony on Mars and giant rockets and space stations for the rich to pay him to live on. The imperialist nations are already closing borders, building walls of all kinds, and getting ready for massive population controls through martial rule.  Sure, let's fight it, but if we're not gonna fight it with all we got then why bother at all? Let's not half ass it."

"The sea votes republican? Now that's a real shocker!"
"But seriously now, yes climate change should be a much greater concern, I think any human with half a brain knows that. The problem is that even when its repercussions are imminent, terrible and, if we continue just as we do, inevitable, they still seem to be too far into the future for anyone to care. Specially with all the fuss about other more immediate problems like the state of the economy, the ever more polarizing politics, the migration crisis that affects more and more countries, the advance and conflict of PC culture against the status quo and conservative view, and many many others (as it was very well put in the video), without any sort of solution to these problems or at least partial ones to reduce the amount of attention and importance we give to them, we hardly can focus in eating less meat, choosing greener alternatives of energy or worry about how lavish lifestyles affect the environment."

"If climate change really is this huge priority for you, then change your political platform to reflect that preference. Get rid of all other contentious issues that might bother right-wingers so you can convince them to vote for your candidates. Stop trying to advance gun control, stop trying to raise social program spending, quit all the asinine culture war shit. Do all of that and I'll believe that you genuinely care about stopping climate change; maybe I'll even vote Democrat. Until then I see your rhetoric around climate change as just another plank in your campaign to advance the entirely of your leftist agenda. I could buy into this one thing with you, but the rest of it I'm not having."
"When the Australian prime minister got backstabbed because he tried to put in a renewables energy target into his parties (terrible) policy and replaced by someone that waved a piece of coal around parliament I was so unbelievably angry, shouting at the t.v, curling up in the corner in anxiety angry.  The person who will be running against my member of parliament actually called me... weird I know... and I had a half an hour chat about how mad I was about the change in prime minister and the reason for its occurrence. But this person has no chance of winning, this is a safe seat that has never gone to his party in history, my vote (which is still required here) cannot change the government.  His party policy announced recently is well okay, they tried, it's nice to have someone try, it will probably meet our Paris agreements, but we know now, that's not enough, Australia just had its largest CO2 emissions since 2004... we lost 6 years we needed to make a difference.  Strike huh, well I can't strike when I don't have a job, unfortunately. Recent PhD graduate in science not climate science but I can read and understand it. You know what happened in Australia on Friday, school children went on strike. School children went on strike because our government refuses to do anything about climate change...  And still, I am left with a question what can I do? I have the knowledge, I even have skills applicable to renewable energy production and storage but for now, that would be months of throwing my resume around and years of mostly ineffectually banging my head against the limits of human knowledge (the bit with the scientist doubting herself and purpose hit a bit too close to home)...what can I do... do I run for Parliment?"

Even if climate change doesn't ruin a harvest outright with temperature fluctuations that cause vines to bud early and be killed off by a late frost (2017) or with hailstorms that destroy entire crops (2018), it will still make for less and worse alcohol. Two thirds of wine regions are projected to be agriculturally or commercially nonviable by 2020!"

"If you care about literally anything on this dumb earth, there's a good chance that it'll be ruined in whole or in part by climate change. The problem with confronting people with that fact, using their favorite thing, is that people can always retreat into flat denialism because humanity, as a whole, is really good at believing that something won't happen if they don't want it to happen.

"Thank you for this. Seriously. I just got in a pointless debate on youtube about this topic. I usually don't post contrary material because I see no point in inevitably engaging with trolls, but I just said something about global warming and triggered a bunch of people who were triggered I was triggered. Someone made fun of my liberal tears, someone else told me that 'saving the earth sounds nice but it means too much sacrifice and will result in the killing of all poor people' (an argument I was not familiar with), and another person said climate science was too vague to worry about because 'we don't even know how bad co2 really is'.I don't understand how so many scientifically illiterate people genuinely think they know better than the experts. Dear lord.  EDIT: forgot to mention the brilliant retort I got of 'well, climate change is an inevitability. Ice ages happen, warming occurs, the earth changes and it is arrogant to think humans can do anything about it.' It is reminiscent of the idea 'if everyone dies eventually, then people should just run into the middle of busy intersections with their eyes closed.' It is baffling to me that even those who admit to climate change seem to throw up their hands in the air and would rather go on living like they do and have to terraform mars instead of making some sacrifices and attempt to save the only place in the known universe we are currently aware of that can sustain life. The earth won't end in a colossal boom where we all ascend painlessly to heaven, it will just start sucking so much harder. And harder and harder. And our cute little grandbabies will wonder why we let it happen so goddamn easy."

"Finally talking about a very important topic.   Eating less animal products won't help us, we need to end animal agriculture.   FACTS with sources:   Animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. (http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM)  Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. (http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf)  Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide ‚Äì a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. (http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)  Even without fossil fuels, we will exceed our 565 gigatonnes CO2e limit by 2030, all from raising animals. (http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294)  Not to mention water use - Animal agriculture water consumption ranges from 34-76 trillion gallons annually. (https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3098/pdf/2009-3098.pdf)  Growing feed crops for livestock consumes 56% of water in the US. (Jacobson, Michael F. ‚ÄúSix Arguments For a Greener Diet: How a More Plant-based Diet Could Save Your Health and the Environment. Chapter 4: More and Cleaner Water‚Äù. Washington, DC: Center for Science in the Public Interest, 2006.)  477 gallons of water are required to produce 1lb. of eggs;  almost 900 gallons of water are needed for 1lb. of cheese. (http://www.watereducation.org/post/food-facts-how-much-water-does-it-take-produce)  Land use is also incredibly pertinent:   Livestock or livestock feed occupies 1/3 of the earth‚Äôs ice-free land.. (http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/News/2006/1000448/index.html)  Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction. (https://comfortablyunaware.wordpress.com/2012/06/09/biodiversity-and-food-choice-a-clarification/)  Land required to feed 1 person for 1 year:"
"Vegan: 1/6th acre"
""
"Vegetarian: 3x as much as a vegan"
""
"Meat Eater: 18x as much as a vegan"
"(Robbins, John. Diet for a New America, StillPoint Publishing, 1987, p. 352)  If you're asking yourself why you should care, or stating that human rights issues are more important..  It is also worth putting the animal suffering problem into perspective. Worldwide, 56 billion land animals are killed every year for food. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon deforestation. Nowhere in the world are humans being exploited in the magnitude and severity as non-human animals are. If they were, there would be global unrest and the issue would be addressed immediately."

We are goddamn lazy monkeys, nothing will change if the change is not cool or profitable. So make it cool or profitable ‚Äî history proves again and again that such problems have some elegant and simple solutions. This is true for veganism, communism or many other leftist ‚Äûism‚Äú-s. You can even make a rule of it: if somebody says that humanity should come together and change its behaviour, he's probably wrong and misses the simpler solution.

"The super rich 0.01% who run the world can afford super-Yachts with air conditioning, that will literally and metaphorically 'float above the problem', so they simply won't be affected, whilst millions of others will die. Last year, the seafaring super-rich spent $2.9 billion on super Yachts, whilst laughing all the way to the bank at the terminal gullibility of the 'disposable' voter-consumer classes.  Coastal cities worldwide will be under sea-water, whilst the grain-belt of the USA would be reduced to infertile sand dunes as the temperature rose and rainfall patterns changed. Curiously however, in the short-term at least, not everyone in the world would loose-out under global-warming. The exception is the vast Russian steppe region (currently infertile due to perma-frost) which would  thaw out, and could (for a while) become the new grain-belt, radically shifting global politics, as the USA would need to import all its food from Russia or starve, making Russia the dominant global superpower. Is it any wonder that Russian-controlled political puppets in the USA (especially the orange-faced ones) are so keen on deliberately increasing global warming."
"It's not even a matter of steady inevitable drowning of cities. If you understand chaos theory and climate as a giant chaotic system, it gives you the answer for so much (including cold snaps, even record cold snaps). Feed energy into chaos and it goes more bonkers. Every tenth of a degree widens the range of outrageousness weather brings us. Long before the cities are underwater, they're gonna be flattened by completely bonkers storms, winds and rains. We can already see this, bigtime. Remember chaos."

Think they care? The US has no natural barrier like the Mediterranean for refugees to drown in so the wall (which already mostly exists) had to be put up.

Even if we had communism/socialism/worker syndicates/coops, there is absolutely no way to consume animal products in an environmentally healthy way."

"#EarthStrike #ExtinctionRebellion"
"20 to 12 years left. Huh, all this time I've been theroughly, genuinly, annoyed by people to the point it's just full on hatred now. Let's review the facts we know: First, we've been repeatedly shown time and time again that the Far-Right/Conservatives don't care about the people and those around the  world as the oh-so-claim. They don't even care about the people in their own country unless their Rich-White-Elitist who puff their own shit and view everyone from the middle-class to lower as 'Bellow them,' this evidence is continuously backed up by the amount of Corperate/Wallstreet deregulation they do. Along with the unecessary and illegal warfare we've engaged in against other countries for nearly the last 17 years. All of the justifications being litteral American imperialism to basically just comming out and saying 'We're only there to take their resources,' having mixed how the Trump administration royally fucked us over in the beginning of getting off fossil fuels and the DNC now accepting Corporate PAC money as donation's to help raise their campaigne funds again to the New administration in Brazil now considering deforestation in the Amazon along with the genecide of an indiginous people who've lived there FOR YEARS! Along with numerous other actions that have the ability fuck over their people along with the WORLD much like the U.S...  And the worst part is all of point 1 doesn't cover the giant amount of shit that's going to lead to the Third Extinction...  The Humanist Report putts alot more detail in these news reports as well, I'd highly recommend everyone to check him out. In his most recent video he sums the jist of this really well, but basicly my generation along with all future ones will have to litterally deal with the consequences of the last generation's action's. Because let's face it, the people governing us right now, as well as the Fossil fuel companies that are at the end of their lives. They're not going to see the worst effects climate chang is gonna have to offer in the next 50 or even 20 years! So, much akin to the Conservative character Natalie played in this video, they're living up the height of their lives whereas people like me or any future generation are not going to get that chance since, by that point, we could litterally be living in a post-apocolyptic world when they are dead and gone. Now explain to me, how's that fair?  I see everyone blissfully unaware of the potential hellish future they might live in the next 20 YEARS!!!!!! And the worst part is they got to live!!!!!! What about me?!?!?!?!?!?! This is why I've come to hate people in general. They're, by definition, stupid. Sure, we could band together, have an 'Earth Strike' as people are calling it. We could put public pressure on politicians and demand change to renewable sources of energy... But think about this, people have shown us time and time again they don't give a shit about us unless it raises their profits and even then the reason why this is the hill they're willing to die on is because they know if they give in their businesses will be shut down. They have lobbying firms, Far-Right media, Corporate Reps, and millions of jobs and advertisements behind them continuing to spread misinformation. Do you really think we could beat all of that with the amount of time we have left? 12 years. 12 years to change or we die.  We're going to need Radical change if that's the case to save the Earth. I'm talking an armed Revolution here. A Coup. And not everyone's on board with that idea and some of those who are, might think to use it for personal gain via the MIC aka the War Economy. So I'm not optimistic we'll come together or make any real change fast enough to divert a humanitarian/environmental crises by the likes of which we've never seen.  As much as I like your videos Natalie, the alternatives aren't very realistic and these are the kinds of things that only the Governments of countries have the power to do. However, they refuse to take action due to intereferance with Corporate financial interest. I hope the world proves me wrong. I hope we break this cycle of insanity that has plagued us through history... That we could live in a world that makes sense... But we don't. The world can only make sense if you force it to. People can only learn through pain. So naturally I say, we give it to them."

The 'left' has to deal with republicans respectfully, establishing a good relation, not calling them idiots or paranoids. Insist on the problems, it's causes and solutions; fill the discussion with logical substrate, following discussion ethics. We can never assure we bear the truth, this is logically impossible, we assume that we may be right, but we could be wrong, and we are never 100% correct, republicans may be right.

I would tell those Republicans: do you really want to live in a world where you can't take your kids to see orangutans or giraffes in the zoo?

"Not that I care too much about South Park getting any credit, considering how much damage their nihilistic faux-centrist libertarian bullshit has caused, but... I reluctantly admit I find it funny sometimes, and two of the more recent episodes from this past month ('Time to Get Cereal' and 'Nobody Got Cereal?') actually rehabilitated Al Gore, admitted ManBearPig is real, and essentially admitted that they were totally wrong. It was as close to an apology as one could possibly ask for from Matt and Trey. Unfortunately it still ended on a cynical note, but that's South Park. Anyway I'd recommend anyone who can stomach/possibly enjoy the show to watch those two episodes, if all you've seen is the old original Manbearpig episode."
"Damn girl you look so good"
"The problem I have with 'lefty' policies on the environment is they require people to make sacrifices, damage their economies, lose jobs etc (while IMO seeming very ineffective). There needs to be a more friendly path preferably with immediate gratification, For example people wont give up meat to save their own lives now, do we really expect them to give it up to save people who don't even exist yet? Vegans need to gather their best recipes and offer people foods that taste better (are cheaper) than meat, (theses actually exist)  and only when they are readily available and non judgemental will they win in a capitalist world!"

"Humans have a hard time grasping climate change for the same reason we have trouble comprehending evolution: Our brains are extremely bad at comprehending time, especially on a long term scale. We're only good at dealing and processing things as they happen in the short term because ironically, that's sort of how we evolved to be. It was how we survived. Most humans in the beginning probably didn't think that far ahead. They probably didn't even expect to see tomorrow‚Äî let alone the impacts of their actions decades and centuries from now."

"THE EROTICISM OF THE SEA"
"Fossil fuels drive 85% of energy generation. Most alternatives we have access to are dependent or in some way derivative of fossil fuel energy. We are 15 years too late to avoid drastic economic impact once effects are felt. Any reduction now or in the future simply decreases the severity of the events, even complete cessation of emissions.  The inconvenient truth is that a cool several fucking billion of us were only even born because of fossil fuels. Any technologies we develop will require substantial emissions to facilitate a transition to a more sustainable model at the current scale. Almost no aspect of the modern world is possible without large amounts of energy for production, operation, or both.  The suggestions you gave would certainly reduce your emissions, but at this point the goal should absolutely not be to reduce. It should be to CEASE IMMEDIATELY. Not to mention many of those suggestions still require substantial dependence on fossil fuels. And without a literally god like miracle the only realistic way to do that is to become unilaterally more poor and give up a set of luxuries we were only granted from fossil fuels.  People say time is money but that's bullshit. Energy is money and we live in a world with an obvious addiction and limited understanding of high school level physics and science. The situation is actually quite a bit more grim than this video let's on. Good one as always tho."

"Lately I've become really pessimistic about all this. I get the impression day after day that global capitalism is immune to any kind of action taken against it because it has become too powerful and widespread to allow any kind of substantial change in it's basic functioning in a large enough scale.  Which leads me to believe that things will probably stay pretty much the same until the cataclysm is inevitable and/or the global economic system collapses on itself to a degree that it cannot be rebuilt. And what may come after might not be better than what came before.  Honestly it's pretty disheartening, I feel that the only thing I can do is not having any kids and try to not think about it too much."

If these Electric cars were more affordable to the working class than there would be considerable less emissions and more Oil companies begging on their knees.

Such a struggle... I am still apprehensive about it all. I guess I'll leave a hint. I'm 26 started hrt young and got srs at 21. I wonder if contra knows who I am lol.

"Love your videos Natalie. Keep up the great work.  I want to throw out some constructive criticism here, and it's a point I'm sure you expected to get when you made this. (2000 comments and counting so I know this is going to get buried but fuck it) Part of what has made your work so powerful is that it strives to present the opposition, when there is one, in its strongest form. As you know, avoiding strawmen is the only way for conversations like these to move forward. You've been great at this in the past, but I feel the bougie bathtub character in this vid made for a very poor representation of the position (i mean who wears their underwear in the bath?? she's clearly out of her mind :P). I don't need to see a vapid moron get schooled on climate change - I want to see the very best that climate science deniers have to offer get schooled on climate change. Otherwise, this video is just preaching to the choir, and that won't help anyone who disagrees to see the truth. Christopher Monckton, for example, has been a favorite among deniers, and I feel you could have done a hilarious spoof on his posh ass.  PS hit me up if you ever want to do a spoof on my posh ass"

You also fail to mention the political instability that will inevitable arise from arid countries becoming inhospitable, as such that we‚Äôve already seen in Syria and Darfur, and the implicit threat of that political instability, supplemented by the climate refugee crises you make reference to, could have potentially devastating consequences in a nuclear armed world. I‚Äôm afraid the situation is a lot more grim than you make it out to be in this video."

"hey kids! fossil fuel companies are not your friends! take it from your resident west virginian, they'll kill you to make a dollar! coal companies are destroying my home and have been for decades. they have historically done literally anything the law will let them to make the maximum amount of money possible. inescapable poverty, unsafe working conditions, pitting marginalized populations against each other, lying to their customers and employees, ousting dissenters, fuck, coal companies have actively killed striking miners. not just in accidents. battle of blair mountain, 1921. strikers were shot down for striking, the police and the government backed up the coal company. they literally dropped bombs on striking miners from airplanes above. that was almost a hundred years ago, yet they're still doing this shit. they've attempted and succeeded to suppress local labor history and information about climate change, destroy historical landmarks relating to the battle of blair mountain, intentionally allow for potentially disastrous mining accidents, create newer and incredibly polluting mining practices like mountaintop removal and fracking, mass layoffs, bribing elected officials with buckets of lobbying money. FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES DO NOT SUPPORT AMERICA. i know i sound off my fucking rocker but you can look any of this shit up, it's true. the more you learn, the worse it gets, it's genuinely horrifying. they have destroyed my history, my people, and my home, and they are perfectly content with it happening to you."

No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized by the 'Dark Mother' as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planes of existence and yet, across the gulf of the ocean a mind immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with her envious eyes, and slowly and surely Dark Mother swelled and expanded her ocean frontiers as she used our short-sighted plans against us."

Or Find a way to reduce costs towards eco friendly solutions and subsidizing those costs for companies , making the market naturally go towards renewable energy. Elect people who will stop the sugar and oil subsidies. Eat LESS meat that you haven‚Äôt farmed or hunted yourself (you don‚Äôt have to go full vegan, we are omnivores after all and there are evofriendly ways to get meat) Make public transportation non-gas based.

"I'm quite pessimistic that we'll survive. Capitalism and the elite have brought the entire humanity on its knees. However gotta keep hopeful and optimistic even when facing the horrible truth. Ethical consumption is quite weak, but under the current system that's about as much as you can do to help so veganism or even cutting down on your red meat consumption is useful. Of course violent revolutionary action, strikes etc. are useful tools to possibly bring about some change. Of course the liberal media does attack you when you violently oppose the status quo so very large scale movements all over the world are needed. The riots in France right now should be our model in Europe I think."

"The New Yorker piece on you was sooo good mommy! üòò"
"Hey! Longtime viewer, first time commenter.   Your video made me tremble in fear -- like litarally, physically shake  --  during the most dire parts. I get these shakes when I read or hear particularly devastating stuff about climate change, which is my absolute gravest concern. It worries me to the point where it's my main source of depression and anxiety.  The severity of the subject has compelled me to try and understand the world as best as possible. If we understand it, then maybe, hopefully, we can change it. I've read almost sixty books so far this year, among them 'This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate' by Naomi Klein and 'The Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming' by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway (I recommend these books). I've also read books on philosophy, politics, neoliberalism, propaganda and fascism. I read heavy stuff, and it's downright masochistic at times. I think you have to be a masochist to keep my reading habits up for long.  My greatest ambition in life is to become a writer and tackle the topics of climate change and fascism -- because I think the latter will flourish under the former. (My greatest areas of interest are climate change and fascism. Yup, I'm great at parties.) But ambition often feels like a burden, and so I start doubting my talents, becoming afraid that I won't do my grand visions justice. As someone who's been a struggling writer yourself, you can relate, right?   Your video was exactly what I needed. I'll doubtless rewatch it many times, like I've done with all your videos (yes, even the ones you don't want me to see anymore. Sorry, baby, I can't help it! They're too good!) Along with depressing books, your channel has aided me greatly in my valiant effort to understand the world, and I'm really only writing this long-ass comment to thank you.   Thank you for your thought-provoking and hilarious videos. You tell bitter truths about the direst of topics, with wit. That's a gift, a gift I envy and aspire to attain myself. You're an inspiration and a motivational force. Thank you.  PS: I loved the use of the reptile iconography at the end. 'The reptiles' need not be like anything out of a conspiracy theory. A reptile may more broadly be understood as anyone who succumbs to an ideology where they just ignore climate change. They may know climate change is real, they may know their habits only worsens it, they may know who's ultimately responsible, but they just ignore the problem altogether because 'Feels good, man.' They succumb to the sweet, numbing and nihilistic ideology of hedonistic consumption (which I guess you could also call fucking neoliberalism!) 'The reptiles' are merely people who've reverted to their reptile brain in this most deplorable fashion."

I'd love to go vegetarian because I feel sorry for the animals, I know that animals are alive, conscious and aware, and a lot smarter/more similar to humans than most people like to admit. But I just can't let go of meat, I don't know what else I would eat. My appetite suffers already as in nothing at all seems tasty, and I own several large carnivorous lizards so I'd have to buy meat products of some kind anyway, their bodies aren't made for going vegan lol."

"Speaking of general strikes- this last Friday, tens of thousands of Australian School kids had a climate strike- they refused to go, or walked out of school, and held demonstrations all over the country. This was organised by the school kids themselves.   Proud to say my daughter was one of the strikers. So there are some that care.   Also, Australian politicians are just as bad- they‚Äôre celebrating the opening of another new coal mine (even calling it- a massive Indian mining corporation, a ‚Äúlittle Aussie battler‚Äù üôÑ). That coal mine is being given all the free water they want (in an arid country!), are being given a ‚Äúroyalties holiday- so they are basically being paid to take our resources, instead of paying us for them, and are right next to, and shipping the coal out directly through the Great Barrier Reef- you know, just the largest reef in the world, the one that dying in front of our eyes- not to mention, the reef that supports 70,000 tourism jobs. But sure, risking all of that for maybe 40 temporary local jobs is totally worth it.   Our government is also pushing for more coal fired power stations- even though they are already more expensive than renewable alternatives. Gee, wonder if that has anything to do with the massive donations, and revolving door of pollies- mining company lobbyists? Our current minister for the environment literally used to work for a mining company. A former resources minister now works for the offical mining lobby.   It‚Äôs all so corrupt and fucked up. They don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre killing humanity‚Äôs future. They care about getting more money now- fuck the kids and grandkids!   But- that school strike was pretty awes me, even if the pollies‚Äô response to it was atrocious: literally, stay in school and we should teach you about they joys of mining and fracking. Damn those science teachers teaching kids the truth!   I wonder why they‚Äôre so keen to fuck over education??"
"You're like a Sassy Queer Bill Nye"
"I just wanted to clarify one quick point that‚Äôs made in this video because it‚Äôs often brought up in discussions on other political topics but ‚Äòcost‚Äô of a food can be measured in 2 ways, the actual average price per pound (or whatever unit of measurement you wish) OR caloric cost. This is why in discussions of food deserts and the importance of preserving corner stores in the wake of gentrification cheap McDonald hamburgers and the like are brought up. Because even if the ingredients to roasted eggplant or salad are more affordable over say a months worth of budget than something akin to McDonald‚Äôs everynight, McDonald‚Äôs, meat of all qualities, and animal products (milk cheese egg) are MUCH cheaper calorically. This is often overlooked because of discussions of calorie control and dieting, but a lot of lower class work still requires calorie intake, and often may require a higher calorie intake than higher paid working positions (ignoring lifestyles outside of the workspace, I‚Äôm talking bare minimum here) due to the requirement to work longer hours, do heavy lifting, staying on your feet, etc. And while something like McDonald‚Äôs r whatever doesn‚Äôt have high nutritional value, our bodies are MUCH more reliant on calories than proper vitamins to function properly/at all, and is one of the reasons Veganisn is NOT widely recommended as a suitable or even viable lifestyle change to help content global warming (as opposed to vegetarianism which IS widely recommended) since non meat animal products like dairy and eggs contain more calories than many conventional vegan options (this is actually WHY we have dairy at all, because Northern Europeans needed to cultivate a source of high high caloric food during the cold winters, and had to develop/evolve lactose tolerance past adolescence. This is also why caucasians have the lowest rates of lactose intolerance, since the gene isn‚Äôt inherit to humans as a whole and originated in Northern Europe, with the descendants in modern day carrying on the same genetic coding no matter their actual home tempature or calorie needs)  Really loved the video, as a nuclear physics undergrad the future of energy consumption and distribution is intergrak to my studies and I just thought I‚Äôd share some context for others  to an offhand comment that tends to pop up in other political and apolitical discussions not directly related to climate change."
"In some ways I think the problem is the wording (because everything always comes down to linguistics). The planet isn't being destroyed, the planet is a rock in the endless void, it'll be destroyed when the sun blows up. The environment isn't being destroyed, the environment is just a generic term for the biology around us and can't be qualitatively judged as being good or bad. Climate change won't kill the planet or kill the environment, it's going to kill *US*. Humans. All the environmentalist whining about penguins and polar bears have only made people think that we're not the ones in danger."

"0:10 literally an ethereal queen"
"1. Yea shit's looking REALLY BAD. 2. Hey, at least China's going to save us....  Ok, maybe I should go ahead and expand upon this point a bit more. Hopefully, everyone is aware of the 35 BILLION (yes with a B) US DOLLARS China is putting into green infrastructure. Not just in China, but developing nations?  Why is China doing this? To become the next world super power. In a few short years, thanks to green infrastructure in underdeveloped countries that were dominated by the US and Saudi's to keep underdeveloped for easier raping, these countries will no longer be beholden to either religion (Saudi's construction of Muslim universities or the US demanding abstinence only education, just as two examples) or to the enslavement of its people (on going civil wars for easier access to materials or slave state jobs, just as examples). Once these countries are producing eco friendly products and have higher educational standards, China will have MASSIVE trade partners unlike anything before in history.  So that's it, right? Not by a long shot. This is the reason I am not worried about North Korea. In short, China knows where it is about to be in relation to the rest of the world (as THE superpower). They are smart enough to realize that in order to be a world superpower, they need a world to be a superpower of. China is already enacting stringent environmental regulations. I have a theory though. With China dumping this money in green infrastructure and technology, they are actively researching ways of not just fighting global warming, but actively reversing it. They have already made great strides elsewhere with science (genetically modified twins? Fuck yea, I'm in). So, I would say it's not too far fetched to believe they have some kind of plan.  So let's say I am right. China is about to end global warming within however long, no more worries, right? WHAT THE HELL? HOW IN THE NAME OF OUR EVERLOVING FAVORITE KERMIT IMPRESSIONIST DID YOU EVER COME TO THAT CONCLUSION? Even if this does happen, it means very little if we do not slow global warming to a point were it is reversible. Let's say it doesn't matter and China can reverse it anyway, well, I don't know about you but I still don't like China. I don't really like any power actually. Any superpower is inherently evil. The US will just drag behind unless we enact our own green new deal. Not that I'm in favor of the US just creating a new status quo with a green new deal, but holy shit, we still need to be careful. Even if I'm right, that doesn't mean we won't be open to new threats and challenges. Sustainability for humanity IS a huge problem that green resources will help fix (feeding a few more billion people? Easier done when the crop takes less then something like a hundredth of current crops... yes I'm talking about crickets, get over it). We still have a lot to work for and to fight for. I would also never admit this or say it to a skeptic, but....  We can point out that China is about to become an economic powerhouse because of their green new deal. Maybe we can use the right's open xenophobia to coerce them to help with a green new deal of our own because I'm pretty sure the right really doesn't like China.  Either that or I'm just crazy. I mean I have several really bad mental illnesses... but you get what I mean."

"I'm glad you addressed animal agriculture in this. The most common estimate I've seen is 18% of GHG emissions, just on meat, dairy and eggs (that's more than the entirety of transport; private, public and commercial). While radical change is necessary, we can't demand change to the industries while still demanding the damaging products and services they provide us, blaming the system is just another way to avoid responsibility and do nothing.  I'm also glad you addressed the 'soy gives you moobs/turns you into a woman' (wouldn't that make it easy). The only study supporting that included wildly unrealistic amounts of soy, and was supported by the dairy industry, while more impartial studies suggest that as phytoestrogen is the same shape but has a completely different chemical makeup, it actually blocks estrogen receptors reducing the risk of hormone-related cancers (and moobs).  Are you vegan yourself Natalie? It certainly seems like the core principals of justice and freedom from exploitation for all are things you share, and can you really say you believe those principles if you exclude animals from them because they taste nice?"

I live in one of the most liberal countries on Earth, we're so progressive that led lights are already mandatory, other light bulbs became illegal years ago. And we have more electric cars per capita than any other nation, soon they'll be mandatory too. Our politicians are always talking about things that need to be done to clean up, even though we're already leading in renewable energy and innovative new green solutions. Guess how we fund all that progress? Oil, lots and lots of oil. Our awesome /s politicians recently expanded oil drilling in the north sea and proclaimed we'd have a steady income from oil for at least a few more decades. Yay Norway. A population so racists we elected a right wing government as soon as they mentioned immigration, despite knowing what the right wing actually is, we did it before Trump made it cool even. Of course nobody here would admit to themselves that they're racists, because everyone here has a Jesus complex and think Norway can do no wrong. So we're all sitting here on our cloud looking down at the stupid primitive polluters and Trumpists and Muslims, sorting our own trash and feeling all good about ourselves while buying a designer salt shaker for $200. Never even once worrying about all that oil being pumped into the global market through massive pipes spanning the planet, while at the same time nobody can figure out how to get water to places that suffer from drought. We throw away 1/3 of all the food produced on the planet every day, but once when we where 16 we spent two weeks in Africa building a school (mostly getting drunk and being a tourist but whatever) so it's fine."

"3:08 - 4:08 I've had this conversation with meat-eaters on multiple occasions.

Psychology is so interesting (and a fucking demonic bitch).  As you mentioned, it seems that humans (on the average) care more about our own time alive than the time our collective progeny will be alive. We want want me want now. How much of this is a Sisyphean task that will require an impossible(?) paradigm shift in human desires to really come to pass? It seems that we're fighting something that cannot be won. Human nature is so depressing I cannot stand it. I secretly (not anymore) wish that a piece of space debris or meteor will crash into me one day and just end my consciousness suddenly and instantly (me being the only person to die). More power to those who can continue fighting for just causes. My motivation is just getting weaker and weaker as time passes. I'm directionless, floating into the maelstrom of meaninglessness.  I am my own apocalypse. I do not feel strong enough to deal with all of this. It may be shameful, but that's how I feel. I'm too lazy and/or too stupid. I don't fucking know anymore.  Peace.  P.S.

"Point of clarification, the claim that '100 companies cause 71% of carbon emissions' is not actually true and misleading. The real statistic is that 100 producers (both companies and government enterprises) are responsible for 71% of the global INDUSTRIAL green house gasses.‚Äù Industrial emissions are only a part of the total emissions (e.g. in the US its 22%).      https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240"

The thing is, while some positivie changes are easy-ish to do, many are pretty hard or require education. I wanna be a performer, not an environmentalist and a nutritionist and all that jazz. And it costs money to have others tell you what you should be doing instead of researching it yourself. Just like good diets are worth it but if you can't pay upfront, it doesn't matter where that diet will take you, you're not getting it because you're poor. And I'm poor. And busy. And worried about all this but totally not equipped to do anything about it. I barely have any control over what I eat because I get help from homeless people services. I can't encourage industries like electric cars because I have no permit and I certainly don't have the money to buy a damn car that costs five times normal cars that I can't afford either.   I'm doing what I can. But nothing's gonna change if the high-ups, the presidents and ministers, don't start enforcing the change. Yes, enforcing it. As in pay the money it will take for:  me to eat less red meat  the world to be thouroughly informed  things to function while we all work towards change.  I am lazy and I need someone to hold my hand (and pay for whatever it will cost me cause I have literally no resources, and I've been working on ambitions that have nothing to do with climate change so I don't wanna give up any of it)  Give it all to me.

They obey the same donor class as Republicans.  We can only have change through electoral means if enough people embrace the likes of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and many others who aren't corrupted, and who are willing to withhold their votes from people like Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Corey Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and so on.  Voting blue no matter who will lead us down the exact same path as electing Republicans, just maybe a little gentler and with some more lipservice toward 'fighting climate change.'  If corporatists think they have your vote no matter what they do or say as long as they fly a blue flag, they won't change a thing no matter how often you call them and tell them to support a Green New Deal.  Why would they?  You've already promised them your vote, and their rationale is, you have nowhere else to go.  Just look at how the Democrats have behaved since taking the House.  They haven't even formally taken power and they're already capitulating to the Republicans."

"I disagree with the statement that capitalism is all about short term profits. I think there is a cultural issue that seeps into business in the United States' mixed market, and that the engineers and entrepreneurs who have long term goals are more lacking. I mostly believe it to be social programs against businesses that cause these issues. Bailouts, special taxes, regulations, and unions will not allow the companies to die, nor make the profits to expand, and forces them to keep and maintain a staff of incompetent workers, and, in many cases, ban and restrict new and efficient technologies (as a skilled laborer, I've seen this myself), while companies no longer have to worry about ethical profits, so long as they side with the right politicians, like Inhofe or Hillary (yes, they're all in it). Many of the destructive social actions in the US, that have shaped businesses into these dirty political games, I'd first seen in Atlas Shrugged. I've even seen politicians quote Rand near verbatim, unintentionally."
"I feel like I need to stand up for South Park a little here, since the comments seem to be mobbing against it.  Before I start, I want to say that South park *should* be criticised, it is imperfect. Very imperfect in fact. As a series it has a very troubled history. However, over the past few years it has covered many topics reasonably well. It often brings attention to subjects that a lot of TV ignores or is unwilling to touch, while doing so in a way that is easy to digest and palatable to people who may otherwise shun many of the concepts that it covers.   Equally their recent game 'South park Fractured but whole', is quite excellent. With some really nice progressive and innovative touches. Admittedly along side some less progressive touches, but generally they made use of those points to highlight absurdity, or did so in ways that were designed to subvert expectations."
"NOOOOO! That figure of 71% of global emissions coming from 100 companies is not accurate! That percentage is only for industrial emissions, which makes up about 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Over 60% of carbon emissions come from the transportation, agriculture, and energy sectors. These are areas where individual consumer actions will help a lot! Please do not wait for the government or corporations to stop climate change, we all have to step up.

A lot of those companies are actually state-owned, and can effectively be seen as extensions of their respective governments that you can buy stocks in. This isn't to discredit you in any way, just to highlight the importance of political action, seeing as how the behavior of these companies could be directly related to how/for whom one votes. https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240"
"Sorry, but this existential crisis requires drastic and immediate action. Continuing to fall for the good cop/bad cop routine and settling for the lesser-of-two-evils Democrats isn't going to cut it. They're every bit as beholden to fossil fuel interests as the Republicans are, and are constantly touting the wonders of 'clean' coal and 'clean' natural gas.  Simply voting Trump out of office won't change a damn thing; he's a symptom of a larger, systemic problem, not a progenitor of the any of the calamities we're facing. Nothing would be different with a Hillary Clinton in the White House; she's actually to the right of Trump on many key issues. Instead of being outraged by the same damn actions Trump is taking, the establishment would be making endless excuses for her, telling us how oh so pragmatic her preservation of the status quo is.  I'm a good deal older than most here, and have been hearing for decades that we need to hold our nose and vote Democratic, that they'll somehow magically turn left one day, becoming the party of FDR again. Being able to take the left's vote for granted has instead given them license to push further to the right every year, so that they're now more conservative than the Republicans were under Reagan, while the Republicans today are full blown fascist.   Trusting that the slightly less evil half of the corrupt duopoly is going to save is catastrophically naive. We needed to start investing in a viable option outside of the this back-stabbing, hopelessly corrupt, unsalvageable institution decades ago. We're way behind schedule, and putting it off further will only lead to a more disastrous future for those who come after us. The problems we face require long term thinking and planning. Fantasizing that the Democrats, at long last, this time for reals, are going to so what's needed if only we get them back in the majority and in the Oval Office, is criminally irresponsible.  It would be a repeat of 2009-2016...swept into office with a crushing majority on a progressive platform, with a mandate to enact radical reform, the Democrats shafted us again and adopted and expanded most of Bush's worse policies, pretending that the mean old Republicans made them do it. The filibuster isn't a magic bullet that instantly kills any bill; it, at most, delays legislation from being voted on for a bit. Please, apologists, stop invoking that tired excuse for Democratic malfeasance, for their lack of effort to deliver what they promised. Putting them back in office will only result in exactly what we saw under Obama: absolute capitulation and subservience to moneyed interests, while insisting they can pragmatically do nothing else. We're supposed to pretend that Republican policies are somehow more palatable when served up by those with a (D) next to their name.  We need a mass exodus of liberals from the corrupt duopoly NOW. The Democrats need to be replaced; taking them over is pure folly, as it's been clear for decades that corporate interests have a complete stranglehold on the party. Jesus Christ, the incompetent Pelosi is going to be Speaker of the House yet again, and she's already pledging 'bipartisanship' instead of actual resistance. IF the Democrats were to reform, it would only come after enough people stop pledging their vote no matter what. They need pressure from their left. Seeing their historical base being pilfered might finally urge them to action. But if you swear fealty to them, they'll know they can give you nothing in return. Absolutely nothing is what you'll continue to get. They'll keep moving to the right, because YOU assured them you'll bend over and take it."

This is nearly 1000 times as effective as veganism. Also don't use blockchain-based technologies obviously.  On another note, there's some new research suggesting small additions of seaweed into diets of dairy and meat cows can reduce methane emissions by about 99% (unbelievable numbers but UCD puts out good studies). Neuromorphic computing can greatly reduce energy costs of computation. FBS + animal cell culture can reduce the necessity of meat raising from a farming perspective and the fourth agricultural revolution seems to help. There seems to still be a lot of fertile ground left in basic research and I hope we can seize it in time."

"What was the point of this video? The only decent line of the entire thing was whenever she states something along the lines of, 'so you want me to change everything about myself?' And that is probably a much larger issue than any of the other shit discussed in the video, though it was completely glossed over. People do not want to change, they do not want to take responsibility for anything, and they most definitely do not want to do it because somebody else is telling them to. It is why people are quick to blame 'out groups', which the video touches on but doesn't connect the two concepts for some reason, and ultimately, there probably isn't any way to overcome it. It is why we've got daddy Trump in the white house, to take care of everyone!"

"A nice little detail in this great video I‚Äôd like to point out is that it doesn‚Äôt buy into the mainstream narrative that humans and the environment have different interests and that we‚Äôll just have to make some individual decisions if we want to save the planet. The way liberal environmentalists approach this topic infuriates me. Personally, I manage to avoid using cars or buying overpackaged things for the most part, but many people do not, and guilt-tripping them is only going to ‚Äì if anything ‚Äì make them more hostile towards environmental activism. I don‚Äôt think we should blame people who don‚Äôt manage to meet some upper middle-class standard of environment-friendly consumption (putting the ways in which this type of consumption is still very harmful to the environment aside), but instead seek to overthrow the system that creates these problems in the first place. In the case of plastic waste, for example, the completely irrational state of commodity production is largely responsible for the horrific news (such as a literal Europe-sized plastic island in the Atlantic Ocean) in recent months. That doesn‚Äôt mean resisting the whole thing in the short-term is impossible, but it‚Äôll only get you so far. We‚Äôll have to fight for broader systemic changes, and ‚Äì as Natalie accurately put it near the end of the video ‚Äì economic action (general strikes, for example) is highly effective in achieving great changes within capitalism and ultimately smashing the capitalist, profit-oriented framework itself. The environment and the masses ultimately have a common interest in overthrowing capitalism."

I'd also love to say that a full of communist revolution could fix the problem but an issue there was said by Zizek: 'What happens the day AFTER the revolution?' He also said he'd sell his mother into slavery to see a V for Vendetta part II. I guess all we can do is just keep lighting fires under the capitalists' asses like Natalie said until we get at least somewhere so we don't have to be stuck trying geoengineering and the only idea that doesn't sound completely awful is marine cloud brightening since it apparently can be reversed the easiest if it fucks up.

"+ContraPoints  Hey y'all, hi Natalie. I'm one of the people over at EarthStrike, I was hoping to add a little bit to this video.  So first of all there is one bit of crucial misinformation in this video concerning the emissions of companies. In reality it's 71% of global INDUSTRIAL emissions that stem from 100 producers, not companies but also for example government it self. Now those direct emissions are a smaller fragment of the global total one has to consider the part companies like Exxon play in this by not only adding directly into the pool of emissions but also fueling factors like transportation, other industry and energy production. Which is why it is important to both understand that we need to change our own behavior but also act politically in order to quickly change not just the landscape on and individual level but also on an industrial level. Attacking the problem on both sides. Contra already makes some good points on what you can do *individually* to help change the world, I'm here to tell you a bit about 3 things you can do politically.  3 Things that are not even that hard. First, take a look at platforms like ours over at earth-strike.com, our friends over at Extinction Rebellion or any other local organizations. Spread awareness by tweeting and sharing, make a meme if that's what you feel like, i mean political memes are lame as hell but if this is gonna go down we might as well laugh a bit right? Talk to your friends, your union or fellow students and workers. Word of mouth is always appreciated! Second, go to a protest. The folks over at Extinctions Rebellion specialize at that and we can highly recommend them. I get it, ugh going out, ugh peope. But just being there helps build up a presence, it shows politicians that we will not sit idly and let our planet die. And finally, Strike! This is where we at #EarthStrike come in, we're organizing a global general strike on the 27th of September to push for stricter government action to *not have our planet die*. You'd think it'd be less controversial but here we are. Yes this is the hardest part but come on, isn't it a bit exciting too?~  Anyway, thanks for the nod and wink, I really hope this video gets us somewhere. :)"

The problem isn't even that there are climate change deniers, the problem is that the political and economical systems that the western world uses are entirely incapable of handling the societal changes that are required to adapt to climate change.¬†  In Sweden, for example, where I live, there is not a single climate change denier in the large political parties. Still, almost nothing significant is done towards decreasing emissions and the few changes that have been proposed are heavily debated when they should have been implemented years ago. The bottle neck for serious action against climate change is actually not denial, it is the entire modern democratic political system and the way it interacts with capitalistic interests. It would have been more interesting if the video had dealt with this much more complex problem."
"I think we should take up swords and stab the sea"
"We are pretty much doomed though."
"The funny thing is, in terms of the grand scale of the history of the earth, caring about climate change is a very self-preserving, human centered thing to do. If humans choose to fuck ourselves, the earth will go on. Plants and aglae will eventually use up the carbon dioxide and new species will evolve from the survivors. There have been mass extinctions before, and life has always found a way to survive it. In fact, on a geological time scale life has almost wiped itself out several times, for example, when bacteria evolved photosynthesis the increased oxygen almost killed all life on earth. When politicians say shit like 'Well, the earth has been very hot or very cold before,' they're taking a really weird, geological-time scale way of thinking, which has no relevance to human lives. They act like people concerned about climate change are concerned about the survival of literally the earth as a planet. We're not. We're talking about the survival of our species. We can care about other animals sure, but ultimately that's what it boils down to.  When they make that arguement, they're actually right, the earth would survive another mass extinction. But we most likely wouldn't. And certainly our way of life will all the champagne and delicious barbeque wouldn't."

"At least you didn't suggest 'EarthStrike' by name. They honestly don't look very trustworthy: grandiose but vague plans, no named organizers, no press materials, no privacy policy, no data collection and protection policy, and, from the promoters I see on reddit, no experience with or clear ideas about how to organize and support strikes. At the best, it looks like a well-intended disappointment; at works, vaporactivism with big side helping of doxxing."

It would also help create jobs and make the US an energy exporter. Just don‚Äôt try to destroy working class peoples jobs that are dependent on Fossil fuels."

"GURL. Im so glad this video exists. I used to have an english teacher back some odd 10+ years ago when i was a freshman in high school that let us pick our own essay topic like every 2-3 weeks.

"Veganism to fix climate change? That's just stupid. Plant trees stop fracking, reduce the use of large cargo ship and coal fire plant.

"sea mommy is mad at us for being such naughty boys :((("
"Thank you for making this. I feel saddened that the corporate media downplays the issue of climate change and amplifies culture war issues that have no impact on their sponsors. Even people with 'scientific' backgrounds like Sam Harris continually decline to talk about how severely we'll be impacted by it and instead garble on about the marketplace of free ideas. It's 100% the most important issue of our time, yet even all of the youth activism is directed towards gender and identity issues. People say, 'Well we can have more than one conversation,'  But then why are people of colour so insistant that whites share their platform if there wasn't an obvious monolithic discourse?   Maybe we have to look at climate change through a feminist lens, or attach a working class / bourgeois narrative before people in our own circles will start paying attention, and then attach an economic catastrophe narrative for people on the right. I'm in a state where we've had the worst Bushfires and heatwave we've ever seen on record, and a tropical Cyclone Owen looming on the horizon, and yet in all the news coverage about firefighters and evacuations, heat waves and dying flying foxes, not a single mention of climate change in the media at all - but they will pivot to a segment talking about how many female panelists there are on the ABC. I can't help but think that gender issues are a convenient distraction from something that actually might hurt their corporate sponsors, while maintaining the appearance of woke progressiveness."

"I don‚Äôt understand why denying climate change became a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù opinion in the first place   I mean I get why (muh carbon taxes limiting muh freedoms, muh fossil fuel industry jobs etc). But it‚Äôs literally the fate of human civilisation at stake.   Conservatives are motivated by protecting the way of life  in their countries but don‚Äôt stop to consider the opinions of experts who say ALL ways of life will end if we don‚Äôt make changes to how we treat the environment   Where do they get the confidence to stand in the face of every single climate scientist and bet the future of their countries - the thing they alleged care about most - along with the rest of the planet?  It seems to come from assurances from clueless politicians and or people who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo."

"Well, to be fair, an inconvenient truth was mostly 'I, AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT, say...', while the Inconvenient Sequel consisted of 'as I, AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT said the last time...' Still, he has a point. But, the way he presented the whole problem was really... let's say... problematic. The part that really did it for me was in the sequel when he, the awesome guy he is, great man, AL GORE, consoled a crying dude who lost everything in a flood. I see how one could use this to emotionally rattle people, bit the way it was framed, it appeared to be mostly about Al Gore being a great guy. So, in conclusion, I agree with the point made, but I personally dislike talking about Al Gore's Documentaries because of the way they present the topic versus the way the present the person, seemingly (intentional or not) using climate change to stress his being a good (great (awesome)) person."
"Thank you. The conservative worldview was never meant to last forever. It was a survival mechanism that worked much better when the world had far fewer people and surviving the coming winter was a constant concern. For millennia the tough minded heartless warrior was an ideal archetype for survival. By their constant warfare and stealing from each other they eventually thoroughly mixed the human stew. And when humanity began to multiply in a huge way conservatism became obsolete.¬† But just because it became obsolete it did not quit. For a little while it looked like there was time for conservatism to simply fade away but that didn't last long.¬† Conservatism was given one last chance to dominate humanity forever when we learned that billions of people and the industries that support them are heating the earth. This is actually great news for many of conservatives because they can make it fit their religious prophecies. To them it's not man heating the world, it's their god. Their god has always hated humans and having us boil in our own filth because we were too stupid to stop it would be a pretty creative way to kill us off.¬† The point is that to many conservatives climate change is good news and they won't do anything to help and will do everything they can to let it happen. It's in the Bible."

So less cows being bred for their meats, more for their creams :). And just cause I'm on the subject, America needs to fix its dairy industry more then anyone. They're fed corn and stuck in a building which isn't right to begin with. Cows need grass, not corn :("
"Ok, @ 22:40 the album cover for the Roxy Music album, ‚ÄúSiren‚Äù immediately popped into my head.. Was that an influence, Natalie? You often seem to put so many music, film, art, and even literary references and/or easter eggs into your vids from past sub-cultural scenes that I love, but sometimes I think I‚Äôm just reading too far into the imagery. I swear it‚Äôs a reference to that album, though. You can tell me I‚Äôm an idiot if I‚Äôm wrong... (also, I thought there was a Devine reference here too, but that one definitely won‚Äôt surprise me)  Anyway, I FUCKING LOVE THIS! This shit is so incredibly important, thank you for giving this the attention it so desperately needs!

"OK video but the call to activism was weak.  1. 'The science is still out' This was a line used by the tobacco companies for years and is being used by the oil companies now, remind people of that as often as you can. In order for 'the science to be out' there needs to be an active discussion on the issue in the scientific literature, there is not. It is just a delay tactic. 2. Climate change cannot be a wedge issue if it is then progress gets stalled/destroyed when a different administration takes power. 3. You better find a way for capitalism to solve this problem because if you have to fight both the large oil companies and capitalists rit large in America you are doomed to fail. Fortunately, capitalism can be used to solve this problem,  Oil and Gas will have to lose market share. Rather than arguing that we need to shrink our economy ask who can benefit from that shrinkage and get them on your side."

"Until now I've always held off on liking and subscribing for some reason. I think it's about time for a change."
"The reason why conservatives reject climate change is because they see it as a way for the government to push SOCIALIZUM! and collect more taxes. As we all know, conservativesTM are in favor of least regulation. This is why now they're trying to regulate the internet and dictate what speech should and should not be allowed on private platforms, they want to regulate a woman's right to poke her vagina with a hanger, they want to regulate who you should be able to put an engagement ring on, they want to regulate what types of grass you're allowed to smoke, blah blah... I mean, the idea that conservatives aren't in favor of massive government is delusional. They constantly pass regulation trying to micromanage people's lives. If I was a conservative, I'd use climate change to begin developing new energy sources, remove fossil fuel dependency and that way I won't have to worry about taxation, and I'll be removing dependancy on the arabs.  But who am I fooling - it's lefties who invent everything. Then conservatives come and want to regulate the shit out of it. Just look at what's going on around social media right now - all of it is lefty invention, and it's been flooded by conservative parasites trying to use the government tell private businesses how they should run their business. But don't you DARE do the exact same about oil companies."

"Remember that even if you aren't ready to go Vegan you can simply reduce the amount of meat you eat. Consuming less animal products (specifically red meat and dairy) is good for the environment, your health and animals.  Of course fossil fuel pollution is the biggest damage dealer but even the average person can make small changes that multiplied across millions and millions of humans will have a significant effect. Remember to support politicians who recognize the grave threat climate change poses!"

"I love the taste of meat and I know that animals must suffer for me to eat it. I considered trying out tofu but I'm not sure, if I can get meatballs to taste as good if they were. The only way I can justify eating meat is selfishness. But then, eating plants is also a form of murder.  I think that suffering is inherent in the way the world is. Like a flaw you can't pull out or change (yet). Nobody asked for this. So I might as well eat the meat. Maybe we'll have good lab meats some day."

"Global Warming as a term dates back no further than the 1990s... with Climate Change having been the official term prior to Global Warming.  Also... I'm not really able to do the Vegan diet as my body does not seem to function on it. I'm also the person who can eat bloody improperly cooked chicken and not get sick from it... somehow... I was really really thirsty for blood that day too--which I just assume is me being somewhat mentally unhinged. I try to not let my desires to consume blood interfere with normal human interaction--but this was a case where I managed to--not be sick for a few days like a bunch of people around me who ate the chicken seeing me eat it.  THAT being said--if we were to have people eat two servings of meat a day--it would be a huge REDUCTION to how much meat is being consumed. If you take out a deck of cards--put away your Legends Magic Deck--like a normal set of French Suit Poker Cards--that is how big a single serving of meat is. What kind of crazy person only eats two servings of meat in a day? Most sane reasonable people eat a years worth of meat in a single day--like rational people. So--if people who do enjoy meat, were to eat a reasonable amount of meat (hell, for a lot of people limiting it to five servings a day would drastically drop it)... we'd see some great improvements.  I will go vegan, if people start letting me have a tea made from vampire tea bags (yeah... I know--other less crazy people could prolly do it easier)... but... in my 'being slightly unhinged' I have to acknowledge that meat consumption is kind of over the edge and over the top. I mean... look at a deck of cards... think about when the last time you only ate two servings of meat in a single day was. Ask what that would look like ordering it at a fast food restaurant.  Also... Grolar Bears are a thing now because of Climate Change. Most people do not sit around going, 'okay... Grizzly Bears--but how could we make them more fearsome?'... but here we are... Grolar Bears are Grizzly Bears on even more fucking Meth than you would usually expect a Grizzly Bear to be on (which is a lot... Bears are crazy!)."
"We‚Äôre not getting rid of capitalism, Natalie. Just fucking stop."
"I remember back ten years ago, when Al Gore got savaged for having a ritzy house while Bush Jr. had engineering students design him an eco-palace of the future.   When concerned mothers were trying to save the planet by unplugging their refrigerators and sending their husbands out in the family three-row SUV to buy ice every morning.  I remember....  I remember being just me with my average intellect and average high-school education trying to parse all the information about climate change I had access to on dial-up internet after pushing the sources through the, 'Do I respect this person?  Do they respect me?' filter.  All of the misinformation out there;  Some from people pursuing purely selfish agendas, some from people with the best of intentions but a lack of faith in the average person to be motivated without some 'finessing' of the facts, and some from people who just straight-up didn't know what they were talking about...  Because of all of this, ten years ago I knew... I... KNEW... that Climate Change was in fact.... not really a big deal.  Some dry areas would become wet, some wet areas would become dry, growing seasons would become longer and ocean-front property would move three inches closer to the beach; no big deal right?  But if you just couldn't bear cheaper strawberries year-round then stopping Climate Change would be as easy as KILLING SIX BILLION PEOPLE.  What?  You think that's too extreme?  How could you think that?  Don't you know Climate Change is a really big deal?  The atmosphere will thicken until it blocks almost all useable light while holding in all the warmth until the surface temperature rises to be able to melt lead, like on Venus!  Burn the land, Boil the Sea, and yes it will take the sky from Thee!    But don't panic, doooooon't panic.  We can stop this, we can.  Just buy a Prius and a case of florescent light-bulbs and that's all we'll need to stop this.  Ten years... a lot could happen in ten years.... why do we have to be so fucked-up?"

"I found the production values excellent, but the content rather shallow. Particular omissions that disappoint me:  - The reality that the problem with addressing climate change is not science deniers (though they certainly don't help), but getting coordinated action on a global scale. This is a genuinely hard problem, no matter how much everyone believes. - Ocean acidification. It felt weird seeing mother sea be gleeful, when she should be feeling rather sour. - (Bonus) It would've been nice to have some commentary on geoengineering. - (Extra-bonus) The fact that we'll get some (further) level of warming and need to adapt. And to what extent adaptation can be a complement to reduction."

You can't really just blame 'the right' or 'the conservatives' on this topic, the 'go green no nuclear energy' people also did their fair share in destroying the climate with their ideologies. Now I know I can't 'expect you to shine a light on every single issue out there', but I think this would've been an important enough topic to at least scratch rather than just ignoring it or pretending it's not part of the puzzle"

"Hey Nat, love your videos this was great, thank you for talking about veganism. A few things though:  1.) The 100 companies argument sort of shadows the necessity of veganism and reduces the significance of individual choice. After all a lot of those companies will have roots in animal agriculture so the increase of individuals going vegan will undoubtedly have an affect on them, just look at how the dairy industry are suffering. Animal agriculture, livestock and their by products accounts for around 51% of all greenhouse gas emissions according to research from 2009-2015. So individual choice could have a great impact, it‚Äôs more sustainable to change minds and perspectives through education rather than pushing for taxes on meat etc.  2.) Its great that you pointed out that that plant based meals are cheaper, it dismantles the fact that veganism is this bougie thing, but it‚Äôs kinda disappointing that right off the bat of celebrating delicious meat based foods, in the vegan case you said ‚Äòyou can eat lentils and sprouts‚Äô. Hearing this won‚Äôt make veganism appealing to people, after all there‚Äôs so many cheap and really good vegan food people can have and enjoy, ie pasta, fries, burritos, hummus and falafel, burgers, plus a lot of Asian and Indian food is already vegan or can be veganised.  3.) This is really pendantic but although you mentioned the dairy industry and eating less red meat, it probably would‚Äôve been better to say them together and not as two separate things. Beef makes up the vast majority of red meat and causes the most environmentally impact of any animal, but I‚Äôve known people who have stopped eating beef but then continue to consume dairy not making the connection. This is a problem, in my country of the UK 50% of our beef comes from spend dairy cows (the other 50% from calfs and male cows I think) and I imagine it‚Äôs similar in the US. So essentially what this means is that the beef industry and the dairy industry are one in the same, leading to the raising of the same animals and ergo the same environmental impact. So talking about them separately when they‚Äôre inextricably linked runs the risk of people limiting the consumption of one but not the other making no real difference, instead they are just receiving a different manifestation of the same environmental impact.

Oh no the science is telling us to be the pioneers of another socioeconomic revolution to save the planet, i don't have time to be the hero who saves everyone... oh wait BEING THE HERO WHO SAVING EVERYONE IS LITERALLY WHAT THE US THINKS OF ITSELF Doing something for climate change is exactly something the US would do if it gave a shit about his own ideals, because even capitalism would benefit, produce a bunch of solar panels and sell them, get filthy rich with alternative fuels and create a new monopoly, produce more and better stuff with less energy. Progress and capitalism are supposed to be together, progress helps capitalism get even bigger and not fall behind the times. But capitalists care more about the money they already have instead of doing something that helps everyone AND gets them even more money in the short run"

"Cool science facts: Technically we're still in that ice age and have been for 2.6 million years. The poles of the planet are still frozen solid and there are several large permanant ice sheets. Likewise during the coldest part of the ice age the equator was still warm, otherwise species such as reptiles really never would have survived. That period was a 'glacial period', during which the ice extends further towards the equator. If anything, we might be headed for the end of the ice age completely 20 million years early."

"Generally a good, informative video. One part I do have to complain about, though, is that starting at 19:45 . Not only are there 'capitalist' solutions to tackling global warming such as emission trading schemes or a carbon tax (not to mention that Margaret Thatcher, of all people, was one of the first leaders of any country to campaign to stop global warming), I also believe that such statements are harming the cause more than helping it: By asking for radical changes, you might be driving many more moderate right leaning away - even if they do solidly believe in global warming - towards the climate sceptic community. Such messages evoke the impression that the only alternative to climate change happening is letting 'crazy extremists' into power and some might rather fancy taking their chances with the former. Call me an optimist, but I do very much believe that there are many among the climate sceptic' or those opposed to environmental measures who - somewhere deep in their heart - do feel that climate change might be real and would be willing to support some efforts to stop it, should one show them that there are also less radical measures to help hinder global warming.  Violently objecting or denying it seems like a very natural first reaction  when someone claims there is a serious problem and completely giving up on their way of life is the only way to stop, but much less so if one offers more gradual reforms."

"Contrapoints, I think you are losing what made you so successful in the first place. What made you rise up was that you managed to try to handle the best talking points of the other side, say why they are wrong without demonizing them, and making self deprecating jokes about your own side. You clearly spend this entire video preaching to the choir, and trying to make demonize the people who disagree with you, and saying dumb shit like either we have to fix it or we get climate refugees. We could simply not let them in, and instead of talking that alternative also, you make it a dumb binary. You also say that people need to vote democrat in order to stop this, but economic destruction won't help much either. having a more richer economy could help us brace for this. Saying the choices are vote D or destroy the planet is just pure alienation and was unnecessary. Perhaps your transition is fucking with your ability to do the things you used to. Another point, technology is rapidly getting better far faster than the planet is getting worse. We are damn near approaching the point that we can grow crops in the desert, and desalination technology is only getting better, scientists really cannot account for the rapid expansion of other sciences and the potential possibility of out engineering our problems."

"While I'm all for fighting climate change and pollution, I feel as if the liberal solution is too drastic and risky to be sustainable. I mean, the total abandonment of fossil fuels may affect the value of our currency. A drastic lifestyle change might throw our industry into chaos, and leave us weak to foreign influence. The right and the left need to have a realistic discussion on the logistics of environmentalism. The United States doesn't need to turn into a different kind of dystopia as a result of blindly following environmentalist figureheads, who are only educated in environmental science and not much else. I think we could find a better solution if every US citizen were educated on economics, finance, and envorinmental science, but there is only so much time one can devote to reading that stuff."

"Okay first of all i have got to say it really was a much needed video. With that in mind there were some issues to it. The main thing is the fact that you didn't villainize the corporations all that much. Well sure you said that they are responsible for the damage, but what you should do is to point us into direction of direct action not only against the climat change but against the cause of it which is the giant industry and bam you also have instantly a guy that nobody likes and who can work perfectly for the narrative and also deliver some much needed ancom agenda and this brings us to my second criticism of the video. Well i will give it to you the disfunction of capitalist system when it comes to fixing this problem was mentioned but what you should have done is double down on this and say that the only true solution to the problem is ending the existance of private companies in this sector once and for all, because realisticly that is the only way of dealing with climat change and some subtle reforms while still leaving it to the markets just wont do the job.

This was the intentional misdirection produced by the industries reduction in carbon emissions stood to harm: that Al Gore was attacking your way of life when he was actually attacking the fundamental technologies and industries that needed to change.  You can still drive a Humvee (HMMWV for those of us who remember) or live in upstate NY and crank the furnace up to 80 degrees as long as your car runs on renewable diesel and your home is heated by renewable electricity.  You'll have the same carbon emissions that you would if you moved to south Florida and built yourself a hippie mud hut."

So, so shocked when in 9th grade I gave a presentation on it and had a bunch of other students assert that it's fake.

"This is something that I have never understood about conservatives; they seem to believe that it‚Äôs basically a miracle that society hasn‚Äôt fallen apart already because we‚Äôre all rabid apes deep down inside, so we should change as little as possible. Apparently Jordan Peterson once said that if he were given the task of changing Canadian traffic laws he would study 8 hours a day for a decade before making the tiniest change, I guess lest the dragon of chaos infect our highways.   But that absolutely doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that when societies have collapsed in the past it‚Äôs been because of a a reluctance to change their traditions; look at Easter Island for a classic example, but there are many more out there.   Climate change is going to give us a lesson in this. Addressing increasing food insecurity, increasing climactic chaos, mass extinction of plants and animals and increasing numbers of refugees will require societal agility to a degree that many conservatives will be uncomfortable with. Maybe they‚Äôll genuinely want to address the problem but same thinking that got us into it won‚Äôt get us out."

"This is a terrible strawman. As a major offender, you 'debunk' the no consensus argument with the 97% of climate scientists figure. Besides multiple of the authors of papers cited claiming their findings to have being misrepresented, the argument was that there's no consensus on future climate trends -which, as of right now, there isn't-, not on the anthropogenic nature of current climate trends. Another point was the argument of climate change having stopped, also 'debunked' in the website you linked; this argument actually never existed. What they may be trying to address is the fact that the rate of increase of global temperatures having stopped since the late 90s. While some Alex Jones types may make outrageous arguments, it is deeply irresponsible to take these as representatives of climate skepticism. This is equivalent to Ben Shapiro claiming that your birth genitals define your gender because transitioning doesn't change your biological sex, and it just so happens that Riley Dennis considers herself to be a female. Therefore, argument closed, he already debunked your arguments and you can make a video titled Ben Shapiro DESTROYS trans ideology."

I don‚Äôt think that people understand the scale we humans operate on; we cause 10X more soil erosion than all other types of erosion combined, even including the efforts of Our Dark Mother, The Sea; all of the volcanoes in the world generate about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, while our automotive and industrial activities cause some 24 billion tons of CO2 emissions every year worldwide, etc etc.   We‚Äôre a natural force. People making the argument that ‚Äúwell, the climate changes in the past, it‚Äôs a natural thing‚Äù seem to totally ignore that fact that it was the interaction of natural forces with one another that changed the climate, and that adding a new, fast-moving natural force into the mix will obviously change any system as complex as the world‚Äôs ecosystem is."

"Fuck it. Let the world end. There isn't a point to telling people  about global warming because all the scary stuff isn't supposed to happen until 100 years from now and lets face it no cares about shit until it starts effecting them in the moment.  It's scary until you ask 'Hey when is this supposed to happen?' and the reply is '100 years from now!'. Personally I think theres really only three options to global warming. 1. We detonate neutron bombs above major cities  to depopulate.  2. Convince everyone that C02 and other green house gasses are pushing oxygen levels down global and everyone is going to suffocate in 20 years. 3. End the world with nuclear holocaust."

Now all the people of our societies are to blame - not heavy industry, mass waste of packaging, oil industries, endemic plollution. Now lets trust at face value these same industries who have started/bought up as many 'green' solutions as the market will bear. And contribute heavily to political coffers.

Nature is good, but I can just relate to the suffering of real humans over an animal looking said.

"We're definitely in an apocalypse, and not just in a physical sense (the more important aspect is spiritual/occult). It began in November 2016 and is still ongoing.

"Whenever Natalie releases a new video, it's always a Wynn.  Addition in edit: So I just finished watching this video, and a few points:"
""
"1. carbon emissions from the animal industry are larger than all transportation combined"
"2. a lot of industries depend on the existence of the oil and animal industries, using the by products of these industries, so if the entire world went vegan and switched away from non-fossil fuels - it would have a real impact... the problem is getting there, but perhaps just a critical mass of say, out of my ass, 10% could be enough to make that happen. Companies that don't adapt to changes in the market *do go under*, it is not unheard of, capitalism isn't too big to fail... and from their ashes new companies arise to exploit the market. We just need to keep making sure to control our demand so that it doesn't support exploitation."
"3. voting for a different president would be good, but it's not like Obama did so much for the environment... as much as anti-capitalists like to say otherwise, the money vote is the strongest vote people have. Politicians will make promises they will 90% of the time not keep or even go against them. Many of them are bought out by the lobbyists. So again, using your wallet is the best vote you have."
"4. anti-capitalists will say that the corporations will just find a way around and continue exploitation... to a certain degree, yes... but eventually the pressure will be too great and they will have to adapt or go under to be replaced by new companies that have adapted. These mega corporations are rich because we make them rich. They can stop being rich if we stop making them rich until they change their ways or go under."
""
"Now I am not one to say capitalism is perfect, far be it... and a new system needs to be implemented if we reduce scarcity enough using new technologies... but until then, in the current system, a dollar vote is more powerful in my opinion than a political vote, but sure - why not do both?"
""
"Also, does this mean you're vegan now, Natalie?"
"Damning humanity just to own the libs. Thanks Obama. O shit, I obviously meant: fuck you Trump."
"Climate change: natural and man made change in climate Global warming: man made climate change only"
"Always, ALWAYS remember: stopping climate change doesn't mean preserving planet earth, but preserving _humanity._ The earth will, after a couple millennia, have regenerated from climate change if we seriously fuck it up - but _we,_ the human race, will not survive this."
"is there an editing error at 19:08? there are two takes of the same section of dialogue, but for all i know, it's a sophisticated metaphor"
"This is a great video! I think the end could have been a little smoother, but it was still good!"
"YES SHE BACK"
"Hi! With regards to a massive general strike, I noticed you were in contact with the #EarthStrike movement in preparation for this video. It's a promising new organization that has been endorsed by many prominent leftists including Noam Chomsky and David Graeber. We're only a few weeks old right now, and we're still trying to get off the ground and spread our reach. To this end, you've built up an impressive following among our primary target demographic - young, leftist, and online - and an official shoutout from you, maybe in the video description, would mean a great deal.  We're organizing three global protests for 2019, culminating in a general strike on September 27. Our mission statement, list of demands, and information about national and local campaigns can be found on our official website at https://earth-strike.com."

"There's something so beautiful about water. I can't really explain what causes that beauty. It has this almost otherworldly effect on me. When I start thinking about it I can't contain myself. My excitement bursts forth from within my innermost being. I guess this longing for water is something so primal that it transcends time itself. This longing for water must be coded into the very minutia of our DNA. It has been a part of us for longer than we know. Frankly, I believe this deep lust for it has been a part of us for longer than we've even had the idea of an 'us.' This lust for water exceeds even the seemingly endless bounds of conscious thought. From the beginning of life itself there has been one common factor in every species, the one thing that unifies all life. For this reason I believe water to be the essence of all things good about the human experience. Happiness, joy, love, hope, togetherness, peace, thought, time, progress, etc. All of these wonderful things are most perfectly found in water. Sometimes, when I am alone and yearning for the embrace of water, I cannot help but ponder the deep cold expanses of water that span most of this place we call home. Truly the sea is our dark mother, the origin of life as we know it. From the very first cell, water was there. This impossibly deep connection between water and the experience of life can lead to only one end, and that end is the realization that to be one with the water is to be one with life as a whole. The paramount experience of existence is to be enveloped by our dark mother, to feel the liquid in every curve and divot in my body, and frankly, as with every divot in my body, the water also fills every divot of my soul and my conscious mind. For this reason alone I believe that as humans, all of us must surrender ourselves to the inherent eroticism of the sea. We must become one with all life and sink into the embrace of the eternal bringer of life."
