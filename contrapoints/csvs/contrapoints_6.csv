"Thank you."
"This video aged extremely well."
"Even the way McCain shut that shit down was odd, as if being Arab and a good husband and citizen were mutually exclusive.  His sentence really needed an 'and'."
"Ahh he makes me sick to my stomach"

"11:09 should we tell that guy that he’s holding his sign upside down?"
"After telling some critics of him  to go back where they came from despite being americans, I think, yep, he is."
"Wow what a way to celebrate a third-year anniversary"
"Trump has no actual opinions. He isn't really alt right, he just plays one on TV. *finger guns*"
"Amazing how now his racism is basically confirmed with his 'go back to your country' tweets."
"This video was uploaded three years ago today"
"The opposite of Arab is decent family man??"
"What a joke, splicing footage and editing answers to look bad is pretty low."
"i like guy contra better only because it shows an edgy white guy can be lefty and rational"
"I wouldn't call arachnophobia innocent. I mean, I know they're not popular animals, but arachnophobes are still killing harmless small animals for no reason."
"What a FUCKING SCUMBAG president. Holy shit. What a fucking SHITHOLE."
"yeah.... trump is pretty good at the circular agrument"
"Ah, Natalie, you really were a yum yum as a boy.   As a bisexual, I declare you my dream woman. In all points in time."
"'Is Trump Racist?'   Yes."
"wait but? McCain's comment was still pretty racist? He said he's a family man, citizen, etc. assuming that if Obama, yes who is not an arab, were an arab he would then not be those things (family man, citizen, american, etc.)."
"'Her son's hooked on meth, and she her self occasionally likes to get tweaked asf.'"

"The fuck, HEEBEEJABBIES  Annddd I'm dying 😂😂😂😂"
"So...what are you trying to say"
"Can we get a follow up on this? It’s almost election season and I feel like it’s been both watered down and made worse simultaneously."
"You just hate America!! Trump 2020!!"
"McCain shits that shit down but was an advocate for every war and was essentials getting us into Iraq, John McCain is 1000 times worse than trump."
"hee. heebeejabis. ive been laughing for the past minute or so"
"I’m tired and please like I am calm"
"Corn silk tufted cheese puff😂"
"i wouldnt say no to the idea of real america because of the implication"
"Can we get a Michael Brown redaction please?"
"Heebeejaabees 😂😂😂"
"McCain said that Obama is not an Arab because he is a decent family man, as if that makes somebody not an Arab."
"this guy seems awful. I hope he doesn't win."
"Trump is racist and so is the great warlord father of Islam. FWIK about both, despise them about the same. And the hijab is not empowering to women anywhere as long as not wearing it is punishable by death in more than a few countries. So I oppose both Trumpism and Islam, until they're able to reform to some decent level of human dignity in society. Still waiting."
"its crazy how much nat has changed in such a small amount of time. Im glad your transition is doing well!"
"omg trump is blackface"
"EXCELLENT HITCHENS REFERENCE"
"I'm so sexually attracted to you as a men that I easily forget that it's not the real you."
"That should be calling Elizabeth Warren 'Pocahontas'."
"My beautiful Trans-sister, Presidents Woodrow Wilson[born on December  28, my birthday and Lili Elba's was one racist asshole. You're stretching things a bit when you call Trump's calling Elizabeth Warren 'I'm part America Indian, Jewish and non-white]. In regards to whites being afraid of black criminality, remember that blacks are thirteen percent of the population and committ over fifty percent of crime. Even Jesse Jackson said he would be afraid if there were a group of blacks behind him at night. You stretch things to justify your supposed racism!! As for myself, I call Trump President Hump and Vice President Pence Vice President Piss. One other thing, consider this: those black millionaire NFL players condemning 'racism' in a country that elected a bi-racial President to two terms, has had two black Secretaries of State, a black Supreme Court Justice! I think Tabbie needs to threaten you to stop you from playing fast and loose with words to justify your pre-conceived Liberal Blather!! btw I'm apolitical."
"as a heebeejabi wearer...  ok i do actually wear a hijab ngl i just needed an excuse to say heebeejabi"
"I watch contra's old videos exclusively for the thrill of thinking how dysforic it might make her that I do it"
"trump isnt racist bc we disagree with him, hes racist bc of doing and saying racist things"
"I will save you some time, yes. Yes he is. But please watch the video, it's pretty godamn funny :) THX CONTRA!"
"did you start playing At The Bottom of Everything on the guitar or am I imagining that"
"God damn leftists"
"arachnophobia is not innocent, it's homologous to racism. I mean this literally. Hurt another one of my comrades and I will find you. We are going to fight. Absolutely not cool."
"How can Trump be racist against blacks like you say, when he is black himself? In fact, he is the third black president the US has had, after Clinton and Obama."
"0:24 its Hunter gathers from Venture Bros.!"
"Trump is punching down at everyone, including the Trump chumps who support him.  He panders to prejudices because there is nothing good about him that he can sell to voters.  Is he a true racist?  It's true he hates minorities, but he doesn't seem to have any real affinity for anyone but himself, so he lacks any social attachment that we would expect from a true racist.  He's a more of a shit-lord racist who only uses racism to sanctify one person, himself."
"You give McCain too much credit - he didn't say that it's fine to be an arab, rather just that Obama isn't one and is in contrast a good family man as if that's incompatible with being a brown person"
"Have to admit that Trump is a very intertaining and in your face kinda president."
"God, it is so weird to miss McCain."
"It started interesting, but condeming people without knowing anything about them is stupid, so if give Trump that advantage. Just look at jussie smollet, a good example of not directly condemning something or someone, when you don't know the background of it. And that Trump waited one day, before he condemned that Dave from KKK is fine, and is not because of pressure. I have seen enough the last 2 years of Trump to know that he doesn't care about pressure. So for that you video earned a downvote...."
"You want to know why they all have beards? I'll tell you why they all have beards.  They have beards because they don't have the discipline or the energy to lose the weight - or they just don't want to give up the eating habits that caused it in the first place - but they're too vain, and too invested in the High-T Alpha Male So Buy My Sketchy Supplements thing, to just not give a damn about the pouchy cheeks and the incipient jowliness.  What? Don't give me that look. That's why _I_ have a beard - well, mostly, anyway; I don't identify as 'alpha', don't know or care about my testosterone, and don't have anything to sell. I'm just an intersex queer trying to make the best of life with this pesky extra Y chromosome that I never asked for and didn't want. I'm eating properly now, and I'm up to 20 minutes a day on the elliptical...some days, anyway...and I've lost ten pounds since last month (thanks for asking!) but I've got a long way to go before I'm comfortable even thinking about shaving off the face rug.  (Also, somebody really needs to tell that guy on the right that Langly from the Lone Gunmen was never cool, not even when the show was on the air.)"
"Where has the guitar gone in your more current videos? Bring back Trembly."
"Takeaway: Maybe he should wear a helmet. an army helmet. from the first crusade, to stave off the spray of feminist poison and guard his cornsilk tufts. everyone hates it when white men culturally appropriate black sexual aggression and claim it's their 'hip new style as president'."
"Here in Brazil, Bolsonaro was supported by the same KKK guy. Dave said 'he has blue eyes, he seems like one of us' hahahaha OMG We are so screwed"
"How can you be involved in American politics in 2016 and NOT know what the KKK is?  The civil rights movement was a huge part of political history."
"All politicians, not just one side, are a part of the same shit show. The shit show to drive us at one another’s throats and believe ones virtue signaling over another’s proves dominance, In a time where most people could give a rats ass as to who is doing what as long as they are not hurting someone else. Then they all ignite fires because everyone’s idea of “being hurt” is different. They make us all so torn in who we are and what we think, because 8 years ago they were saying the same things as their opponents, and now they are condemning them for the same slander. Politicians are everything that is wrong with this world. Anyone who’s desire is to have a role of power has major psychological issues. And anyone willing to drive to the polls has put themselves into a position of developing the same psychological discourse found in all politicians. All races have a desire to see their race not be thrown to the wolves, when we should be focused on humanity being the only race. It was the politicians who purchased the slaves from the African tribes trading the members of the apposing tribe to the white politicians. And the politicians are the ones that sold the idea to the rest of white people, and it was the human race that worked together to prove one was the same as the other. If everyone would just realize the politicians and corporate owners of the politicians are trading all of us amongst themselves through their greed and narcissism humanity will uprise and refuse to allow the politicians to be a threat anymore."
"11:10 upside down sign lol"
"Trump's purported racism seems to mostly be about him speaking about stereotypes. White supremacists reading something differently in Trump's words does not mean his words are inherently racist, people often enough see what they want to see. This would imply too that all the non-whites that support Trump are too stupid to see his racism, which is rather absurd."
"Who part of the beard and lipstick gang?"
"Got a story - my mom is racist, but it's mostly fear. I stopped at a gas station when driving through  Arkansas to Oklahoma. The people I could see were all black, but they looked like they'd just gotten off work. I saw a lot of overalls and coveralls covered in either drywall or paint, a few fast food uniforms, and some regular clothes. Almost all were in cars or going to cars, getting out of cars, with one or two walking.  So we were stopping bc she had to use the bathroom, and I wanted coffee. I teased her occasionally about being racist bc I thought it was dumb, left over fear and a lack of understanding from her growing up in Memphis TN in the 50s-60s.  So she says 'oh we can't stop here, let's go some place else'.  I thought that was silly. So me, trying to ease the tension, pulled up, stopped, and I said 'yessum miss B. I sho will', but I put the car in park. When I put my hand on the key to turn it off, she pulled her purse up to her neck, and in the most terrified voice, she said 'DON'T YOU DARE CUT THIS CAR OFF'. Her face was raw panic, her eyes wide, and I don't think I'd ever seen her so afraid. I almost asked if I could at least go get a drink, but the fear she had in her eyes stopped me. I just put it in reverse and backed out, and we had to go to the next exit.   I knew fear was part of it, but I had no idea it was that bad. And I'm telling you, this wasn't a drug riddled, bad area. I know you can't tell criminals or dangerous people by looking at them, but it was broad daylight, and these were just working people who just got off, most of them older than 35+. Fear never entered my mind looking around, but by her expression, you'd think we were surrounded by zombies in the apocalypse.   I stopped teasing her after that. She's in her 70s -  I don't think I'm going to change her mind at this late stage, but it still makes me a little sad.   I'm grateful that at least my kids won't grow up this way. They have a healthy dose of 'stranger danger' fear, but it's of unknown people, not any particular race. Thinking about my mom growing up that way, and about all of the alt lite and alt right around us, it just makes my heart hurt. I wish that we as a society were more scientifically literate, and more willing to work together. Think of all that we could accomplish if we banded together, putting aside our differences.   Sometimes I wish that everyone would come together. Some days, I wish that the alt right would go some place and create their 'white ethno state' or whatever, leaving others alone to work together. Mostly, I want to save them from themselves, the young ones who just listened to horrible  propaganda and who believe silly things that science has already debunked (like how they believe that certain races are inherently smarter, or that skull size and intelligence are directly linked, that the white race is going extinct, etc).  Everyone is afraid, and the media is keeping us all scared and divided. I miss the unity of our country, where we could have our differences, but still get along. It's depressing as hell some days.  Anyway, I'm on my phone, so sorry for typos or auto correct issues. Hopefully you'll get the gist.   HAGD KIDS ;-)"

"Calling us mexicans rapists is not racist, but xenophobic. I would urge anyone to read journalistic investigations on the subject, rather than any popular news outlet on the MX-US drug, people and gun traffic subjects."
"Arrrgggh...I loooove your channel soooooooo much, buuuut...McCain responding to that comment about Obama being an Arab with, 'No, he's a decent family man citizen that I just happen to disagree with,' is really not a good example of a response that is not racist, in comparison to Trump's overtly racist responses. In saying that, McCain was implying that...being a 'good, decent family man' and being an Arab are mutually exclusive, as if Arabs are not 'good, decent family people' themselves??!? :-( (Not to mention, the idea that in order to be a decent person, you have to be a 'family man' and a 'citizen' to begin with. >:-( )   Having said all of that, I absolutely freaking adore your channel, loved the rest of this video and am obsessively watching every episode. You are restoring my faith in art as social commentary, philosophers as punk rebels, and, dare I say it, youtube as a forum for signs of intelligent life in the universe. <3"
"2 years later and the answer is even more obvious than it was then: hell yes hes racist. and republicans have shown hes not the only one."
"I agree that's it's racist to assume someone is a criminal because of their race, but black crime is through the roof in America. You can't really blame people for having an unconscious bias."

"0:53 aLLeGaTiOnS 0:57 How is trump supposed to disavow someone who he doesnt know about? That seems perfectly rational 0:59 IIRC he also accused ted cruz of being not born in the united states 1:02 ? not an argument 1:05 but I thought that people who esposed violent athoritarian beliefs such as nazis should be punched 1:11 'according to' 1:11  when trump is taling about mexicans he is talking about illegal immagrants, he even says that some are good people  1:12  he was mocking the chinese specifficly 1:13 trump was mocking elizibeth warren not because elizibeth warren was native american but because she was not. She did not grow up in native american cultiure, or have any native american ancestery, so by no metric is she native american   3:16 No evedence of this claim is given. And when responding to this comment remember not to use ancedotal evedence   5:25 the thing about dog whisles is that they are conspiracys theroys and unfalsifyibe hypososisy by nature. even if you can confirm that one person uses a dog whisle, you have no way of knowing who else was using  a dog whisle or if someone was merely perciving a dog whisle that was not there.   5:48 This is a claim which you give no evedence to support.  the obious counterpoint to this is that what she claims she was meaning was that people who merely see america as a finatal market and have no commitment to america such as coastal elites and people who are merely here for the jobs are not real americans as they are merely riding off america and not contributing to it or are loyal to it   6:35 no one is claiming that all of america was better in the past, but in terms of achivement, such as industry and space program america has lagged behind   7:41 again, how can you condem someone who you dont know anything about?   9:51 This is like the people who claim the simpsons predicted 911. Just because you have evidence of somthing doesnt mean anything if you cant disprove it. 10:39 ill have to admit I do disagree with trump on this but what does it have to do with race? also though throwing tomatoes may seem harmless it is a gateway to larger acts of roudyness   also I thought It was okay to punch people with radical authoritarian veiwpoint's Eg nazis or communists."

"He didn't call all of them rapists, he said those who do shady shit to get into America don't really give a shit about America and its morals, they'd even laugh at you for calling them sexist.

"Trumpy Bear!-!..soft and cuddle"
"Nice. Electing someone who is either racist, or doesn't know what the KKK is. Really up to date on American politics huh?"
"Your interpretation of the idea of 'dog-whistling' is silly because you can say just about anything is racist even when it's not, and you have to employ your own racial interpretations to declare something racist.   For example, at 5:56 you say Hillary Clinton addressing 'urban youth gangs' basically means she's talking about black youth gangs, but that's just you assuming urban youth gangs means blacks specifically. I could say you're racist for making that stereotypical assumption. 'Urban youth gangs' are a problem for any country."
"Jake Tapper looks so tired in that clip."
"*insert shitty orange man bad meme or soy boy insults*"
"Never thought I'd say I miss John McCain lol. Republicans have devolved so crudely in the last 10 years."
"Here is the issue. The left needs to differentiate this issue much much further.  1. Often the left wants to make the accusation of racism into an ontological question. Meaning is someone's 'very being' racist? Rather than whether someone's behavior and policy is racist. I have no idea what Trumps 'being' is. I do know that his anti-immigration stance allowed racist memes to circulate widely such as graphs revealing that non-white births will outnumber white births in the future. So it is clear to me that this policy alone is fueled by people who clearly have irrational racist fears. And Trump rarely if ever tried to dispel them except saying I am sure some of them are nice people etc. so instead of focusing on his being focus on his actual policies and the reasons behind them. And call it a racist policy and the rationality for that label.  2. The left consistently ignores activists who speak in the worst rhetoric like wypipo, or whity, or looks like white people are xyz. I have de-friended many people on Facebook for this rhetoric. It is deplorable and hypocritical and will continue to divide the left into factions that can't communicate with each other much less bring an important message or policy to congress. But what's more I have seen people in public positions like teachers do this. The right wing is calling it out. And in the meantime they are implementing policies that are founded on racist ideology like the reason to build a wall and other policies which have negative impacts on everyone who is in the working class.  3. Guess what many people in disadvantaged communities will have racist rhetoric whether black or white or Latino etc. The left needs to listen to real concerns and call out and correct racist rhetoric, beliefs, and ideologies just like McCain did in the video. They should reject a lot of this rhetoric like only whites can be racist. I understand what is trying to be said it has been explained to me but it boils down to a twisting of the term.  4. It is clear that you have noticed Rubin, Shapiro, Peterson etc. their task is to rebrand the right as 'the real tolerant liberals'. The thing is they have a point in regards to the way ideas are framed and the rhetoric that is being used. But the left should not just use their frames. The should take George Lakoffs advice and create their own new frames. They should not be afraid of Marxist language, but they can use the same rhetoric by evoking the specter of Thomas Payne or John Dewey or Upton Sinclair and various others that carry the exact same message of oppression.  5. Obviously racism exists. But isn't racism also a subclass of classism. Has it not been traditionally as a form of classism and dividing the working class? Maybe we should not be afraid of talking about class oppression.  Just some thoughts."

But still i like Trump way more then the competition, mainly because he got rid of many US-Bases here in Germany, while Hitlary wanted to keep em. so more power to Trump! :)="
"Looking at this now in 2019, it's shocking jsut how little time it took for this kind of thing to feel so normal from Trump and his supporters that seeing all of those clips in one place like that just really turns my stomach. Like jesus crhist, this is what has become the new normal? Really hoping this shit gets nipped in the bud, and that we see some real change in the way things are run so that someone like him can never again reach that level of power."

"Can you do a video about why Trump supporters always say that it's Obama that created the division in the U.S.? Every Trump supporting troll I see on the internet is blaming Obama for the racial divide even though the man never used any of this type of rhetoric. Is it mainly because they blame Obama for PC culture and the 'inclusion' of minorities in stuff? It totally blows my mind."
"Trump might not be this awful terrible person deep down, I think if I sat down and talked to him we could find middle ground. Its not republican views that piss me off so much but like you said in this video, the pandering to white nationalist ideas. He might not personally believe what he says but he is still saying it and that's the problem. He even said if he ran for president he would go republican because they are the easiest to fool. Which is a shame because I know a lot of trump supporters who don't say shit like that and aren't racist, they just have conservative values."

"Hi, I love your videos, but I have to disagree with the comments about the Clintons. 'Super predator' was a legitimate term coined by sociologists at the time. It wasn't intended as shorthand for 'Scary black people' until racists started using it as a dogwhistle and the term fell out of use. Bill Clinton was popular with black communities because he was the first president to actually meet with them and address the drugs and crime in their communities. This was a huge change since the previous presidents before Clinton, as you mentioned with Regan, vilified black communities as dangerous self inflicted ghettos with lazy welfare queens. Of course, NOW we know that was not the correct path of action. Before that, Hillary Clinton worked as a lawyer going undercover in schools in Alabama, reporting instances of schools breaking segregation laws.   I know 2016 is long over, but for all the finger pointing at Hillary over the super predators comment, Bernie Sanders was the person who actually held office and voted for those crime laws."

"Banning hijabs because they are a symbol of oppression against women. Uncomfortable to wear, hot, and restricting. Though ironically this is a pretty useful set of words for some S / M Play you know what I mean? Addiction to pain.  They're pretty awful but my stance on it wasn't that I support women's oppression or the backwards beliefs, just that women can wear whatever they want to. What would be more telling is a law which explicitly told someone not to wear a hijab. Despite this woman's desire.  And 'no woman ever wants to wear one' is just a straw man, no true scotsman. It's ironic, you don't want to oppress women but are suppressing a demographic of women by means of overt shame for what they wear. We'll get there eventually."

"look, 3000-10,000 genetic clones of Luis Bracamontes, most of whom have also been indoctrinated into radical Islam, are about to invade the Southern border of the US, and DJT is going to protect us from that. So it's not racism. It's not. It's self defense.  Sarcasm aside, 2 years later, this isn't really up for debate. The debate today is more about whether racism is bad or good. It's not about DJT, it's about the whole Republican party which endorses him."

"God I wish there was a way for me to actually, personally bless you. You are the only thing that saved my soul from cynicism and hatred of the human race as a conglomerate. I was raised in a conservative, Christian household in Memphis, TN, a city traditionally known for being forward thinking and caring about minority rights. I had to live through all this shit first hand, still do. And thank you so much for not only putting out a clear argument I can use, but for literally bringing me to tears with the feeling that I am not alone. I’ll comment something of this nature again on your next video, but I couldn’t leave this one without saying it."

"I cannot believe I am going to do this, but I agree with stormfront. Trump is pandering. I do not think he is overtly racist, but he can work a crowd. Say all the correct words and phrases. What does that say about his supporters? As for his hotels and properties, I am not so certain that can be directly linked to him. He did marry an Eastern European, however, and they do not have the best track record when it comes to race. They are my people, shut up. She is a Slovene to boot! Slovenia was once a Yugoslav republic, until unabashed racism ripped that country apart like hungry tiger would a rabbit. Mike Cernovich, one a Trump's loudest supporters, openly waxes about the ustasha. Since Trump supporters do not know, nor care what a ustasha is, that gets a pass. (hint: the ustasha, legionnaires,  and nazis were pretty bad. in that order) I think what he says, and the fact he won the election says a lot about America in general, and the people who voted for him."

"I loove ya videos, finally some more opposition to those god damn alt rights who have infested youtube. Definitely got my subscribe <3"
"Those racists are so crazy, however I could support whatever they call it, White Pride, White Power or whatever they call it if it was equal to like other forms of ethnic pride and not (away from the cameras) overt love for race war, for getting even with Jews (based on largely conspiracy theory about Jews, and the idea that human rights and civil liberties FOR ALL is a Marxist conspiracy) and other stuff that's LITERALLY HITLER. In the meantime, check out this and a few extremely similar racist videos that aren't European.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZhQMkBe54 Or quite a few speeches from L. Farrakhan that ALL Whites are devils that need to basically be killed off. It's unfortunate in that I would prefer less overt White racism and shut up about the Left version of that including hatred of White Males from some activists.  BAD OPTICS."
"He called illegal immigrants rapists, not Mexicans."
"This is the first piece of media i have seen from 'the left' (god i hate those descriptors) that has actually been able to convince me that, maybe, trump is actually racist. Thanks!"

"I know rationality and arguments are important, but I could not avoid laughing at that guy holding a sign upside down at 11:10"
"Nothing makes me more angry than people applauding threats of violence."
"RIP John McCain. I myself lean left on the political spectrum, but I still think that McCain was the type of Republican that we need more of today.  Even though I disagree with a lot of his beliefs for what was right for the economy and other things, he was still rational, educated, and willing to talk to people about why he believed what he did."
"Rest in John McCain, in life, I disagreed with your politics and voted against you, but at least you weren't Trump. In the afterlife I hope you can hang out with your fellow squadmates from Nam', have a beer, and watch the game."

"O wow.  This is the first time I noticed the old white guy behind Trump doing a modified Nazi salute in that footage."
"Ok wait I agree with nearly everything you say but asserting that the reason people criticized the martyr status of mike brown purely for the pictures is absurd. Its the video footage of him robbing a liquor store the same day. The man didn’t deserve to die and the cop deserved to be fired but cmon dawg."

"At 1:05.....I love it, the just breezing past the obvious counter-point about BLM themselves encouraging violence....  Yo Contra I really think you need to be a little bit more critical of some of the positions you defend..."
"That trump is definitely racist."
"Normal person with a beard here, it's not a choice. The immense levels of testosterone require us to use non conventional means to shave, such as lawn mowers or the front side of a jet engine. Stubs are the best thing we can do but god damn it, we still try. The least we ask of other lower testosterone beings is to appreciate our efforts."

"I GET YOU'RE TRYING TO EPHISISE THE DOG WHISTLE THING BUT MY EARS HURT NOW"
"I'm just gonna say that I've been getting tons of your old videos suggested to me and rewatching them and, in retrospective, it's so obvious that you're really a girl. Like, it's gonna sound weird but in the videos where you present as male there's always some kind of slight feeling of dissonance or unease in the way you present yourself and in your newer videos it's totally gone."

"Can you make a video on why trump is bad?  I was disappointed in my answer when someone asked me and I want to use your smarter brain, you have one of the all time best brains."
"In regards to the Trump on David Duke point: He said in that interview he knew nothing about him and that he needed to do research on him. He then the next day disavowed him. Weak point. It wasn't because of pressure but due to the fact that he wasn't willing to be baited by the interviewer into saying something on someone he didn't know. What if I were to say the name of a famous human rights leader or scientist and said they were a neo nazi? He simply did not trust CNN in this interview. Misleading."
"Not the only point here, but a lot of antiquated theory beyond just racism lead to what was considered a crime and how criminals were punished historically, including lynchings. In the time period you discuss in this video, they were being actively advocated for a plethora of reasons, not least of which was that contemporary psychological and biological theories posited that criminality was an innate human quality that could not be altered. It was believed that a criminal was born, not made, and that they needed to be weeded from the population so that criminality would also be eliminated. The traditional 'progressives' supported the idea of cleansing the population of uncooperative elements of society strongly and many examples exist of progressives saying things that would make modern progressives faint if they realized what they were associating with when they carry with that title.   At the time, the scientific literature suggested that lynching was for the greater good because criminality was higher in black populations and progressives (as they still are) were driven by altruism into supporting lynchings. When it is for 'the good of the many,' and there is little ability for the few to fight back, horrible atrocities are commonplace and this is a trend throughout history. This is one example of how collectivism can be highly detrimental when it is combined with coercion and violence. My point in bringing all of this up is that, according to our modern knowledge, of course it is wrong to discriminate on skin color alone. It wasn't always so obvious. That doesn't excuse the atrocities committed in the name of supposed progress, but it does explain why individual liberty and holding a morality which respects every individual equally regardless of race, class, sex, and association  is more valuable than this concept of the good of the many outweighing the good of the few. There is no good outcome possible if any wrong is done in the process. All things are either a zero or negative sum game if they are not voluntary."
"Ahh, D.W. Griffith, the Steven Spielberg of blackface."
"Two years later it's gotten so much worse lol."
"And now here we are in 2018 and I think it is pretty clear that Trump is a racist---and a moron----and sexist---and xenophobic and an all round terrible excuse for a human being.  But yet his followers love him. You can honestly say that not all Trump supporters are racist but all racists are Trump supporters."
"Hhhm. The closeup on the fat guy in a suit, waving his sign back and forth in rhythm with the chant: “Build the wall.” That guy sure looks a fuck of a lot like Ken Calvert, Congressional Representative from California’s 42nd district. Of course this is just speculation, but I don’t think he would object to it; most of the people who support Calvert supported Trump.  Something that he might object to though is me pointing out how he consistently votes against the interests of the people in his district and consistently refuses to answer to his constituents afterwards. Ken Calvert has canceled town hall meetings over and over again. Ken Calvert has simply refused to go into work at his office for weeks when people were camped out in front of it demanding to know why he canceled town hall meetings.  Did repeating Ken Calvert’s name in the same sentence as his dishonest practices make this seem like a political ad paid for by left wing politicians? Does the fact that Ken Calvert has had several sex scandals offend anybody? Would a political ad from the left call Ken Calvert a huge piece of shit?  A fucking Scott McClellan looking child-fucker? (I honestly don’t remember the details of his sexual scandal, but I think one of the girls was pretty young, though not actually under the age of consent, but he was in his 50’s. Fuck that old pervert.)"

"A crtv ad played on this"
"I'm fairly right-leaning myself, and even have some support for Trump's policies such as the Wall. And his low taxes. And his peaceful settlement of the North Korean Issue. However, I'm rational enough to recognize that Trump's rhetoric is such a type that it helps to bring out the worst in people. I remember being very, very reluctant to support him back in 2016. I ultimately voted for Gary Johnson, yet had I known about his open borders policy, I would have voted for Trump instead. And some people need to stop with their 'a vote for a third party is a vote for my political enemy' bullshit! A vote for a third party is a vote for a third party, dammit! If I vote for Deez Nuts, then Deez Nuts gets +1. 😒 Some people just can't break out of their binary thinking, can they?"

"SPOILER ALERT BIGG RANT:   So historically the concentrations of power and control started with over throwing of the freedoms and power of the people by an omnipotent God, population increased so techniques of control had to become increasingly wide spread while becoming more inconspicuous, during the middle ages the feudal lords and monarch took over the position of control and all its spoils of being able to exploit the capacity and power of the people, then when mercantilism turned into capitalism these feudal lords were taken over by dozens of individuals who exploited the “ free” market to monopolize and control vital industries entrapping the mass in an anesthetized zombie consumer citizen happily being controlled as long as they fed us a bone, then population increased connections enhanced so control in today's society is being taken over by the military. No longer can materialism keep the power of the people under control so bites began occurring to the insidiously nice hand that fed us and now it's turned into an iron fist and u just have to look at the nature of the entities with the power to control the masses to understand the ways they will exploit their position. The military will physically enslave us. The totalizing hierarchy of fascism or corporatism, the military at the top ensures a complete form of whatever control they want it is unfettered freedom of the top while the freedom of the bottom is irrevocably usurped. The panopticon surveillance state capitalism is losing its justification for control and the internal contradictions of neo-liberalism are becoming untenable when it self-destructs the military will attempt to swoop in and pretend to save the day, we will humbly accept but then you have the military in control of the Earth...gamee over.   The worlds population needs you. the Q phenomenon and Trumps presidency is a massive covert plan by the military to pave the way for complete population control and the continued colonial expansion enriching the same blood lines and not so secret clubs. This is the colonization of the mind, now the peoples of the colonizers are becoming the victims. We need your leadership to stop this Turtle Island from legitimizing its authority. we have been enslaved by the cult of materialism and now its not working so the next phase of control programming is dystopically evil. if this militarization completes its plan which is working thus far (look at the US zombie's gaze onto everything Q says and consequently POTUS. wake up this is all smoke and mirrors!!!! there is a war being operationalized but it is not in the middle east its right here in North America and then Europe and the World. The military is losing its justification for existence so it continually engages in activities that elicits conflict for which they point to in order to justify funding, power, control and existence. this is the last breathe of the military unless they all transform into diplomatic peace keepers?? could happen ha"

"Easy mate, love your shtuff but...... your points could be more potent if you weren't overtly disingenuous at times in this here vid. Whilst I'm not a fan of old trumpypoo, you've misrepresented his speech regarding Mexican rapists - he said they were sending 'their' rapists, not 'they're rapists' and it was a bit poncey showing black guys getting beaten up while he was just slathering on about general protesters. I get your point about covert racism and I don't necessarily agree with you but that example did seem to be a stretch at the least. The problem I see is that a lot of these sort of tactics are what have pushed peeps away from the mainstream towards anything that is, on the surface at least, different. I think it's easier to say the guy's a knob. Obviously. Cheers anyhoo."

"I've said in the past that as Republicans go, McCain isn't so bad. I was told that I'm wrong and that he's pure evil. I can't say I know that much about him but he's not a conspiracy theorist. So that's one point for him.   Someone once said that if you took out all the crazy conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, religious extremism, racism and voodoo economics out of the Republican party, you'd be left with a few common sense ideas that actually belong in politics. He seems like he doesn't go for most of those but I don't know which."

"What do you say to someone who says there is no proof that Trump is racist and still denies his racism after you give them many examples of his racism? It seems some people will never accept he is racist unless he actually says 'I, Donald J. Trump, am a racist'"
"McCain didn't exactly 'shut that shit down.' The woman said, 'I don't trust him, he's an Arab' and McCain responded 'no man, he's a decent family man.' This implies that Arabs can not be family men or decent. His response is still far better than Trump's rhetoric"

"I'm offended!  My beard looks fucking terrible, and these lies give me a false sense of superiority."
"The problem isn't racism... you missed everything. The problem is that the ethical world of the leftists is crumbling such that their moralizing isn't effective except when backed with media social pressure, that is, authoritarian pressure. This can sustain itself only so long and another strategy must be found as the right is seeking to undermine that lynchpin through which all else falls. When social media pressure fails, the already rejected moral world of the left will give rise to oppression of the majority. Oh, wait, this is a video from pre-election 2016? Oh sorry, this is garden variety election year propaganda."

"This is real simple. The Oxford English Dictionary's first recorded usage of the word racism was Captain Richard Henry Pratt. He used it like the word classism. Specifically, he was using it in reference to people with institutional power who set up segregationist policies. Read the FBI file on the investigation of Trump's segregationist policies. I did. They would send a white person in his buildings to look for apartments. They had units available. Later, a black person would go in to the same building, but they were told nothing is available. They were even told to go somewhere else, specifically to section-8 housing.  See, real simple. Trump is a racist."
"'Still likes to get tweaked as fuuuck' lmao"
"rarely anyone this honest on the issue, calling him racist is an assumption and a bit unfair, even if likely true"
"I really enjoy your videos as they truly highlight and bring up points that often go overlooked or not looked at whatsoever. I don't agree completely with your points as I personally agree with limiting Islamic immigration and that America is a welfare state however I am able to see the flaws in some arguments that I make myself and actually am beginning to refine and re-establish my stances on particular issues. I hope that you do well in the future and I wanted you to know your videos do affect people and have changed how I think about certain things. I'm not saying you are right on all topics, simply that you hit the target on some."

"Not ex-wife pictures of his daughter"
"alright, I see it now"
"Trump is the first pres that didn't coddle to false claims of 'racism' and fascist lefty speech codes. Same with false rape accusations. For that he has my Eternal respect.  Ps Contra is a rapist, because I identified some invented codeword dogwhistles that identify his inner thoughts. Honestly, this shit is no better than pizzagate. Sad!"
"thank you for giving me a video I can show my belligerent family members"
"I'm here because of Hank."
"Hank green sent me here and I'm glad he did it."
"the Wagner music hahahaha"
"He's supported by David Duke, the KKK, the  American Nazi Party, and pretty much every white supremacist group in the country.  Do you think they maybe support him just because they kinda dig his economic policies?"

"55,000 subs! YEY!"
"10 points from gryffindor lol"
"The fear of black people being more prone to raping white females is still visible in alt-right propaganda. And Donald Trump knew who David Duke was back in 2000. http://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-david-duke-amnesia/"
"8:06 Though he actually denounced David Duke years before when another politician had connections with him. He knew of David Duke, of his former membership of the KKK and his continued racist statements. Then forgot as soon as he ran for office."
"That montage of Trump encouraging violence against protesters and his supporters cheering made me so sad :("

"'I'm not implying anything. I just love Wagner. That's all.' 14088 Hz whistling noise intensifies."
"No, he's not. At all. He used to live in a predominantly black neighbourhood in New York. His second home that got devastated by hurricane Irma was on Saint Martin, an island where the vast majority of people are black. His current wife is an immigrant. All of his in-laws are Jewish. Since taking office, he has considerably reduced murder-rates and improved living-standards in Chicago's South-Bank, LA, Birmingham, and Brooklyn. He couldn't possibly be less racist if he tried.     And, fuck Donald Trump nevertheless, because he's an unpresidential rodent who denies global warming, beefs with Kim Jong-Un, advocates nuclear proliferation, fails to disavow KKK-endorsements, and sucks up to theocratic zealots."
"Made it half way through before i quit.  Sorry thought it was about Trump."
"you really used Mike brown as your argument? the guy who attacked a police officer and got wasted for being a dumbass who fights cops"
"McCain the man"
"why are so many Trump supporters white people in their 50-60s?? seriously curious. including my parents"
"McCain lost, Trump won. Because Trump portrayed his opponent as a moral evil and McCain portrayed his opponent as a family guy with disagreements.  It may be decent and maybe what we should except but it is not going to work."
"08 was a fake election. McCain is a globalist shill."
"10:50 I love how there's an Asian woman to Trump's left who is clearly enjoying the show."

"Haven't event watched this video yet, just wondering... are there any more intelligent nuanced liberal commentators on YouTube like Contrapoints? I found myself in a big anti-sjw phase because the regressive left was getting so ridiculous, but Contrapoints reminds me of the good in being liberal. I don't mind Katblaque either, but there seem to be way more popular anti-sjws than popular liberals with at least semi-intelligent videos."

"Omg just noticed the Implication reference. Contra is on another level"
"Lol. Crime stats dont mean _anything_, you guys. The facts are just racist."

"Hi, ContraPoints! So it would be helpful if you write English sub-titles for this video. First, sometimes you are talking very fast, and second, it is easier to translate this video into other languages."
"I honestly don't think Trump is racist. He's too narcissistic to conceive of an actual cultural or racial group. In his mind there's just him, and people who aren't him. He's also too intellectually unsophisticated to hold a mental view as consistent as racism. Of course, he's also perfectly willing to be blown by any wind that he thinks will gain him more power.  Hmm, did I just use a metaphor that contained the words 'willing to be blown by'? I... apologise."
"killed a spider? disliked"
"Disliked :("
"I love that you've realized that it's not wrong to be afraid of the ghetto based on the fact that a black woman was afraid of the ghetto.  Note: Had she not been afraid, it would have NOT been ok. Because that's how ALL the best scholars have deduced the morality of a subject: how a random black woman felt about the subject.  So truly enlightened, you are."
"Good video."
"This is pretty weak. Racism is one of the worst allegations you can levy against anyone. Doing it so willy-nilly doesn't do anything but to water down the gravity of the word. In Germany we have done that so exessively that people are now starting to say: 'Meh, so I'm racist, so what. Everyone is a racist according to you guys.'  And do you know who wins when you do that? The racists; not those who may harbour some stereotypes as nearly everyone does, such as Donald Trump, but the kind of racists that want to make policy based on race like Richard Spencer and Actually David - fucking - Duke.  Racist is a serious word. Apply it seriously."
"WHERE THE WHITE WOMEN AT?"
"I think you have to actually have feelings in order to be a racist. I have this discussion with coworkers and friends on a regular basis. TBH, I don't think Trump gives enough of a shit about other people in order to be an actual racist. He doesn't even really have any actual politics, just things he does because he thinks it will make him look good. He's more properly termed an opportunist. For example, I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually give a shit about the working class, but he'll talk about it constantly. He definitely doesn't care about security issues or terrorism, but he sees it's a winning issue. The guy has been all over the map in terms of positions. He's been pro-choice and pro-life, pro-gun and anti-gun, pro-immigration and anti-immigration. He's whatever he needs to be to win. The fact that he managed to successfully position himself as the anti-Hillary Clinton after holding the exact same views as her (and indeed being good friends with her for over a decade) still surprises me. The only thing it really tells me is that people have incredibly short memories and are terribly gullible."
"Why don't you have more subscribers?!"
"Trump *did* disavow David Duke:  _'I disavowed him. I disavowed the KKK. Do you want me to do it again for the 12th time? I disavowed him in the past, I disavow him now.'_"
"I laughed.. I cried.. I cheered. Good video."
"80% of women crossing the border illegally are raped. They are raped the mexican men they pay to bring them across the border illegally. They are literally bringing rapists across the border. That's not racist. Statistics don't have feelings."
"Blacks make up about 13% of the population but commit about 50% of the crime. Read the Color of Crime report."
"Finally I'm glad an sjw has pointed out Hilary Clinton's overt racism. I'm pretty sure Trump was trying to appeal to racists. And non racists. Basically everyone in the sneakiest way he can. I guess that's politics."

"IMO beards are awesome and anyone who can grow one should."
"If Trump were racist, though, why in Kek's name is he helping black people in Chicago create a better life for themselves? Hispanic immigrants are taking jobs that should be going to black people in the South-Side, and VICE already did a documentary on Trump's negotiations with respected members of the black community to reduce the Chicago murder rate disproportionally affecting black people as well as negotiations to improve educational and living standards."
"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
"I'm sorry,  but everything these days can be taken two ways or more. There is enough questionable material on anyone in the public eye that if you really really want it,  you can pin tht race-card on most of them. I like how you did the video, it was fairly fair and there is dirt out there.  I don't see Trump the president as actually discriminating racially against a group of people. I can see the borderline material that can be taken either way as bringing attention to the dangers,  such as with securing our borders and vetting refugees, especially from countries with ties to our a history of connection with radical Islamists. Trump is showing he cares about the people, and that means all of the people that are citizens, not just white people. He's certainly not nearly as openly racist as either Hillary,  who's been caught many times on tape saying nasty things,  even the dreaded N word. Then there's Obama who took EVERY opportunity in his last years to racially charge anything possible in the hopes of a civil race war so he could implement Marshall law and become the last president of the United States...he was close. Bottom line is, yes president Trump can be offensive, especially if you're looking for it,  but he  really is trying to carve up the government and give the country back to all of us. For that,  I'm grateful."

And what about the numerous things he did for minorities? or the people who ( minorities) work for him that say otherwise. the popular opinion is that he's racist. I don't see how this video is a contrapoint material. you only have one point. I guess I was looking for some ammunition and this is to week for that"
"I think you're expecting a 3 dimensional chess mastermind behind Trumps head. Both his and Hillarys genuine gross fallbacks can be addressed in one line: they're old."
"I agree Mr. Points."
"Hey Contrapoint, How do you get paid with your advertisements?  I ask because Im not a patrone.  But I can help you best with Ads.  If you get paid only, get paid more, only if we watch your videos all the way through, or Only if we click on the link to the advertisers produck page.  How the hell do you get paid so I can do that which to get you better paid."
"Can we have McCain come back?"
"Well, I was worried there for a second that you were beard shaming."
"maybe Trump intentionally pandered to the White nationalist crowd so that he could gain their support, thereby fueling the conservative values held by this group and making Republicans think 'oh hey we were right about minorities after all'"

"I'm a 18 year old rationalist and can't grow facial hair 😂😂😂😂"
"I am 'like' trump in regards to how he can be concieved without us knowing what he really thinks on this matter, about race, gender whatsoever. I would answer just say shit like trump does, because I do not care about the feelings, ideas, or the misconceptions by drawing conclusions prematurely about me and i would rather that if people had a problem, they would just do a magical thing called,,, asking questions.  Simple questions people! STOP LIVING IN YOUR HEADS, PEOPLE!  What do you mean, you insensitive fuck ?  Just what I said, you suspicious piece of shit that tries to find something hidden beneath straightforward speech like some psychoanalysing idiot that can not for the life of it figure out that the insensitivities, reservations to denounce groups is of concern, mentioning of facts.  Espousing non politically, groomed to fit, faggotry of correctly expressed ideas do not need to harbor anything other than what the said words were meant to address. Anyone thinking they can speak for the behalf of others, are generalizing, and than as to tell about how x generalizes, is such hypocrisy.  Some of us are just pretty fucking innocent.. Damn. I really raged for no reason whatsoever. Just tired that people assume that someone needs to have depth. Selfcreated silliness, trying to give meaning to existence when it just needs causality.   I do not care about winks, the interpretation of whistleblowing, or any of that bullshit. And because stormfront or what the fuck they are called, does not mean anything at all who they choose and choose not to associate with.  You either are a racist, because you believe in the inferiority of different race, which is in laymen terms completly acceptable to me, if they are grounded on something remotly based!  Some of us are just insensitive like myself who does transgress , seen by those on a drunken stupor of people who have preconceived notions of the natures and cause of a said word, sentences, policies or whatever. They are not the same as being anything. If anything, this is bigotry when people just do not inquire more as to figure out what every person thinks and feels. It is just bullshit. And contrapoint is ill equipped to even figure out what racism is, if she, he, xer their, blabla  somehow thinks that YOU CAN figure out if someone is a racist . Even an emotional reaction and the words along with a reaction which can make people espouse dumb shit is not clear evidence of anything. People who hold racist ideas even, should not be put in that corner. Their behaviour should be simply be judged by a reasonable means to trigger, threaten, use violence or any act that is unacceptable as the bad part.   Why OH WHY CAN PEOPLE NOT JUST DRAW THE MOST ACCURATE ASSUMPTION WHICH IS THAT TRUMP IS AN IDIOT!  WHY DO PEOPLE PRETEND TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!?  Based or who a group like due to their own principles, ideas and whatever is well or better received than a  counterparts if you have to choose between option a or option cunt, is not an indicator on jack shit!   I do not fucking care if someone is a fucking nazi, communist, feminist whatever, as loong as they say something which DOES NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, BECAUSE IT IS RETARDED!  Let people have their fucking concerns, address those concerns if you wish, but to speak about a group or individual you do not know, you are just acting like a fucking moron who tries to gerrymander enough emotional strings which makes a certain person feel inclined to agree. Good night."
"And yet again, you showed no proof that he is racist. All you got is paranoia and really broad assumptions. Claiming him as a racist, which is a really big thing which lots of leftists seem to be sure of, based on very weak arguments, is extremely immature.  Racism is wrong and should always be under contempt, but that doesn't mean that we should ignore the problems in hand and blame a false ghost like the justice system. It's true that black people commit a higher percentage of crime equivalent to the percentage white people do. It's due to poverty, bad parenting and ultimately Rap Crime Culture. They also commit half of the murders (due to gang violence), that's why on average black people suffer heavier jail times. Ignoring the problem and blaming 'racism in the justice system' really doesn't make their situation better http://bit.ly/2ayh9h9.   You think he's using the Southern Strategy because of a line of some poor choice of words? Trump is not a very sweet talker sure, because ultimately he's not used to express himself well enough as he is not a politician, and by that I mean that he doesn't know how to explain things very clear and thoroughly (even though, It's not hard enough to understand what he means in the first time unless your social IQ is very low), but you can't assume that he supports the KKK because of some interview where he seemed visually tired, or then you think he promotes violence with no context (many rallies before that, tons of left leaning supporters had assaulted his audience and Trump supporters over the country). It's the same with Mexicans. In many of his rallies he's mentioned that ultimately he wants to deport the Mexicans which have criminal records (because before, even if a person of that nationality committed a crime, he would not have been deported but just put in US jail), but of course you'd never mention that, because you're too focused on your bias towards him, right? You think the 'Make American Great Again' logo is racist now? Really? It's aimed towards his original agenda, which is improving the country's economical issues with China and debt. White hate groups? What about Muslim hate groups? Or even hate groups against whites (such as anti-fa groups, BLM groups, feminist groups). Oh, but you're completely going to ignore those issues like any other leftist, right? Violence against protestors because they're BLACK? Stop assuming everything must be connected with racism holy shit, where there's no evidence for that and you make that assumption, you actually encourage more racism from the victim side of the spectrum. Most of his very violent protestors have been middle-class white people, which have all been arrested. Oh no wait, It's because they're white, oppressed by the black Barack Obama government, right? Stop searching for racism where there isn't you dumb ass."

"I like your voice, dude."
"Would i be considered racist if i would say the 'black community' has a problem with crime right now? Does the reason why i think that make a differnce. Would it still be racist if i came to the conclusion that it is because many black communities are poor and have bad education which leads to crime and crime strenghtens the first two points, and so on? Like in many other poor communites. Would it be racist to believe that more police in those areas could lead to a positive end of course you need to end poverty which i could try through a better educational system. Is it racist to belief the facts by the police first? You get the point... ."

"what I like about your videos is that they are... pretty damn logical. I try to keep a critical mind, try to find problems with your logic, but you got me beat on that, it's pretty good.   I've been seeing pragerU videos to get a sense of what the 'other side' (feel anxious when I say that for some reason) say and see, the seem legit. And some of those videos are... pretty well done and have taught me a lot, but some of the arguments are complete rubish and they are said by people I suppose know better (the global warming guy, just so bad). I would love to see you takle them!"
"Another fantastic and well said video! KEEP. THEM. COMING.  You have a fantastic talent for researching, writing, recording, and editing (unless you resource, which kudos to them also) and I'm enjoying all the work. I found you on Reddit and am now binging. But please keep it up!"

"1:36 sums up why I have such problems with body shaming.  It's nothing but bullying, and when you bully someone's *body* you bullying everyone that looks like that.  I know this is a joke but it's a serious criticism I hold of many feminist YouTubers, they will call Warcorpse666 ugly, which *you* may believe is true - and believe is fine to say because he's such an asshole, but what if he has a twin who's the polar opposite personality wise?  Does it just suck for them and should suck it up?  Bullying I tell you"

"Forget about what's inside anybody's head. Racist is as racist does."
"There was a premise in this video that sat wrong with me but I couldn't quite put my finger on it until recently. The whole 'dog whistle politics' thing.  I can definitely see its potential as a tool of subversion. And evidence seems to suggest it was very much a weapon of choice in the past (particularly during the Nixon years). But the premise involves other people drawing a conclusion that deviates from what is literal. And there's another mechanic that can achieve this same effect: 'projection'. People simply injecting their subjective worldview, what they want to see, onto reality.  To me, occam's razor would suggest that Trump being that thoughtful about his choice of words is less likely than the simpler explination that ideological groups are continuing to project their worldview onto everything (be they old school racists or the PC culture).  God, Patriarchy, the Gay Agenda & the Jewish Conspiracy is everywhere and you can see it in everything. That I can see people doing. Trump actually thinking about the secondary consequences of his words? WAY less likely. The guy is basically talking out his ass."

"Uh, I have to point out one thing about this video. You say white people in the US have an unfounded fear of black people. I would like to point out to you that blacks comprise of around thirteen percent of the US population and are responsible for around fifty percent of all violent crimes. Do you not think that with this in mind, their fears are just that little bit justified?"
"Why is it ok to talk about the blacks and the latino's vote demographics during the election? Isn't that racist by typical criteria?"
"Hello. Please let me thank you for making a video that attempts to address the point of debate that is whether Donald Trump is a racist. I was surprised how few people presented arguments from an unbiased yet factual perspective.   As a preface, I would like to say that I don't identify as conservative or liberal, democrat or republican and try to be objective as possible when making decisions, but as with all individuals; I am fundamentally biased.  With this election being over and the protests in the streets, I decided that I should find it within myself to become educated on the most controversial topic regarding the president-elect. I found a few videos from people of various races that argued both ways, but they all had some glaring biases that quickly became evident to me. I was hopeful when searched 'why is trump considered racist' to find a video that was as neutral as possible and based their argument on factual evidence, such as his policies. At this point I found your video. I was relieved to find a video that was completely unbiased... until I reached about 20 seconds and realized that I was mistaken. Regardless, I watched your video. Several times in fact and decided to research the issue myself a bit (probably should have decided to completely investigate the issue myself rather than interpret the information presented from a secondary source, but being the person that I am, I was too lazy to do so). I actually ended up watching one or two of your other videos before I decided to essentially waste my time writing this long-winded comment in the form of feedback. I found myself agreeing with you in some respects, but not so in others, but regardless I respect the opinions that you hold.  First, I would like to say that I actually enjoyed your content. I enjoyed your humor and thought that you obviously put effort into researching this topic. I hope that you continue to educate and express yourself in this way. The most prominent thing that I noticed while watching, was that you tend to relate things to the past a little too much (in my opinion of course). The past is invariable a valuable source of information to rely on, but some of the allusions you made were a little far stretched for me to make a conclusion from. I have found that Trump like all politicians (including Hillary and others), pander to various audiences. Though Trump's execution tends to be more crude as he has decades less political experience than individuals, such as Hillary Clinton. I can definitely see how someone might make the judgement that Trump is pandering to the group of Americans that might be fearful of immigrants or people that are in general, fearful, of people that are different than them. However, this is a natural reaction, perhaps not the correct reaction, but definitely a natural reaction and I find this to be an issue in and of itself. I have yet to reach a conclusion as to whether Mr. Trump is actively playing the fears of certain groups of Americans or if it is genuinely his perspective on those issues because I have no sound evidence either way. Still, I found the graphic images of the civil rights movement mixed with the statements presented by Donald Trump towards the end of your video to be in poor taste. I found it to demean your argument in general as you made the jump from his words about violence against protest (which were in poor taste to begin with) to intense violence against the African-Americans who want nothing more than their rights. However, it does pander to an certain audience that wants to be outraged by his words regardless of context. I do not profess to be an expert on any issues related to politics as I find it rather toxic (especially during this election cycle), but I cannot find any specific evidence to point to Donald Trump being the racist that he is considered to be. Certainly, some groups of people may be the most disgusting racists, but that does not speak to the character of Donald Trump himself. So at this time my judgement of the president-elect is in a state of turmoil, which perhaps may only develop once he has had the chance to lead this nation.  Again, I would like to thank you for your opinion. My own thoughts may not echo your own, but I do respect them. I hope that you continue to produce videos, such as this, to contribute to the conversation on various topics."
"You are a sheep."
"Seeing how articulate your videos are makes me wonder whether you read your comments often. Were I to try and make video essays like this, I would obsess over every single commenter who clearly had not watched the video, and every misrepresentation of my argument. I suppose other people don't have this problem to the degree that I do, but I absolutely hate to be misunderstood or misrepresented."

"Gee whiz, you are criminally undersubscribed! keep up the good work!"
"All this video does is take Trump out of context. Trump already has made fucked up remarks in the past, why not use those instead of cutting clips or taking what he says out of context to make it seem like your right.  Trump is not racist. you can argue that he's a bigot and ignorant and I will agree with you to an extent but he is not racist."
"You are so funny!"
"You make the best point in proving that Trump is racist I've seen on YouTube so far.   But it still fall a short, you made a good point that its hard to really tell whats going on in another persons head. Basically you conceded that you did not have the proof required.  your country has allot of problems, you should try your cross dressing in Saudi Arabia. you would go straight to jail a get raped by lots of men.  If he plays on the prejudicial fears of the white majority is that any different in his opposition playing on the fears of minorities that Trump is a racist without conclusive proof."
"Woooow! Respect for McCain +10 O.o"
"So... what's wrong with racism in general then?"
"Ah, triggered normies..."
"Fuck, man. I want to be your best friend. I fuckin love you."
"I just think Trump isn't articulate enough to specify exactly what he means. Thus, he attracts two mostly into two types of people: the 'racists' and the 'thinkers' that could be thought of as the alt-right. For example, Trump says, 'build the wall'. The racists think, 'Those goddamn Mexicans ruining our country' while the other group says, 'yes illegal immigration (from every source, but Mexico is the biggest one) has negative effects on our society and economy'. While I don't think Trump is the smartest person in the world, I do think he raises some good points. I fucking hate this election"

"Another interpretation of Nixon's Law and Order/Silent Majority approach was that it was more ' effing long-haired hippies' than 'effing n%&&#%'. Two aren't mutually exclusive,  though.    Palin's anti-coastal rhetoric seems more anti-DC/academia/intelligentsia/ media than one with a racist undertone."
"What is that image at 13:02?"
"I prefer the overt neofascists and white supremacists to most of the new 'alt-right' crowd.  At least the former are honest about their seething race hatred and contempt for anyone outside their ingroup.  The alt-right however? They just squeal-squeal-squeal about being CALLED racists by others; whining about how 'I can't say anything without being seen as racist!'. Well, have you tried not saying and doing shit that's suffused with race hatred, xenophobia, and dehumanising ethnic minorities? It's really not that hard."

"Trump is bad news.  He could plunge us in a nightmare we may never escape from.  Reagan looks like a saint compared to Donald.  Even Romney looks good.  I'd take Sarah Palin for president compared to this guy.  The country is in some trouble."
"I have a beard because I'm a CULTURAL MARXIST.  I lied actually, I'm just a marxist. I lied again, I'm just a marxian socialist. I lied once more, I just don't like shaving."
"Ahhhh....tyvm for returning to Youtube. You've definitely changed your substance and style, but you still make a fantastic video;)"
"I think it's because the people accusing Trump of being racist tend to have a reputation for overusing that particular label. Often adopting the social justice adacdemia definition instead of the conventional definition which only further dilutes the impact of the accusation with miscommunication. So to the average layman, it's become a 'boy who cried wolf' looking scenario."

"ur pretty :3"
"Nice conspiracy theory!"
"I don't really see the comparison to Trump throwing people out of his private events and police brutality. One is idiots stomping on free speech getting what they deserve and the other is police crossing the line.

"Trayvon was curb stomping a dude. Brown robbed a store and was punching a cop in the face while trying to take his gun. These shootings were not racist, but fearing black criminality IS rational as they commit about 5x as much violent  crime as whites. In NYC it's more like 20x"
"awesome, huuuuge video, keep it up."
"This is the best argument for Trump being racist I've seen yet. His rhetoric is absolutely questionable. Either he is cleverly toeing the line to pander to paranoid old white people, or he is just an ineloquent buffoon who words things horribly.  The thing is, his policies are not racist, as most people claim."
"I have a conspiracy theory that you've kidnapped David Lynch and you're forcing him to edit your videos"
"Meh, not bad, but your progressive fag aura of [I'm holier than thou because I'm in the non-racist camp] kills most of the humor.

"I, Ironist - as I live and breathe!  Glad to see you back on YouTube, been missing your content.   Realise you've been back for a while, but yeah..."
"Think for a moment on the term 'Dog Whistle' politics.   If something is so veiled that only by paying the strictest attention to the most minute semantics that you then have to interpret against a backdrop of social dynamics that are fluid in the extreme and far from being universal, that has to be searched out in a spelunking expedition of mental fecal matter.  To the point where playing 'Twister' while covered in motor oil on a polished marble floor would support a more firm metaphorical foundation. Then chances are that _you_, being the interpreter of said 'dog whistle', are in all probability the largest racist in the room.  For my part, I'd rather see a person's racist faults out in the open where they can easily be confronted and dealt with.  As opposed to the systematic racism of lowered expectations where the conditions of our minority brothers and sisters can only be remedied by the great white father (or mother).  The latter is a kinder and gentler form of racism that comes with a nice reptilian smile, that also stands out as the cruelest form of a base and cruel practice."

"I have to say, I watched you when your channel was still called nykytine or something like that, and when you were, first a drunk religionbasher (crudely put) and then a philosophy freshman, and I really like this incarnation of you. I always smile when a new video of yours pops up in my subbox. I was at first somewhat worried that you wouldn't be able to maintain this honest and homorous approach to the dishonest and nasty cesspool that is the ongoing internet war about gender and SJW's and the like. (I know my patience with it runs out easily)  But I'm impressed by how well you are able to deal with it all."
"That picture at  0:15 is the dummest thing I've seen in a week."
"I don't think Trump is racist, but I also don't think he thinks about what he says before he says it. He's appealed to a lot of people by not playing the political game of doing very clearly laid out speeches where he talks around subjects in a politically correct (and frankly professional) way. He just says what he thinks and there's a lot of people who like that. Unfortunately since you can kind of only 'hot take' a lot of what he says it makes it very open to interpretations, which allows actual racists to think 'hey, he agrees with me.'  All that being said, I think Trump has said some real ignorant shit that has made him look pretty stupid, and pretty easy to interpret as racist. But is he actually racist, probably not. And the majority of his supporters probably aren't either.  But it shouldn't be ignored that David Duke and the stormfront idiots are so intent on supporting him. That should raise some red flags that he hasn't told them to fuck off."
"Typical protard balderdash. First, never mention the behavior of the supposed maligned other (crime stats for instance). This allows for the improper diagnostics of psychopathologization of the white majority. Second, once you've framed them as suffering from irrational fear (without a spect of evidence l might add) discuss history in a feelocratic fashion (never mention how many lynchings there were, how many of them were white and how many them were black). Third, take your standard liberal narrative and claim that you've demonstrated a continuity between your indeterminate stories and today. What chiefly irks me about protard automatons like contrapoints is how they think that they can think when all their storytelling is nothing more than the narrative and their entire line or life of thought is mass produced for the creation of the biddable bodies they supposedly oppose."
"Been looking forward for your next video and you didnt disappoint. More psychology <3"
"He definitely wants the racist votes, but that doesn't mean he is racist.  I think you over exaggerate somethings.  Also, it is a little disappointing that you used cases where the shooter was acquitted on charges of murder as examples of racist murders."
"@5:49 what?"
"dude your videos are getting better and better"
"I'm the 666th viewer to this video.  I feel special now.              Haaaaven't even watched the video yet."
"Trump has never mentioned race beyond pointing how how many African-Americans and Latinos support him. He has used offensive language towards individual members of a race, but that doesn't make him racist. It rather shows that he knows how to persuade people to vote for him. Discrediting your opposition is a wining strategy. Exactly what you did in your video. And it obviously worked for the primaries. Expect him to switch to a message of love for the general election. He's playing the game of politics. Everybody does the same thing, he's just better at it.  It is only his political opposition that constantly mentions race and in most cases it is divisive and intentionally so. Trump has literally never said a negative thing about race during this election."
"Trump says, 'They're rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.'  Which you interpret to mean 'He's straight up calling them rapists'.  But he's not saying that is he?  He is clearly saying that, of the illegal immigrants, there is an unnacceptably high proportion of them who are rapists.   I don't know whether what he's saying is true or not, but he's definitely not saying what you are interpreting."
"I dont know if trump himself is racist, but if you are a racist, trump campain headquarter is a good place for you. You can answer phones with the other neo nazis that work there."
"The problem with the term 'racist' is that it is so vague that literally anybody can be interpreted to be racist.  If you believe that one culture or religion is better than another, that can be interpreted to be racist.  If you like styles of cooking and foods from other countries, that can be interpreted to be racist.  Likewise if you have failed to  actively denounce particular groups of people who like styles of cooking and foods from other countries, that can be interpreted to be racist."
"Obama might not be Arab, but he doesn't want Muhammed to be criticized.  So he might be muslim."
"Once again great video, I'm not afraid to admit that  I hate tackling racist issues.  It infuriates me, but I do like hearing other peoples take on it."
"Great video again, Nyk!  May I bother you to watch my new video arguing Steve Shives as a New Atheist Heretic? I would very much like your feedback. Sorry if I am a pest. Don't want to link and get spammed; its on my channel, though."
"12:08 I believe they prefer the term, 'Bronzed-Americans.'"

"tl;dw: no trump is not a racist"
"once again good video. there are literally no 'feminist' content creators that sit down and explain things like this."
"I can't even express how happy I am that you are making videos again. You are legitimately hilarious (and cute when you genderbend FYI)."
"You've made valid points but you completely lost me with the 'like, comment and subscribe' spiel. Ruined the whole fucking thing."
"This video is idiotic beyond belief. Of the countless things you could _legitimately_ criticize Trump for, you choose to criticize him for 'racism' using some of the weakest, most willfully ignorant arguments imaginable. What's most disconcerting is that a lot of this smear tactic BS is coming from people considered to be 'intellectuals.' And partisan cronyism is so widespread that few people ever bother to call out dishonest shit like this within their ranks. Most of them cheer it on like trained seals. The ends justify the means -- that's the message here. Forget Hanlon's razor and fuck the principle of charity. Let's exploit the fact that Trump is an inarticulate simpleton who's fast and loose with his language to nitpick his actions in the _least_ charitable way to _pretend_ that the guy is a racist. An anti-Semite, even! Assholes. Yes, I know - Trump does the same thing against his detractors, but that doesn't mean _you_ should contribute to the problem, you race-mongering weasel."
"Orangie? I was totally with you until that completely racist comment. I thought you were better than this."
"Stopped watching when you started talking about how Trump called Mexicans rapists. He didn't.  You clearly did a lot of research and preparation for this. Would it have been so hard to actually watch the speech where Trump says the famous 'they're rapists' quote? Maybe see who the 'they' he was referring to actually was?"
"'If you show a picture of a black person looking like a thug a lot of white people conclude he deserves to die'? Unless by 'a lot' you mean a tiny minority then you're wrong. You provide no evidence for this. Isn't it a racist statement?   The so-called 'southern strategy' is is democrat conspiracy theory, easily debunked. The southern whites departure from the much more racist democrats started decades before the 60's. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/04/30/southern_whites_shift_to_the_gop_predates_the_60s_118172.html The democrats overwelmingly opposed the civil rights act (the republicans supported it) and they started offering welfare programs to win black votes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkHrI7W3WCQ  The concept of 'dog-whistle politics' is non-falsifiable. How exactly would Sarah Palin disprove your claim that 'real America' refers to 'white rule America'? It's Orwellian bullshit. You're just voicing your paranoia.   There's a similarly large history racism and general bigotry in all politics so singling out American politics is irrelevant to whether Trump is racist or not. Politics is force.  'Looks' like . . .' is not a valid argument.  Trumps slogan is not saying things aren't better now than they were several decades ago. It's saying America used to be great (you can look up the criteria he gives if you care to) but now it's not. You have to understand what greatness means in this context.   He didn't call undocumented Mexican immigrants rapists. They're not 'undocumented' (nice lefty-speak). They are illegal. ILLEGAL. NOT undocumented. Ill- the fuck -legal. They are committing a crime. Illegal. That's why Trump has to repeatedly emphaisze the word 'illegal'.  He called a section of the illegal immigrants rapists and he was referring to facts. 80 percent of Mexican women are raped crossing the border http://fusion.net/story/17321/is-rape-the-price-to-pay-for-migrant-women-chasing-the-american-dream/ . He's not saying 'how would you like black people raping you daughter?'. He's saying they ARE rapists. They fucking ARE.  Then you revisit the tired issue of a former KKK member 'endorsing' Trump.  Here's Hilary actually praising a former KKK member https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryweuBVJMEA does that mean something? Is she a racist now? I mean, there's barely a politician of whom you can't find support of such people. Bernie supporters have been violent towards women. Bernie said 'he can't be held responsible for everything they do'. Is he a misogynist now?  Maybe EVERYONE is a racist all the time forever everywhere.  Your clip of the dotering old women and Trumps response is another example of you reading motive into things. How do you KNOW Trump left it to thrive? Left WHAT to thrive. It's just a old women and you're just offended by trivialities.  As for McCain and Regan's responses to such things; You used examples of Reagan's dog-whistle racism earlier. So are these Republican men racist or not?   The star of David lie? The storm-front candidate of choice? Really rational arguments there.  Maybe you'd like point out that his favorite Star Wars character is Darth Vader. I mean that implies Trump is evil TOO right?  I tried to watch the rest but you're just an ideological hack. This video is entirely composed of insinuations and smears. Presenting a cherry-picked collection of clips and articles, none of which show Trump actually saying or doing anything racist (not that you give any definition of racist) does not add up to 'He's a racist'.  You are the one exploiting race to go after someone you despise. YOU are the racist."
