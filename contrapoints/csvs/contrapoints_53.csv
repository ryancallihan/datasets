"I love this!  'Excuse my beauty' shows real strength and actually compassion for the idiot cop!"
"I have such a crush on you... You are an amazing, beautiful person. 💘"
"I'm happy to be a TERF."
"see bolsonaro shaking hands with trump was DEFINITELY the worst brazilian reference ever"
"you are beautiful"
"Transphobia... transphobia never changes."
"It’s so sad that some people feel the need to criticize/discriminate/hurt others who are just living their lives and not harming anyone  I’m from Austria and we have an annual event called the life ball which is basically a huge LGBTQ+ event, some people dress up in costumes some don’t and it’s just colorful, everyone’s happy and and accepting. Whenever I’m there I think to myself what a shame it is that this is just one day in a year. Everyday should be like that! The atmosphere and energy there is so loving and compassionate...I really wish that at some point in the future, the possibility to be whoever you want to be and not being judged for it, won’t be restricted to special events like the life ball or the pride parade. Let’s hope we get there!"
"I think of myself as a 'feminist' but I'm not a TERF.  I think there is still, after all these decades, a lot of disagreement or misunderstanding of what 'feminism' actually is.  And I'm glad that you have been using the term TERF because we really do need to have a clear distinction between men and women who are feminists and men and women who find trans people 'too different' or repulsive.  Basically, language gets very twisted around, because human beings are so F-ing crazy, don't you think?"
"Hating straight white men's still cool though right?"
"stolen valour ...or stolen victimhood. Are they really synonymous?"
"this is my second or third viewing lets gooooo"
"I love how much effort you put into these! Each character is so unique and your costumes/makeup are phenomenal and you can see how much effort you put into every ounce of each video. Your sets and lighting are wonderful, your jokes always hit a home run, and your scripts are wonderful. You've just done such a good job with all of your videos."
"Love your video, you go girl!!!"
"i think this is my favorite video on youtube"
"I'm sorry I keep double posting on all your videos, but you're truly charismatic.  You make me question my own beliefs as a trans person.  You could be a General.  One of the things I prize about myself the most is my composure under pressure."
"I mean, she does have a good point. The national mall really isn't going to bleed on itself."
"I want to be her friend so bad, she seems like so much fun, so sweet, & I love her style."
"Holy shit, I have that same teacup"
"I’m a trans-TERF"
"this was so excellent & the lesbians love you"
"“Oh it rattles my chromosomes” has made it into my common language. Thank you, miss points"
"a"
"Huh, I forgot about COPS. I remember only seeing the previews, but still thinking that it looked like a really trashy, power tripping show."
"She’s old enough to be my mom buuuuuuuuuut ... idc I would marry her in a heartbeat  Edit: before y’all make stupid comments, I’m a girl"
"Why can't we just let people live? If a person isn't diminishing someone else's well being then leave them the fuck alone."
"For real the costume design of the Inner Radfem is absolutely stunning"
"You kinda look like Wynona Rider in this video???"
"I'm offended by your beauty."
"Please release sad tran full song on spotify"
"I've only recently started watching you, directed here from Thought Slime, and I've learned so much.  The part about Stephanie Yellowhair and your comment at the end nearly brought tears to my eyes."
"Liked for the who reference"
"BURGEONING"
"😭😭😭 Our Chili is fine!!!!"
"All of the Reds fans watching this died when you called their chili shit"
"Love this essay!"
"i like how nathalie shows the same level of intelligence and respect in her arguments as in any other of her videos but she doesn't pretend to tolerate terfs for the sake of their comfort. real badass of her"
"I love love love your videos! Please keep making videos! ❤"
"this video made me extremely self conscious about my hands, i didnt know that was i thing why did you do this to me"
"9:34 I mean, I feel this exact same way, except I'm cis. I feel as though my facial structure and certain features arent fem enough. I get nauseous when compared to my fathers looks (you look just like your dad!) and subconsciously am always reinforcing the idea that I look 'mannish'. I only get these feelings with my face, bc my body is very feminine but I'm curious if this is similar to the feelings many MTF transwomen experience? I Identify as a woman and I know I'm not a man, so feeling this way makes me very uncomfortable and unsatisfied. It can all be chalked up to not feeling pretty enough I guess."
"you are sooo amazing!!!"
"I'm not trying to be rude but someone explain to me, Why are trans women women?"
">cis women who don't wear makeup >trans women who wear a full face every day >'fighting society's stereotypes of what it means to be a woman' >* cool handshake while Womp Womp plays in background *"
"Reminder,you're not a female. I identify as......... Pure crap,biology has decided that for you. You are not God,or edgy,just mentally ill. SEEK HELP NOW."
"Sure, burgeoning is iconic, but luxuriance is quite dandy"
"Love!!!"
"Alguém veio por recomendação do Tese Onze ?"
"also, that veil look is everything. you've joined the constellation of my fashion icons"
"i lost my shit at the robot siren noise"
"What actually 'is' the Jewish Question?"
"I honestly don't understand TERFs. Like, if someone feels so strongly that they are a woman then why can you not just let them? Why do we have to debate and criticise someone else's gender. What is it to you? Let people be happy for fucks sake."
"This video is just perfect!"
"10:43 to 11:27 had me rofl. 'i guess english is still patriarchal language, right? So i should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds? NEER NEER NEER NEER NEER!!!'"
"I really appreciate the way you explain things. I'm not against anything a person wants to do but seldom do people break down their views and contrapionts (sorry) so well. Thank you."
"I'm a cisgender feminist and your videos have really helped my reconcile my subconscious fear and confusion about changing language and gender identities. I had so many questions which I didn't feel were appropriate to ask my progressive peer group or which I didn't feel confident I could phrase in the best socially conscious way.  You are incredibly intelligent and compassionate. Your socratic dialogues have taught me so much. I feel ready to be loving and accepting of everyone, which obviously I should have been doing from the beginning. Thank you."
"TERF is not a slur. It's how TERFs initially named themselves."
"Terfs make my blood boil, especially considering they *should* know better but don't."
"YOUR 👏 UTOPIAN 👏 PIPEDREAM 👏 IS 👏 VALID 👏"
"Your makeup skills are getting god tier"
"love you, love your channel. the only other video i’ve seen so far is the one discussing the incel community but i feel fairly confident in saying that the points you make are refreshingly nuanced which imo is severely lacking in public discourse on any medium. if people can’t figure out by now that virtually nothing in life is black & white then they need to be exposed to more content like this. keep doing what you’re doing. 💜"
"'manly and clockable'  PFFF You're more feminine than I am and I'm a cis woman. (I think at least, I'm a little confused)"
"Not to pick sides or even defend Terfs BUT. If Terf is not a slur then Trap ain't either."
"'this is only for women' Jokes on you! I am non binary, I am above the system!"
"only 5 mins into the video, but before I can continue I must say that I am liiving for this Maleficent look. The glitter cheek and tiddy contours are 👌.  I hope one day my contour game will be half this good"
"Contra you're genuinley amazing"
"<3"
"So when you say you used to be “anti-feminist,” you’re differentiating between what you call “TERFs” and “feminists.” I’m curious to know what you did when you were engaged in misogyny, prior to your transition.  Edit: your highlight is blinding 😍"
"Just an observation, you've got a kind of Yvonne Strahovski vibe under the makeup.  ok byebye"
"Terf is a new term to me, been out of the loop far to long. Bad as they are I can ignore them, it's the alt right bible cultist that scare me. They just don't want us to go back and hide in the closet they want us exterminated. Extremist are just evil in themselves and must be defied, terf, alt right or religious fanatics."
"Look absolutely lovely to me and very interesting."
"yeah and it’s really eye roll worthy to see terfs spout too about how all trans men are just lost women drowning in internalized misogyny. does that happen? it does, happened to me, i worked through it. WITHOUT BEING A TERF. because wouldn’t you know it? my experiences are not universal! and it’s possible to detransition (partially anyway, i still am non binary, just on the more feminine side now than masculine) without becoming a gender critical asshole! amazing concept. brilliant video on the subject."
"I think this was a great video and that you're a great person for talking about these things"
"Why is so hard for us to empathize with people? Great video."
"Question. Why is it so bad for a white person to put on blackface but ok for a man to dress up as a woman and claim to be one? Is it... ladyface?"
"So, if a biological woman can range from hyperfeminine to hypermasculine, and your organs or chromosomes don't make you male or female, then what does it even mean to say 'I'm a woman'?"
"TRAs: terfs: 'some kind of misogynistic conservative bullshit'   'terfs': look man I just want to undress in a lockerroom without a male looking at me and play sports against people from my own sex."
"Vase be look like r2d2"
"I think the solidarity is acceptance.   And I also think, perhaps in antithesis to activism, that we should accept to those who are opposed to our views - where it does not actively (read: legally or substantially) hinder our freedom.  Also you're artistic expression is inspiring."
"Lastly, lastly....no one should use the term-GENDER FLUID. It just sounds gross! Keep your fluid to your self. Fluid is only good in private. You are very talented. You remind me of a young Faye Dunaway. That may be offensive but I am totally lost at what is offensive anymore."
"And Katherine McKinnon was a whore. Not in a bad way. She worked as a prostitute. Which was her choice. Sort of? I would be a whore if it paid well."
"And I remember Anita Bryant! She was hysterical and liked orange juice. Wait, you are a trans woman? I am very confused. Troll. Queer. Real. Non binary. Phobia. Cis. Gender. Islam. Jewish. Drag. Gay. Real. Dysphoria. DSM5. Testosterone. Transitioning. Words."
"This is a fascinating channel. It reminds me of Louder with Crowder and Riley J Dennis. My 2 favorite vlogs. It is good YouTube and the internet have maid beyond useless retarded people have a place to mentally masturbate. God Bless America and MAGA bitches;) Whether you have a wiener or not."
"Did Natalie grow up in Baltimore? Whenever I watch her videos I feel like I’m in Hampden.   Great video Natalie. Keep up the good work."
"Rest in peace Stephanie Yellowhair, you didn't let the bastards get you down xxx"
"I'm a trans man watching this, I'm okay to watchi this right? I mean I'm not a woman... but I'm interested in this"
"I would like to add that having the experience of being a woman or growing up as a woman varies so much not just from from person to person but also from country to country and no one would expect a cis woman to go through a certain amount of suffering just to count as a woman as an adult or as a person worthy of joining the feminist movement. I spent a while living in Egypt and a while in Germany as a child and the difference of how you are treated is so vast that I feel fairly comfortable in saying that in some way it could be comparable to growing up trans vs growing up cis. So unless we impose a harmful and very specific standard of how one has to have experienced the oppression of the patriarchy to be a woman this point is utterly moot."
"Youtube workers love take it into their ass..."
"I'm glad i found my way into your videos. The way you combine humor with some really tought topics are a pleasure to listen too and it does'nt hurt that you're a beutyfull woman with (what i consider to be the the most important thing) a brain as well as a great personality.   Being an ally i have to admit i knew disturbingly little about the trans community, chalk it up to the 'live and let live' mentality, but going throught your videos have given me a better understanding and more knowledge about the subject and i just wanted you to know that you earned yourself a new fan by only being your own fantastic self."
"Hi. Great video. However, your comment about cincinnati chili is unwarranted and offensive. Please reconsider your biases pertaining to the italian-derived cuisine that coincidentally originated in Garbagetown, USA. Thank you."
"As a cis woman I have one question. Can she do my cleavage contour? Because those boobs are amazing!!!"
"I have felt so alone and alien in the trans community just for believing the kind of nuanced things you say in the video in regards to socialization and experiences. Thank you so much for being a voice of reason that can defend trans people without extreme black and white thinking that has never felt true to me"
"If anyone wants some super gender-inclusive speak in their media, there's a podcast called Sawbones, it's hosted by a doctor and her husband (Sydnee and Justin McElroy) and they talk about the WaCkY HisTorY oF mEdiciNe. They use terms like 'pregnant person' and whatnot when talking about medical history and it's just really refreshing hearing them include NB and trans folks in history. Very good, highly recommend, lgbtq+ inclusive all around from a couple of married Cishet white adults"
"You are brilliant and fantastic in all the work you’ve put In to your excellent coverage of this issue. Absolutely beautifully done. Thank you so much for this!"
"I just watched your incel video before this and didn't even realize you were trans!! Your videos are so creative and amazing keep doin u girl"
"Thank you so much for these videos.   Your wit, beauty, honesty, and humor are equal parts enlightening, thought-provoking, and inspirational.   My one complaint is that sometimes I have to back up the video because I’ve been mesmerized by the highlights on your cheekbones and missed what you said.  Seriously, what highlighter are you using because that shit is magical!"
"Can you do an episode on transvestigations? It would be interesting to hear from the other side of the debate."
"I'm really proud that you took a turn from clocking a tran to actually embracing your womanhood.... you're truly inspiring. You make me want to over come my fears on my own identity and sexuality. tbh I'm a female attracted you guys but about three years a go I meet this amazing guy who made my heart throb and I ditched him because I found out that he was a she and I got all weird about it. I haven't stopped thinking about him to this day. He lingers in my mind. Now and then and I wonder what would have been if I became his gf. Should I slide in the DM's still or am I an asshole?"
"Everything about that thumbnail is gorgeous"
"It's misandry below the transphobia. Womanhood is an exclusive club and they feel insulted that you are trying to trojanhorse your way in."
"I love this video... I hope some TERFs watch this with an open mind and actually give it a shot, I think most reasonable people would come around, but reasonable people are rarely TERFs, so idk."
"*P I S S   O F F*"
"GERMAINE GREER IS A MAN, YOU SHILL."
"holy fucking shit. This is peak communication. this is form and content perfection. This is is AMAZING, it is a masterclass in honesty and quality of expression. HOW could you not instantly sympathize with trans women. How could you care about the details after such an appeal coming from a beaming example of freedom of expression and just freedom of being.  I am inspired."
"Here's a question for this channel? Why are Men the enemy?     I exist because my Mother gave birth to me. I love her and appreciate her.  I'm also fortunate to have met a woman who is smarter than me and is also a lady I adore. I am a very lucky man to have her in my life.   I resepct her for who she is and also because she is VERY sexy. But she is more than my equal, intellectually and emotionally. She is the boss of me but she does not treat me like I'm inferior, nor would I treat her that way."
"this was the very first video i watched by you and, knowing nothing about this channel at all, i legitimately believed you were a biOLogiCaL fEmALe up until the point where you went and said 'adult human females' and followed it up with 'x-extra biological' at which point i began to question some things. but even so, you honestly do pass so incredibly well that even then, i doubted your obvious sarcasm. tl;dr: you're gorgeous and i'm not just saying that because i'm a nice person"
"I'm ashamed I've wondered myself about trans women trying to remove themselves from toxic masculinity and becoming women but I understand the need to fit in. The trans community is one of the toughest groups I've ever seen. No one could truly want to be trans. I imagine there are a few online individuals who do it to score points, but trying to live your life when everyone screams at you to stop is obviously challenging. I'm trying to be better and become an ally worth standing at your sides. I certainly don't want to steal your voices, or become the image everyone sees. That's why your work is so incredibly vital. Trans people need to be their own voice, and I think as an ally, it's my job to ask others to listen."
"I have nothing but support for the transgender community. I admire your resilience and strength. And I would never pretend I know better than a trans person when it comes to their gender identity but I have to admit, since I believe gender is a construct, a part of me wonders how that is compatible with trans identity. Maybe the compromise is to let everyone do whatever the fuck they want, whether they feel like a man or a woman or if they feel, like me that gender is nothing but a neat little prison society puts you in to exclude you from certain experiences."
"I'm sorry but like the argument 'you didn't suffer from the patriarchy as a little girl therefore you're not valid as a woman' is such bullshit. Since when does the oppression of society makes you anything ? It's a consequence of who you are or appear to be in the eye of society and nothing more.  Also as a lesbian and a feminist I think if there ever was a contest of the America's Next Victim, Trans women would win obviously. Like who are we kidding? My experience as a woman in society is hard (but as a lesbian I also have a camaraderie with men that 'protects' me from some of the discrimination straight women experience) but a trans woman ??? You girls are warriors for being still standing with all the shit thrown at you every day. Also if we look at the rates of murder against cis or trans women like... you get my point."
"I think I fell in love with your channel. It's been such a long time since I've been that excited about finding a new youtube channel I love, where have you been hiding all this time ?? Shitty youtube algorithm.  A trans scholar with heaps of humour and the greatest production value I've ever seen for a channel based on popularization of complex topics.... SIGN ME THE FUCK UP ! I'm only 2 videos in but I think I'm going to binge all of your videos and engage with all of the comment sections. I'm sending you lots of love and positive vibes. Thank you for your work. You're fabulous. -A friendly lesbian"
"I think you explain things well, you are very fair minded, and  I love your self deprecating sense of humour. I must say though that the venomous criticism of Germaine Greer that I hear from some people in this corner of the internet does not sit well with me. Germaine Greer made a lot of valuable contributions to the discussions in second and third wave feminism. But she feels, like I feel, that the destructive and oppressive experience of growing up as a woman and the discussions related to our reproductive rights  are a very , very integral part of what it is like to live as a woman. I do not reduce women to their reproductive biology and I am not trying to 'gatekeep' trans women from being considered women.  However, if you grow up as a biological woman, you cannot escape, for instance, the load of thinking about birth control and  the abortion debate. I've experienced trans women being less than sympathetic to these issues of cis women online. (I'm not saying that trans women do not have their own, very considerable amount of shit to deal with from society, just that the experience is not entirely the same. Cis and trans women have overlapping experiences rather than identical ones, some parts are not shared) Sometimes when I listen to you, I do sense the 'privilege' of having grown up as an upper middle class male with the confidence that that entails, and I feel that men agreeing with you over 'cis female' voices is just people taking the scenic route to shitting on women (and their stupid opinions) yet again.  I'm honestly triggered.   And I'm not looking to make it your problem,  I'm trying to explain where cis women that have a certain amount of discomfort with the discussion  about trans women and inclusion may be coming from."
"“Burgeoning” has become my go-to safeword for when I’m feeling dysphoric"
"'Concerns'"
"The teapot scene made my year _Thank You_"
"Please teach me how to compose an outfit like that"
"So TERFs are like MGTOW but for women? WGTOW?   If so, I say, just like I would to a MGTOW: Go! Run free! Nobody from the opposite sex really wants to marry you. It's completely fine. Go on. Bye."
"You: The Teapot shot and the laughing  Me: Ah shit, here comes another online crush... *scoots over to Patreon*"
"Personally I think it was be awesome if everyone were born female and we’d all have the ability to switch between a penis or vagina.  That way we would all be able to get knocked up or do the knocking."
"I absolutely adore you.   Thought you were amazing before your transition, opinion hasn’t changed after.   I know you were losing sleep not knowing this.   😜😘"
"Well, I've never really thought of what you were saying but by watching this video it made me actually think about it. Everybody should be who they want not what the standard wants them to be.I have never had to deal with this but I have a few friends that are very open about themselves and I always knew that it was really hard to go through anything really without people excepting you for you but now watching all of your videos I feel like I can actually talk about this subjects with a open mind by really understanding your points. As your can see I  am really hooked to your videos and I absolutely love your channel"
"Rip nonbinary people, we are aliens. Rally under the great beige spaceship!!!!      (Just jokes. Dont crucify me)"
"'Exscuse my beauty, TERF!' is the most iconic quote if 2019. 😍"
"Now I am understanding"
"Pure genius."
"Natalie, you had me tearing up when you began to talk about “the resilience of trans women.” What a true, beautiful, heartbreaking observation."
"the music change when the scenerio switched up UGH her mind!"
"personally trans what or not is very irrelevant to the fact that ur sexy af being urself. i dont care dick or punani down there but to have such confidence and swag is what makes me wet. but maybe im just too horny to be racist"
"LOVE"
"I loove the bloopers"
"shes so pretty"
"TERFS: i'm a woman bc my period!!! And trans women are not bc no period!!!  also TERFS: how dare you call me 'menstruator' and reduce me to my period!!!!"
"Just found your channel and already like it! You're very creative in your video,you don't just talk like the others you're give us much more and that's fun!"
"My opinion? Gender... doesn't fucking matter, be what you want, how does someone being anything hurt anyone?"
"If the JBP and Incels videos were a 6 and The Darkness was an 8 in terms of representing the 'other side', this is Natalie's first work that gets it 10/10. Spectacular effort."
"'its like being trapped in the bottom of an elevator shaft with the ghost of anita bryant'  me: googles anita bryant   'do you kids even know who anita bryant is?'   me: ........................."

"Ask a terf about trans camp?"

"My trans friend used the 'trapped in the wrong body' metaphor to explain being transgender to a 7 yr old so there's how you explain it to your kids."
"Gods what a fucking shame that it has taken me so long to discover this channel."
"Does anyone have a timestamp for #yesallgamers"
"If u think about gender like sexual orientation, u see that the problem of 'defining if u are a trans or just a delusional' is not impossible to solve.  I mean. U don't need every time to study the brain of a person to decide if he or she has chronic depression. Of course with a brain scan u would have more chance to get it right, but this doesn't mean that there is no other way to verify it without a brain scan, with a certain amount of accuracy. This to say that u can actually distinguish,in many cases, between a trans person, o cis person, and a mentally hill and curable person. Sorry for my English, hope I'll read this even if probably u won't, and good luck."
"Something I think a lot about the question of whether or not some trans women communicating with the social language of meticulous femininity is harmful to cisgender women is that it probably or at least maybe is--but it isn't harmful because of the vulnerable people using that language, it's harmful because of the way that language is being weaponized against all of us by the system we're in and the people whom that system favors. Like a lot of else that is happening in this rhetoric, it's misplacing the blame and sort of hiding behind that misplacement."
"Why are you BUYING food? We need to abolish capitalism!"

"As soon as she mentions souls I’m out. Thought I his would be serious."
"I am one of those straight man just wondering some of those questions and trying to better understand gender issues. On the other hand, I'm always too afraid to be offensive or be taken for a troll/asshole for asking. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge and experience in a pensive and thoughtful way. I really value this content and your approach, and I wish more people could just have a good discussion on these topics. :) All the best!"
"I'm really trying hard not to cry. *hugs if ok* Thank you so much for this. I know people express admiration for you a lot and that's so true, what you do is fantastic and admirable but I mean it truly and deeply. As a trans woman myself, god it is so hard to be confronted with terf rhetoric and I know that as trans people often the worst transphobia we encounter is what we've internalised, but thank you so so much. Thank you for showing us that we all feel like that but we can all overcome it, we can all stand firm and rise above other people's small minded hatred if we know *why* they think that way because at that point their arguments lose all power. Sorry, I think the end parts of this were a little bit triggering because I know I feel a deep sense of gratitude but I'm struggling to turn that epiphany moment into words. Suffice to say, you are doing good and valuable work I have so much love for you and everything you have to say is so well researched and thoughtful, thank you. :)"
"That character break with the teapot had me in stitches, I have to say"
"I dont know any trans men online but I know of alot of trans women online but in real life I know no trans women but I know alot of trans men, I just graduated high school so alot of people I know are young and more insecure I wonder if trans woman have a harder time coming out as women because they have this idea of masculinity they have to preserve, I almost never see girls being pressured to be super girly but that's nothing close to the truth for boys who want to be feminine but idk"
"I rewatched this video today and I forgot how much the 'take a fucking sip babes *felates the spout of a teapot*' got me in stitches"

"Great video! What's your opinion on the idea that gender is an entirely cultural construct which has nothing to do with biological/anatomical sex differences? Do you believe this is the case, or that gender is comprised of both biological and cultural components?"
"Básicamente todo tu vídeo atacas convenientemente a una hipocresía estúpida npc a INDIVIDUOS que tienen un pensamiento que atancqn aspectos de pajas y más bien intentas refutarlos .... Usando puntos de tesis falaces como la ' homofobia ' cosa que no existe ya que está no tiene sustento clínico ni tampoco aspecto fobico si no es más bien usado como una falacia de autoridad por el hecho de que representa una intolerancia , intolerancia que no se lleva a la ejecución al igual que la fobia por medio de la anciedad si no de crianzas o aspectos culturales que desencadenan odio ... Cosa que no es lo mismo   Si bien el propósito de este video es atacar a la hipocresía por parte de una rama femenista de la propia hegemonía actual lo cual concuerdo , pero no lo haces con calidad narrativa si no con el mismo nivel de incoherencia falaz"
"Jajajaj no existe en lo más mínimo un privilegio masculino. Incluso hablando de opresión la heterosexualidad fue un tabú y una forma desviada de lo que era el ' locus genitalus ' ... Pero fue gracias a la aceptación de la heterosexualidad y la destrucción de su sentencia durante más de 30 años la que dio pie a más cabida a las distintas orientaciones sexuales y su libertad como tal ...   Además mencionas que cuando se da el argumento de que el privilegio masculino no existe y se dan datos como por ejemplo el hombre como 80% más recurrencia en asesinatos y robos , 70% de posibilidades de mantener una vida en la calle ... ¿ Esto pierde valor si realmente no tengo un interés por dichas personas ? Eso es una falacia del Espantapájaros que sienta o no sienta empatía por esos hombres o no .

"Slanus be praised😂"
"I also think there are some men on the left who are actually a bit misogynistic and think feminism is wank and women are biologically meant to be subjugated. They use the trans thing to dismiss feminism. This is actually transphobic since they’re not seeing trans women as women who could benefit from feminism, they actually relate more to trans women because deep down they think trans women are men and women aren’t quite human on the same level."
"yeah"
"If I identity as a 50 year old woman (instead of 25) why cant I be a 50 year old woman? If I identity as rich can I get a bunch of Money?   Ok the last was a bit of a troll question.But like seriously I dont understand. For me (and most other cis people) we see two genders. They are based of biology. There is male and female in like 99% of cases. Then like 1% is born with something other than xy or xx chromosomes. But these people arent usually the nonbinary, genderqueer etc people. These people usually also identify AS either male or female (since they usually lean more towards one or the other biologically still).  A masculine woman is still a woman. A feminine man is still a man. Can someone please explain? Im rather confused .  Also , male privelege. Really? I think privelege is more complicated than that. A poor boy abused all his life is not more priveleged than say Kim Kardashian. Wealth matters more than gender (I think)"
"Oh dear god I shoulda made enough time to check out your videos a WHILE ago, you got a lotta good laughs from a leftist lesbian (a real one, not a TERF). Subbed immediately.   (At first I got your channel confused with one of the '''rationals''' just because of the name, but then I heard who you actually were, and since then I've meant to check it out, once again glad I did)"
"OMG! chicka thank you! finally someone answering the questions i want to ask but couldnt bc name calling can get you fired now, and any questions are met with being called a phobe"
"I know the word 'TERF' is mainstream acceptable right now, but as a word which is uniquely used to target women for harassment, it is still cringey to hear it. I am a (trans) woman who is reliably attacked with it when I admit I'm unsure of my position on some rando political garbage, when in otherwise very pro-trans circles. I guess it's a good thing that my 'allies' think I either pass enough to be targeted this way, or that they are inclusive enough to use women-specific slurs against me, but still, it's incredibly painful, and worrying that it's usually followed with threats of violence (gotta 'punch a TERF' right?).   That minor treason being said...I love this so much."
"Well said.  Your talking points that I've seen thus far have impressed me greatly. You approach the subjects with a delightful mixture of both serious facts, your opinions, opposing talking points, and most importantly, humour. I don't get the impression that you are mocking those that do not share your beliefs, which is a sign of good faith on your part.   You are a very intelligent woman, and it's a delight to see your videos. It's also nice to see more transgender women step up and use their voices in a responsible, well said, and thoughtful manner.  I normally don't like following 'internet personalities,' but you, ma'am, had me won over in the first video I saw. I look forward to more of your videos, and wish you the best."

"Thank you for this! I loathe TERFs, but you addressed some of my own unresolved concerns here. This was so helpful."
"Listen, These videos need more attention"
"Honestly, I love you and your videos. I have no problem with people being trans. I don't make hateful comments, I hardly ever comment online at all. And I have still wondered these questions you bring up but, then later summarize as non-excusable transphobia.   I was genuinely 'just wondering'- actually. I don't know any transgender persons and I have never heard anyone talk about the questions you bring up before.   As someone who seems like an intellectual, and have the capacity to understand others feelings, I think you should know better. Education is much more needed more than condemning. To not make the distance between people even larger.   I understand you're hurt, but you could make a separate video venting and a separate video explaining. Online it's easy to generalize because the trolls are the ones who are most visible. But that's not an accurate representation of reality."
"Gender cuckoldey...."
"As a Cincinnatian I fell tf out at 23:10 😂😂😂. I wasn't ready."
"I really really appreciate this video, and appreciate the emotional cost you likely had to pay to make it, and I apprecaite you.  I am bi, so totally empathize with other women/LGBTQ+ folks telling me I've got my gender identity wrong... However, I also interface with the rest of society, and just couldn't answer some of those 'Troll Questions' since being trans is not my reality.  And, unfortunately, not having an answer made me start to think, gee, maybe there is some merit to the argument.  I really appreciate that now I am able to toss those questions aside.  Also I just want to BE your aesthetic.  Much love from another ex-academian."
"It's interesting how 'you don't know what periods are like when you're 12!' Is a terf argument against trans women, but trans men's fight to have the 'female' birth control that insurance pays for also cover trans men is misogyny. Facts and logic, suuure .."
"Hi, I never considered myself a 'radfem' but as a women that hates makeup, dresses and things that are considered femenine and growing up with everyone telling me I was dressing like a men and that I would be alone for the rest of my life created some sort of dislike for trans women who follows all those steps to 'make them a women', I felt as if they are saying that if I don't follow those steps I am not a women. But after this video, after listening to how you feel and why you do it... I get it. I really do.  If I feel so bad as a women to be compared to a men I can only imagine how a trans person would feel beying called 'trap' or a gender that he/she does not identify. Even if I don't dress the way people tell me to dress people still see me as a She and that's a privilege that not everyone have. So thanks for this video. Thanks for having the patience to explain what is probably obvious to you but maybe not to everyone.  Ps. Sorry if my english is wrong, not my first language."

"Every time I hear 'identifies as a woman', I get confused.  What does it mean? Like,  I know I am,  because of biological reasons,  but how I can identify as a woman. I'm  honestly trying to understand trans people,  I don't  want to be bigoted, but I just don't  get the meaning behind those words."

Most of the traumas in their life as a 'girl' child made them the women they are today. All they can see is someone who bypassed all of that and is now talking them down, invalidating, and 'strawmanning' them.   But you're the ones getting heard instead of them and they're being vilified because they feel a way. Y'all had what all the sylvia plaths wanted and now 'get to be'  women too? It looks so bad but I dunno..."
"As a gnc (nb) woman I actually feel very connected to trans women. We're both women, but a big portion of the society we live in see us as 'wrong women'. Being a woman sometimes feels like you have to fit into this narrow mold, while men get to just be who they are, without the same requirements for how you should look, what you should and shouldn't shave, etc. I don't understand butch/gnc women who side eye trans women when a lot of the struggles we go through are similar."
"Okay but you look like Winona Ryder in this video???"
"So, how can one ' identify ' as a woman? Like what does a woman feel like? I find it interesting biologicals males think being a woman is an experience or costume vs biological. like as a woman, I dont feel like anything nor do I identify as anything. I dont have much in common with other woman other than my biological function and most women would agree."
"All you did was blame women and tell us to stfu and accept it. No fucking opinions for ofabs...I mean terfs and trolls. We can go die or go through conversion therapy. I couldn't give any fucks about what you're flapping your gums about.

I suffer from cptsd and fibro myalgia because I was born with a vagina and have to live in this body. I suffer through this life daily and have been suffering for 35 years because of this body, if I could just identify out of it all, I would have, but I didn't and don't have that luxury. Nobody listens to women or girls with trauma or mental illness, but society listens to boys...What the fuck did you smoke before making this video? Crack? Is it crack that you smoke? I literally just raised my arms in the air and knocked my bong over. Omg... and in the end, you gaslight all your viewers with a conclusion that isn't true AT ALL!!!!!"
"I lost it at series of genderless sounds"
"I must say love, you do have a knack for keeping the interest of others and that is a talent in itself, my idea of a trans woman is a man who decided to become a female, simply that, and vice versa for females who decide to become a man.  I like that you give other sides of this and explain how others may view trans women, I also love the theatrics, marvelous. I also want to express that I would love for us all to remain our own self based on our genders loving the Creator and knowing that we are already designed perfectly from the start of the first breath, oh and even before that.  I also live in reality and know that my views and opinions does not express that of the masses.  I personally am a female, biologically, and have had many girlfriends in the past, yes. I am not knew to trans people at all levels of their transitioning.  I know we have many ways in which we live our lives among each other.  My beliefs are what they are and I'm good with where I'm at with that.  As you are with yours, and I'm also good with that.  I would like to repost your video on my channel with your permission because I honestly don't think you are being bias and that is rare, I do see most videos that only express a one sided view of their topic, and enjoyable to see.  I have to be honest I have only watched 16 minutes exactly so that's what I get so far.  Thanks for sharing you with me.  I love you and love each other."

"In a perfect world gender binaries/social constructs wouldn’t exist but bigotry is widespread and EXTREME. it’s understandable why trans women do feel comfortable expressing traditionally feminine cues to avoid misgendering. I don’t think it’s putting womenhood in a box at all (unless ur part of the group that equates passing to validity)- in the reality we live in filled with bigots and assumptions it’s understandable but sad trans women have to conform to a skewed view of womenhood to avoid being misgendered :< whatever makes u feel safe & comfortable in ur gender identity shouldn’t be policed"
"Everybody commenting on the tits, your getting off to a dude named Bill. Just a quick PSA"
"I've seen gender critical arguments and I appreciate you taking the time to unpack each one. I still don't agree with the 'pregnant people' language. It isn't just in scientific journals, I've seen people shame women for wearing pussy hats or saying they must say 'pregnant bodies' when protesting strict abortion laws. I know it excludes transmen and NB people but I don't think its ok for women to be shamed for not using inclusive language when it is largely just women that are being oppressed and controlled. And I never see this type of language policing for men, ever.  Anyway this doesn't mean I'm gender critical, my views aren't one or the other. I just wish you explored this problem a little more because it is the only one that keeps me on the fence."
"This is the second video of you i've ever watched. I had no idea you were trans. I thought you were a biological woman with a deeper voice than usual. I thought it was part of the whole 'character' and spirit of the channel to have that tone. ( I hope me saying that isn't offensive to you, i wouldn't want to hurt anyone in any case).  Anyway.. you are a biological legend and i adore your work."
"Brilliant."
"I was a bit of a fence-sitter and this video really helped answer some genuine questions I had that TERFs posed but never answered. The only thing I'm still confused on is what defines a woman, but idk if that'll be completely answered anytime soon. Awesome video, tysm!"
"Side note, what most TERFS see as clocking traits are many traits Jewish women and other poc women have and are highly racist, what TERFS see as normal wombyn traits are what a western European society pushes as its standard of what a woman is meant to be."
"this video makes really good points that i think most radfems who aren't terfs (i promise they exist) would probably agree with. to me, bio essentialist terfs are completely going against the whole point of gender abolitionism. claiming that womanhood means chromosomes and uterus is completely missing the key point that 'woman' is an essentially oppressive societal role, usually based on birth sex but also experienced by trans women. denying that is being blind to material reality. so to me, 'abolish gender' doesn't mean to make everyone into neutral beings, but to abolish the concept that your birth sex has any bearing on your personality and life."

And, like, I'm a cis woman so I'm pretty fucking sure I'm not the Gender Master here. My mom especially has been getting very curious and interested about trans people, sadly I missed most of my Queer Sunday School classes so I don't have all the answers.   I just watched your new video, and it pushed me into a rewatching binge. I noticed most, if not all, your videos have portuguese subtitles. So I shared your channel with my mom. She almost became a reactionary a few years back, was calling everyone a communist, a feminazi and etc, after a SHITTON of dialogue that only happened cuz she is an open person she is now chill. I'm glad I managed to help her get here, but I'm even happier YOU'LL be able to get her to places I can't, and understand ideas I'm not especially versed in. She liked your looks btw, thanks again philosophy queen"

"Watching videos like this support my convictions that everybody has a butthole deep in their soul. No one is ever above the pride that convinces people they are better in some arbitrary facet of life than any other people. It's TERFS accusing trans people they are tearing down a century of progress, or my Christian brothers and sisters telling themselves that they might be sinners but 'at least I'm not gay'. Honestly, the hatred we have for each other is just as illogical in light of our own shortcomings as the love we feel for other people in the face of their shortcomings."

"My first ContraPoints video and here are a few thoughts (feel free to tap out and the like button at any point in this comment):    0) The fact your subscribers don't exceed the population of 50% of the global population is bullshit. YOU ARE MY NEW FAVOURITE YOUTUBER.  1) You are hilarious. Witty, well-timed, densely layered, balanced against argument, fair. Just *MWAH*. As a stand-up geek, this is just brilliant. Your timing is natural, pointed and well spaced.  2) You're smart. Not smart in the 'I have more IQ points and I'm gonna bombard you till you become tired and agree' sense. Or the 'I'm not gonna argue with you as much as character assassinate you till anything you say is rendered invalid by being said by you' sense. Or any other than, 'here's an argument. I know arguments. I defend my links, premises, and conclusions. I know your argument. I know its flaws and its weaknesses in the thorough academic canon. I also know how to argue without being an arsehole.'  3) You know how political arguments work. They're designed to ask hard questions which are unanswerable rapidly. Bullshit is quick, insight is not. You know what to dismiss, what to take seriously, when to accept and when to avoid speaking altogether. That's rare. That takes a lot of practice and careful thought. Well done.  4) You know rhetoric, in its best possible form. You prefix your arguments well, suggesting a knowledge of the breadth of the topic and enhancing your own humility. You also know when to prefix with expertise, punchy arguments and humour to ingratiate your argument to the opponent.  5) You dismiss political buzzwords. Buzzwords like 'libtard, HAM, snowflake, Nazi, femiNazi, and especially TERF, etc.' aren't arguments. They're words, with implications and an efficient way to hurl an essay at someone else in a few guttural noises. You address them, not exploit them. You speak with them after clarifying their vague meanings. It's the best way to use them.   6) You know advanced logic and political fallacies from the 'gotcha' to the 'tirade of bullshit' to 'PRATT' to 'rhyme equals reason,' even if you don't name them. The moment where you addressed troll statements was textbook. You do better than that: you explain them and discredit them.  7) You know how to concede and agree. Frequently, some arguments are unwinnable. That isn't the fault of the defendant but the fault of the douchery of the person who said the argument. Like 'you should be working to abolish gender,' to which the response which you gave is perfect 'how in the fuck is one person supposed to do that? How am I to even answer that argumentatively? That burden of proof is excessive and no thanks.' It's endearing and to the careful eye shows far more insight than ignorance.  8) You know how to be reasonable. Your entire argument is both successful AND fair. I've trusted Trans dogma on the 'experiencing a female upbringing from afar.' Yet you give up on that and still argue insightfully. It's rare to wholly decisively win an argument without being an underhanded bastard.  9) You are so gorgeously well-read. Your referencing and quoting like an academic master. I love it. Sylvia Plath responded to clearly and objectively is just mood.  10) You know how to burn strawmen. You often say 'what I am not saying or am saying' which defuses reductionist responses so elegantly and rapidly.   11) You have such empathy for the otherside, which I am so thankful for.     *RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE*"
"If terfs don’t want to be called terfs then so be it, let’s just settle for bigots or transphobes  Call a spade a spade"
"Well as a Cincinnatian and a gamer I am offended     Seriously though great video as always"
"Hi, I really love your videos. I've been researching a lot into the whole radical feminism thing after being called a terf (for daring to state that penises are technically male sexual biology whether or not they belong to a woman... TO a trans woman who was saying that any of us lesbians who didn't want to have sex with her because of her penis were transphobic bigots). So. Learning lots about politics on that end of things, and of course your videos offer a really great insight into the trans side of the equation. I did want to point out though, from what I've learned about the whole 'abolish gender' thing, you did get it right that the idea is to do away with societal gender roles that say you can only express yourself the way you do if you take on the identity of a woman. It doesn't mean to remove all gender expression and stereotypes, but to remove them from their ruling position over the sexes.   Radical feminism states that you should have every right and freedom to be yourself completely as you are and still be able to categorize yourself as the male you were born as, just as anyone born a female should be free to express herself to the fullest extents of masculinity if desired (including breast removal and all of it) without having to renounce her status as female. I understand that it calls for a huge overworking of society and is way too enormous of an ambition to take place any time soon, but with the fervor that trans activists are pouring out and the real change they are affecting in society today to become accepted as their identified gender, I could see this goal happening pretty realistically. Imagine if, rather than butting heads with both trans and biological women fighting over the rights to be called a 'real woman,' both groups could join forces in solidarity for an outcome that would make everyone happy. Male and female, both free to live and express their lives as masculine or feminine as they desire without the social pressure (but still the freedom) to alter their bodies. Yes, new challenges would surely come with it, but when you already have people viciously attacking others for refusing to use 'she' instead of 'he' because language usage is so deeply ingrained in our society, it seems like an uphill battle either way."

"Great video, those TERF twitter comments on here are really eye-opening. I'm not too knowledgable about TERFS before, mostly the general things said about them or what they think about trans people, but those comments are truly disgusting   Also, this might be a call out but for anyone else in the comments, don't respond to the handle anonymous, they're a troll."
"Sometimes I wish we could just stop all of this labeling and isolation. People that usually like to categorise others and distance themselves because of 'unholy beliefs' can end up supporting the enemy"

"Call me crazy but isn't the fact these videos are so engaging and hilarious clearly evidence that they were created and produced by a man?"
"i unironically think contra looks like a guy, change my mind"
"aight no ones said this as far as im aware soo.. transmeds don't believe you need to hate yourself/ your body, you just need to feel uncomfortable or disconnected to your gender assigned at birth (aka gender dysphoria). they also think people who don't have GD shouldn't transition because they have no need to. everything else in the video so far ive agreed with, but saying that transmeds  think you need to hate yourself to be trans is simply false."
"It seems to me, and feel free to call me out if I am incorrect, but transphobia sounds like another form of misogyny. The brunt of the hate is directed at trans women (at least, from what I've seen.) I don't know very much about the subject, so excuse my ignorance, and feel free to educate me. I did enjoy the video."
"As a cis woman with man shoulders and man hands, I'd love to take a crack at these TERF's who imply that all women must be small and dainty."
"I think the only thing I agree with the 'gender critical' feminists about is that the trans community is extremely quick to label feelings of discomfort with your assigned gender as a sign that you are trans and should transition. Trans communities and issues tend to get a lot more visibility than non-binary ones -- and I think that it's unfortunate that many people experiencing some version of dysphoria aren't exposed to non-binary ideas because trans communities are (dare I say) over-zealous about welcoming new members into the group.    I know Natalie has said that the goals of non-binary activists are sometimes at odds with her own (i.e. throwing off gender roles completely vs. fitting into a different gender role than the one you were assigned), and I'm personally of the opinion that we as a society should ideally be moving toward the non-binary model. That said, I also like many things about being a woman, getting to dress up and wear makeup from time to time, and I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with liking to present in a very binary way. I simply think that non-binary, as well as femme-presenting men and butch-presenting women should receive equal airtime in the circles where people experiencing dysphoria go for help."
"PS You're transcendentally beautiful without makeup"
"love the #SMOKEYEYE  jus like ATHENA"
"It really bothers me that you largely dismiss the arguments by assuming they're not made in good faith. I genuinely have a hard time with trans folk who **don't have gender dysphoria** (incredibly important distinction) claiming that they're a different gender/agender because their interests line up more with the stereotypes of the other gender/no or both genders. This has seriously had an effect that I'm noticing in my every day life. I have several friends who now identify as nonbinary and they tell me that it's because they don't identify with society's idea of what it means to be a man/woman. What happened to saying fuck society and fuck stereotypes? Why are we not only allowing, but fighting for them to define our identities just as much as they ever have?   I'm also not making the argument that we should abolish all outward signs of gender and I really don't like the accusation that I'm saying these things because of some subconscious feeling of transphobia I have deep down inside of me... I don't feel that these concerns have anything to do with my opinion on the morality of identifying as a different gender. They're 100% about my hatred of stereotypes. I'd like it if my concerns could actually be addressed and I'd love it if they could be mitigated. All this video did was make me feel like she can't find an argument against this and had to resort to strawmanning it and dismissing it entirely."

"Comparing ‘terfs’ to race realists is just... disgusting. Comparing Nazis that think people should be demoted to sub humans for their melanin levels, and have fire bombed, lynched, and dragged people to death for questioning them to teen girls that say males are ugly online is just embarrassing. No hate crime has been tied to terfs. Not one. Though I have seen a couple videos of trans males attacking radfems at rallies (most notably a gma). She is right about the stolen valor thing, ‘these girls roasting me/using medical terms are as bad as skin heads’, how privileged can you be."
"Love from Cincinnati! Our chili is bomb though."
"Man that beginning quote and that Reddit posts were the most dehumanizing and most gross and nasty things I've ever heard. Didn't use any pronouns except it or didn't even entertain it with a '' for 'she'. To be honest, I don't understand why theyre so angry that someone identify as their gender or 'leaves' their gender as if they're a traitor of teammate . Do they ever think that having someone who is there unwilling is better than having someone who actually IS willing to be in their team? They scream you don't know what it's like but maybe they should stop screaming and try to get to know who the person they're screaming at and see how close they actually are or at least acknowledge them. Jesus Christ it's not a contest or being on teams shit."
"Abolishing gender bit was the funniest thing I've seen in months!!"
"Please watch this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s57T27M1ZXk    I wrote a huge reply but damn. damn. People like this fuel genocide.... help."
"'Female only space.' Oh shit you booted yourself off your own video, man."
"Sorry but transwoman are not real woman and no amount of satire is going to change that  fact! Go ahead and call me a terf and the usual names, we cannot allow real women to be erased!"
"What if I'm non binary? do i still get to watch the video? I'm scared. I've paused the video for 5 days because i don't know. Please help and respond."
"That's exactly my present experience... .femmephobia...  everywhere. rampant."
"oh another good reason not to transition I'm tired of people leaving comments on my appearance instead of addressing my arguments ALREADY why invite more in?"
"I tend to agree with Germane Greer. Read her books. Female Eunuch was sensational when it came out, and she shouldn't be ignored even now. ."
"You broke the mold for trans women, drag queens, tranny porn stars and tranny hookers.  You’re very bright, intellectually attractive  and you’ve got great entertainment skills.  You’ve got great opportunities and adventures ahead.  For a woman you look terrific.  We are all different and you use your differences like a sword rather that a liability.  I can’t even imagine the difficulties you had to face head on to find just where you belong in our world.  You can be proud because you make the world a better place.  I don’t know you but I’d be proud to have you as a friend..."
"Can we get a 'Your utopian pipe dream is valid' t-shirt???"
"funny watching someone who denies science trying to lecture 'science deniers' what a joke."
"A phobia is an irrational fear of something. Disgust at a delusional person is not fear. It is just that-disgust. No matter how many delusional people voice their support, shout me down or whatever you are a MAN. A very seriously disturbed man. Sexual mutilation will not change that. The fact is you KNOW it on a deep level even if you will never admit it. It is not loving to say I support you. I don’t. What is loving is to say you and everyone that thinks they are something they are not need serious help. A person thinking they are a giraffe doesn’t make it real anymore than a man who thinks he’s a woman or a woman who thinks she’s a man makes it so."
"I still have a few doubts, but this video was very clarifying. Thanks! I hope you make more like this if any other topics come up."
"Your videos are so interesting. They're really helpful for me as a cis person to learn more about the trans community and what being trans is like. Especially since one of my friends came out to me as nonbinary earlier this week, so I think it's important for me to educate myself, not just to be knowledgable, but to support my friend."
"Hey! You mentioned my hometown and that makes me feel special!"
"Darling I just started actually watching your videos and you are incredible. You have no idea how much your videos help the people who watch them"
"I want to make clear that I am wholly supportive of people who experience and live a trans identity or lifestyle.  Here's the 'but' that I've discovered is a contentious position. I believe gender should cease to exist in society. This doesn't mean everyone becomes expressionless robots, but that any person should be able to present themselves in any way they prefer, with no expectation that their sex ought to conform to a certain presentation. This includes a person's preference to modify their body to present themselves as they would like. I've been told that my position invalidates trans people's experience, but I disagree. I feel that my belief that gender roles, norms, and stereotypes should be abolished would alleviate gender dysphoria, eliminate the concept of 'transitioning' in a binary as a necessity, and reduce the pressure that some trans women feel to present themselves in a hyperfeminine way that goes beyond their preferred expression. A man or woman should be able to wear a dress, grow a beard, wear lipstick, get jacked, be a homemaker, and carry a pretty pink purse if that's what suits them. They should be able choose to go fully in the direction of what are currently deemed feminine/masculine aesthetics and roles, regardless of sex, and have no fear of being seen as insufficient or 'not passing' because there should be nothing to pass as. I don't believe I'm at odds with the current transgender community, but I've seen some people express that they believe I am. I don't consider myself to identify as a gender. I'm biologically male, I'll wear either gender's clothing, sometimes I wear eye makeup, I love flowing skirts, but that's the one piece that I prefer not to express with because the uncomfortability of social mockery outweighs the comfort of expression."
"A great video by any metric, and should be required viewing for anybody with an excess of confidence in the fitness and merit of their conceptions.  I would like to put in, if I may, that my experience of TERFs is quite different than Ms. Wynn's, and that if I had to make a general observation it would be that they seem for the most part to be TRANS MEN IN DENIAL.  By all appearances, they see their femaleness strictly in terms of the genitalia (and attendant hormones, social expectations, prejudice &c.) with which they have been saddled, for which they feel nothing but disdain.  They resent cis men, on the one hand, for their ability to exist without such sordid encumbrance, and trans women—on the other—both for actually WANTING such a burdensome equipage and for never having been subject to the stigma and liability attendant upon it.  To be clear, I wouldn't dispute whether there are other types of TERFs.  I submit only what I have observed, and what it seems to suggest in terms of their motivations."
"Fantastic job again, Natalie. It’s so obvious that you put in so much effort for your videos in order to educate in the most whimsical, enthusiastic, cynical way possible. You have an insane talent. ❤️❤️❤️"
"Thank you so much for this. Openly engaging issues in this way is the only way to move society forward, and I so wish more people could do this. I must admit to honestly having had some of these reactions and I appreciate you addressing them in such a thoughtful and compassionate way. Sometimes we just need to be called out on our privilege or inability to see the struggle of others, but it's hard to hear that when you feel like you need to defend your own struggle. You nailed it.  I feel like this happens in abundance these days and this video is the antidote. Also, you are brilliant and I love everything about you."
"You need as a university professor to speak. I'm serious. Few people can make such a presentation of the material and so in detail and openly tell all about it. And while making it so that people understand it all."
"I agree with everything, except for your arguments at concern 3, abolish gender. As identifying as non-binary (or just human...), this is crucial for me.  You just joked around about this, not taking it seriously, wich is quite disrespectful to non-binary people really, and also harmful for the feminist movement in general.   Your only real argument to not do more about it, is basically that it's too hard and utopian? So we shoud like... not act like anti rascists because it's utopian to have a society without racism? That's lazy thinking. We should do everything we can, even if we can never experience the ideal society, because that will probably never happen in our lifetime. Doesn't mean things can't be a lot better. It already IS a lot better, more and more people dare to dress non conforming and have the hobbies and lifestyles they want. There seems to be a lot more non-binary people popping up everywhere. People who just don't care that they will be misgendered, because whatever someone call you, it's going to be the wrong description anyway. There's really only two areas where it's important to adress someone by which genitals they may have: Doctors office, and sometimes dating, really.   I'm not saying specifically binary trans people have to be in the front of this movement, they have enough problems already and I support people to dress and act and live as they please. But to not do more about it as a society, is my problem. Especially when it comes to for example raising children, advertisement, or in creating norms and spaces."
"This honest might be my favourite Contrapoints video But I also can’t watch it because it makes me too angry 😂"
"y'know what really fucks me up about terfs? if a trans woman is too feminine, she's 'just copying harmful stereotypes to pretend to be a woman',  if she's too masculine she's 'not even trying to be a woman', a bitch can't catch a break"
"Brilliant!"
"Woman hatred through and through.  How anybody can sit through the rants of a crazy crossdressing narcissist is a mystery to me, but then again some people enjoy watching car wrecks and fires."
"i was actually expecting an anti-radical feminist video, because, well, radical (which is mostly and associated with terfs, i sadly say as a radfem myself) and liberal feminism are kind of opposing theories that tend to bash each other, but i LOVED it, only tackling the gross, exacerbated and ridiculous TERF arguments, and is also inviting to a discussion about what it means to be a woman socially, psychologically and biologically, from all these feminist perspectives. it's just AWESOME"
"You should do a talk with an actual gender critical feminist. There's a good subreddit called 'gcdebatesqt' and it's full of respectful, fruitful discussion. Yes, there are hateful transphobes hiding behind some platitudes, but that isn't the entirety of the GC feminist movement. Even if some the rhetoric is hard to hear, I find that when  both parties are respectful of each other it isn't nearly as hateful as you make it out to be.   You kind of engage in some gender critical points, but a lot of it is still well poisoning, and positioning of feminists as being shallow bigots. They are not.   I generally support you, and what you do. But I think some real engagement would be really good."
"Funnily enough, I wouldn't say I have experienced any female related trauma despite being cis female, I grew up around respectful people.  So should I be denied relating to other women?"
"Do you ever think about the idea that if you ever raise children you're beginning the formation of a person that you won't see the result of because they'll likely outlive you. It's Bizzare."
"A pair of boobs on Channel 2 news boobishly informed us that Chelsea Manning was a 'former intelligence analyst.'  Breaking news, boobs, Spec 4s don't analyze shit."
"'Throwing glitter spaghetti against the wall and hoping for some glimmer of femininity' is one of the best written lines of this episode."
"The opening is correct. Transgenders hardly ever work normal jobs. All these evil straight white cis men are building up society around you leftists while you leftists try to tear it down.  Transwomen are not women. Transwomen are transwomen. Keep winning all sports awards in womens sports, yet claiming theres no advantage."
"❤❤❤❤❤"
"NAT'S LAUGH OMG AW"
"I’m trying to play Assassin’s Creed and listen to this insightful video when #yesallgamers came up.  Please don’t take my PS4 all mighty Contrapoints"
"where can i find those testimonies of ex identified gender critical women, pls?"
"ACKTUALLY KROPOTKIN-"
"Does your belief on transitioning apply to gender fluid identities and the like. You mentioned how you transitioned not because you felt as though you were born female but just because you felt more female in your later life. Would that be the same if someone didn’t feel as though they were a boy one day and a girl the next since they were born, or would it be different because it’s a different identity?"
"What is that cleavage?"
"I love your hat!!!"
"Nothing is wrong with saying that gender is a social construct, an idea that is also supported by the bigoted binary normies. Cool thing to reinforce gender roles. Women are/behave like this and men are/behave like that. That is so 10000 BC. Discrimation is of course shit. Everyone should be and act however they want to regardless of their sex."
"'bah-lonced' 😆   Yeah, keep the chonj"
"The part that always got me was the idea that one could know what it is to feel like the opposite sex in order to say you feel like a man/woman.  Poor ole trans men, they quite often pass, and realise male privilage is the privilage to stand at the back, in silence."
"I understand the want for trans people to dress like the gender they are identifying as (even if sometimes it's to a cartoonish degree) but then what is the rebuttal to the sub sects of the most recent waves of feminism that actively oppose traditional gender norms (in terms of clothing, make-up, etc)?  I get the point that right-wing people who use the argument generally don't care about modern feminist clothing and beauty standards, but shouldn't trans people be more vocal about it too? The two ideals are complete opposites but I only ever see trans people pointing out the trolling about modern feminist ideas from the right and never being critical of the feminists themselves."
"this absolute queen.. what an ending"
"I think the closest I ever came to being a TERF was in sharing similar views to yours around gender metaphysics. I don't believe in gender essentialism, including essentialism that accommodates trans identities (e.g. female brain vs. male brain stuff). I drifted to TERFdom briefly by over-emphasizing the importance of this abstract belief, but then I realized quickly how insignificant this point was compared to the real-life violence and oppression faced by trans people, which deserved far more consideration. Who am I to tell trans people they're wrong for not embracing gender non-essentialism when no one else even does? I'm sure they don't have the time. Plus, I wasn't being respectful to those who do have essentialist philosophies around gender (e.g. spiritual beliefs).  All in all, I still hold the personal belief that non-essentialist definitions of identity are no less valid or 'real', and that embracing this idea would ultimately put less pressure on people who are trying to find themselves (generally speaking). But there is no reason to criticize trans feminism over that whatsoever. And TERFdom was a totally dumb place to look for that philosophy anyway.  Edit: also thought it was worth mentioning that radfem stance on porn and sex work, as a former sex worker, drew me into TERFdom first. I think a lot of feminists fall into it that way too. Btw I hope all this rambling is okay as a very late response to your initial request for former TERFs to come out of the woodwork."
"I transitioned from male to female. Now Im considering transitioning from Conservative to Liberal."
"ignore this 7:50 8:35 9:38 11:00 11:40 15:00"
"Wayyy too smart & articulate for me.  I hope we never meet so my heart & mind don't get utterly deconstructed. (But then again, very interesting & fun to watch!)"
"Thank you for actually addressing these questions! I've always legitimately wanted the answers and I appreciate it!"
"It annoys the hell out of me when people act like there are *no* reproductive rights concerns for trans women, when an enormous number of jurisdictions explicitly or implicitly require that trans women be sterile in order to have their gender legally recognized. (Trans men too, which means they kind of get the full spread of threats to their reproductive rights.)"
"Okay more smiling bloopers like at the end, please. I love seeing you smile and look happy and we only get the barest glimpses of it in your (excellent) videos!"
"oh shoot im lesbiab"
"I'm transmasc and my aunt called a trans kid an it. I don't think I'll be able to come out any time soon."
"<3 Love you"
"Okay I love your videos hon and lord do they give me strength.  Lot of good points in your video as always but you leave Cincinnati chilli out of this! Only good thing about my home state is the chilli."
"I would love for Nathalie to share her thoughts on trans women in female sport, that's where my inner radfem comes crawling out.. Educate me please!"
"Comment"
"thank you so much for hosting a dialogue with a dizzying amount of nuance and perspectives. thoroughly enjoyable. *subscribes*"
"Aren't human hands supposed to have knuckles?"
"luggsurree[unintelligible]"
"What TERFs hate is men, they don't see a trans person as a trans person, they see a transwoman as a man trying to invade female spaces and they view transmen as women trying to gain male privilege. It is misandry that ultimately underlies their hatred, and probably would be better to convince those individuals that men aren't bad in the first place that they'd have to worry about people they see as men invading women spaces."
"Hey Natalie, I really enjoy your video essays, thank you for the time you put into them. Do you think it would be possible to time stamp your Chapters? I want to relisten to some parts but I binged out on you (post James Mansfield collab) and now I have no idea which video i need to go back to. I know it's a pain in the ass but i feel like it might help people to reference your work correctly in the future. x"
"Back in the early 2000s I read a lot of cyberpunk novels. I tried to image what weirdo reactionary groups would come to be in the future. I was sure it would be some kind of biological conservative movement. One that denied the humanity of things like cyborgs, AI, etc. The newer Dues Ex games touch on this a bit. But here we are, in 2019, and the big new reactionary groups are ones clutching their pearls over biological purity. The only thing we got wrong was they care about what gentiles you have instead of how much of your body is robotic."
"Not gonna lie, I totally didn't realize that Natalie used to be a guy."
"I remember reading about Stephanie passing away and the beautiful things her family had to say about her. I am so glad you brought up such an iconic Queen!"
"so fucking smart. such a good fucking content on the whole channel. so fucking funny and at the same time spreading important messages. so fucking gorgeous and so many nice outfits, I mean... girl, you totally rock! Just ''discovered'' your channel and I'm already in love."
"I don't think they meant 'menstruators' as a derisive term, but simply as people who menstrate, since people past menopause and children wouldn't be the ones tweeting their receipts for tampons (unless they were purchasing for someone else) because they don't menstrate and thereby wouldn't be buying pads/tampons, meaning that they wouldn't be affected by the Tampon Tax and that Planned Parenthood tweet wasn't meant for them.  What a mess of a sentence that was."
"31:54 The delivery of this final line is so brilliant, and I absolutely love it."
"Even in robot mode, you're such a woman."
"Most transphobes can't even spell the word 'nuance,' let alone know what it means."
"Hey Lady Man! You sure would Dig, my series on the ANIMA ANIMUS. I spent years sexing up Crossdressers & entering their Subconscious to UNDERSTAND how this Left / Right Brain thing works in GENDER + THE THIRD EYE> NEXT LEVEL BABY! I adore your style. Let them eat Cake, Killer Queen! (Mr.+Mizz Mercury)"
"Natalie, you look stunning in this video"
"I don’t agree with you on some things, but I can’t deny that this was super entertaining and interesting.  Subscribed 👍🏻"
"Great video. I have been curious about a lot of this. Thanks for making this. Be whoever you want to be :D my partner is a bit narc cis male at times only since a male friend he was close to tried something on him. It upsets me he has become somewhat phobic of anyone in the community (one of my best friends is fluid and one of the most pure hearted amazing people i have ever met) and as a woman who's always identified as pan orientation wise  (and total misconception that having kids changes my orientation i'm attracted to people based on who someone is and how we connect not what ever they identify is) i hate stereotypes omg yes! as a parent this stuff is so important to learn more about from every side. thank you. i want to be able to fully support both my kids if they ever want to identify as not what they were born as 'scientifically'  if they go through anything in life that makes them feel that this is who they are, and teach them to be accepting of everyone for who they are and respectful. I cried when one of my friends told me some bullying they experienced.  Keep up the informative content please. thank you. your videos are important i'm mother of a currently cis preschooler and cis girl unless either decide they are opposite of that and I want to let them know that I love them for who they are and they can be whoever they want to be.   I will have to watch this more than once to remember all this info but your video is great. A friend mentioned your channel so I'm glad to be here watching <3   I saw Kim when she was here in australia! i adore her !  Look even some cis women aren't stereotypically 'feminine ' so i find this really woahhh to be learning,  so backwards if people feel that way. i find it sad :("
"Wait you just dissed Cincinnati chili. That’s wrong."
"Great costumes."
"the gong is the peak of comedy i haven't laughed this hard in a WHILE"
"Transwomen are biologically male. That is an objective statement of scientific reality. Anyone who doesn't think so isn't living in the real world."
"'Is Anita Bryant even dead? Scholars remain divided.' LOL!"
"You are solid gold 😂😂😂 👍🏻💜"
"Omg I loved your like main outfit(the red one) it is just simple enough that it isn't too much And the hat reminds me of like old movies with those certain women (I have no idea how to describe and if you can't tell I have a horrible vocab with clothes)"
"Can I stay? I am a gay boi and I just wanna hear the tea tbh"
"You honestly look feminine to me even without makeup"
"Don't be a twat, you are as disgusting as I am, angel %~€"
"Was that you on k?? Wow! Pure art!"
"Lol my gf"
"OMG, speaking of Ombre lipstick, your makeup is 'extra' in the BEST of ways!  Eye makeup has stymied me throughout my 20s and 30s, but blended lipstick is something I have been able to manage, and yours is GORGEOUS!   Also, legit every point i can understand/commiserate on as a cis-female and for those I can't (because not trams-female) #support and #love"
"i don't think it should be people with prostates i think it should be prostate possessors"
"On the point of giving birth being hyper feminine, I think as someone who is 23 and had to have a hysterectomy,  I was forced to see a different perspective early and i am thankful for that. I have never wanted kids and I have had multiple older women tell me that if I dont have kids I wont have meaning. So thats fun.   I'm enjoying your videos so much. Thanks for sharing"
"Go trans and allies!! :)"
"Newfound Trans woman here who just had a major falling out with his CIS terf sister. This video was exactly what I needed to hear! This was so cathartic! Thank you so much! You've got a subscriber for life now"
"whoa whoa whoa. Wait. There r trans. Guys? What? Impossible. Sounds fake but okay"
"I'm a straight male and stayed for the conversation. Very interesting."
"CINCINNATI CHILI IS GREAT YOU SHUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL MOUTH"
"The thing that make me the most angry is that the academia always said that gender don't exist and that its a social construction, but now that rad feminists are saying that too, the trans comunity started to freak out"
"You should bring trans people that detransitioned"
"so when a terf says T-women are not women. are you lumping them all together as a monolith or are they varied and nuanced like trannies? Maybe they are using metaphorical language to describe the very argument you use in concern 3 in regards to socialisation. MtF trans are not the same as women because fundamentally they have very different childhood experiences. That alone serves to prove that although some TERFS are mean calling trans folks it. Doesn't mean they are all immoral or disrespectful towards trans folk. They just don't believe they are the same as women. Which YOU FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE. Also.. sad that people are afraid to say your attractive in public but they say it in private? How tf do you know that though? I think you are attractive.... but you dont know i wouldnt say in IRL and if I didn't it wouldnt be a result of stigma, it's a result of women assuming every compliment from a guy is a sexual move to get in her pants. SO... yeah lets talk about MGTOW lol you legit cant compliment women. Unless you are in a direct conversation which they initiated, it is extremely scary and anxiety inducing to try and communicate with any person, let alone a lady and tell them you are attracted to them. The fuck... I am recieving mixed messages from the women IRL and the women online and the transwomen. I think you are all different and its too confusing to work out anymore. I just want my ex back but being calle da fag my whole youth i hypermasculined my way out of that relationship. THANKS SOCIETY :) Good vid though. Go Contrapoints"
"I felt that concern 1 was poorly answered."
"Also intersex people exist and are way more plentiful than society would have us think. Any exclusionary language in unproductive/ damaging to multiple groups."
"Read the comments for instant death"
"I'd like to hear more on your perspective as a trans woman! I suppose if I were to ask a question, it would be about what you really believe gender is. Perhaps this is something you've spoken about before, and if so, I apologize. And I only ask this to you, not because I think you contradict gender, but because you pursued your gender. Most of my and my peer's relationship with gender is something along the lines of 'Roll with what you got and see where you go,' but I think you could potentially provide a much more specific understanding. Thanks! :)"
"YOU SHALL NEVER PASS"
"What confuses me about all the talking 'gender critical' feminists do about how it's totally obvious that trans women aren't 'real' women just from looking at them is that I'm biologically female and have always identified as female and yet at multiple points throughout my life, I've been mistaken for a male based on my manner of dress, the length of my hair, rather or not I'm wearing makeup, how my makeup is done, how I carry myself, etc. but if anyone was to imply that the fact that I could be mistaken for a male at times when I was not overtly presenting as a traditional female meant that I wasn't a 'real' woman those same 'gender critical' feminists would come to my defense and be furious on my behalf."
"I had a joke about this, something about Germaine Greer learning to catch waves, but I forgot it.  I think the punchline was something about a 'surfin' TERF.'"
"fuck u ilysm"
"I was really disappointed when I saw r/gendercritical linked by a moderator on one of my anarchist subreddits. Leftists need to have more animosity toward idiotic people who are also on the left but completely wrong in different ways. Love this vid."
"Germaine Greer should be retroactively disowned by every single person on this planet who considers themselves a feminist. No one who honestly gives a shit about humanity and equality would ever describe another person as an it.  Yah that was a comment heavy on morals and light on aesthetic. But I'm irate af."
"A mentally retarded dude who pretends to be a woman is trying to deconstruct gender? How fucking original. Only self-absorbed useful idiots would get convinced by this 33 minute video of pure shit."
"I love everything about this video. I don’t understand terfs/transphobes, what gets my ick Factory is what the do mostly to trans women, it’s cringy and gross. I am not threatened in any way by another woman no matter how they became one, why should I be, I haven’t heard a good reason yet. In fact if I don’t have to I won’t say “trans” woman. It’s also mystifying how forgotten “trans” men are, as if they are inconvenient to the haters “truth” (that’s a lot of scare quotes lol). I can’t imagine most of what I loved through as a lil girl being even as close to as difficult as it would be to transition, and there was some really shitty things, but those were brief and I wasn’t forced to live it every day all day. Also I have to say I wish I was single and you dated women 😉"
"That headdress tho my gawd someone mod that into every game ever."
"What is that word she is using at when she says 'Just seems a little ... and i don't like things that are ...' at 13:05"
"I’m not sure how I found you, but I just couldn’t stop listening. You’re intelligent, eloquent, witty and pretty. You have a new subscriber 🙏"
"this format is absolute genius. brilliant, nuanced arguments cloaked in gorgeous aesthetics and a soothing tone  ==> changing minds faster than was ever possible before.  I learn so much from every new video (I took one GWS class, so it's not like i have no experience with the theories but I'm no pro) and love how you point out the problems with dogma while giving the context that the dogma came from so people don't just turn around and become dogmatic anti-dogmatists. Unfortunately, easy on the eyes and the ears means easy on the mind, but thankfully we have you to use those powers for good."
"Corona Premier, eh?  I would have assumed the TERF beer of choice was Dos Equis."
"I just stumbled onto this video. Love it!  Greetings from Stockholm."
"If appearing like a woman isn't what you're saying makes you a woman than what is it that makes you a woman? What is it that you can now do that you couldn't do before that means you are now a woman? Just like the cosmetic definition of gender any other definition than biological sex people will take issue with.   'Femphobia' is rooted in misogyny? What you were talking about here doesn't hurt women at all, and plenty of very feminine women have this phobia.   The whole 'trans women being feminine is bad, trans women being masculine is bad' point you made was really a strawman. People who think this think trans women being caricatures of women is bad, and trans women being biologically male is bad; not a contradiction.   Best wishes."
"TERFs: I will not be reduced to simply someone who bleeds!!!   Also TERFs: Trans women aren't women because they don't bleed!!!"
"soo.. this isn't about super contra is it?"
"These videos are so pleasing to my eyes  You are beautiful"
"““I want to understand where people are coming from,” she says. “I don’t just want to nail my mind shut and say whoever disagrees is coming from some inexplicable evil.“” and that’s why you actually fucking talked to and/or fucking debated with somebody who you deemed “TERFS(or whatever I think you also called them SERFS at one point, I just can’t keep track of all these goddamn fucking SJW buzzwords you leftists shit out these says)” in this fucking video instead of literally PLAYING THE FUCKING ROLE A A STRAWMAN and......................................................literally debating you in a fucking costume playing the most caricatured, stereotyped fucking version of a fucking TERF(SERF, again, I really just do not for the life of me fucking know) that you could possibly fucking play.........................................................................................................I don’t even fucking have any smartass things to say at this fucking point, you’re just a fucking goddamned fucking hypocrite."
"So I'm just finding your channel and am currently on a binge. I think you make excellent points and have provided a perspective that I wasn't aware of, and your delivery is pretty hilarious. Also, not that it matters, but I think you're so beautiful and your makeup in all the videos I've seen so far is amazing."
"Laughing and nodding my head off during the Video and then crying at the end. Thank you, lots of Love!"
"i’m not sure whether it’s a compliment or not, but I didn’t realise you were trans for a really long time! You’re stunning and your style is iconic and i’m not gonna deny my small crush on you :)"
"I don't even try to analyze my gender, I just experience it fluidly. I've heard accusations of trying to take advantage of 'the best of both worlds'. And..... so? So what? It's the best of me in any case. Should I feel bad because others have limited their human experience within rigid confines of gender, based on their reproductive organs and bone structure? Nope. No thanks. You couldn't pay me enough."
"Thank you for providing a platform for me to confront my internalized transphobia."
"whenever I watch contrapoints, i have to have the dictionary tab open to look up the meaning of words because im stupid"
"23:09   Maybe if you weren’t raised with our “Chili” it’s less likely you’ll “get it”?  😱 Actually I’m always just a little surprised whenever I hear non-locals acknowledge Cincinnati’s existence."
"Muh feminism, its about equality, except for trans women... because muh feminism"
"Kind of wish you mentioned even if very shortly that this TERF disgust with transwomen, all the hairy paw and stubble stuff, largely comes from their visceral hatred towards men. I know as a feminist you need to frame their position as reasonable and coming from their lived experiences etc.  Still, if one makes the mistake of reading these subreddits, it becomes quite evident very quickly."
"Even Turfs are the fault of man. Men must literally be what hopped out of Pandora's box I guess sense every problem boils down to men. I am a lefty but every day I feel myself getting more resentful. 'Well it isn't about you but the biggots' won't change how critical my fellow lefts are of me or credentials needed to be accepted. No matter how I behave I will always just be simplified down to my gender's worst examples or corkboarded and red stringed on how indirectly this is men's fault. Thus my fault. All problems are men's fault I suppose. 'Doesn't matter who is transphobic all that matters who maybe invented it... MEN!' I am tired of feelin' like a villian. I don't need a group for self loathing or accepting the stigmatic demonization of my demographic, singled out of conversations, or have my demographic's issues ignored or told 'it is men's fault so yours' Of course not you but men... But expect it being thrown in your face nontheless... Because men did it. But I am suppose to empathize with the blanketed animosity I get because it is woke. MAYBE it was men who did just everything wrong. But I am not *THOSE* men.. so why should I put up with this? I might hop out of this 'accepting and inclusive' movement. One so obsessed with pointing a finger to some one.. Preferably male.  Peace out and excuse my rugid good looks."
"Natalie (or anyone else widely-read), do you have a shortlist of essential literature on all issues feminist, gender and trans?  I am not afraid of academic textbooks (having to read everything from medieval theology to neuroscience for my PhD), but I have been underwhelmed by the circle-jerking jargon of Judith Butler, critical theory etc. It's not so much I disagree with them but that I'm unsure what's the exact argument and what to do with it. Are there good introductions to the key issues with solid, transparent argumentation and preferrably an illuminating empirical dimension (in the broad humanities/historical sense, not necessarily experimental)?"
"As always, amazing <3"
"I love you."
"thats.......not what a transmedicalist is....."

"Identify as what you want, but be aware that if an emergency surgeon needs to save your life, he or she (they're usually not as nuts as you) needs to know _what_ you are _biologically._ If you would _insist_ on being 'a whamman' on the operating table, it might even be your last wish because biology makes _clear distinctions_ between the sexes."
"I definitely support trans rights and I'm strongly affirming of transgender women (assigned male at birth) but just because I don't agree with all the current rights and requests of transgender men (assigned female at birth) and/or non-binary people I've been accused of being a TERF and not intersectional. I disagree, I'm very much an intersectional feminist, I just question some of the agendas and topics put forth by the modern-day transgender community/movement."
"This was fantastic. I didn't even know I needed this info but it was funny and informative and I want to learn more. Thank you for all you do!"

"makeup or very little makeup, you always look amazing and lovely, natalie! As always great job on your essay, it was thought-provoking, vindicating, and comforting for me to watch. I always feel safe watching your videos even when they're dealing with 'touchy' subjects that I would otherwise be scared to broach in public. Anyway I hope you have a nice day!"
"Very informative. I'd actually wondered about the answers to some of those questions myself, so it was good to get your perspective on the nuanced answers."
"*bangs gong*  H O W   I S   S H E   T H O ?"
"This video is probably the most informative I've seen about trans issues and I appreciate the attention to detail with addressing points. That being said maybe you or someone in the comments and answer this question for me.   I understand that gender dysphoria is a very real  thing. My question is why is the primary remedy (as far as I'm aware) making external changes to the body to reflect a certain mental state when we could instead allow the mind to become comfortable and accepting of the body it's in? I mean I can understand that traditional ideas of what men and women should be would be off putting to someone who feels that they are more in touch with the opposite gender to their own but I feel like that's more of an issue with societies representation of gender rather than a justification to reassign yourself to better fit those representations. I can't help but think that if just being called sir could ruin your day then addressing your brains ability to accept it's body should take priority over extensive surgery and hormone treatments for what is ultimately a cosmetic change. If wearing a dress and putting on make up as a man makes you feel more comfortable I'm all for it, I just think that unnecessary surgery isn't great for your body. Again I don't know if this is discussed during consultations before transitioning but anyone wanna clear this up for me? Contributions much appreciated."

"As an Australian, I have to deal with these shitheads all throughout our academia which Greer basically stole a million bucks out of with the help of Sheila Jeffreys.   I find it funny how people accuse the '''liberal media''' is somehow magically on our side when Australia and the UK feel the desperate need to host Greer on every type of commentary panel every time she alternates whatever habitat she feels will give her the most money and the most attention at whatever time of the year.  And how many Australian faces of the trans community that are actually educated and have something to say about politics and are routinely asked to comment about any sort of issues in the world or domestically?  ... Um .... Cate McGregor?   I mean she was a Colonel and Group Captain in the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, and the Director of the Army Land Warfare Studies Centre ... She got an Order of Australia for her services at the LWS Centre so she's gotta be smart about certain things...   And that's great... finally out trans women talking about all sorts of stuff other than being trans! We're also normal people with normal careers and career projectories and experiences! -- But not a whole lot of trans faces at all.... Shitload of transphobes in academia and journalism though -- making money exclusively by being transphobic, and nothing else.  Actually having read some of Cate McGregor's stuff and she's a great scholar of military science and was an effective director at the ALWSC. That being said, problematically Catherine McGregor could be described as conventionally conservative. Which is -- not great. And probably explains why the media glommed onto her as opposed to letting her slide into obscurity as simply a strategist, director and PR consultant in the Army and RAAF.  That being said -- what, exactly, does a Sheila Jeffreys or Germaine Greer actually bring other than transphobia to any sort of political discussion?"
"No one gives a fuck what you do, 'trans'.  You just can't force people to abandon their perception of reality and buy into your delusion and hysteria.  Normal people don't have time or patience for that shit."
"For me exploring these ideas, I want to know why a person wants to pass as the gender opposite to their sex. Why do they care? And why do people care about preventing others from doing that?  But a big concern I have is when people don't seem able to define what a man or woman is. Because how does somebody ever know that they aren't a man, or a woman, or even neither? Its like everybody is given permission to define their own personal truth, their own definitions of 'man' and 'woman'. And only then do they decide whether they fit into one or neither category.  I think the convention that a man is an adult male person, and a woman is an adult female person is very useful. Some people may be dissatisfied with societal expectations and connotations but at least we know what the words mean.   And it might be a storm in a teacup, except a lot of angst and pain and doubt is being generated because people are unsure of their gender. And no wonder. There is literally no way to answer them except by pointing to volatile cultural references about how males and females relate to the rest of society. And people wallow in this mess. And I don't think it needs to be that complicated.  I am sure there would still be a lot of people struggling with their identity no matter how we approach it. But I think clearing up the language and terminology of man and woman, and grounding it in the biological convention, will help people to comprehend and communicate their experiences much better."
"To me it really seems to be a junction of language colliding with personal truths. Language necessitates that people agree upon what words mean. Personal truths is where definitions get to fluctuate. I honestly think that's where all the tension stems from. Personally I am not a fan of personal truths, I think absolute truths are real, they can be known and they matter. And I am particularly fussy about words having defined meanings, because discussions and disagreements don't matter if we don't know what the words mean.  Also while I want to be agreeable and generally will cooperate with people on requested pronouns, this video made a very good point: Using requested phrases would make me an accomplice to legitimising something I don't agree with. At least not yet. I think using language in a way I find in-congruent is the main thing that concerns me. But to reiterate I also think a lot of people are hating themselves because they are confused about things that have not grounding and have no answer."

"The only thing that offended me in this video was the low blow at Cincinnati. I love my city and I love my chili."
"You are everything. Thanks so much for your brilliant creativity and super smart smarts. And your makeup is on point:)"
"I've genuinely had the comment from a TERF saying 'TiM sex offenders should be sent to male prisons because being convicted as women endangers other women in prison'. How do you even respond to that? Invalidating a whole group of people because a handful are criminals? How does one reason with that?"
"Dont listen to the haters dude. It takes a real man to put your balls on the line like this mate. Whatever people say you're one of the bravest chaps on the internet. Congrats mate, keep dressing like a woman if it gets you off. It's your life man, live it how you want."
"Trans women arent women.   Deep down you all know I'm right."
"You looked super beautiful at 10:44. ♥"
"1) I don't care at all what you do with your body or with your legal gender status and name, as long as you don't demand that people call you made up pronouns. 2) If your *sex* is not female I would not make out with you or have any other kind of sexual relationship, even if everything else would fit. You are not a women in that sense to me.     Not sure what to do about that... Is that ok?"
"Can we just talk about how beautiful the moments when she cracks herself up are?"
"Very good!"
"You are amazing! You break down concepts in such a comprehensive and witty way and its enthralling. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"Jesus Christ, you’re fucking brilliant...."
"Hi there,   Serious inquiry: Why trans woman and trans man and not woman and man? Is the goal to be different or the same?   Thanks,"
"This man will never be a woman. But we can pretend if you want."
"I think you're a super hot chick! I don't care what those radfems say! Thanks for telling us your story <3"
"Yes your beauty is incandescent.  Also this was kind of sweet,  but also hilarious (love all your personas) and as you said, nuanced, to actually argue their points, allowing that some might have been attracted to the movement by those points and not necessarily by hate.  You rock."
"I would really love to see a discussion between you and Magdalen Berns."
"excuse my ignorance, thank you for clearing up my misconceptions"
"that trans woman literally knows no shit about gender criticism. she only disinforms and desconceptualizes many terms gender critical women have used in their literature. i would gently ask you to search on your own about radical feminism and its purposes instead of keeping up the idea that this video or twitter makes you conclude. radical feminism was born between 60's and 70's, not yesterday.   just because she looks wow stunning, funny and charming and the most special precious thing on the world shouldn't be a reason to believe every word she says. be careful."
"Some people in the comment section sound like they could really use a tongue pop. Or two. Dosage varies based on the severity of TERF cases."
"If women being oppressed by men was a real thing, I'd appreciate the politics of feminism but culture (all cultures) inclusive of matriarchal ones are co-created by women and men. Perhaps Trans people might be able to claim oppressive victimhood but Germain Greer certainly not. Its past time for the Myth-Making of feminism to be dropped. It only destructively divides our culture, same as ethno-nationalism."
"viztroy"
"As a non-binary person I appreciated the abolish gender thing. I mean I do want to abolish the gender binary but that doesn't mean people have to stop presenting masculine or feminine or whatever they feel like i mean it in the sense that you're not shoved in to a gender box at birth and expected to perform as such. It also means trans men and women presenting however the fuck they want and still being accepted as their gender because gender isn't just performative or skin deep. I mean ultimately people would present as they like and gender just wouldn't be a thing but that is a very very large equality pipe dream.  As an aside your videos are so beautifully made my gosh ahh"
"if you go into terf spaces like r/gendercritical, then you’ll come to notice that its the exact same thing every time: six or seven sad white cis women sitting around in an echo-chamber where they all stroke a hate boner for trans women and pat each other on the back for showing those evil trans menaces what for. they never have anything of value to say — most of the time, they’re just mocking and sneering at the physical appearances of various trans women, and repeating the same old ‘blah blah male privilege blah blah invading our spaces’ dogma over and over.   i think that this more than anything shows that terfs are a dying breed. nobody takes them seriously or humours their ideas anymore, which is definitely a good thing. the safer trans people are in feminist/lgbtq+ communities the better."

"I didn't wanna check out this channel for some reason before but I'm glad I did now. This answered a lot of genuine questions I had that I never had the opportunity to ask a trans person about. Now I'm pretty sad to find out my past rhetoric was shared with TERFs but at least I have solace in how mine was never malicious as much as it was pure curiosity."
"All I can say is ... I would! ... ;)"
"There will always be negative bitches in the background 😂. If you are black, gay, trans, lgbt, liberal, etc you will get loads of bs and hate 💀🤦🏾‍♂️. My own race comes for me for being bisexual as if it’s “bad” because sadly religion has been ingrained and brainwashed into my “race” therefore they are heavily critical towards the lgbts unless they are a woman, lgbt themselves, or really down to earth.. So it’s shitty to not only get bashed by racists/supremacist (not always white as other races can be abusive racially speaking.), but also homophobes on the back end 😫🤣.

"Absolutely amazing! I am in awe of you!! 😍😘"
"i feel like terfs have made it so difficult to develop an analysis of gender as a constructed social class without coming off as transphobic. gender is a social construct, but like...the days of the week are a social construct, but it's still thursday, you know? and that has an impact on the world around us. trans people exist within this construct, and pretty much all of them are oppressed by it. i liked what you said in this video - 'i live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening whether you like it or not'. it is most useful to see gender as a material reality that includes sex, and to acknowledge that no one oppressed by it has identical experiences."
"TURF? Jezus woman you use a lot of constructed words. No need to get your broom though. Heterosexual is a construct, society is a construct. Masochist is a construct and the list goes on and on. Yep nihilism is a construct. But the best there is. Carry on vagina man."

"Transmedicalists dont think you need to despise your body to be trans, they think that in order to be trans you have to have  dysphoria wether its mild or severe. If you dont have some kind or level of dysphoria, you have no reason to transition, and therefore, cis."
"Thank you for taking some of these questions seriously. I think you did a great job answering these questions. My concern is actually around getting our terms and ideas more accurate and consistant, because I think Ideas like 'a woman trapped in a mans body' sounds confused an unhealthy IF taken literally. These 'wrong ideas' can give people unhealthy ideas about themselves. I really do think Narrative and framing makes all the difference not only in main stream acceptance and integration, but also with a more personal healthy psychological expression. And I think this also goes for categories like 'gay' and 'straight' when people want there to be a 'gay gene' so they can prove their preference is rooted in their biology to back up this 'I was born this way' bumper sticker when a better more accurate sticker would be 'I can't help what I like'. Even though there are biological factors, sexual preference is probably more of an expression of nurture and life experiences than nature. (Though neither of these stickers is going to matter to the people who think nature is sinful, fallen, evil and something to be corrected anyways.) - But the over arching theme in my mind is a 'psychological stigma' around certain categories and our potential to relate ourselves to 'false binaries' like 'Gay or Straight' or even 'social gender roles' like typical 'Male and Female' archetypes..  Maybe your representation of 'beyond gender' is what other people are advocating for but for me it was a bad analogy. I don't think we would create a 'non-gendered' situation. It would be more like 'express yourself how ever you want' as you said in your video about beauty, talking about 'personal style'. From the perspective a person can express themselves how ever they like, but it doesn't change their biology. - And it terms of personal development I do think being comfortable with what are considered both 'masculine and feminine traits' in our selves is healthy.   So just in terms of language. I see that you live your life as a woman. I think you pass. I even think you are beautiful - inside and out. I think you are cool, and smart, and I like you. I think you are even probably as healthy, thoughtful, and as self aware as a person can be deciding that you want to get surgery and change your look. I have nothing but good feelings and wishes for you. I would respect your desire to be called whatever you like. That being said, to me and according to our current definitions 'man and woman' are not 'social genders' but 'biological distinctions'.  Masculine and Feminine are the 'social role' words. - I completely honor and respect your choices. My concern is that we actually talk about these things in a way that is fair and honest to both sides. I don't even think 'trans-gender' is the correct word for switching from one gender to the other since 'trans' usually means above or beyond, but I get that 'gender transition' gets shortened to 'trans-gender'.  I think we DO need more videos like this, So thank you again. These issues are important and the conversations do far too often devolve into calling people haters, bumpers sticker answers, and playing the victim,  and as you say, there are good and valid reasons for this in general. (and to be honest, though I am interested in discussing these Ideas I also don't want to upset anyone or make anyone feel hated on or unaccepted, and I think a lot of people feel this way and so just don't talk about it.) These really are important issues for everyone not only because we share a world, we want to understand each other and get along, but also because sex and gender are issues for everyone so getting it right on these topics really matters.  Keep up the good work!"
"Though I do think the main problems is that theres a basic difference in understanding, and it shows in the counter points of your video. The main problem I've found from the radfem side is that is isn't about presenting, its about the fact a male is stating that they feel like another sex, they think its that your making a sex into a theme sort of. Though I know it doesn't feel that way when you actually have dysphoria. It'd be interesting to see what you think about the points from trans folk that have gone radfem"
"I love your videos. I think you express your ideas in a very creative way. Though, I'm non-binary and I wish you would speak in a less obviously binary way."
"Just your daily reminder that trannyism is a mental disorder and 'advocating' in favor of it is no different from being 'pro anorexia.' You are contributing to the mutilation and destruction of countless young people. All in the name of shoving your evil disgusting fetish down people's throats."
"This is why I love you, Natalie. (May I call you Natalie?) Between this and your video about incels, you present such a reasonable response to the kind of people I myself find irredeemable, explaining their beliefs in a way that helps me understand where they're coming from, however misguided they are. It's too easy for me to dismiss them as fanatics who can't be understood or reasoned with, but dismissing them isn't the solution. I have to believe we can convince people, even the most fanatical, that they should treat everyone with dignity and respect. Please keep doing what you're doing.   20:20 And let me just say, as a straight cisman, you're an attractive woman. Don't get me wrong, I'm currently in a relationship and happy with her. But whatever anyone says, you're very attractive.   Whoa, I'd better post this comment before I get myself in trouble. =)"

"I think the problem is that there are now subgroups of gender critical discussions with some definitely being all flimsy feminist but there's also others that are more towards the 'anyone should wear what they want'. But at the same time they also see the different sides of the trans community, the good, the incel-like ones and the creepy, since sadly I think there's always those groups in a community. I feel like its a pipe dream to be able to discern each group from each other though."

"I am fine with calling them 'gender critical.' In ten years, that will then be the 'slur' they rail against. Every euphemism they may choose will be tarnished by what it represents. The true stigma is not in the word, but in what it describes. The word TERF - a simple, value-neutral acronym (Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminist) that has picked up its unpleasant connotations by association - itself is an example of this process in action. The true insult to these individuals is what they believe. The people contaminated the word, not vice versa. Contrast 'gender critical' acronyms, deliberately designed to be insulting.   I have some sympathy for these people. Internalized misogyny is an awful thing to live with - many of these women have been at the other side of the very same ugly comments they subject trans women to. I just wish they could lash out against the people who instilled them with that disgust in the first place, instead of pushing it forward onto people more vulnerable than them."

You got a soothing voice and your journey makes the beginning of mine just a little less terrifying..."
"Yes bitch!!!!! That ending had me JAZZED!!"
"lol Someone linked me here from Twitter. They're dead to me now. All the best; I wish everyone success. But I couldn't make it through the first minute. Why it is trans women go so far out of their way to incessantly remind us that they're women every 3.2 seconds? I don't mean it as an insult; I honestly don't. I realize it probably comes across that way, but it's just off-putting. Nobody else does that except trans people. I've never heard a biological woman do that in my life. And if they are doing that, I wouldn't watch their content either."
"One word: INCREDIBLE. #ExcuseMyBeauty"
"I love you but what you said about transmeds is simply not true. Most transmeds believe in the notion that you need some form of gender dysphoria to be trans. There are some scummy people who follow the ideology, just as there are scummy people who are tucutes. Transmeds are nothing like terfs."
"Germaine Greer is a piece of shit, but every one of the thousand times I've watched this video the phrase 'in futile competition with a Dynel wig of immense luxuriance' KILLS my wig-lovin ass.

"“Excuse my beauty, TERF” is the most powerful phrase I’ve ever heard. Nathalie, thank you for this blessing."
"I feel extremely oppressed as a non-binary gamer"
"your wit and your educated language are really attractive. also as a non-native english speaker i pick up some new words every time i watch a video of yours, so thanks for expanding my vocabulary!"
"'Luxurianshhhh!' And 'Peck off!' Get me every time. 😂"
"I just remembered, I posted a Kropotkin comentary in an old nat live stream. I feel ashamed of myself :("
"This video is FUCKING INCREDIBLE"
"That's so scary that someone i used to respect Germaine Greer, could say such dismissive and vile things"
"Good vid, you're super entertaining to watch and I appreciate learning more about this subject. I must say though that I disagree with your point about society being the sole reason that our genitals at birth determine the course of our lives, and why we can't just 'erase' gender. Biological men and women are just different, period. We typically have different strengths and weaknesses due to many long-proven factors. Different in abilities but equal in value 😁"
"Ketamine is not shitty."
"Thank you so much for this Natalie, excuse the beauty!"
"l i s t e n  s w e a t y 😘💋"
"Pretty convenient to dismiss questions you can’t answer as “trolls.”  Woman is not an “identity,” we suffer oppression world wide, and violence from men, based on our biology which is not something you can identify into or out of.  And it’s pretty fucked up to think you can simply identify and access women’s single sex spaces.  Changing sex is biologically impossible.  You are a man."
"I appreciate you actually answering these questions in as nuanced a way as possible. The only question that you addressed that I had previously wondered myself was the one addressing the fact that trans women don’t have the same childhood and formative oppressive experiences as cis women. And while identity is not just a common group of people who have the same pain, it is for me, part of it. It is relieving to be around other people who truly understand what I’ve been through, even if the understanding is unspoken. Trans people go through their own kind of trauma, I’m sure, but it’s not the same as the trauma of growing up as a girl, with all the bs that entails. I don’t condone anyone acting on those bitter feelings or treating people poorly because of it- but I do sympathize with the sentiment. So of course all are welcome to my womanhood party- but I think I’ll always still have that little twinge of bitterness in the back of my heart. Not that it’s anyone’s fault- just society’s. And I’m choosing to focus my efforts on making sure growing up as a girl isn’t traumatic in the first place- instead of taking it out on trans women."
"*I always dream of the day when people find healthy, practical ways to deal with their trauma instead of crawling into a hate filled rabbit hole with no escape.*"
"Dioooooos está muy bien pero cada vez que ponen una palabra como ellxs me da un ictus, la e no me gusta pero al menos se puede leer dios santo, no puedo con estos subtitulos van muy rápido XD bueno igual se agradecen"
"That explanation of derogatory term vs. slur was on point!"
"The opening reading is hilarious and depressing simultaneously."
"I love how self-aware you are of your specific privileges and social disadvantages. You know you're not as oppressed as most, due to your race and economic status, and you know the boundaries and limits you have from personal experiences by growing up male. I love that you don't overstep those boundaries, either. You always bring up logical points and provide sources for your facts. You're honestly one of the best representatives of transgender women on YouTube, at least in my eyes."
"Yo, I found you through sexplanations and I absolutely fucking love your content"
"terfs: stop equating women to our body parts, being a woman has many complex parts and we face many struggles socially! trans woman: h- terfs: DID YOU EVER GET A PERIOD I DONT THINK SO"
"brilliant as always! Please keep up the good work."
"so you made a biased video on gender critical females starting with the idea that they are trolls but because u seem smarter than the average TIM i'm supposed to watch a 33 minutes video on your opinion no thx bye"
"I love that you use nutcracker music as background <3"
"okay but the bejeweled forest demon is exactly my aesthetic minus the ideology"
"My one criticism is that I think it's bad to say 'what [people I oppose] really want/think.' Instead it's better to say 'While [people I oppose] claim to think/want this, they do [action] which I think shows something else'"
"Cincinnati Chili is the greatest culinary invention in the last century.  No other dish combines the savory complexity of a medley of meat and black beans with the depth of cinnamon to the stunning degree as Cincinnati Chili.  How dare you desecrate the holiest of food with your blithering critique?  You have earned a downvote from me, madam."
"I made the fatal mistake of reading the comments"
"I think you dismiss the gender abolition argument a bit too easily. As trans people I think it is really important for us to actively critique gender in general, especially when we think about the experiences of BIPOC folks. The system of gender we live under is a tool of both 'gendered' and racial violence. Like, obviously TERFs are often not making this argument in good faith. But like. It is an important argument."
"This is an interesting person good quality too"
"So the experiences and realities of bio females is a figment of their imagination?  And nothing to do with their biology or socialization due to biology?  So why did feminism begin again?  So it should have NEVER existed & we don't need to worry about #MeToo or those whiny beeatches in the middle east, africa, etc?  Cause their reality is not reality & these 'females' just be trolling?  OK.  It all makes sense now."
"really good resource, thank you for doing what you do"
"I am glad you exist."
"I'm a cis woman and the amount of people who assume I'm a man makes me really doubt it when people claim they can tell the difference between cis and trans women."
"This schism"
"perfectly demonstrates the fatal flaw in all the leftist ideologies; that they are all subjective. None of these beliefs have any real ground to stand on, it is just emotional appeals and primal reactions."
"Questions you can't answer are not trolling. It is stupid to make broad statements that are illogical and demand that everyone just buys it because you think some nuanced explanation justifies it. The ultimate problem is that your arrogance prevents you from ever considering that you could be wrong, and that you have no responsibility to explain the things you demand other people to accept."
"whatever dude"
"Fuck radfems they are the bitches that treat me like I'm less of a woman because I wear band shirts and jeans. Fuck TERFs I'll slap them with my used pads for ALL of us ladies . Also, women on Depo and the implant don't even have periods why are they obsessed?"
"Trans women are women IDGAF what anyone says because the chick at the grocery store definitely intimidates me like all the other bitches at work. You know those catty dagger eyes? Go on you bad bitches maybe just give us cis girls a wink every so often so we know you aren't one THOSE women because there's women and then there are cunts"
"You’re a man!"
"you get treated as monster gender: pronouns *it* and *spit*"
"It is exhausting trying to figure out how not to offend others - when I never mean offence to anyone. There is so much anger out there.  Exhausting."
"If some people really want to do what she jokingly did at 10:43, that sounds sad and boring to me. Sounds more oppressive then just like people be people and letting them express how ever they want."
"#yesallgamers yeah but blizzards SC2 is fantastic, its like real time chess.  What? You asked me to only talk about what I know.    X"
"'What it is to be trans is to despise your own body, what it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.'   Congratulations you just made feminists seem more insane then somebody with an actual mental illness."
"Thank you for the amazing videos! As a baby lesbian born and raised in the Deep South, I was clueless to %99 of what you talk about in your videos. I just wanted to let you know that your hard work is greatly appreciated! Now if you’ll excuse me I’ll go ahead and surgically remove my lips from your anus."
"Your videos make me laugh and cry? Seriously I didn't know how sorely we needed this discourse handled exactly this way until I found your channel. Well done, Natalie."
"WoW ! All of this is Incredible ❤️😍❤️"
"'excuse my beauty, terf' is amazing thanks"
"I love your videos, you're brilliant (& so gorgeous).. what do you think of this article; https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/05/transgender-kids-brains-resemble-gender-identity-not-biological-sex/?fbclid=IwAR0ZtBlrvK1TkznVe-PxmGMbuKvtWDJvwuMZX-vnpe6m1BZtF-4dxIJBFCE"
"My ambitious projet is abolish C. Tangana"
"Thanks for explaining a lot of things I was genuinely wondering about but didn’t want to ask my trans friends because it felt disrespectful/inappropriate."
"Have been binge watching you today, and damn, your costumes are so freaking nice. You have a great talent!  Also, I thought 'clocking someone' means punching someone. I just imagined you going around and punching people xD. Took me longer to understand then I'd like to admit"
"that song at the end is my fav"
"I really appreciate you making this video! It has helped me come to understand some points the transgender POV and has been tremendously educational. I had been having these questions in viewing discourse and people bringing up these talking points, but was discouraged from asking any probing questions so that I could understand the nuance of the situation. I saw how people who asked these questions were treated, and so I just didn’t ask them. I see how these questions can and have been asked in malice, but in answering them in an honest way sometimes you will catch the genuinely curious individuals wrestling with a lack of knowledge and have been walled out of any and all productive discussion by those who use these inquiries to target and harm."
"Siempre me ha gustado la estética y la producción que maneja en sus vídeos, a parte se agradecen los subtitulos al español."
"I actually was curious about these questions but I assumed there were good answers. I was right. Your amazing videos always put things in context for me, so thank you! You are brilliant! Germaine Greer's horrible comments in the opening to the video answered some of my questions before you even started talking. What a hypocrite. She sounds like a high school mean girl. Like: 'Ew you have hair in places you shouldn't have hair! Some parts of your body are too big!' I used to beat up girls who said crap like this to me in high school with my big fists and huge feet attached to hairy legs. Not that I'm advocating physical violence. Ahem. That would be unwomanly."
"'America's Next Top Victim.' YAAAASS!! LOVED that quote!"
"I love all of these looks"
"natalie saying 'piss off' is everything. i'm obcessed."
"@14:30: The gas station attendants, nail technicians, and heating and plumbing guys can't be nice people? Their not smart enough to be respectful or progressive? Because of their jobs? Most people I know were not fortunate enough to go off to University, that doesn't stop many of us from striving to be decent human beings."
"#excusemybeauty this is amazing <3"
"This video is amazing!! You’re so eloquent and well spoken, while also managing to be hilarious. Also your costuming is so gorgeous, just like you! I hope you have an amazing day :)"
"now I feel bad about being a feminist (and by that I mean that I believe that we are the same fucking species)"
"Thank you so much for addressing these concerns! Your point about being afraid to ask these questions really struck a chord with me. I don't want my concerns to harm or be seen as invalidating towards trans people, but still so often did feel a little ...well concerned. I really enjoyed your video and many of my concerns have been laid to rest."
"How do they celebrate your period when it just hurts and you can't wear your favourite clothes because of the swelling? By talking about it? I am genuinely interested? Because I feel it's the worst part because it gets to be soooo I convenient... Unless you feel it's okay to bleed in your pants and swimsuit, then it's cool, but kinda disgusting because then bloods gets a little weird down there and it's not just blood... Hmmm also pads are not eco friendly, but the cup thing seems too painful for me to use.."
"I'm a cis woman who grows a full beard, has a more 'masculine' body type and facial structure due to PCOS. The amount of VIOLENT hate I've received from TERFs for existing happily and being myself so publically is so wild. I've been told I'm a man invading lesbian spaces, that I deserve to have my dick mangled, that I'm a disgusting hairy manly TIM who will never understand the female experience. I've had them demand /proof/ that I have a vagina, even. These people are all hate and it's so frustrating as a femme cis woman and lesbian who literally just fucking. Naturally doesn't pass as female lmfao. I wish they had any self awareness whatsoever. Thank you for this video."
"She looks like Winona Ryder."
"This is so educational"
"20:12 Yeah, sounds like being a Black natural born woman in American."
"https://youtu.be/qlRkLtKqSrY"
"❤"
"11:15. It’s still way higher pitched and more nasally than it was when she was a man. Could she still speak like she used to, or do the hormones change the pitch as well as practice? Just curious. Not trying to be rude. If I’m being rude just ignore me."
"Inner Rad-Fem is the best costume yet."
".. when you realize that some of the comments/questions you left under other contrapoints vids are actually terf talking points .. ouch Thank you so much for this vid, it helped me understand a lot, and I rly appreciate it."
"Oh my god, the terf music is 'the nutcracker'    Thank you for another beautiful brilliant video, Natalie."
"It is quite unfortunate and more than a little sad that Miss yellow hair cannot be with us here and now. My thought however is, to this gay man, I feel comforted knowing she has become an ancestor my ancestor your ancestor an ancestor to any who would listen to her truth ... Excuse my beauty."
"im so confused"
"as trans women"
"are we cis woman?"
"you are valid you fucker"
"*holding a teacup* 'take a fuckin sip babes' *DRINKS FROM THE POT*"
"That fucking teapot moment, holy shit I adore you"
"This was so fantastic because you clicked pretty much every single concern I had when faced with new trans women when I was young. Then I realized it was so much harder for the trans woman and while her journey would be different the destination would be eventually the same. Also, I realized it was literally none of my concern if she had struggled exactly as I had and that oppression is not the only definition of what it is to be a woman and even ciswoman have gigantically different experience and yet we still have general solidarity and determined that supporting a new sister is far more important than my petty concerns about 'earning' womanhood through a theoretical standard female life struggle. You can just love your sister and not question the validity of her experience.  This was just so so so good. Thank you."
"yess i stan contrapoints. i love that she is so careful to consider every perspective, and give people the benefit of the doubt, but then totally own them."
"Any advice on how to wear that amazing outfit when you're a thick 5'2'?"
"In the past few days I've been having discussions with TERFs about Caster Semenya; one told me Intersex people don't want to be used in trans issues discussions (nevermind that some intersex people consider themselves to be trans) but I can tell the concern isn't real because all of them are comfortable calling Semenya a 'male'"
"I was by momma-dom told to comment, so I comment."
"Nice video and I agree trans people shouldn't be referred to as 'it', that's awful. However you didn't address the concern of male pattern violence and the fact that trans women have the same rates for this violence against women as men do. This is why 'terfs' are concerned with allowing anyone who identifies as a woman into women's spaces, it jeopardises women's safety."
"What the fuck are you talking about?  That fake voice is just too much as well."
"I love your videos' aesthetic, your aesthetic in general tbh, you're great!"
"You're a year and a half in (in this vid) GIRL YOU LOOK SO GOOD. Today is my 2nd week of being on hormones and omg do i hope to look as good as you in 17 and a half months ;w; (Even tho i look like a fucking Hon lol)"
"Another great one."
"Hey, white privileged and in general pretty lucky guy here... I won't pretend to understand anything and I have to admit I've never given trans people much thought. But from the bottom of my heart I want to say: I admire that in our current world, confronted with all the internal and external issues you must face, you seem to have turned out pretty awesome. Stay strong and stay beautiful. I hope at some point we as humans can leave all this race/gender/whatever discrimination bullshit behind and live equally and with respect.  That, or x-phobia, climate change and war gets us all and the last demagoges will shout: Beware the gender-/race-/whatever communists!! ;p"
"i think the trans 1% might be a rich, white FTM trans but you are prob in the 5% :p"
"i'm a typical straight dude who works in the arts with many non-binary people. these contrapoint videos are great for spreading awareness about issues that affect many of my friends and colleagues and have been awesome sources of information for people like myself who want to be better allies for the people in my community. vids like these are helping to bring us one step closer to an inclusive world for everybody. thank you for the time and effort it took to make these vids."
"leave video game alone you psycho. LololoL"
"8:40 - Not real and not valid to who? Within the current meta? Defining everything takes away the humanity of it (for me) most of the time."
"Thank you for this emotional and informative essay. I hope you stay strong and find your will to face each day in this horror of a world we live in. Terfs can choke"
"You: I know you're all gonna go down to the comments and say how manly and clockable I am Me, for the first like 4 minutes: ....are you trans or cis...? I'm new here if that didn't give it away 😋 Also?? I love your outfit??"
"As a female gamer, I feel very attacked with that 'yes all gamers'. Yet, I also think it's hilarious as I know a loooooooot of hateful gamers.  Also, I'm one of like two or three liberals and the only openly LGBT+ person in a family of highly conservative people. I I have a brother who worships Alex Jones, another brother that's a Mormon, and parents who voted for Trump and honestly hoped the wall would built. My mother is half Mexican. The ONLY way I can convince them, even momentarily, to treat trans people AS people is by telling them that trans people have female/male brains in a male/female body. While I totally agree with and support your viewpoint of gender dysphoria, it makes humanizing LGBT+ SO much harder and opens up transphobic comments like 'Well then a sexual predator can just 'decide' to be a woman and go assault actual women!' And I just don't have the patience to adequately shame them for that thought process. I'ma stick with the brain talk just so that I can keep what's left of my sanity."
"All I know, is that women can be brutal to other women, like I’ve never seen with dudes. “Catty” doesn’t even come close as a fitting term.   Guys grow up knowing if you talk shit about/to other dudes, your ass is gonna get fucked up.   Women don’t really have that fear, sure, some “cat fights” happen, but tbh that’s a lot of hair pulling and scratching. This might have some effect on why women are comfortable being complete bitches to others."

"I work at Skyline Chili (Cincinnati chili restaurant, for those who don't know) and I'm shook."
"<3"
"So, terfs are the epitome of 'so left their right.'"
"hm that was really interesting to me, because I have some of the questions that TERFs tend to use, and I wish there was a way to address some of the more complex and nuanced questions they bring up (gender critical people) without coming off as unaccepting or antagonistic. For instance,  I still want to know what is the underlying unhappiness with gender if everything is based on social norms. You touched on it a little in the beauty video, and it got me thinking. Can we extricate femininity from the social expectations put on women? And if so, why aren't there more unfeminine trans girls?"
"Also!!! So close to 600k!!!!! Woooooo!"

"so... I am a brazilian undergrad and I feel like Deleuze, Derrida and all these ´68 guys are all just full of shit, but I frequently have to watch someone talking about them as if they were the KEY to understand our total colapse as a country, even though no one seems to be able to explain whatever the fuck they are saying most of the time. So I thought of asking you, since I practically adore you at that point: Is there something worth studying in these guys? Are they relevant, or were they just a fad that, as always, got stuck in the most marginalized corners of academia? (psychology classes in south america still worship Freud, for that matter.) x0x0 and sorry if I murdered your language."

"With great love, I gotta say why is it I keep feeling you're about ready to burst out with a breathless me too! When you talk of not so feminine straight women, or was it all women, so much to think on...."
"I spent 30 minutes on the gender critical subreddit, the hate from the TERFs is insane there. Recently coming out as trans i had to get out of there, i don't need that kind of negativity. I just wish humans were better, and let people be who or what they want to be. I feel like anyone that harbors hate for some group especially one that is marginalized has some deep seeded issues of their own."
"I'm a hardcore libertarian.  Do what you want and live the life you want to live, but the cold hard truth is you will never be a woman from a scientific, biological standpoint.   Also, 40% of trans people attempt suicide and the rate skyrockets post reassignment surgery.  If that's not a blatant red flag for mental illness, then mental illness apparently doesn't exist.  So be yourself;  however, just realize once basic statistics and scientific fact enters the realm of your zone of argument, you will lose every time.  The far left aren't heroes for supporting trans kids.  They are simply the moral cowards pushing children toward suicide by telling them the lie that they can be anything they want.  In addition, lefties used to heavily mock Christianity for believing in creationism.  20 years later, the modern left has gone so far off the reservation of sanity that they think scientific fact is a state of mind and a feeling.   Pretty soon we'll see the left finally attempting to legitimize pedophelia as a valid form of love."
"10:52 Going to be honest, when you did this scene I kinda jumped, because wow, you really looked different. You actually remind me of my Mum when she was in her late teens, really strong resemblance. (Not the robe or the hairnet)"

"Are these literally arguments you've had or some assumed characterisations? I think this is a performance and I think you are an artist. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. But and this is a big ugly but some guys first interaction with this is from the position of victim. A thing that we all need to realize is that everyone deals with predjudice and challenges to our identity. It's not that trans women or men is bad, it's that it appears to be inherently deceptive and often predatory. My role in the family is a protector and provider not an enabler."
"omg... I looked up Sylvia Plath because I loved the quote you used and in the images tab there was taylor swift and an article calling her the new Sylvia Plath... wtf so strange"
"Hi! First of all I want to make clear that English is not my 1st language so there are some things in your video that I didn't get 100%, so please correct me if I'm wrong. But your interpretation of 'abolishing gender' is so different from mine that I would like to share it with you. So, I always understood this term not as abolishing the female/male features of an individual (like what you interpreted as gender neutral clothes, hair, etc on the video), but more as erasing the social conventions used to oppress people through gender identity. For example, I would love a trans woman to be able to wear short hair and sweatpants while being treated with the same respect as any other human being, instead of her being preassured to look a certain way to pass as what society thinks a woman should be. Do you know what I mean? And yes, fuck anyone who says you are 'disgusting', wtf, people are SO MEAN."

Neither can you enter the wombynspace if you were born with an oppression rod between your manspreaders. You are not on the left, if you were born a white man you are part of the capitalist patriarchy."
"As always love the presentation and arguments. A friend and I discussed semi abolishing gender. I wouldn't be opposed to gender being treated more like religon and race where it's not, provided you're not an a--hole, something you walk up to everyone and ask because it has no bearing on capabilities to do work and stuff but could be important to people who might want to date each other to some extent. Also we did make the distinction that sex and gender aren't the same and sex is mainly important for medical forms."
"Jajajaja this guy"
"Can you please do a video on pro-choice vs pro-life? I know it’s a touchy subject but I wouldn’t trust anyone but you to give an exhaustive and considerate view that challenges both sides of the issue. I know it’s a daunting challenge but there is no woman in this world who could present the philosophy and ethics in such a way as to do justice to the topic. Your videos have been a jumping-off point for me to discuss difficult topics in the past and I really would like to thank you for being a life raft in this political sea of 2019."
"24:47 me and the trannies on discord at 4 am"
"Is there any middle ground though? Like, can I be aware of and sympathetic of the issues trans people face and respect your identity and pronouns, while at the same time think that sport divisions should be separated by biological sex and lesbians shouldn’t be accused of hating all trans people and wanting them to die (Quote Riley Dennis) because they’re not attracted to penis? Can’t we discuss reasonable issues like this if both parties remind respectful?"
"Okay, so I almost never leave Youtube comments cause it always felt idk pointless or pretentious or whatever. But I'm honestly so fucking relieved to have found this, and so grateful to you to have made it, that I just had to write a thank-you note, even accounting for the miniscule chance of you actually reading it.  The Trans /experience? movement? existence?/  has been a great cause of inner struggle for me. Like, having grown up in a fairly homophobic little Eastern European country, I have had some experience with discrimination. So to suddenly feel - not bigoted, but certainly not as empathetic and respectful as I should and want to be - was a source of constant unease. A part of why it took me so long to understand, I think, is because I know I would hate it if I was to be asked over and over again to justify my identity to anyone and everyone that doesn't get it. So - I never asked the members of the trans community. I get that it's up to me to educate myself, I do. It's just very hard to educate yourself about an experience someone is living, without either living it, or talking about it ad nauseam. Especially for a scientist, who is somewhat trained to only really respond to logical, well-argued points.  So - this was a godsend. Thank you again. You've made me a much happier person."

"This is my first time being exposed to this topic. Experiencing this conversation. Thank you for your honesty. Thank you for your brilliance. Thank you for exposing yourself to the hate and the love of a community in the sake of knowledge and growth on our behalf. I've learned a lot and I appreciate you. And your team.

It goes under the radar alot better if I just fit the binary."

"a huge part of ''female socialization'' that dumb TERFs would never consider is: it depends on how your parents raise you!!   like, my dad always devalued 'feminine' stuff. (for example, my mom's friend owned a dance studio and he always liked to say that wasn't a real job, and that her husband who was a construction worker was the only one who had a real job in the family.)  he had me working on cars, woodworking, driving trucks with trailers, shopping at Menards, helping build houses and carrying heavy shit, basically just treating and socializing me like a typical dude. the only thing i didn't like was how i had to dress in big boots and baggy pants and old sweatshirts. sometimes he would even get my gender confused, i think...one time he said 'what would you do if you were a woman?'  i won't say this made me feel like i wasn't socialized as a woman AT ALL as a kid, b/c obviously he wasn't the only influence.  but it's naive to act like female socialization is this thing that happens in a universal way to all cis women, and trans women who transition at young age.  like, lol, tell me more about how all women are raised and socialized, TERFS.  TL;DR it's easy for a parent to raise their child according to the norms of the opposite gender (that the parent perceives the child as). not that that's the only sphere of socialization the child is exposed to, but it's certainly a big sphere."
"Your video production is insane, I hope you get the fame and recognition you deserve for the effort you put in your content. Keep it up!"
"Почему на русском не все субтитры :( Сложно непонятно"
"Never heard of terfs but it’s interesting, I feel like there’s a difference between people who genuinely have problems with gender and terfs. It looks like in essence terfs are people with problems who enjoy the negativity and being nasty because of issues in their own lives.   Anyone who’s normal will treat people with respect even if they don’t agree with them..."

"The like to dislike ratios on your videos are great for how controversial your content is."
"Growing up in the 'sixties, I saw in magazines and in person, lots of young women who looked just like what you do in your first 'abolish gender' persona: straight hair, no makeup --- usually in miniskirts and tie-dye T-shirts, though. It's great that even in your Abolish Gender personas (BOTH of them) you read completely as a woman.  Also I have noticed (or maybe I have just *decided*) that even your 'annoying' alter-ego characters (your inner-RadFem) are really charming, even when they speak the words of the 'enemy.' It seems to me that not only are you giving us debate points in an entertaining way, but also that the various parts of your soul that we all have to work to knit together are, whether still separate or not, becoming more and more healthy.  Just what I think! Wonderful videos, and yes, I am a subscriber :D"

"Genderless ContraOoints is killing it."
"One of my friends said that trans women cant be women because they dont have to endure periods. I went off. Thanks to pcos I never had a period until I was finally diagnose and put on birthcontrol at the age of 27 .. so what was I for all those years? I didnt bleed so was I not a woman? Tons of women have issues with periods and tons of women cant have babies, doesnt make them not female and it's the same for trans women they arent men just because they dont bleed or give birth"
"Thank you for taking the time to address the questions seriously, particularly about early socialization and oppression based on reproductive biology. I don't think these questions matter except in edge cases, like that of trans women competing in women's sports....but it's frustrating in those cases, when trying to express the sense that women-who-have-never-not-been-biologically-and-socially-female are getting gypped, that the only response you hear back is 'TRANSPHOBE'."

"14:26 honestly, the only reason I’ve ever been able to clock passable trans people is because IM trans and I’ve seen and talked to a lot of trans people. If it weren’t for my experiences as a trans person, I honestly wouldn’t be able to do it at all and a lot of the time I can’t clock people. Clocking people is actually hard and for me it’s like a Trans Sixth Sense™️ to notice anything trans or queer."
"Natalie thank you."
"4:34 idk who she is but Anita Bryant sounds familiar lol"

"I'm CIS and stumbled across this channel a few weeks back. I was not supportive at all of the people covered in this channel up until recently. Between this channel and one other, it has done more to demystify this topic and the ambiguity I feel than the various websites I've looked at. I still don't get a lot of it and it was a relief hearing in the video that the trans community frequently adopt and reject terms until there is some sort of consensus that the new term has utility."

If you have books, let me know. Sincerely, your new fan"
"When you described transmedicalists, you were actually more accurately describing truscum. I am a transmed. I only believe that an individual needs to experience some form of gender dysphoria (whether that be social or physical) to be trans. Most transmeds believe that a demedicalization of the trans experience is inherently harmful and devaluing."

"Gender critical feminists will have you believe that they are simply being objective, and that they aren’t trying to demonise trans people, they’re just critical of their status. However, if you visit any large forum on gender criticism, and I do mean any, a staggering number of posts will be attacking trans people as ugly, violent, disingenuous, duplicitous, mentally ill, etc. Rad feminists are very careful not to make sweeping generalisations about minorities, or to offend them, with the very obvious exception of trans people. According to them, it’s open season for slurs and public attacks."

"I love your costumes and makes up!"
"Omg THANK. YOU. I used to be Mormon and therefore did not understand the LGBTQ+ community at all. I am now trying to understand it, but I felt like transgenders were the one community I just could not grasp, and, like you said, I didn’t feel like I could ask without being an ass. This answered all of my questions. Thank you!!"
"Kinda sad that Russian subtitles are only fot first quarter ((("
"I think when they say you haven't experienced female opression they mean they haven't instilled all the insecurities that are put into little girl's brains that affects their confidence when they grow older into you. I think this is true, there was a TED talk of a transexual woman talking about those things, and saying how when someone mansplained something to her for the first time, she cut them off and told them 'I know that, that's not what I'm asking'. She has the confidence to say that because she was RAISED as a man, not as a woman. Most women usually don't cut people off when they do this because they're not raised to be confident and secure of themselves, they're raised to be quiet and 'Polite'.  Now does this mean you're not a 'real' woman? Of course not, and it's a ridiculous argument. I mean isn't that the goal at the end? That women don't have to grow up with this lack of confidence because of social norms and constructs? If somewhere in the world there is a woman who wasn't raised in a way that makes them loose their confidence and voice like it usually happens to women, does that mean they're no longer a woman? No. This opression is clinging itself onto womanhood, but it's not a part of it, luckily."
"I want an animation of you doing the Germaine Greer quote in the first minute.  Like it would be AMAZING!!  That was some superior voice acting."
"Thank you!! My first video. So very good! I am a cis woman who went through her own phase of 'radical feminism' when my hatred and anger toward men was so bad it was disgusting and mean spirited. Thankfully for me I had spent my last year of high school in rural area of Thailand and made life long sisterhoods with transwomen. Our solidarity together and having been blessed enough to be witness to their experiences would not let me bullshit myself or the world for long. Thank you for making this video! It is so important."

"Transsexuals competing in sports will be a huge issue in the upcoming elections in the USA. As usual, Democrats will be nuanced about the dingle dongles, titty tittys, hormone therapies and get their asses handed to them by the GOP. The Republican party has a bludgeoning stick: Girls losing the 400m relay to a team of trans-girls. America-at-large will stand against transsexual anythings when confronted with such unfair horseshit. As someone who has no pony in the race, neither mare nor stud, I find it all hilarious. America will declare, 'Fuck your fairness, it has to be a fair playing field!' Idiots everywhere. It's funny. It really is. Comment here to prove my point:"

"This really stuck out as a succinct main point:  'Maybe abolishing gender is a good idea... but that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change, kind of like abolished borders... and denying trans people their gender identity because 'Abolish Gender' is kind of like denying citizenship to immigrants because 'Abolish Borders'."
""
"You're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable under the present system and then leveraging that system against them under the pretense of abolishing it.'   It comes down to not being a self-righteous, theory-drenched, forever newbie dogmatist instead of a practically minded, empathetic member of the human community. And yes, I acknowledge that this can be difficult in the current engineered social war. Stay away from Internet forums. /irony"
"On the point that 'what it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men', and the absence or lessening of female oppression in trans women's lives somehow denies them womanhood...  I am a cis woman who, somehow, missed most of misogyny. I have never been catcalled, even when wearing minishorts and a see-through shirt. I have never been grabbed by a stranger. I've never felt the need for any kind of defensive weapon when walking alone at night. I'm not sure how it happened, but most of the 'YesAllWomen' events that define how women experience sexism skipped over me.  By the TERF logic presented here, I have no right to call myself a woman, despite being assigned that identity at birth. If your definition excludes even ciswomen, I think you missed your mark, bigot. XD"
"I have no idea how this came in my feed, but I enjoyed it."
"Since she's talking about her ability to pass - I did not know she was trans until i watched a video where she mentioned it, and honestly I think she looks like a larger-framed, sassy Natalie Portman.   But also, I love the way all these points are laid out, and the nutty costumes just makes it more fun to watch. Her inner TERF looks like Maleficent going to the Met Gala."
"I would love to hear you talk more about transmedicalism!!"
"Your usual fabulous-ness (is that even a word?). Great video. Thanks!"
"Natalie, I support you through a lot, but this video definitely disappointed me. It disappointed me because saying that every radfem is a transphobic is only fueling the fire, it disappointed me because I've personally experienced social exclusion because of some of the question I've asked, it disappointed me because I wrote a very long, detailed e-mail to you explaining why I'm rad-leaning and why many of my trans friends are, too. I am disappointed because we live in a time where abortion laws are being banned and instead of talking about the misogyny behind that, we're worried about semantics and inclusivity. I am disappointed because you're using straw man arguments here and while I understand that a trans woman like you doesn't trust radfems online (neither do i, believe me i had terrible encounters), me and several of my friends wrote you an e-mail and you clearly didn't read them.  There is more nuance to this topic and I'm sad you wouldn't acknowledge that. You do realize that people literally telling lesbians that they need to be attracted to dick to validate trans womens identity is a thing? You do realize that there are some predatory people out there who use cotton ceiling rhetoric to pressure lesbians into sleeping with them? There are people like Eli Elrick (a trans woman) who has raped someone (a trans man) and who has made sure all of the evidence disappears. And these type of people have influence. I wished you would've taken a second glance at people who are radfems and who are not transphobic, there are enough of us out there. 'Radfem' is NOT a dogwhistle for transphobia. The person who invented the term 'TERF' was a RADFEM who wanted to distinguish between radfems and transphobic radfems. Like, please. Honestly.  1 Million views and you're not going to let someone like me speak up? Someone who is just exhausted by internet trans activism and wonders when it's going to be okay again to talk about misogyny that cis women face? Because we do feel like we're being silenced and I'm not saying that trans rights aren't important at all, but sex-based oppression is a thing and we shouldn't act like the growing number of radfems is just because people are assholes."
"It was a funny video, sad that it didn't tackle any issue seriously."
"I used to watch you years ago but honestly it was difficult for me, being that I’m transgender, I didn’t understand your “process” at the time. Maybe because it was still blooming and unfolding but as I’ve grown as a transwoman, I’ve realized that even though I “pass”, passing isn’t our defining moment. We’re always in the process of defining ourselves but it’s starts in the mind first. That place where all things are born! You have definitely bloomed and you are making a difference! And thank you for acknowledging your colored (melanated) sisters struggle because it’s definitely a different experience but nonetheless we are the same tribe of minds. We just need more help and resources from you all but we are one 💕"

"I have to admit the phrase gender critical appeals to me. I hate the term cis, I’m not + have never been comfortable with being a woman but I don’t want to be a man either. So some of the arguments radfems make appeal to me, especially about heels + makeup being oppressive. I don’t want to wear either but know full well from past experience that if I don’t I’ll be treated like s***. I hate performing femininity, but the reality is I have to if I want to get by. So is a choice you’re bullied into making really a choice?  I agree that what Greer wrote was hateful + not just to trans people, plenty of non trans women have unfeminine body characteristics. Body shaming is cruel + disgusting, you’d think somebody who claims to support women as a class, group, whatever, would know that."

"To the turfs I would say... What about women who get their uterus surgically removed for health reasons? What about women who are infertile? Our reproductive capabilities are only one part of being a woman, and it's different for a trans woman, just like it's different for those with reproductive anomalies. It takes more than a reproductive system/capability to be a woman. Period. (Pun intended heheh)."

"While rewatching the video with my mom, she asked me if it is fair for trans women to compite against cis women in officials sports. For example, the controversy of those two trans girls in Connecticut who were winning against the other girl (and gaining school scholarships due to it), because they started hormoning kind of late in their teens and so had more testosterone (meaning more muscle and power). What do you think about it? Should be a part of sports with only (trans) men and women?? Should they participate at the same category as their true gender (the one after transition)? The same happens for trans men, the lack of testosterone in the childhood leads to less muscle and is considered the testosterone they take as dopping??  Sorry for the mistakes, English is not my native language"
"Excellent video. I have to say, I love the moment in videos when Natalie breaks character for a split second and laughs freely. I am endlessly thankful that those moments survive the edit. I don't know why, but they make me really happy."
"I recently asked my cisgender brother what made him a man. He told me told me, 'Because I am. That's all there is to it.' And, in a spark of insight and compassion he said, 'And you're non-binary because you are, you know you are. That's all that matters.'   Like all my relationships with cisgender men, we've had our ups and downs, our rough spots. But shout out to my brother, who can be hot headed and obstinate but always calms down to listen and process and do better next time."
"honestly, something that annoys me a lot about the ' the traumas of girlhood' thing is how it just ignores the huge variety in even cis women's experiences.  They talk about it as if there is one experience there, one set of traumas and that #s theirs and that's it.  And that's just divorced from reality and ignoring so so many other aspects that play into how womanhood affect a woman's life.  take race, location, religion,  culture,  income, sexuality, self-expression and even just their parents' political views. One cis woman's girlhood can be fucked up in a completely different way than theirs. the stuff forced onto women varies A LOT.    Like, my experience was being a well off girl in a place where my race was never an issue. I didn't get catcalled at 9 and I didn#t get forced into dresses. Actually, I was told that skirts and dresses and makeup where for brainless sluts looking to compensate, who were sure to end up poor and worthless. So I ended up tomboyish. Not out of actual preference but due to panicking and shaming myself whenever I felt like wearing a dress or something flowery and hiding that I tried on makeup until like 7th or 8th grade I think, at which point I said fuck you to the classism and the second-hand sexism of  judging anything feminine and embraced that I could wear a skirt without losing my worth as a human being.   That's pretty damn different from what most butch lesbians I've heard talk about this have described. and it's different from what friends that fit norms pretty well but that also lives in a  crime-riddled neighborhood  have told me  And I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that someone that was sold off to marry and have kids at 12 might have something else to say. That cis women  that went through genital mutilation will have something else to say too.  That  Women told by their religion to shut up  and be quiet will have a different story to tell. that women  that have their hijab ripped off their heads  in public against their will will have yet another.    The experiences are incredibly varied, in ways they often don't even consider in their narrow-minded narrative. so when another variant comes along they reject it instead of seeing that the experience is varied already. that the experiences of trans women might actually be closer to those of some other cis women than their own.    The sheer ignorance and self-centeredness of it baffles me"

"I was a TERF myself for about a year.  You know what made me rethink the whole thing? They say that trans men are all lesbians that hate themselves. I noticed something was wrong when I saw a pattern, TERFS are mostly white middle class cis lesbians with conservative backgrounds. If they were straight men, their life would be close to perfect, therefore, they project what makes them less privileged (being lesbians) to trans people. Another TERF pattern is their connection to not only the second wave of feminism, but the first one too. The second one was not inclusive of trans women and the first one was not inclusive of black women, I don't think it's a coincidence that they are mostly white and mostly British."
"Amazing video. I didn't realize how ingrained TERF language was even amongst more liberal pro-trans groups. Up until now, I believed that being trans was simply something that could be explained away with science, more specifically mutations and cross-over events regarding sexual determination genes and hormone imbalance. Not that those aren't still real things, but that being trans is too much of an umbrella statement. The realest answer is, 'who the fuck cares, let people live their life.' How people choose to express themselves is all about personal preference, and it should be common decency to just respect that. It isn't hard, and opposition to this idea is just you being a dickhead. Why anyone would take it as an issue how someone chooses to express themselves is beyond me. But I suppose that this opinion changes when it comes to children. How an adult chooses to express themselves is their choice because they are at an age where they can understand the weight of the decisions they are making, but kids are very shortsighted and impressionistic. I know my ideals have changed a lot between the age of 18-22. The idea that a child making an irreversible, life-altering decision like gender reassignment surgery scares me in the same way of a child hurting themselves due to body dysphoria. I want them to be ok. I realize that people use, 'but think of the children,' as a way to delegitimize trans people, but I really am honestly concerned with high suicide rates tied with body dysphoria. Someone getting improper body reassignment surgery would be akin to being assigned the wrong gender. I will continue to research what it means to be trans, and continue watching ContraPoints for all of her funny content, so I can be more informed and a better ally."
"I love you, Natalie Wynn. Keep being brilliant and funny and amazing. I also think you’re fucking HOT. So that’s a real thing."
"Your voice is so angelic and the color palette that you use in every outfit is beautiful"
"Really dumb stuff tbh  So much bullshit to justify a mental illness like disphoria.   It is OK though, with tech eventually people will be able to grow real male and female bodies but in the meantime, deal with it.  XX =/= XY. Accept that you were born before your time, and you will die a male. Is not that bad ;)"
"Even if you were to strip away all the information in this video the production value and humor is amazing, I love it!"
"I love your honesty and transparency. So many people try to debate over these kinds of topics but then fall short because they sputter on points that shine a light on themselves. I love that you propose another side's viewpoint and admit both the truths and the faults. It is exhausting trying to listen to someone who only wants to demonize an opposing side and idealize their own, but never show where the other side is right and where their own side falls short. Thank you so much for presenting these ideas in a realistic fashion and not being afraid to actually show all sides. It makes it all so much easier to understand and get behind. You actually address questions so many people have instead of just trying to sweep it under the rug as if it doesn't push your 'agenda' enough. THANK YOU FOR NOT HAVING AN AGENDA AND ACTUALLY JUST TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE. It is just such a breath of fresh air listening to your take on things because you lay all the cards on the table and make a point to address biases instead of just spouting points based on your own preconceived notions and acting like these preconceived notions should be oh so obvious to every other human being on the planet. Addressing biases just make the best arguments that anyone can follow and remain civil about, no matter whether a person agrees or disagrees. Once again, thank you. I cannot thank you enough."

"I've been ong a small binge these days watching your videos! They are so informative and funny. And your presentation is just top-notch!"
"I'm looking at this video until now because I wasn't feeling ready to watch it before. I have considered myself as a radical feminist for a long time, in the way of believing that most of the oppressions women suffer are caused because of their biological characteristics. With this I don't mean that is like that all the time because patriarchy has taken this forms and applied them to all women and bodies that are read as female not specifically to the biological ones, but that biological characteristics are the root of that oppression and that it's still a relevant topic of discussion. I do believe that the debate about transgender issues and radical feminism can use this kind of arguments to belittle and make fun of transgender people (specially tansgenderwoman) but I find it fundamental to open this places of encounter and debate (obviously with people that really want to talk and, most importantly, listen).  And I think too that is important to remember that the struggles that women face are complete different all over the world and the specific vulnerabilities  that trans and biological women face in each context is different. In a personal way I can tell you that it is very difficult to understand why anyone would like to be a woman, I don't like being a woman and almost all my female friends don't like it either because in my country (Mexico) the violence against women is crazy and I feel womanhood as an everyday struggle, as a borden. For this reason I didn't understood transwomen but as I hear you speak and watch more of your videos I have undestood more from your context and in the same way begin to understand the ones in my own.  Thank you for opening this places of debate, we are at a time where we have to discus this topics (in a theoretical and personal way) to look for solutions against the brutal violence against women and misogyny in the world. Congrats for the video and you channel! (sorry for the bad english)"
"You’re highlighter is always on point. I’m jealous."
"wheres the new video?   please"
"15:00 Take a fucking sip, babes."
"hey, who wants to abolish gender? Not me. We need more genders because these two suck bad.  I'm thinking we get the trunk people from Rick and Morty, and then that planet of hot enbies that Riker fell in love with, for starters.  and of course, cloud people like from Super Mario RPG.  Get NASA on it already, if they can fly holographic planes into the World Trade Center, then inventing new holes and prongs should be a piece of cake.  Silicon Valley is always talking about 'disruption' so maybe they can help, I'm sure they're all tired of watching the same two genders masturbate through laptop webcams.  We can't count on China to save us, the Cultural Revolution abolished gender and that's the only Marxist policy they still actually follow over there, which is why their stock market still doesn't work quite right.     Crapfully yours,  George Carlin"
"I always wanna clap at the end this is ARTTT"
"how is every video she puts out so on point?"
"Anyways, thank you for helping me see some real silly ideas I was still holding"
"I wish I could like this more than once.  All the snaps, girl. So much truth.  So much tea."
"You give me so much joy and knowledge in a sea of dread 💕"
"Ehy Natalie, can you better explain the question about “femme - fobia” by pre-transition trans women?"
"Moloch needs a other baby, Call schlomo to get some more"
"'race realists' is a term created and used by the dominating race, white. 'TERF' is used against the subjectated gender, women. In a completely objective way, your argument is invalid."
"30:44 Transphobia. Transphobia never changes"
"Thank you for this, I love this video!! I love the terms menstruator or pregnant people. I'm a proud menstruator! lol. I look forward to the medical advancements that will allow transwomen or any gendered person to get pregnant and give births. I am interested in the constructed nature of our bodies! I personally am interested in liberation from gender, not in the sense of abolishing it, but that it is something that is a fluid choice that doesn't restrict people but helps them thrive.  But I totes agree with you that that is a utopian vision at the moment. Gay marriage bolsters the institution of marriage that has been faltering badly, if anything it infuses new blood into it. I feel that transwomen are embodying authentic womanhood, for me at least which has been losing meaning and faltering! I think transwomen are bringing hope to womanhood. I sometimes wonder if transwomen are able to  suggest a vision of true womanhood to the world.  And transmen a vision of true manhood, in a world where gender as an institution is failing us.... Anyways, please keep being who you are, I am learning lots from your videos, and thanks for helping us to be good allies to transpeople. I am especially interested in being a good ally to transwomen (sisterhood!!)"
"you failed to address the key element of gender critical views: biological sex is all that determines whether we are a man or a woman. what makes one “feel” as though they should be the opposite sex? no one can answer this without being entirely sexist. i do understand the idea that hyperfeminity is criticize but you have to perform it to be perceived as what you want to be, but feminity is not womanhood. you are a man, and it’s fine by me if you want to be a feminine one."
"Quick poll: Like if you’re a socialist Or comment where you are politically"

"I want to motorboat those tits.  That is all."
"You are wonderful. I have some personal views that I really want to be rid of, and you have helped in a big way."
"I generally agree with everything Nat said, but I think she left out two important other aspects of gender critical 'concerns.' 1) That ciswoman across the world experience much more oppression than transwomen ever will (which, Natalie could partially respond to with her great point about TERFs defining womanhood as pain and oppression). 2) The rather scary instances of misogynist transwomen who disrespect women's spaces, invade them with an arrogant entitlement, and often have scary records of violence and abuse towards women. Of course, this it not the majority of transwomen, but I would've liked to see Natalie address that particular concern. I've heard some transpeople pass those individuals off as 'Actually men' or 'not actually transgender,' and I'd like to see Natalie's take on it."
"You are great Jordan! All dogma is designed to control humans globally. When you can make people believe in magic men in the sky, the sky’s the limit! Lots of love from a papa bear!"

"It's been a bit more than a month Natalie and then I see some videos of this hairy slightly younger dude on your channel smh."
"Hey Natalie, a streamer I watch mentioned you in passing and I ended up watching your whole channel. Couldn't help noticing Infinite Jest sitting prominently on your shelf so I tried to find out if there was any information about your opinion of the book, but the only thing I could find was a tweet where you said that it was 'a douchey book to own.' I own a copy of Infinite Jest, does that make me a douche? Fuck."
"This woman is amazing. I'm in love"

"yeeeaaah!"
"Hey, how dare you insult the traditional food of my people! Cincinnati chili is fine. :D Is ok, I still love you."
"Would it be possible to describe all this using universal neutral terms. Like instead of using the term misogyny, just use the term prejudice? I mean, when even the definition of woman is up for debate, there's a very long way to go, no? Is there any way to approach this from an objective point of view? It's very hard to separate the hypothesis' from the conclusions? I'm probably way off here, but my take is that all this comes down to the ideal of the inviolable individual. You know, treat others like you want to be treated, and so on? Surely the prejudice we need to confront is that within ourselves? And by confronting others about their prejudice, we almost certainly will only harden their prejudice? Does one violation justify another? I understand you feel threatened by this Germaine character's identity, either self proclaimed or assigned? And surely she feels threatened by your identity, either self proclaimed or assigned? Could that be a common ground for conversation maybe?  Anyways, very nice work. You're very good at what you do.  Sincere"

"<3 so great! thank you!"
"You are just amazing! I stan"
"I love you! this butch woman stands behind trans women!"
"Natalie you are smoldering hot, 10% of that is external, 90% of that is intellectual."
"This video had been sitting in my recommended since it came out (Google clearly knows I'm NB), but I didn't click on it because I was worried it would be too serious, depressing, or pessimistic. But your humor and that hopeful and empowering ending made it a bearable conversation about TERFs and their effects on trans people, which is something really rare. I think you have the capability of bring a lot of new people into this conversation, whether they're the most liberal person alive, neutral, or a TERF bigot themselves. And that's really amazing <3"
"Do you make the costumes for your characters? They're always so spectacular!"
"By the way, Anita Bryant is alive. She's 79 years old."

"Luv you"
"As someone who is considered and considers himself a man, but also someone who grew up plagued by gender stereotypes that he never conformed to, I deeply appreciate this look into what goes on behind the TERF phenomenon. For me, the notion that gender is biological, and not social, is deeply comforting. If being a man is just to have a penis, then it's meaningless and anyone stereotyping me or criticizing me for just doing what feels natural to me, are projecting something irrational onto me. If what it is to be a man or a woman is a 'social construct' in the way people talk about it, then all the behaviors associated with masculinity are masculine by default. By taking ballet classes I'm in some way deviant now, instead of just acting according to what feels right to me. I'm now transgressing. And I don't want to transgress, I just want to be me. I'm not being feminine by taking ballet, I'm doing something that I enjoy. I'm not being feminine by having long hair, I'm doing something I enjoy. The fact that other people take that to be feminine is of no concern to me, because they're just projecting their own notions onto me.   But at the same time, everything Natalie has said in this video seems correct to me. These personal experiences of mine, along with the narratives I've used to cope with those experiences, don't undermine what's the issue, unrealistic and policed gender norms. Whether I agree with Natalie's underlying metaphysics of gender, (which I clearly don't) I still agree that her situation deserves to be taken seriously and sympathized with, along with other trans people. TERFs, along with others, are in danger of taking their own experiences too seriously and objectively. Seeing our experiences as valid, but only as one among many experiences, is crucially important. And I'm glad that this video exists to illuminate a divide."
"Of topic here but wanted to give you an input: Maybe you could make a video about the mind-body problematic and use theories like the one of silvia federicci to connect this philosophical problem to an anticapitalist feminist perspective. Are body and mind separable things? Is the body and the emotions getting opressed by the rationalist capitalist liberal view? And why? patriarchy? witch haunt ? and so on... - but yea it's just an idea - do whatever you want with it :)"

"Germaine Greer can’t tell the difference between Lizzie and Laura in Goblin Market so we didn’t stan anyways, but now also transphobic ???!! Double not stanning ."
"I just about screamed when you went in on that tea pot. This video was so funny and relatable. My personal philosophy, loosely put, is that both trans women and cisgender women struggle under the system of patriarchy and working together in solidarity is going to create a better future for all of us. Every individual has a nuanced and different experience of the world from the next person and all of our lives are enriched when we share those narratives, trans and cis alike."
"This was so well done, so articulate, and hysterical at times. Very beautiful. 🌈"
"'I don't believe in any gender metaphysics'. mad respect <3 I was kinda confused about your views on this but I realize I actually agree with you more than i thought."

"Wow you hit a million views again !! Get it girl !! ❤❤❤"
"You are amazing!"
"It's nice to hear someone actually answering those questions instead of just screaming 'you're transphobic you just dont get it you fucking TERF!!'  So thank you for that.   i considered myself a rad fem for 3 weeks because I didn't know there was other feminists who were thinking 'just like me' but then I got scared of the people in the movement but still had these questions in my head and didn't know what to really think. You are very smart and it's refreshing to hear someone who has actual thoughtful opinions.    I never disrespected trans people but I did think (and kind of still do) that the're reinforcing stereotypes by saying things like 'I used to play with barbies' and other irrelevant stuff to explain why they're women. Or hearing trans men say ' I was tired of people telling me that I couldn't do certain things because I'm a woman' . As a woman you feel kind of ''betrayed'' or 'disrespected' when hearing this sort of stuff. (which are actual quotes from trans people being interviewed).   Anyway, your video was very refreshing because you ackowledge the privilege you used to have and explain very well why you make a lot of effort to look like a 'typical' woman. I get it now, because as a black woman we are often seen as unattractive, unfeminine, and we often tend to compensate by going to extremes just to be perceived as feminine as white women who seem to have the luxury of being feminine just by being skinny and having long hair. SO I get it."
"holly fuck i havent pressed the subscribe button so fucking fast. almost broke my fucking mouse."
"I love watching your videos with my grandma. She says hi!"
"Thank you sincerely for this educative video."
"Damn Contra- where the fuck you at girl? We waiting on a new drop!!!!"
"feminity and masculinity are not the same thing as gender, wether or not you are either masculine or feminine says nothing about your gender"
"Barbarians come to raid your village, kill all the males, and take all the women hostage as baby-making slaves (as has been done throughout history). The moment they find out that you are a useless male, you, my dear, are killed and spared a lifetime of suffering. Meanwhile, the real women are raped continuously and forced into servitude. You are a man and you have male privilege, even though the bros don't treat you like a bro anymore."
"I think you are most beautiful and feminine when you present without all your makeup in the section when you wear the 'genderless' attire. I actually think you underestimate how beautifully and naturally feminine you are with none of your hyper fem getup. In your  so called 'genderless' attire you are truly lovely and womanly. All this other stuff you do is fun, but it dosnt make you seem more beautiful. I am a hetero male."
"Thank you for making me look up words.   I get smarter watching your videos. Legitimately. Not just cause of that, but consistently that."
"this is so good!!!!!"
"Consider yourself subbed. You've been in my recommended for months and now I'm binging. Your content is fantastic. This decor looks like Oscar Wilde exploded in there. Love it."

"Who's doing the narration for the text in this video?"
"Watching your black sparkly chandelier headdress swinging around while you talk about 'foisting penises on lesbians' is my favorite thing I've done this week. Thank you for yet more exploratory opinions expressed more fabulously than Gotham deserves."
"I will not deny a trans-person their chosen identity, but I will not be forced to say that they are what I don't believe they are. My reality is also valid."
"Why do you hate women?"
"Trans-women are men. You are not a woman. We can all go along with your pretending, but it won't make it true."
"For most of us it's a game . Where we oppose other side only because it's fun.  This is pretty much it ."
"Dear Gorgeous Goddess, Thank you very much for your videos. I would like to donate to the cause; however, your patreon page (all of patreon?) only offers recurring monthly subscriptions. I would much prefer to make 1 payment at a time rather than commit to a monthly amount as my income fluctuates ( I am one of those adjunct college professors: 16 years temporary, part-time, no job security, flat sharing in 1 of California's most expensive cities,  PLUS full time single mom w/ 100% custody of an amazing, brilliant, feminist young man interested in Wollstonecraft and Marx-- so I've got that going for me ; ) ! ) Please advise re individual non-serialized payments. Thank you, and a thousand glitter kisses to you."
"ContraPoints is so sophisticated and I love the outfits. Cis women have came a long way. Yes you can pick out data where women have unfair wages & sexual assault. You can also pick out data where men were pressured to risk their lives in the army or denied jobs because they were considered 'too intimidating'. I guess my point is I choose not to engage in conversation about privilege in association with gender & race. It makes the same stereotypes that often social justice warriors often fight when directing at their declared discriminated class.   If a straight white man is sexually harassed it equally angers me as if a black transgender woman experiences the sames thing. Obsessing on these classifications is low brow & non-intellectual. 'Americas next top victim' is boring af."
"I would not say that I was on the fence of TERFdom ... but these questions have crossed my mind. Honestly, it started because of another of your videos. You mentioned big, strong, masculine women when discussing the construct of femininity and sort of said, 'right, because look at how great society views them.' As if to say, society treats them like shit and therefore that upholds certain dainty, willowy standards of femininity as more accurate. I fucking hated that. I embody powerful femininity as a very big and strong (cis) woman. I'm 6'9', 330 lbs. Its hard for me to see clearly around my ego in this, because I have become fiercely proud of my stature, partly as a defense against the way I've been treated my entire life. When I was 10 years old a bunch of hick dudes screamed at me from their pick up, 'hey bitch, you dropped your dick!' Thus began the public harassment from strangers that continues to this day (though I had plenty of 'private' harassment from peers at school starting before I can remember). I just don't like the idea that people in formerly male bodies (sorry if that is offensive, I'm not sure how else to say it) feel entitled to define femininity, when I have been shaped as a woman by men's responses to my body, which did not fit into their definition of femininity. Maybe we can relate in that way. But the difference is that you don't understand what its like to be undeniably a woman from birth and be told that you are still wrong as a woman, constantly, based on lifelong programming about what is expected of you. And then have someone who came into womanhood later in life and also lived as a boy or man in a world that caters to men's perspective, be in a position to tell you what the definition of femininity is. This is what might be missing from your definition of femininity. Idk, I have to go watch that video again now."
"Maker's Mark?   Respect."
"I guess most of the time I end up thumbsupping a video at the end after finishing watching. There's always a bit in the middle when I do for your own, more spontaneously because it was brilliant. In this case it was the Genderless bit. Thumbsup."
"Ok, but your “TERF” costume is amazing and I want it for Halloween."
"Hello my fellow SJW and feminazis alike. What gender are we today?"
"Fuck Terfs"
"i think that people with a different experience with womanhood should be embraced! each differing experience should be listened to, understood and celebrated! being a queer identity whether in gender or sexuality shouldn't become a pity contest, but instead each individual should be acknowledged and accepted, not shamed for 'not being sad enough'. each individuals experience is unique and has it's own lessons and hardships, just because one person's doesnt match another's doesnt mean it's an invalid experience to have. like those kids said in that old musical movie, we're all in this together,  we should act like it."
"This video inspired me so much. As a baby trans person coming into herself this vitalized my strength and courage and in this moment I feel ready to face the world I’m coming in to. I’m so grateful for this online platform where there are creators like you that will speak with such power, truth, and intelligence for people like me who are just beginning this process of self love and acceptance.   Thank you so much for being so visible, there will never be words good enough to show the gratitude you deserve. ❤️  Light and love, darling!"
"10:43 : Oh my god, this is the first time I see you without make up, you are so gorgeous, I had to do a double take for a moment there--!! I don't know if it's just my face-blindness but for a moment I thought you looked like Lindsay Ellis."
"Gender is such a complex issue. I used to think it was just black & white, male or female & then some ppl were gay.that was the extent of my knowledge. After my son came out as trans and I started to learn about what it means to be trans, trans issues, ppl who are intersex, gender fluidity, etc. and I now see gender as a spectrum, a unique & complex experience for each individual. Now I don’t get hung up on having to label someone. Your value as a person is not defined by where you sit on that spectrum, it is innate. Thank you Natalie for making me think, challenging assumptions & unconscious biases. My son needs ppl like you, the world needs more ppl like you."

"As ever, a nuanced, humerous look at some of the current contention. This cis white male appreciates the education."
"Um, I'm a man and I  have had long hair for any period of time up to which it gets annoying and I donate it.  I _balk_ at the notion that it is a female signifier, even if I have been catcalled from behind.  I AM AGHAST.  But, really, with the way things have kind of progressed, it seems more like short hair is a male signifier more than long hair is a female one."
"Okay but your TERF character's look is STUNNING"
"I have dyslexia and thought this video was on “critical points” like from calculus lol"
"The idea that one's gender or sexual identity should be based on 'Pain' is an interesting one. If that logic applied to me, I wouldn't be considered gay-leaning bisexual male. I grew up with a much, much easier coming out than most people because I lived in an extremely progressive area in a blue state. Not to say I haven't had intense encounters with homophobia: I was nearly kidnapped to be harmed/killed by an older classmate, and later on in life had a gun pointed at me. But those were exceptions to the rule. I just never felt particularly miserable by my experience. Most of my worries are about people hundreds of miles away influencing me through policy, and that diodn't even hit home until I fully matured around 25 and started thinking beyond my immediate sphere of awareness.  So the idea that one has to earn their identity through pain is a very, very alien concept to me."
"Can I just say, the way your veil lines up with your left eyebrow is so aesthetically pleasing."
"If she was singing about a coat hanger abortions, I might find the song mildly less annoying when they play it 3 times a night at work. I may actually have to start thinking of it as such so I can laugh from within at the drunks dancing to a song about a coat hanger abortion."
"Okay, so I ADORE this and I adore Natalie. Not particularly fond of the genderless part like ... I suppose there are better instances of holding space for genderneutral, non-binary etc. people but then, I also get the point she's trying to make (albeit oversimplified)."
"There's a lot here I didn't know thanks dear one."
"JRE sent me here. You cleared up a bunch of things and told me some things are still grey; thanks!!!"
"I am a Christian, and I Love your channel because it is very helpful in understanding the perspective, pleasures and pains of people who identify in a trans manner. The reason other Christians and the many anti-LGBT non-Christians, hate LGBT people, is because they don’t see that you’re a real person worthy of love.   This may further be because they themselves, according to their particular interpretation of Christianity and/or Life, see themselves as ultimately unworthy of love, dissociating from all humanity, failing to recognize that Jesus was not a ruler to eternally fail to compare ourselves to, but a savior in whom we can rejoice and likewise accept all of mankind in sincere friendship. They project their own “I’m not good enough.” onto you, ignoring your own.  I especially appreciate your honest and potent manner of expression. I think you are gifted in being able to get behind the surface of the language and share the deeper experience within.  *_((((((((((((“BUT”))))))))))))_*"
"Wait so are you a woman or a trans woman?"
"First time on your channel, loved your thoughts and presentation... high-larious. Also, you're gorgeous without nails and makeup"

"I hate terfs so much, and it always bothers me in THE MOST HYPOCRITICAL WAY because they most definitely insult ''real women'' with their cruel comments. Intersex women, butches, anyone who is not quite the same PHYSICALLY.  also often gets racist with ideal European features and hella ableist."
"As a nonbinary AFAB, abolish gender just doesn't work for everyone. Also, inclusive medical language is HUGE because hopefully no one likes being referred to by their genitals? Also intersex people exist?!   Eliminating gender stereotypes and enforcement, allowing for people to choose a gender rather than be forced into a box is great. But most decent people want the majority of people to experience euphoria in their bodies and way they move in the world. (Excluding ideas that HURT people. Your body, your business. Other people's bodies and identities? THEIRS)"
"“...I have especially little patience for (Terf) requests for linguistic decorum.”  Or to put it another way, you refuse to cede linguistic territory to people that have an ulterior motive.  This line caught my attention because it’s the same argument Jordan Peterson is often criticized for."
"I will be honest, I believe in rigid gender. This still aligns with my support of trans people. Gender fluidity has no bearing. If people put effort into being the opposite sex, that has no effect on my life and they can do whatever the fuck they want."

"This has added more to think about as I go through my own journey of gender identity that I struggle with.  For example what you said about some trans thinking that you are only valid as a trans person if you have experienced agonizing hatred of your body.  While it is true that I have often hated my body and the extreme maleness of it, there have also been times of peaceful acceptance of that same body.  The fact that I have at times in my life comfortably accepted and even enjoyed a male identity has also made me feel now like a fraud.  How can I even consider that I am trans when I still use he/him pronouns and live and identify as a man?  How can I say I feel this way now when I was so eager to fulfill male gender roles in my 20s?  I look at young transwomen with beard stubble and wigs and imagine their gender dysphoria must be much worse than mine to feel more comfortable dressed like that and to be side-eyed by everyone around them.  Maybe my trans feelings are less valid because I always put on pants and polo shirts and cut my hair short to fit in with those around me, to desperately seem normal, to seem as male as possible.  To realize now, though, that those thoughts and concerns are what are actually invalid has been inspiring."
"uggggggggh I'm so jellus of ur makeuuuuuuup fuck also the video has a point... uh... TERFs bad!"
"That mic drop at the end was the best possible way to end this"
"Male feminist here. I was admittedly a TERF before I even knew what it was. Not because I indulged in privilege oppression framing (something I still don't think is helpful). But I saw male socialization in a lot of my transwomen friends coming out. I saw it making many of my female (and especially lesbian) friends uncomfortable, and it admittedly made me uncomfortable as well. It took a while to integrate the difference between personal discomfort and feminist ideology around a trans identity.  In a book I'm writing, I'm considering the impact of male and female socializion in how genders approach the issue of consent. It's a very difficult framework I'm trying to develop, not the least of because of my own limited experience as a male. I've been doing as much research as possible (and of course have a female coauthor), but the male socialization issue has always been bugging me in the back of my mind even though I no longer could be considered a TERF. There are things yet to learn and understand.   This video has been extremely helpful"
"I just found you and while not a TERF, I am a better woman for having watched your video.  You are a beautiful, funny, thoughtful, genius. Thank you for being you and making videos like these."

"I'm a... Strange girl, myself. Bi, Panromantic, polyamorous cis woman who is one of only two women working in my site/industry.

It helps to have something like Trek or Marvel on your side. I appreciate your explanation."

"@ContraPoints love your content, absolutely hilarious and intelligent! Can you make a video about how different cultures around the world tackle questions about gender. Totally ignorant here and loved to be educated. My question is mainly just inspired by a trip to thailand, where ladyboys were an open and (to my eye) completely accepted part of society. I realize I'm not able to even formulate an intelligent question, but I'm hoping you might be able to :)"
"Thank you, but THANK. YOU. for the bit about social constructs because  I don't think it means what the internet thinks it means! Plenty of things are not set in stone yet necessary. Their entire meaning depends on the context; Language for example: there is no scientific reason why the letter 'A' means the sound we associate with it, we just collectively agreed that it does in this time and place to communicate better. In China or Egypt centuries ago, the same sound was written differently. It's the same with many other things; art, cooking (jews don't eat pork, westerners don't eat insects yet neither are poisonous) religion (abrahamic or not, organized or not), gender roles are all products of our social psychology. That being said, we must keep in mind that those rules were invented by and for humans, not humans for those rules. They have changed in the past, and will change again... ...and when people are being killed and bullied just because their tangible existence does not fit those abstract concepts of gender, for example, it is better to believe our own eyes and adapt."
"Wait, are those your real boobs and not a breastplate? I'm asking for a friend..."

"I don't understand how terfs will say 'if you feel like you're the wrong biological sex, you don't need to transition; you need to go to therapy' when (at least where I live) you have to get confirmation from a therapist that you should transition before you can do so medically."
"It's been a month, upload something already! I needs your wisdoms!"
"Very on point, people need videos like this. Some of the ideas in this video reflect some of the confusion I had as a (gender non-conforming and constantly bullied for being so)tween/teen about trans people, that I was too afraid to ask at the risk of offending people. Since there was nobody like ContraPoints back in the day, I had to figure most of it out myself through logic, or make trans friends who happened to discuss their experience. It's important to know because it helps ciswomen stand in solidarity with transwomen and be better allies. Also..it's just important to hear transwomen talk about their thoughts and experiences. There simply isn't enough of it in this world, whereas we do have TONS of feminist rhetoric relating to the experiences of ciswomen. Thanks for posting these nuanced answers to the trolly questions. I am sure there are lots of people who genuinely need to hear them."
"I think the discovery of TERFs was a major contributing factor that drove me from being a liberal to a leftist."
"Beautiful video. I think masculinity and femininity are so powerful and when balanced it's just amazing. Why would we hate people who have so many gifts and potentials to share? Hmm. Human-phobia? Although what I do relate to as a straight woman is feeling constantly treated as a commodity or prize to win or proof of something by men, lesbians and trans women. Our humanity as girls is taken from us and then it just seems harder and harder to get it back. It's like quick sand. So there's always the jealousy of male privilege. For cis women feminity feels like all we have. And if trans women have femininity and some male privilege from early life then it feels unfair. But to me if someone can be more uplifted then they will show me how to be that way too so why would I stay divided from them. And of course having felt threatened I don't want trans women to feel threatened either!"
"Could you please talk about why we feel that 'disgust'? I don't understand where it comes from, because logically I support trans rights 100% but I feel that same feeling you describe when seeing a very badly passing trans person and I hate myself for it and I can't explain why I have that taken aback moment for a second before I can pull myself together and give them the respect that they deserve just like any other human being."

"You know, with the intersex conditions I had, I had almost equal choice to be a woman or a man (would've had to go through surgery either way, slightly harder to be a woman, I guess? Not quite, tbh, it's hard to say) And I would've been absolutely stoked about trans women coming out more. Esp. as a sad teenager. I would've wanted there to be 500000000 trans women at my school; the more women, the better. I would've been so happy just to not hear casual sexism in the locker room that the guys didn't know applied to me in some specific ways. For women who are actually women (trans or cis) this must be A Lot (and sometimes agonizing). And that's unfair, and inhumane. And you all deserve way, way fucking better."

"This was a great video. I'm a cis woman who questioned her gender identity from the age of three, and after 20 - 25 years of struggling decided that I am indeed a cis woman and not a man. I'm very pro trans even though I decided it's not who *I* am, and I'd really love to hear from trans men who also struggled and came to the opposite conclusion. If anyone can point me toward a similar commentary to this video from a trans man's perspective that would be amazing <3"

"Germaine Greer also said that most women who have been raped have not in fact been raped but just had 'bad sex.' She's only saying these provocative, controversial, politically incorrect things about sex and trans women because she is an old, bitter person who has not been relevant since The Female Eunuch came out. She is desperate for attention and desperate to appear relevant and important to the conversation.  I'm sure if she had a daughter who had been raped, Germaine would tell her to stop whining and get over the 'bad sex' she had. Very feminist, Germaine. Very pro-woman. Well done, you."
"💜💜💜"
"transmeds define dysphoria differently than what you said (ie. distress, pain, etc). every transmed i’ve met defines the trans experience via a disconnect between one’s AGAB and one’s actual gender. not pain, not stress.   gen·der dys·pho·ri·a /ˈjendər disˈfôrēə/ nounMEDICINE the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex.  as a transmed, i define being trans as this: the state of disconnect between one’s sex and one’s gender. most transmeds think like this. anti-transmeds are often misinformed on our beliefs and instead go by this definition of dysphoria:   dys·pho·ri·a /disˈfôrēə/  Learn to pronounce nounPSYCHIATRY a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.  the term above refers to general dissatisfaction not necessarily related to being trans. the term “gender dysphoria”, however, is specifically relating to trans people and describes a necessary disconnect they must have in order to transition.  for the record, i agree that trans people are not defined by their pain. dysphoria is not needed. GENDER dysphoria, however, most definitely is.  i hope this was informative.  EDIT: i recognize that there are many problematic people within the transmed community. the individuals who harass and misgender others absolutely do not speak for us. most transmeds you will meet will respect your identity and will not expect you to fill any kind of mold, as we recognize that gender roles are mostly arbitrary. most transmeds you will meet will hate terfs. most transmeds you will meet will only define their beliefs as what i described here (ie a disconnect, not distress.) most transmeds you will meet respect nb people. the shitty ones dont speak for us."

Please please please make them shut up, I'm almost to the point where I'm willing to do anything."
"Thank you very much. This was incredibly insightful and I greatly appreciate it. I'm a CIS feminist and I know a lot of people who needed this conversation to happen. In an attempt to be an ally, often times I don't have the words to explain the importance of the difference between displaying gender stereotypes and the outward presentation by trans women in an attempt to present as women in public spaces. Your experience helped me be a more informed person in these conversations. So thank you again."
"Trans non-binary person asking here: did @contrapoints put the word ‘female’ in the description ironically? I’ll be the first to admit sometimes I’m just not cool or smart enough to tell when she’s being ironic. Like when I first encountered her videos I thought she was a far right but job, basically the trans equivalent of milo youanopolis (again, I USED to think all that about Points)"
"Does anyone else feel like the labels 'tif' and 'tim' are kind of inaccurate? I feel like saying I identify as trans implies that I would still be trans no matter what I was biologically. I don't identify as trans. I identify as a man, and I'm trans because that identity doesn't align with my biology."
"I can’t watch any of your videos just once — I keep coming back, and there’s always something new to learn, or a joke that’s so much funnier the third, fifth or tenth time I hear it.  Thank you for being you, and for doing it publicly"

"Paused to react at 20:58    I learned about transsexual people, re: transgender now, in the 90s and early 00s, watching HBO when I shouldn't have.    Regardless, I know that I have felt attraction to a trans person and have many friends who make no bones about who they bone. To me, the points on typical male sexuality, as presented here, shows that they are bro-like in nature - largely true, but I've noticed a schism from the mainstream opinion on this, from my younger friends, in the Bible Belt to where they are attracted to the person, rather than certain gender signals.    True intimacy - the kind to have a fundamentally profound effect on the people involved - is, in itself, gender-less, so I understand the issue (issue meaning how someone could or could not be attracted to a trans person) to that point, but being open minded to people as individuals and specific about how you express love is the deeper issue at hand. I tend to get lost in generalities, because they often have an implications that I'm unaware of, but this gender non-conforming (to borrow a term) part of cis-male sexuality is often omitted in these 'in defense of...' conversations. Yes, I am attracted to women, but is it because they are women or because they present as women? I've asked myself this question and many others like that, finding that I'm a lot more open to things when I take the time to figure them out, or at least come to an understanding.    My actual question to you would be, do think that you and other trans people (not to be too general here) will have an easier time dating or being seen as possible paramours to people at large in the future? A follow-up, if someone where attracted to a trans person, how could they reasonably distinguish true attraction or close to as possible, and not merely as adherence to fetishistic tendencies?   Honestly, I have trouble doing both of these when it comes to a relationship with a bio-woman (how the fuck does any of it work there?!), meaning the differences are massive, but the thing that has bound me to those 'people', rather than 'women', would be the thing that reflected back to me about myself something that made them happy. Example: holding me to my word knowing that I want to be doing that for myself, but sometimes need a hand in achieving. Very vague and loss terminology there, but I think you'll understand the intimacy to which I'm referring.   Appreciate any words in response.    P.S. - I think your tits looked great."

"I respect the effort but she resorted to dogma. Also telling men they have no place in these conversations is garbage. Gender and sexuality issues can’t be lead by a ideology centered on one sex/gender identity aligned with that sex. If men can transition to women or other gender identities then men too have a place in the conversation about gender identities regardless of how they choose to identify.   The gate keeping BS needs to stop. It’s a authoritarian power play by people who want to tell people how to think and feel without having to bother with dissent. Dissent may not feel good but making people feel good isn’t the end all be all when trying to make a just society. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. That’s what the activists keep telling everyone else."

"The transphobia present in so much radical feminist writing has always puzzled me, because when I was just starting out examining the world-view with which I had been raised (Fundamental Christianity/Reactionary conservatism) reading radfem/second-wave theory helped me grok transphobia and I came to many of the same conclusions you argue for in your video. The stuff I read didn't really talk about transwomen specifically, but it wasn't hard to see that restrictive gender and sexual roles meant that a transwoman who felt most authentically herself when not wearing makeup or stereotypically feminine clothing basically had no way to take on the 'woman' social role without sacrificing something about herself. I thought it would be totally natural for transpeople and rad-fems who wanted to do away with gender roles entirely to be staunch allies. Then I started lurking on radfem forums and message boards and was completely flabbergasted that the people who had most influenced me to become less transphobic at first were saying horrible things about transwomen!  Anyways, what I'm really saying Ms. Wynn, is thank you for putting into words things that I've turned over in my head for a long time but struggled to express.  Also: Your inner-radfem is a shitheel but she has amazing style. I want that hat."
"Contra points is GOOD. Drills down hard into the nuance and complexity and reality...also the comedy and the tragedy of things. Trans, Terf, Feminist, Conservative, Radical....yikes...tangled web. Natalie is clearly on to something in the feminist gender critical sub Reddit. That something is a visceral reptile brain hatred of men. That hatred surely has its provenance in all sorts of lived experiences of real women...but it is hatred non the less, and it is good to call it what it is. And right wing 4chan ridicule on the other side? That has some visceral hatred of women going on mutatis mutandis style. True enough. The MISSING bit in all this? Clearly, no primary concern for the welfare of trans people themselves. So. Just hatred on all sides right Natalie? Eeeeeeeyeaaaahweeeelllnnonotreally. Where there IS proper concern for the health of trans people there are other things to think about. Those things include properly critical questions about the utility of powerful drugs and irrevocable surgery. Those concerns can be expressed in harsh terms. Yeah. Or one might just say Natalie is just FINE as is. Why would drugs and surgery make Natalie better than just as is?"

"But does gender really exist?  If it does does it exist as a feeling?  I am biologically male and I have always been conflicted about the expectations society has put upon me because of my male body/appearance.  I have no say, either i conform and feel non-conflicted or I don't conform and feel conflicted.  Perhaps gender is just the expectation put upon me by society based on my body.  So then gender is partly intrinsic and partly social construction - one that it seems I cannot escape from because it is socially constructed from something that is biologically real - my body.  But we can either make peace with the societal responsibilities of our sexed bodies or just accept that our body does not define us and we are not defined by it.  I have never regretted having my body.  I just dislike the rigid expectations that society places on my body.  I resist being expected to do anything that I have not freely chosen.  So, to me it is not the body that is the problem, it is an overly rigid society that that creates the conflict.  So, don't change your body, change society, or change your internalisation of society's expectations.   Be stronger and rise above society, don't feel you have to change your body to fit gender roles that do not coincide with your body.  Just be who you are regardless of your body.  I have never felt male or female,  I just exist in the body i was given.  Expectations exist.  But don't let them define you.  Define yourself.    Trans people say they experience dysphoria - a deep unease with their body that they say can only be overcome by physically transitioning or embodying the opposite sex.  But is this really true? (I of course cannot ever truly know because I have not experienced it, but nonetheless I think the question is worth asking).  I wonder if the dysphoria is not just a defense mechanism against the conflict of not conforming to the expectation placed upon one's body.  One then begins to despise one's body rather than the expectation itself.  This is further enhanced when we are told that gender is a real identifiable intrinsic identity.  It isn't.  It is something we can create in our heads.  All identities are.  There are no identities.  I have a male body but I am not male.  Male is just a word, a label for something that is real - my body.  And I am not even my body,  I just exist within it.  I am not even an I.    Is transgenderism just  neurosis then?  A sophisticated sort of neurosis?  A serious problem of identity?  Which we are told can only be solved with more identity.  But what if Identity is the problem?  Changing identity is not going to solve the problem of feeling that there is something wrong with your identity.  The healthiest thing to do is realise there is no identity and just live with the reality that you have.  This of course is not easy when society imposes its will upon you.  But fuck society."

Maybe I misheard, but at least here where I live, associating fish and women is derogative, as there's this old awful notion that vaginas smell likw fish and there is this whole issue where young girls grow up hearing this and tend to hate their bodies and undermine other women. Aside from this, loved the video! Gonn binge watch the channel right now."

"To be honest, as a former gas station attendant, the vast majority of us don't give a crap what gender you are / were / want to be / present as. Just don't steal anything and don't hang around and talk in a slow spot when we finally get the chance to mop the floor. That's all I ever cared about at least...  On another note, you impress me.  I don't agree with everything you say in every video, but overall, I've been impressed."
"Terfs kinda sound like incels. Its scary."
"This video is valid in every way"
"Being a TERF must be such a lonely fucking existence. Nobody who's into social justice wants anything to do with you because you're a bigot. The only people you could possibly be allied with are the bigots on the right, but most of them are completely unreceptive to any kind of 'femnazi'. And even if they did treat you with kindness, they'd be the type of patriarchy-defending fascist that would want you as a woman to get back into line and take care of hearth and home while they make the decisions for you.   I'd feel bad for TERFs if they weren't such shitty people."
"I don't understand when women complain about street harassment, men talking over them or treating first dates like they are going to die. I've had creepy old men flirt with me yeah, and some assholes talk over me, but if I have to be honest, women are so much worst about talking over me. Also, if you have to treat the first date as if your going to die, wtf are you doing? Granted I don't date alot, I've found my person and we are both happy. Periods. I. Have. Never. Been. Shamed. For. My. Period. My dad made jokes if he was with me when I had to buy some pads. That's the worst thing. Men don't want to hear about the blood, me (and most women I know) don't want hear about ball sweat or random boners or whatever happens down there.    Sorry about the rant. Those are my thoughts.  Edit: sorry I can't stand that women still act like victims then say they are warriors."

"'its hard to talk about tough topics like gender' continues to gloss over actual points and 'wouldnt you rather eat a bowl of thumb tacs'  thats why its so hard to talk about because people like this MAN (has penis) continues to place there fingers in there ears and go 'lalalalalalalalala' until there right. 1 main point that gets glossed over by people like this that makes me believe that these people do no actually care about the trans community is the massive lack of talk about the incredibly high suicide rate (both pre-op and post-op(can actually increase post)) CLASSIC TREND TRANS"
"Great video! I'm a huge fan! You're amazing, girl! Could you please do a video about swiftboating/projection and channels like Prager U and Turning Point USA? I would love to hear your perspective."
"but u a man tho? wat?"
"19:50 Transmedicalism is not about 'agonizing dysphoria' and 'despising your body', it's about… well, just dysphoria. If you believe that in order to be trans you have to have dysphoria, you're a transmedicalist. That's it, nothing more."
"Why do leftists care so much about gender?"

"Ok, i like your content and you as a person. I have disagree, this time, on the 'race-realist, is the same as a racist'-quote though. A race-realist uses sientific data, to proof that race is a real thing. That there are different races, with different properties. Not qualities, properties. A racist also belives that race is a real thing, usually without any data to back it up with and values people differently, according to certain qualities he asigns to these races. So the first thing is a politically neutral stance, that can be an interesting factor, when looking at anthroplogy, history and stuff like that, the latter is clearly a right wing policy, that values people differently from the time of their birth."

"6:00 the point you are making within this timestamp is extraordinarily disingenuous. these are legitimate questions that are being asked because they deserve answers, not because they intend to inflame or delegitimize trans persons identities. This is why people cannot take either Trans nor Rad fems seriously in this debate. And it's why you're better off approaching the construction and development of gender from a place that isn't ridden with ideology rooted in trauma."

"Question: If the tweet about menstruators just said women and you yourself and/or trans people identify as a woman, isn't the tweet being 'all-inclusive' anyway?"
"This cis woman loves you and this brilliant video. The thing about TERFs or gender critical people or whatever is that they are the same type of people as any fundamentalists, they think that broadening definitions is somehow hurtful to them. The thing about cis women is that our own level of gender based oppression is radically different between any 2 different cis women and therefore basing womenhood on some kind of expected level of oppression or pain that we all experience is idiotic. I just wanted to say that....."

"Your genitals at birth do not determine what life you can live... It's called being your own person despite what others think. Sure, you can be killed, hurt, spat on by stupid people, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to live a certain way. Your genitals tell you if you are male, female, or intersex (which there are 4 variations of, all either having one dominate functioning sex organ, or none, to which it doesn't matter, because you probably look like either a male or female, can can do whatever you want). You cannot TRANSITION from one sex to another; it is impossible. What you can do is live your life how you see fit. People shouldn't be shunned for being different, though, I would never humiliate someone who decides to dress a certain way. I take a stance against you requiring others to conform to your understanding of gender, which is biologically wrong in humans.  Here is an article titled 'Sex Change: Physically Impossible, Psychosocially Unhelpful, and Philosophically Misguided' by a Ryan T. Anderson on Mar. 5th, 2018: https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/03/21151/"
"As a ciswoman, here's what I say about transfemininity if asked for my $0.02: You are a woman if that's how you identify. You and I are not the same kind of woman and never will be, and that's ok. There are different ways of being a woman and you create your own womanhood. If you're looking to have the same cultural/societal experience of womanhood that I (as a ciswoman) do, prepare to be disappointed, because biology is like, an actual thing that majorly informs cultural/societal experience, regardless of gender identity (#unpopulartruth... that goes for any and every human, by the way... no one is immune to biological truth or cultural/societal realities, neither of which care about gender identity or dysphoria). Do our differences in womanhood make you less valid or somehow unequal? No. Should our differences in womanhood be ignored? Also no. We can't all be the same, nor should we try. To sum it up, transfeminine women will never be the same as ciswomen, and that shouldn't be perceived negatively because it isn't a negative thing, and there are so many ways to be a woman so now it's up to our cultures/societies to make space for transpeople."
"Thank you so much for making such an elaborate video!"
"I have always felt very strongly that people should love and accept themselves for who they are and that you should never buy into the belief that thier is something wrong with the way you were born (aka 'God makes no mistakes'). For this reason trans people conflict with my personal philosophy. If I had a child who was trans I would try had to raise them to believe they can be whatever they want. A feminine man or a masculine woman but that thier is nothing wrong with the body they were given. Ideally they would learn to love and accept themselves without the need to take medication or have surgery to alter thier body. But I never bring this up with trans people I assume they will disagree and their lives are difficult enough without having to field questions from me. And it is unreasonable to expect people to live thier lives in accordance with my own personal philosophy. They dont owe me an explanation I just use whatever pronouns they want me to, treat them with kindess, and keep my thoughts to myself."

"I hit peak trans after discovering how deeply misogyny underpins my friends' genderspecial identities.   Some context: These (all female) friends would, in a simpler time, just be called nerds. They're a little socially weird. They're not necessarily interested in conventional beauty standards and not romantically confident. A handful are bisexual but torn about pursuing women. (Which, as a lesbian, I fully get and don't want to dismiss.)   All of this has combined into pure, uncut old-school misogyny. Some examples:   * Being nonbinary is just 'not like other girls' on steroids, right? Because my friends who identify that way insist that they don't like lipstick and \[insert stereotyped-as-frivolous piece of media here\] and that's how they Knew All Along that their gender identity was different.     * Any woman they admire is automatically 'butch' or 'gender nonconforming' or 'they/them' in their eyes. A lawyer in a skirt-suit with flowing hair and lipstick? Gender non-conforming bc she goes to court. A figure skater? Butch, because look at her muscles. It's like womanhood is only weakness, incompetence, and passivity in their view.     * 'She won't date me because I'm trans,' has become a really useful weapon. Suddenly, the pretty straight girls aren't just... straight. They're vile, toxic, abusive monsters, oppressing smol soft trans bois.     * In a frankly jaw-dropping conversation, a couple of them insisted that unwanted pregnancy is a horror unique to trans men because of the attendant dysphoria. What about women with no access to reproductive healthcare, you may ask? Eh, they're probably fine with it. Because having a fetus you don't want take over your body for nine months wouldn't provoke any complicated feelings, no ma'am.   Thankfully, I've never experienced physical violence or social ostracism from the trans community. My story is much less dire than many in these threads. But it's just so fucking exhausting and demoralizing to see young women hate themselves and other women, with an entire echo chamber of support around them."
"This was refreshing and informative! Thank you!"
"ContraPoints! There is a debate raging on Facebook about what your MBTI personality type is. So, what is it?"
"I was really interested with the clip you included of the Native American woman. I’m Indigenous and our understanding of gender includes “Two-Spirit” which is a little different than some current Western concepts like “transgender/non-binary.” It might something interesting for you to investigate :)"
"FYI I am a woman with a man's brain. [And soo far, I've been fortunate--he hasn't hunted me down and demanded it back yet :D] Okay, we have long been integrated into society as tom-boys. Males have not had this advantage. but brains Do go through their own separate gender transformation."

"Holy fuck, 10:42, you look amazing"
"Ok, I'm only one minute in, but holy crap, I didn't realise Germaine Greer was such a cunt. Even if this person she encountered was, say, an overstepping drag queen, it still stands to reason that any prominent feminist voice worth its salt is inevitably doing something for the acceptance of femininity, and thus reducing the perceived lowering of male worth upon adoption of femininity. So, sorry bitch, but you probably did do something for them. You can certainly be put off by perceived overstepping, but you don't have to be such a body shaming cunt about it, sheesh.And people wonder why feminists are perceived as man haters."

"I am someone who’s been kind of on the fence, but I’m at least glad you’re individually addressing the concerns of radfems, even if I largely disagree with your video. But I wish people would stop characterizing all radfems (or people who are questioning) as only hating trans people under the guise of feminism— speaking for both myself and many I have met, we are actually genuinely open to a dialogue and to even have our minds changed if you convince us (speaking mostly for people leaning that way, anyway). I know there’s way too many that unfortunately just don’t care about feminism and just spend time hating trans people and triggering their dysphoria, and that’s not cool. But the portrayal of all radfems as man-haters who want trans people dead has only driven me further towards their side tbh, because it’s so rare for me to see people actually engage them head-on without resorting to insults or chants. This channel actually does a pretty good job of addressing the arguments of white nationalists and alt-righters, so it would be nice to see someone at least tackle the concerns of radfems instead of attacking a strawman depiction. This vid is at least kinda doing that though, better than previous videos. I’m especially glad you acknowledged the male socialization bit. Very few trans activists gave a satisfactory answer for that one, but I’ll think hard about this video."
"you are not a woman"
"@ContraPoints You make fun of your voice a lot so I'll just put this out there-- you do have a funny lisp to me, but the only other example I can think of of Baltimorian speech (I've heard) are John Waters films, and of course you fit right in in those, but I'm not sure why. OTOH your videos from Before you don't have the same patterns of speech, so I dunno.  On the Other Other Hand I'm from Minnesota originally and in my experience women and men in Minnesota have different accents, the accent women have is 'marked...'  I guess the question I ask is, do you feel like your change in identification has changed not just the tone of your voice but also how you speak? (I am a dialogue editor on movies so this is just kinda my thing.)"
"COME ON TITS!!!"
"My dad ain't a TERF, just confused, but I'll never forget when I came out to him as a trans man and he asked, 'How can you be sure you aren't just a butch lesbian?' Well dad, I dont know about your definition of lesbian, but mine does not include 'immense desire and thirst for dick'.  Checkmate TERFs, gay trans men exist."
"Abortion is not a right."
"I was gonna make a comment about your costumes and how much fun you seem to have with your videos, but then you hit me right in the feels with your speech on the inner disgust that trans people can feel. I’ve been on hormones for over a year, and I still mostly present as male, partly to avoid conflict in public and partly because I know that presenting as female will bring up both positive and negative thoughts within myself"
"This goes hard"
"The fundamental issue here is that sex is a defined protected category, and sex segregated spaces exist because women have been marginalized from the social structure for the longest time. I dont give a damn if you wanna put on paint face and dresses. I dont give a damn if you want to use big earrings. WHATEVER. What I do care about is having to share sex segregated spaces with you and any other transwoman. Go make your own spaces.   A few weeks ago a transgirl (underage) was accepted into an all girls school, here where I live. So, fuck all parents and girls that wanted and paid for a girls only school because this boy whishes are more important, I guess?  So you start this video talking about fair debate but then you end up with that quote? I dont find you beautiful. Probably many people do. But get this: is not about beauty. Is about sex as a protected quality. And particulary about female humans."
"I am neither adult, human, nor a female, so i don't know what that intro is all about"
"I reject transwomen being women. Why dont you make your own word? We ARE different. You know it and recognize it even here. We have some things in common but we dont share many. So WHY should we be called the same?  Why you even want to be called women, when you are not and never will? The same way I am not and never will be transexual. THAT made no sense to me, at all."
"I prefer gender nihilism, thank you very much. No one is a man or woman outside biology."
"No"
"You're wonderful."
"Hi Natalie would you consider looking at gaming in a future video? It's a really fraught subject for me as I can appreciate various problematic aspects (of gaming) but it also seems like indie games are beginning to open up the space and experiences that games can offer... There's also the whole playing as characters that don't correspond with your real-world / meatspace gender (speaking as a Jill Valentine / Claire Redfield / Chun Li fan)... plus the costumes would be amazing. I know requests like this are a bit lame but a Contrapoints tactical nuclear strike on the worst aspects of gaming would be a thing of great beauty..."

"Thank you so much for this one--it really helped clarify a lot of my rather muddy thoughts on the subject, and put names to things I wasn't aware had names. I wonder if you might be interested in unpacking this, for the lack of a better word, 'debate'--the 'unfairness' of trans women being in competitive sports. I just had a FB friend post this clip about it, and it pissed me off in the same muddy way 'gender critical' did--like some parts *seem* to make *some* sense, but there is a bid current of fucked-up-edness that I, a relatively clueless-on-the-subject cis Gen Xer, am at a loss to unpack. Here's the clip (oh, the spelling--like nails on a freaking blackboard): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAGdZKLMCc&feature=share&fbclid=IwAR0bCl25El_u8xRWN7Vte7q5A4FX0nbCnwm8Lg_88W5k4Rc3-yo-BI6-h_s"

"I’m thinking of showing some of your videos to my mom. She and I have always butted heads on trans issues. Most of her transphobia comes from my father, I think. My dad left the family to transition (I hate her for reasons unrelated to her gender), and she used to openly insult and say horrible, dehumanizing things about trans people around me. I think you’d be a good example of how trans people are people, not a hive mind, but individuals. I love your videos! ❤️"
"Ending patriarchy is also an utopic pipe line dream and you are not mocking it. You could be an abolitionist and dont feel the need to attack trans People. Im an abolitionist and Im part of the national campain that promotes a trans law in Uruguay. Abolishing gender is a valid aim"
"whats up radfem.. have u abolished gender today?? you have not???? come ooooon radfem"
"Radfem and terf is not the same. You can be a radfem because you want to abolish prostitution and gender, or because you thing that equality should not be the goal of feminism and not be transfobic."
"Is that meant to sound like Germaine Greer at the beginning? If so, you've failed dismally."
"Natalie, i adore you. But radical feminist and terf is not synonimus. You can be a radfem and be trans inclusive in your activisim."
"you're so pretty without make up wow"
"Are there no people that are suspicious of gender as a thing, but know that people get to decide their own gender based on whatever they want?"
"Wait no men allowed? why are you here. You still have that y chromosome right? yeah you are a dude. Because science  if you are a man trapped in a woman’s body, great. be a man, wear dresses. this is america. But when your ego is so threatened that you have to change your physical shell in order to satisfy that ego, that’s a fucking problem.  you need a doctor. let’s list out some hypocrisy.  1) Blue and pink shouldn’t dictate gender. Yet if my boy played with his sisters barbies, you’ll ASSUME he wants to be a woman. Soooo....pink does mean girls?....  2) Well i don’t need a pussy to be a woman but you need to lop of your cock wtf? if you are a woman accept your dick and put your ego to the side and just act like a girl. No ones stopping you.  3) Transitioning will make us trannies feel better. Statistics show the complete opposite. Non transitioning men (who feel like women) tend to carry lower suicide rates than those who had.   You are doing some real nasty work to breakdown personal identities. For a group of folk so focused on “being yourself” you sure love pushing your culture on impressionable children who are way too fucking young to know what this ramifications of hormone can therapy have on a child.    btw you still look like a dude. And sound like one. And if i look under a microscope. look at that, that’s a y chromosome. oh science. Your facts are so ignorable   Keep reinforcing the gender constructs as an argument for destroying gender constructs. fucking idiot"
"I'm from Brazil, I like radical feminism, I disagree with some things in this video but I love it! I think the way you discuss difficult issues is so precious and hard to achieve, specially nowadays and on the internet. Your videos are wonderful. I was called a TERF once because I wanted to talk about women dying and getting arrested for abortions in a facebook group, very common in my country because abortion is prohibited, so I got kinda traumatized, and confused, about transactivism, so your video is extremely important. There is much misunderstanding in both sides so I'm glad someone with a great audience like you makes those videos, funny but not offensive, very informative and rational, it's hard to find material like this, most people are extreme to one side or the other because it's easier, like you said. Thank you for this, and for the Jordan Peterson video, that was the video about him I'd been waiting for! Sorry if my english is messy  :p"

They are being expected to use cover warnings for talking about FGM in case it offends a trans woman in feminist spaces.. Great, you don’t care or insist on that. How is that helpful though? Why not talk about the issue instead of pretending it doesn’t exist just because you don’t personally care?"
"Joe Rogan  pod cast brought me here.  Need to see where the guest was getting his info from.  I Think Natalie would be better at explaining the issues better than Adam Conover.  And I knew Natalie was male soon as i saw this vid :) I live in Seattle in what use to be a very gay/trans area.  I forfeit my prize :)"

"I really do not think that it's possible to abolish gender, and I'm not certain it would be beneficial to anyone... similar to taking salt and pepper out of dish in order to make thing more uniformed. However, I do agree that (and I've had this conversation with a few others) going through the idea of surgical reassignment in order to obtain 'passibility' as a woman is just placing yourself through mutilation for the confirmation of others... and I hate the idea that anyone thinks they have to mutilate (and I am using that word because I feel that it is a form of mutilation, much my foreskin removal, breast augmentation, plastic surgery for the unmaned, etc) themselves to reinforce a structure is fluid; regardless of how ignorant asswipes think it's not.    Not that I would force anyone to not go through with it - it's your body!"

"I like the video but what you said about transmedicalists is misinformed. They don’t believe you need agonising dysphoria to be trans or that you should despise your body. Instead, they believe you need at least SOME degree of gender dysphoria (which includes both dysphoria and ”euphoria”) in order to be trans"

"Thank you for questioning the 'Born This Way' dogma. Beyond the fatalistic undertones, this argument undermines the validity of choice. If I choose to leave gender roles behind, that's a valid choice which I made for myself, and that choice affects only me. In fact, I went through many gender identities before deciding that I don't want one - and all of that is okay."
"Are you going to talk about the Peterson and Zizek circle jerk? Er - I mean, 'debate.'"
"i need that 'actuallyyyyy kropotkin' clip on standby forever"
"I forever will love all of your videos, and I do love this one, but I would disagree that all gender critical people are TERFs. I call myself 'Gender Critical' because I am critical of how we as a society view gender and gender roles, on men and women, trans people and cis people - as someone who used to identify as agender due to pressures put on me in a period of my life by certain individuals who had an issue with my lack of desire to present and express myself in a feminine way. I walk in a lot 'trans medicalist' spaces and 'gender critical' spaces (they're often the same spaces, as they share a lot - but not all - of the same views of the world) because those are the only places where I feel like I can have discussions about my experience with gender and sex as a system of oppression without being pulled into the 'internet shaming session of the week.' (as of writing this comment , I have been doxed twice.)  While I do see a lot of TERFs in those spaces, that is certainly not a term that I would use to describe all of us. I'm in a Transmed/Gender Critical Facebook group, and we do not suffer the TERFs (let the almighty banhammer rain down upon them), but we spend a lot of time analyzing gender from a critical viewpoint, including how gender roles develop different through culture and customs. I just wish that there were other places that I could have those discussions without fearing for my safety."
"It was your voice that gave you away for me. You are funny as shit don't agree with all your points on your videos. Found you from a Joe Rogan talk with Adam Conover. I see you as left-leaning comedian talking about politics. You're kind of like the polar opposite of Steven Crowders louder with Crowder where he is the right-leaning comedian talking about politics. Only watched about five or six videos but so far you are the bomb keep it up great work. I've laughed my ass off so many times already so far my favorite parts are your talks with the lizard people LOL."

"I'm really happy you talked about the socialization / privilege thing with nuance.  I'm a non-binary afab person, and although generally, I have some space to talk about what I have with being afab, I feel that it's more difficult when friends I have who are on the mtf spectrum to talk about it. I think we're a bit too obsessed in SJ with categorisation and creating a oppression hierarchy, when it's not that simple?   My Grannie is a cis lesbian born in 1940, one of the people in her community of elder queers, was a trans woman from the same area born in the same time. My grannie had her education while a single mother, her friend got her education directly after high school, and did not have the same level of poverty. It's fair to say that in a way, the fact that as a young adult she was able to go to university, when my grannie had to get married and have children was a result of her 'male privilege' In 1950's Canada, it's pretty clear that being presented as a man made education more attenable.   On the other hand this same difference can be in situations where there isn't a privelege to attribute it to. My brother is a straight cis man, and I'm a Queer, We have different fathers, his was a drug addict white supremacist, and mine was a drug addict ambiguous race francophone. Other than the age at which our mum was when we were had, my brother out privileges me. Yet he is currently attending his postgrad while going through a separation, and with two kids, and started his undergrad with one of those kids, while working full time. I'm in university not directly out of high school due to medical issues, but I've never had to work, I'm living on campus, my only responsibilities are to attend class and remember to eat (and not die, literally my mum's only rule for me is to not die). This is because my mum is in a better financial position, being the youngest child, my mum can work and has no other responsibilities so it's much easier for her to afford my tuition and housing. Also because of my medical situation I get more grants than my brother could have. I am the same as my Grannie's friend to my brother.  And I think that creates an issue because people need to be allowed to feel that difference.  My grannie's friend has no issue with their relationship, they are very close, and they both agree that for the most part her friend got more opporotunities as a child, but my grannie faces fewer issues in their current circumstance.   But people of my generation think, but she believes in male privilege for trans women so she's a TERF. Which she's not. It's frustrating on one end I think for intergrenerational co-operation in the queer community, I think that buy and large, people in my grannie's generation are a lot more likely to be in a situation where their 'male socialisation' has materially benefited them than those in my generation, on the other hand, people in my generation are able to come out at 13 and maybe that's a privelege of time.   But I think what's more important, is that we try and put away the hierarchy and accept what people's personal struggles are. And not everyone will have the same ones. I don't have the same struggles as my brother or my mum or my grannie, and at some point you have to just let people say, well that doesn't really apply to me, but we don't need to compare, I'm sure that was difficult and although my experiences are different I know the general feeling you're describing.   I don't know what it's like to be denied education based on my gender, but my grannie does, and my grannie doesn't know what it's like to have a doctor misgender her, but I do. And that's a lot more how it is than some hierarchy of oppression.  P.S. feel free to ask clarifying questions it's 9am and I didn't sleep all night so this might be a bit hard to parse."

"just a friendly reminder that i am neither real nor valid!!!"
"I really love this video! <3  I am a cisgender female feminist and I am a bit surprised that I agree with you on...well EVERYTHING you said here.  I don't believe in female and male brains, female or male souls and I wish we could just stop gender everything. But that doesn't mean I don't believe in gender as a psychological and sociological concept which is very real.  The identity of a person is formed in the early childhood (this includes the sexual identity). And because we human are very complex creatures we don't evolve always as expected or wished.  When someone with a female body can evolve a female gender so can someone with a male body and the other way around. Both is real and valid.  And just because there are differences between trans and cis women doesn't mean some of them aren't 'real women'. Everyone has their own experiences. And trans women suffer a lot under discrimination and bullying, to say otherwise is just wrong and ignorant. I hope more cisgender people think about that and come to the conclusion that gender is not necesserily linked to the biological sex.  I don't know how it is to be trans but I am very empathic. It's not hard to see the struggles trans people have in our society. I also have DID (dissociative identity disorder also known as multible identity disorder) and some male alters. Of couse it is not the same (not even close!) to being trans but still I have to accept that my mind formed male personalities in a female body. I think this is fascinating and it also made me think about gender a lot.  I am angry about these 'terfs' because they call themselves feminists but all they do is divide us women from each other. And I don't get why they refuse to believe in the concept of sex and gender. They believe only in biological sexes which makes them more comparable to the mysogynists in the 19. centurary then to feminism in general.   In this case: make sisters, not cisters!"
"Gas station attendent? Those were abolished in my stae"
"15:00"
"The weird creep hitting on you in the comment section is back, and she just wanted to say: Great video as always. The 'being catcalled as a nine-year-old'-Part really hit home for me and made me squirm all over again. I had (still have) the misfortune to live in a body that developed into catcalling-material for creepy old men before my age reached 2 digits. I actually can't remember a time where weird old men _weren't_ drawn to flirt with me on bus stations. But I refuse to say that this experience was crucial for me to shape me into the woman I am today."
"Gender critical feminist here (dont call myself a radical feminist because I dont agree with radical feminism on several points):  Gender metaphysics:    You've failed to address the reason why we even need gender metaphysics. How can we measure or discuss discrimination against women if anyone who feels like a woman is a woman? There are many trans people who identify as one gender but are read as, and therefore treated as, the opposite gender by the majority of people they encounter. Do you think that those girls and women who are forced to sleep in huts when they're menstruating could just declare 'actually, I'm a man' and be allowed to sleep in their beds?  Also, its medically necessary to differentiate between male and female humans. Certain diseases present differently in men and women, autism is one example. Only women need cervical smears and only men need prostate exams. There are very glaringly obvious differences in the anatomy of men and women. Your definition of 'woman' makes that extremely difficult to talk about. Your concept of gender seems completely pointless and seems to serve no useful purpose in society, so it seems to me it would be better to define 'man' as 'adult human male' and 'woman' as 'adult human female' so that we can use these words to describe meaningful categories of people for sociological and biological purposes.  Gender stereotypes:  While I'm very glad that you understand womanhood isn't related to femininity, but I've never actually heard a trans person describe what it is that they identify with besides gender stereotypes. That's probably because the idea of having an internal 'gender identity' is bullshit. I have absolutely no idea how it feels to be a man or how any of the men that I know feel about being a man, so how could I possibly say that I 'identify' as a man. What could I possibly being identifying with?  I actually used to identify as non-binary between the ages of 19 and 20 because I used to hear transwomen talking all the time about this strong gender identity that they felt and I just don't have that feeling. I thought that the way I felt about myself must be different to how women feel, therefore I must not be a woman. Then I realised that they way I feel about myself as a woman may well be very similar to how lots of other women feel. I realised I was being incredibly self absorbed in thinking that I wasn't like any other women so therefore I must not be a woman. Luckily, I grew out of it and realised that I am an adult human female and I may as well call myself a woman for clarity, but that my 'gender identity' is such a wishy-washy concept, and a concept that has so little use to anyone, including myself, that I should just stop worrying about it. I see so many people on youtube and tumblr who spend so much of their lives thinking about their gender identity and I just want to shake them and tell them to snap out of it.  Abolish gender:  Bodies are not 'gendered', bodies have a sex. Having a penis or having boobs are not gender stereotypes, they are biological markers. Same with voice pitch. Men have bigger larynges. You make a video addressing gender critical feminist arguments but you can't even seem to differentiate between sex and gender. If you want to argue that sex and gender are the same, then you should have made a case for it in your video, because you're addressing a group of people who believe that gender and sex are not the same. This really takes away from the persuasiveness of your arguments.   Also, radical feminists are absolutely critical of female celebrities who pander to the male gaze, encourage men to objectify them to make money, and then claim its empowering, including Kim Kardashian.  Male privilege:   I will concede that there is an annoying subset of feminists (of all schools of thought) who act like they're the most oppressed ever because they're women even though they're middle class and white. (There is a similar set of middle class white gay men). These types of people tend to be very ignorant of the experiences of other people. I will also concede that you yourself are probably treated by others as either a woman, or as a gender non conforming man. Gender non conforming people (including butch women, effeminate men, and trans people) face their own set of struggles and it would be stupid to argue that transwomen benefit from some sort of privilege IF they're wearing a dress and make up.  However, using your definition as a transwoman as 'anyone who identifies as a woman or wants to be a woman', not all transwomen are going to look like women or like gender non conforming men. Some of them are just going to look like men, complete with suits and ties, balding heads and beards, but because they internally identify as women, they are women, according to you. These transwomen absolutely benefit from male privilege.  This is where transgender theory creates a catch 22 for itself. If you say that any person who has some internal subjective feeling that they are a women is a woman, then you have argued that some women can benefit from male privilege. If you say that transwomen have to be doing something to attempt to look feminine, then you have resorted to gender stereotypes.  Male Socialisation:  I agree with you here but I will emphasis your point that many vocal transgender activists do not agree with you, so its still a very valid concern for gender critical feminists to raise. I have heard people argue that even Bruce Jenner was always a woman and therefore never experienced male socialisation or male privilege. Also, pointing out that women 'don't know what its like' to be trans is further proof that transwomen are not women, but are instead a separate group of people with their own struggles and oppression. There are some overlaps, but they're not the same and they don't stem from the same place.   Reproductive Oppression/Erasing female language:  Unfortunately, many trans activists get angry when women frame reproductive oppression as a women's rights issue because its 'cisnormative' or even 'white feminism' to do so (whatever that means). There were transwomen who were upset that women at the womens march wore 'pussy hats' for example. Reproduction isnt something that every women goes through, nor is it something that every woman views in the same way, but abortion, child birth, unwanted pregnancies etc are things that only women go through, and therefore women's rights movements should be allowed to centre these issues in their activism without push back from trans people.   TERF is a slur:  I dont really care if someone wants to call me a terf since I genuinely do hold beliefs that are 'transphobic', TERF is thrown around to silence women who have any concerns at all about where we are going as a society in terms of acceptable discourse about gender and sex, and it is exclusively used towards women. Also, the whole 'this word is violent' bit is complete projection, its usually trans people who are claiming that referring to someone as the wrong thing is violence. I do agree with you that a lot of radical feminists use terms that are dehumanising (like referring to a person as 'it'), or deliberately mean and hurtful and I don't think that is particularly helpful so I don't do that myself.  Conclusion:   I actually decided to stop using tumblr altogether because the transwomen and the radical feminists on their were pretty ridiculous. However, there are actually genuine feminists with genuine feminist concerns regarding many issues, one of which is transgenderism. These women dont spend their time on r/gendercritical. I decided to stop using tumblr because it was actually colouring my view of transwomen in a very negative way. It is difficult to receive multiple graphic rape threats from transwomen on tumblr and not let that influence your opinion. I would suggest you stop trying to reason with the 'terfs' you are describing as just disgusted transphobes in disguise, and start appreciating that there absolutely are valid feminist concerns with the trans movement."
"I was really hoping you would actually engage with some of the real issues instead of just conflating every person online who trashes trans folks with actual gender critical ideas. I'm disappointed. You didn't engage with any of the issues surrounding concerns about legal protections being undermined (if there is no function definition of woman or female there can't be real legal protections for women or females), the potential for transitioning kids to be gay conversion therapy, or any of the real content of the serious arguments.  The end really proved that you weren't sincerely interested in engaging at all. The title and intro were just bait."
"11:23 I'm in tears XD"
"The part at the end where you discuss your own disgust at yourself and how it had you clock that transgender woman hit close to home with me, as in recent years I finally came to terms with being asexual. For the longest time I fought so hard against it (as far as to try and convince other asexuals that asexuality simply didn't exist) because I thought that there might be a 'solution' for me and everyone identifying as asexual, and that we were simply sexually/emotionally hurt people with low self-esteems and a phobia towards intimacy, or perhaps people who had some sort of of physiological problem that prevented us from sexuality.   It took a lot of soul-searching and analysis of myself to come to the realization that I might've simply come at the issue from a wrong perspective, and that my own concerns with intimacy might've been a *result* of my asexuality and the effects I feared it would have on the relationships I *did* want to establish, rather than my fear of intimacy leading to me 'feeling' asexual as a ways to protecting myself from hurt, and as an 'older' guy in his mid-twenties (when compared with how online most asexuals discussing the issue tend to be younger) I still feel some guilt for that.   Now I don't concern myself so much with whether or not asexuality is 'real' in the way people want it to be confirmed as real. I simply find it to be a valid label that doesn't invalidate me or tag me as ill, sick or psychologically damaged, and it gives me the happiness of knowing that there are other people out there like me who are still valid and yearn for the same things as me, even if the asexual community is still confused and mostly unexplored."
"Dude you have some serious issues"

"why do you put on a voice that sounds like winnie the pooh?"
"pointing out that a man can't ever become a woman, and pointing that people can't be ' assigned the wrong gender ' at birth is not  'hostility towards trans people', or 'transphobia'.   like contra says, he is a man who is living as a woman. that's the correct way to describe what transgender people are.   also no. 'non-binary' is not a real thing. everyone has a gender. And there are 2 possible genders, male and female. And no, a person can not choose which one they want to be, or change their gender at any point.   sorry, but these are facts."

"I live in a small town on Nayarit, México, although I know what you're talking about, i have no background of it, in means that I don't have to deal with any of those problems.

Como dijo Benito Juárez: 'el respeto al derecho ajeno, es la paz'   I think that the problem is that we have the need to put everything into a concept, we are brings of ideas, and if those ideas aren't what we believe, we get defensive, hateful, mad.  We should star by letting everyone live their lives, there are no correct ways of living, i don't know soy prieto y mugroso"

"Maybe its just me but the street and sexual harassment I've experienced doesn't really inform my woman hood. I don't understand that perspective. Who I am, how I behave, and what I feel does.

I do have one concern (that I know many others have as well), and I'd like to hear your perspective on this: medical intervention (such as HRT or SRS) on people under the age of 18. I keep seeing the argument that some kids who feel trans might 'grow out of it' when they hit puberty and accept their birth-assigned gender. What do you think? When do you think people can start with medical intervention? Should that even be an option or not? What are the pros and cons (also in the context of 'regret' or 'detransitioning')? Hope to see a video on this soon!"
"As a cis woman, I don't even know what womanhood is. And I don't care to know. I'm happy to be just me.  #YesAllGamers Now leave my games alone, ok"
"Male sexuality is inherently hierarchical,  Cis straight dom males are all bigots in the bedroom. They should be invited into oppression experiences in order save the rest of us, its just pragmatic. Or maybe hormone therepy could treat toxic masculinity, eather way we all have a socail responsibility to cage these rabid dogs. Seriously"
"24:46 i screammmmeddd <3 we stan"
"women needed a TRANS woman to tell them what being a woman is all about.... LOL    This is great!!!  I guess women can't see the forest for the trees, too close to it to know it or even notice it."

"15:05"
"You literally healed me with this video. I'm a nonbinary queer, and you gave me all the words I needed. Just as you used to be a man, i am still a woman. I dont experience pain, dysphoria, but I deeply want to be nonbinary. You were ready to transition into society's hatred, and I still am not. This is where trans and nonbinary people have solidarity. Society doesnt like people who are not clearly one or the other. But tbh, I had a lot of the questions TERFs had. Because as an enby, I dont wish to pass for female or male. I want to live in this in between place where I am both and neither, and that's where I cant relate to trans experiences, but I dont relate to RadFem experiences either. And finally you expressed why feminists and queers everywhere rally behind powerful trans women and people in drag. That regal posture in the face of the most deplorable treatment, that your nonconforming regality can remain untouched. It is my favorite trope to see in media, a posture so regal that lizard brain concerns dont touch them. Of course the pain still reaches through, but this energy is the energy i want to carry with me everywhere. excuse my beauty."
"i like you but you dont have a uterus, never had one, etc.  cis is made up bullshit."
"Here after r/offmychest upvoted actual terf rhetoric"
"I hope @contrapoints sees this, but I would love to hear/read her take on the debate, well one of many, between the Berlin/german left-scene. Particularly material feminists (who are inclusive of transwomen and transmen) against queer/intersectional feminists. It's quite the heated topic, and though some of her characters and video address some of the perspectives there are another nuances that seem very legitimate to me."
"Traps do not like to be called 'traps', which they think is a term of a disparagement, which it is. Fuck you"

"I really appreciate some of the 'concerns' you address in this video. I'm not a terf, and never got what they were so upset about, but there were questions mixed in there that I had wanted to ask but didn't feel comfortable doing so. Thank you for taking the time to answer them, I know this video won't give all of the answers but I do feel more knowledgeable coming away from it."
"My best friend is trans and I learn a new way in which trans people are bullied and belittled every single day. It's fucking heartbreaking."
"ah, mansplaining feminism to women, classic"
"20:58 I’m mortified that I caught that reference"
"I love this channel. It is so aesthetically pleasing, mentally engaging, hilarious, and informative."
"Very good video! I think you're right about a lot of it being grounded in lizard-brain disgust, but I think I've shared some of these 'terf' questions, not from disgust, at least I think not, but from being quizzical at what gender is. It's a very strange thing, after all. I've heard radical feminists, as they call themselves, argue that the biological reproductive appartus is a material reality, and however one identifies oneself is kind of besides the point. I guess that is the dividing line, how one comes down on how much biology conditions our bodies to look a certain way."
"you are the single best person on youtube!"
"the ending/conclusion was AMAZING 😭 thank you for this i was blessed"
"I was catcalled or something around 7 or so, and I wasn't even trans then, and sure maybe I looked more like a girl then, but not enough to be catcalled by mistake, idk what it was, but it was quite uncomfortable, also the pedophile down the road had popcicles all the time and was 'a changed man' or some shit, idfk"
"I'm like 110% less passable than you and I don't often get gendered at all, but it helps that I live in Canada maybe? Idk, but here, even the gas station guy from the gas station from hell ('oh, those are likely just maggots on the floor' was the thought that comforted me, so ya, it was bad), and I may not correct people, but it isn't too often I get missgendered by people who didn't know me pre transition, I even don't shave often because dysphoria and maybe other things make it hurt to shave even my face, so mostly I look like a guy, with long bleached hair, so far, but I am mostly not given honorary titles, people find ways to go around them in a gender neutral way, but we need gender neutral honoraries that are not weird sounding AF"
"*Your*Utopian*pipedream*is*valid* :D"
"I'm not sure that the word 'pride' really applies to the feelings that motivate TERFs, but perhaps I'm being too generous in my interpretation of their perspective. Growing up as a cis-woman is almost without exception a painful experience, and finding your way into feminism can be incredibly liberating in that suddenly your status as a woman can be something revolutionary rather than a sign that you are 'other' or inferior to men. That can (unfortunately) lead to the feeling that one's womanhood is a precious, vulnerable thing that must be viciously defended from the rest of the world. Because without the idea that women are always and only united by shared injury comes the implication that you may lose the only source of unity and strength that you have found within an identity that has been forced upon you by society."
""
"I'll admit to instinctively feeling a tiny, confused twinge of that when I first started to become more aware of trans people. Thankfully, it didn't take me very long to realize that the existence of trans women actually only makes me happy. The idea that womanhood could for certain people be a path to self-actualization or happiness gives me actual hope that the meaning of the word could genuinely change for all women. So if any trans people happen to read this overly long youtube comment, thank you for existing and sharing your beautiful selves with the world. ❤️"
"Around the sixteen minute mark you respond to the terf *ahem* concern that you benefited from male privilidge growing up and ended up an anti feminist in your early twenties. you say you feel ashamed and alone in admitting that but can I just say, changing your opinions and growing as a person publicly takes more strength of character and courage then being right all along, we all make mistakes and I don’t know anyone who wasn’t an idiot throughout their teens. The nuance and depth of understanding you give to every topic you cover is from a lifetime of learning new things, doing new things, even when they scare you and it shows. Only you could make content which manages to be simultaneously sincere and irreverent, funny and sobering, informative and thought provoking, and it’s because you haven’t run from new conceptions of both yourself and others, much love and respect from the uk you beautiful lady xx"
"i'm so glad i'm a trans man not a trans woman and we somehow magically didn't end up promoting rape in our community. phew!"
"i get that this is politics and we can't afford to be open and honest but i don't respect the current position of the trans female community in 'OH SHIT LOOKLOOKLOOK THEY'RE CALLING US MEN, DON'T LOOK AT HOW WE FORCE THEM TO HAVE SEX WITH US!' i just....facepalm"
"idk, pointing and laughing and going 'look at how crazy these fucked up people traumatized from rape are, look how hysterical these women are for getting upset that i said they must fuck penis no matter what' just doesnt seem all that compelling"
"i didnt watch this so idk if it discusses why it's okay to force women to have sex, but that's the core of the issue and i don't see trans women addressing that issue."
"i just dont know why smart people take the side against terfs because its basically wrong to force women to have sex and you would think smart people would know that. but maybe theyre just so smart they have a justification in their minds for it?"
"its gonna be really awkward when people like me are still around and people try to be like 'lol, terfs' around me and then they'll learn that it was really about having sex with women all along. like its foolish to take the side of 'lets force women to have sex' and try to hide it with how mad those women got that you did that"
"anyway im sure you won a lot of people over to the side of hating women lmao, great work natalie lmao"
"like in the end all of this obscurantism will pass and people will just remember that time when the trans community got all crazy about being able to fuck all the women lol"
"its kinda stupid to schwag out feminism and sell out to men so fast after acheiving some semblance of notoriety idk i dont think it will end well for the trans women because men will get tired of taking sides with you just to bash women when they can do that anyway and then your allies who are women are gone idk why the trans female community keeps making these dumb moves"
"trans women also make fun of trans men too, they hate anyone with a female body idk trans women community needs to change and no one should be forced to think about sex with people they don't want to so im with the terfs until the trans community changes"
"trans women always enlist men to help them oppress women and make fun of them in a misogynistic way thats why trans women are kinda shwagged out for me now idk i have to see the movement change"
"a little know fact is that the word terf used to mean 'a woman who won't sleep with trans women' and thats kinda still why transwomen are mad they act like it's all these other reasons though"

"thanks for this video! Only one question remains for me: WHY is gender such a big thing? Can you tell me why the female gender is appealing at all to you? Why all the fuzz? This is one thing I dont understand, no matter if I talk to feminists or transpeolple. I never experienced what feminists call patriarchy, eventhough I was really trying hard to understand and  to see it, I can not relate to other womans experiences. I dont think things are so different here in germany. I also dont understand why its so important to identify as any gender and then cling to those stereotypes. Well, genderstereotypes ARE social realiity and are a part of the world we live in, so you have to deal with them. IMO there is no need to abandon them as long as there are equal rights, but I also dont care if they vanish or change to the opposite, if there are 100 genders or if there will onetime be only one or whatever. And I understand that it must be very hard for transpeople to be confronted with a social reality that is hostile to them. But what I dont understand: If concrete gendernorms are historically variable and have such an enourmous negative influence over transpeoples lifes, is getting into them (sometimes in extremes) not only social pressure? Or expressing a socialiced schema of somethig one idealized because of the the negative experiences because not beeing able to idetify with the sex you had to live with?"

"Wow I didn't realize Contra was such fragile narcissist.  I hope it's not like this for most trans people.  And now society is supporting them to be even more fragile.  This wouldn't be so bad if not for the one sided selfishness under the guise of compassion."
"I honestly have a hard time with trans men and women because I see it as a sign of the liberal culture and the safe space movement. I struggle with this because I also believe that everyone has the right to say and do what they want and it’s not my place to tell someone how to live their life just like I wouldn’t want someone judging me for my decisions or appearance. I struggle with these two parts of myself. I would never disparage anyone but I still think it and I feel guilty for it. I love your videos and have an immense respect for your intelligence."
"this video really opened my eyes. 'Abolish gender' to me means like everyone should be treated as they identify and there's space for everyone. Like gender does not matter and it does not define who you are or what can or cannot do (gender roles). I did not know it was used as an excuse to attack trans people. Thank u for this"
"I love how informative and entertaining your content is. Thanks for enriching this cisi males life."
"What does 'living as a woman' even mean though? Doesn't that line of thinking still perpetuate that men are one way and women are another?"
"It's just so many people lack any empathy."
"The only possible point a TERF could possibly have is that a trans woman was not assigned female at birth, and was therefor not treated as a woman until she identifying and passing, (within the heteronormative view), as female. It doesn't make us any less validly female. It does mean we don't have an experience of being treated as a girl, but that is it. Brains have a spectrum of sex correlating traits, it isn't black or white either. People are people, let them be themselves."

"Hello Natalie, I love your work. I would really like to see/hear/feel your take on Chelsae Manning being put in prison again, just for telling us the unfiltered truth about what some of our troops were doing in Iraq. She is being tortured with solitary confinement. No books. No sunlight. Noone to talk to. No phone. No TV. No internet. Please, please make a video about this. It touches so many themes that need to be clarified."
"These concerns are genuine and the only rebuttals you have are based on your own philosophy instead of the black and white actuality that the concerns are coming from.  You can identify by whatever you want in your head but if it's a mental disorder, (which I understand you're arguing it is.  It's something you can't help) then why put that on other people??  I wouldn't cosign any other beliefs that come with mental illness so the only argument I see for entertaining it is out of politeness and to avoid the awkwardness of going back and forth.   The idea of getting people without disorders to accept the reality of an individual who can't help feeling a way and can't accept their own reality is crazy to me.  People aren't trolls for bringing up these points."

"Hi! Transmedicalist here! A common misconception about the idea of transmedicalism is that it requires trans people to face crushing dysphoria in order to really be trans. In reality, the majority of transmedicalists recognise that not every trans person faces constant, heavy dysphoria, and also that in most cases, dysphoria can fluctuate wildly. Transmedicalism simply asserts that someone must experience dysphoria in some capacity in order to be trans.  Anyway, I love your videos! They're always very highly produced and you convey some great points. I eagerly await your next upload."

"Apologies in advance for starting this comment by obnoxiously stating my gender, but I am a cis woman and honestly the TERF notion that you can only be a woman if you have a uterus that sheds its bloody skin every month (like some kind of haemophilic lizard that’s hyper fixated on moon cycles) is offensive to me too. As far as I know, I don’t have any issues in regards to my fertility (that’s right, form a queue boys) but that’s besides the point - I don’t appreciate that my entire experience as a woman is apparently reduced down to the status of my womb. The whole point of feminism is de-politicising my body so that there are no social stigmas attached to it. The only reason my womb should be acknowledged is so I can receive medical and sanitary support for my female bodily functions at no extra cost (or at least, I shouldn’t have to pay any more than a man would for gender-specific needs).   Also from a medical perspective, it’s ridiculous to claim that all trans women are biologically male when many of them are taking female hormones which, shock horror, means that they need largely the same medical attention a woman would."

"If you identify as a part of a certain group and people outside the group brand you as a part of the group and thus discriminate you as such, you’re a part of the group. You deal with a female life shit daily, you identify as a female, to me you’re a female. And while I still lowkey despise women who had their periods short and painless, well, I can suck it up, even if another woman doesn’t have them at all. Trans women are women."
"Okay, this is the perfect place for me to make my argument in hopes that its wrong. So, I dont believe that gender and sex are different concepts, but before I explain why, I must make this clear. I AM ALL FOR SELF EXPRESSION. I THINK MEN WEARING SKIRTS AND MAKEUP IS GREAT AND IT BREAKS GENDER NORMS. SAME FOR ANY OTHER WAY MEN OR WOMEN CAN DEFY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MALE/FEMALE.  Now, what I need to bend my belief that gender isnt sex is simple. I need -a concrete definition of male and female -a concrete definition of gender -the lgbtq community to invent a word to refer to people with penises and likewise for people with the other sex parts  Ive tried to construct definitions for male and female, but theres a problem with each one that I can not ignore. Ill list the possible definitions for male (that I can think of) now. Keep in mind theres a similar definition for the other gender as well in each case.  -male=someone who identifies as male problem: this isnt saying anything. If this is the definition for male, then the definition of female is someone who identifies as female, and in that case, theyre interchangable and theres no fundamental difference between men and women so the words may as well not exist  -male=typically masculine person. Theyre tough, manly, courageous, they drink beer, watch football, etc problem: this is sexist (as far as im aware, genderist isnt a real word, so wed need terms to describe bigots for sexes and genders if theyre different too). If sex and gender are different, then people should be able to identify as a gender regardless of their personality traits. Im a guy, and I dont fit the typical male image in the slightest, to say that im less of a man or not a man at all because of that is insulting!  -male=its subjective to each person. People can be whatever gender they want and define gender to whatever suits them. problem: thats kinda stupid. We need an identical understanding of what gender is on a societal level if were all going to be on the same page here. Whats stopping me from viewing someone else as a gender they dont identify as? This definition doesnt entail that you cant misgender people and not be objectively wrong, so its useless.  -male=person with a penis problem: this is the one the lgbtq community refuses to accept.   The last definition is the ONLY one thats consistent and makes sense. Its grounded to physical evidence that is mostly consistent to everyone, with some outliers to keep in mind (Im not gonna get into the multiple sexes idea rn). Okay guys, prove me wrong!"
"I LOVE YOUR EARRINGS! 😍"
"FUCK IM A MAN YOUVE FOUND ME"
"all due respect to this video, but it didn't change my mind.  and i don't feel like you really addressed the concerns.  you just gave a point based on your own philosophy but people with this point of view don't hold that.  which is the issue lol"
"Highly misleading and paradoxical. It is true that the origination of he/she predates the discovery of chromosomes, but is it not obvious that after the discovery, chromosomes became one of the defining features of the male and female? What differentiates a woman from a man is her potential to conceive a new life and bring it to the world.  The nonsensical argument that if any form has outer appearance like that of a woman should be considered a woman comes at the expense of reducing sexuality to mere perception. For instance, a plastic apple looks similar to a natural one in outer appearance and even gets called an apple, but is it really an apple? Does it have pulp, juice and seed? In spite of calling a fabricated apple an apple we internally don't believe it and to my understanding that is what these 'I feel like woman so should be called one(fuck biology)' activists are demanding. They simply don't want to be called with a particular pronoun, but also want to be believed to be a woman which they are not because they lack multiple defining biological features of a woman.  No one refuses to call a trans-person with their desired pronoun in a private space (not even Shapiro and Peterson), but same demand in public space acquires different connotations. The defining features of the categories of man and woman depend on the traits found in majority and that can not be blended with exceptions, as any act to do so would amount to the mockery of the very practice of characterization. There is a difference between perception and reality. Our perceptions can easily be corrupted as we perceive through our senses and what we see or sense is not always true and the false perception doesn't change the reality. So a claim to form a sense of reality only on the basis of perception is a joke.  I speak as an ignorant man questioning my enlightened queen."
"Oh do I need a mug or shirt or something that says 'Your utopian pipedream is valid.'"
"This one was tough not gonna lie. It’s hard to listen to people who would consider them selves 'feminists' would engage in such blatant body shaming. Even if I take it at face value that they just want to deconstruct gender, they still want men to be ashamed of there knuckle hair and forehead shape and the like. I did a feminist art piece for for my senior final project about sexism in advertising, and in trying to tell a story how sexism is everyone’s problem I came across the term 'the male grotesque'. Using masculine features like body hair or a heavy gut or a bald head in order to repulse people and make short hand for the person you don’t want to be in the ad. Similar to media creating unrealistic beauty standards for woman, a lot of media tells men that there bodies are inherently disgusting. This is just compounded when dealing with gender dysphoria. It’s the kind of thing that made me hate feminism in high school, and I can see it applying to the anti-feminists today. Not only are they pushing hate speech against trans people, this kind of rhetoric creates new radically misogynist incels."

I know your intention is to address the incomplete and/or false narratives behind the complicated dogmatic views of our time, and understand that you aren't really interested in directly confronting transphobic 'fact champion' pundits. You've joked about being asked to go on 'free speech' podcasts, but I am curious what thoughts you have about educating misinformed skeptics who might be more receptive than the Ben Shapiros of the world. Do you think speaking to someone like Joe Rogan who has such a wide reaching and diverse audience would be beneficial to mass clarification on the nuances of gender, or are he and his affiliates too far down their rabbit hole?

"I like your outfit. Let's see where this goes.   Also looking at you reminds me of a story of my former bestest friend girl in the world. The guy she had her first time with also turned out like you. And by like you I mean fabulous. Gave her self-esteem issues. Any opinions on that matter?  Oh, and if you are actually responding to this. How did you make that sound with your guitar and the glass thing in one of your earlier videos. I might need that at some point. Not that important of course. I'm sure someone else knows too, but I thought since I'm already here, why not ask?   Also I hope there is more piano with singing at the end."

I'l start doing ketamine because fuck society. LOVE YOU!"
"This was a really awesome video. I think you addressed terf common claims really effectively, were hilarious, and I can’t believe I hadn’t found you sooner. I also really appreciate that you acknowledged that trans women do to a point in their lives benefit from some male socialisation and privilege, and that there needs to be space to discuss issues like menstruation. I’ve often felt pressure as a trans man to dismiss the parts of my life where I was treated as a woman and when I experienced misogyny, menstruation, etc. and to be quiet on issues like abortion even though they intimately affect me because to admit trans men experience female socialisation somehow equates to calling trans women men. I think you provided a really great, nuanced approach to the issue and I highly appreciate it. Thank you for the great video, I hope to see more like it :)"

"Bellisima my Trans-sister!! You knocked it out of the park!"
"Really, I find this presentation quite enlightening.  These are changing times wrt to gender/sex/role 'identification'.  The old rules have been tossed out and we are all trying to figure out what the new rules are. But what are the rules for?  The old rules were for making it efficient for us to communicate our interests and play the interpersonal games in order to optimize our happiness in interpersonal gender relationships. We all need to be polite as possible but not at the cost of bluntness that will bring us to a better social norm for everyone's benefit."

"'Rattles my Chromosomes' I love this."
"15:02"
"I remember a trans woman talking about her attempts to get a therapist to sign off on a transition. 'You aren't girly enough' was the response. A year later, she shows up in pink with her hair and nails done. Therapist signed off on the transition immediately. So that may also be a factor in hyper-femme trans woman culture."
"YES! I mean, I'm a cis woman but this is absolutely a great video and explanation and it absolutely bridges any possible difference in terms of different points of view. If someone still has a problem and is still siding with TERFs, then they absolutely do not want to actually listen and discuss."
"I'm a gamer and I was really put off and alienated by gamergate. i even wrote an essay about how gaming isnt gendered when it wad happening. but then, if I say #notallgamers it's a lot like #notallmen right? is there a better word for video game enthusiasts that don't obsess over their masculinity and how unfair it is that women don't owe them sex? also, new sub. i really enjoy your videos. also also, you are a beautiful woman, never let anyone mess with that truth."
"Okay but can be briefly appreciated how actually Angelic Natalie looked in the 'genderless' scene"
"Clearly, you don't think nails and make up are all there is to being a woman.  It's also ornate set dressing and lighting, elegant and constantly novel costumery, and an exhaustive writing and editing process."
"Not at all balanced."
"I actually became gender critical after this video. Sorry Contra. I still love your vids. But penises will never be female, and transwomen are not female. I can still respect pronouns and all that but I honestly have changed my mind radically after actually looking at gender critical arguments on their own terms."
"I'll check in after you get the 300 videos about TERFs you need to make out of your system. I'd never even heard of them as a group before, but I have to admit that despite your style and humor, I'm getting really bored of refutations against a group of people whom I have never met and I will never meet. I mean I can't say I blame you as it's become way more relevant in your life, and it is absolutely worth talking about at length, but your videos are starting to feel circular to me so I'll tune in another time."
"Love your videos and style, have started to question my participation in some youtube anti-pc channels like thunderf00t, tj, etc. I've been watching a lot of your and Philosophy tube's vids, and questioning some other people from the anti-pc crowd that I like that may be problematic.  Just wanting to know your opinion on Bill Burr, Ricky Gervais, Pewdiepie.  If it's not too much trouble"
"Theory: genderless contrapoint is actually jesus"
"This video bit me on the butt. I totaly have baggae from the 'stolen valor ' feeling. Rich white men becoming trans women always makes me mad but im probably just annoyed by their monetary privilege. And its a misplaced feeling."
"To be honest, I'm a cis woman and I don't know what it's like to be catcalled as a 9 year old, because that never happened to me. It sounds like TERFs are extrapolating their own personal negative experiences to all cis women to cynically weaponise them against trans women."
"FUCK IT UP"
"Genius"
"Thanks for this intelligent and -- for me at least-- educational video. It's an area where most discussions tend to generate more heat than light. I don't know if I agree with all the points (or contra-points) you make,  but there's a lot to think about. At this point, no conclusions. I'm just trying to understand. I also appreciate the entertaining and satirical production. Good job!"
"17:48 reminds me of the thing they say at the end of every episode of the red green show “i am a man but i will change if i have to i guess”"
"Take a sip babes 😂"
"You know I got someone saying that I’m a transmedicalist or something a while ago and I just want you all to know that the information needed to know that not all trans people experience dysphoria is not available easily to people who aren’t trans and don’t regularly engage in trans rights and health related issues. Of COURSE it didn’t occur to me that the insinuation that the trans experience is defined by pain is bad. All I knew is that dysphoria= don’t like your body, so it pushes you to transition. That made the most sense. But apparently that’s not how it is for everyone. And maybe I don’t really get it, but it’s not like I’m running around telling everyone that trans people are lying or something just cause I don’t understand why not all trans people experience dysphoria and I don’t really know what they’re feeling."

"Reminder that a trans woman, Chelsa Manning, did more for our society and humanity then everything every single TERF has ever collectively done"
"Is it really intellectual discourse to compete in who has suffered the most during their socialisation? All that strange talk comes from sociology. The human condition becomes determined to be just a playball of societal factors. This is worse than biological fatalism. Please reconsider free will. Current discourse in the arts is just way behind of other centuries. Maybe it's also because of YouTube can still not compete with a good book."
"You're still my favourite transsexual philosopher. And I'am still waiting for a philosophical porntape. A new genre,  wouldn't that be something?"
"The tranny 1%"
"I found your comment on the increased judgment of your appearance interesting , and your use of 'male privilege' surprising . I don't feel trans-individuals OWE members of their gender any understanding , though recommend it . I just stumbled onto your channel ; thank you for an entertaining and informative video ."
"Wow. I haven't tuned in for about a year, and I'm amazed by the way your choices in aesthetics, writing, and delivery have evolved.  The way you phrase the sadism of transphobia, and how it originates from the lower recesses of our brain is an interesting theory. Did you hypothesize that yourself, or did you read any psychology literature that pertains to this?"
"No one knows what it’s like To be a sad Tran To be a trash can  For trap chasers jizz"
"You answered a lot of my questions as a 'cis gender female' about the 'trans women are women' and 'Trans rights are womens rights' etc. I have wanted to ask these questions. But felt apprehensive to do so because rather than educate (which is what I would be asking for)  people enjoy berating (mostly from 'cis gender' people) for not knowing what you said are nuanced answers."
"Contrapoints is good"
"Another junk video that starts with a red herring defining *stereotypical* - and CONtras ALL about playing to the stereotype in her own head - behavior of Women. So tired. So lame. So wrong. So illogical. And whoever read the Plath quote is a horrrrrible actor. I mean, that was rrealllyyyy bad. Also, feminists aren't critical of transmisogony because they want trans people gone CONtra, so much as you. x"
"I was never ever ever a rad fem. I have never felt negative emotions towards any trans individuals. I can admit that I used to not be able to understand how to actually regard a trans individual as their identifying gender respectfully when speaking to anyone. Watching you tubers that put themselves so out there as trans people or literally any other societal or culturally different human being has cracked my awkward stiffness or not knowing the right way to regard someone that is just going through a different journey than me. It’s helped me learn that we are all humans and not a single one of us owe any of the others anything so there is no reason to hate or see one another as “something we can’t understand”. Just witness. Hear it, see it, feel it, mill it over, and once it soaks in you just treat everyone like humans. I unintentionally used to assess any random trans woman as a man that was so out of touch with the masculine and so I tune with the feminine that they would rather...idk shelve the masculine gender thing and “be” a woman until I understood that that just isn’t how it is. Trans women are just women in their soul and personality and being. You don’t know what it feels like to just stop feeling *yourself* so what more is there to get? Love your channel"

"This channel was the most important discovery I've made in all those years of youtube!"
"I have a genuine question. So I'm fully on board with the whole trans thing, however I actually DO wish to know what exactly is the difference between a trans woman and a feminine man (or trans man vs masculine woman). Please don't misunderstand me, I am fully supportive of both trans people and of cis people who do not conform to typical gender roles, I'm only curious about the details. What specifically differentiates a feminine man/masculine woman from a transgender person? Where is the line?"
"Thank you. Two of my best friends identified as trans men until late 2017. When they detransitioned I tried to support them completely, and I probably didn't do it perfectly. But within the course of a couple weeks they had swung all the way to being radical feminists, saying that the entire trans community, literally all of it, was toxic and disgusting and wrong, and that there was no such thing as transness. I just... had no idea how to handle it. They blocked me on social media before I'd even responded once - no exaggeration. And just... I mean best friends. We'd known each other for years. This video doesn't make losing them hurt less, but it helps me work through what I knew was wrong with their mindset, but was too hurt and confused to put into words."
"Anita Bryant , OMG!"
"So I have a little bit of a confession. I never had a desire to speak out loud my more Terf like questions. I didn’t hate Trans people, and was fine being around them. Used their pronouns. I knew the language I wanted to use was going to be problematic but I wanted to understand why people dressed hyper feminine. Why if we break gender roles that someone would want to reestablish them with male and female identities.   As a ace woman, I never cared about who I was dating because no matter what was downstairs, I didn’t care. I mainly dated only personalities.   I dated my girlfriend before she came out, and loved her enough to stay regardless of her appearance and pronoun change.   I appreciate this video since I got my answers and why they were inappropriate other than just going with my own judgement that these questions shouldn’t be said outloud and I should just accept their is no answer."
"I'm way too gay to watch this video I'm going audio only sorry"
"Just wanted to say, thank you Contra for making these wonderful videos. I fell down the alt-right rabbit hole while trying to convince myself I wasn’t trans. Thanks to your videos, I realized I was wrong on all accounts 🤦‍♀️"
"Man in dress makes video exclusively for women only clooooown woooorld"
"You make strong points I haven't heard before and I love your videos but honestly this comment is just to throw love on that hat. The little mesh veil? Hell yes."
"You guys remind me of the day the circus came to town."
"Abortion is literally murder."
"If I'm understanding you correctly, Natalie, or others :   Trans-friendliness requires giving external social reinforcement to a trans persons internal reality of gender. If that's correct then the biggest most important reinforcement for trans-women will come from women, especially cis-women or women treated from birth as women. 'Cos like what would a man know about being a woman?    Similarly the most reinforcement for a trans man would come from men.    So as a cis-man it is far more important for me to support a trans-man than Contrapoints. If Natalie is sexually turned on by men (heterosexual~? or erotically 'heterogendered'? then I might have some additional capacity to reinforce by recognition of attractiveness - but one can make no assumptions).      Is that correct? Most of what you Natalie, want from men is not to be assholes. What you need from women is inclusion.   Do trans people get both internalized misogyny and toxic masculinity at transition only, or all the time? Sorry, are you getting both now, did you only get one before.   If there were a category 'beautiful man' If I described a pre-transitioning or  gender complex trans person that way would that help, like we already have strong women.  strong vs beautiful : isn't that the crux of the gender binary?   so  many questions. It  may not be as complex and sophisticated as yours, but at least  my mind is confused. Must take some brillo to be as clear as you are.   thanks"

"As I understand it, gender critical feminists believe that gender is something with which we're enculturated from birth. I'm hoping you'll touch on this, because it illustrates an important ideological difference that's often overlooked. It would seem to follow from this rationale reason that people like Meghan Murphy believe that you and Theryn Meyer can never be women because you were enculturated with a masculine gender identity from birth. You were raised as boys, and as such, cannot help but perceive the world through a masculine lens. Any common ground they appear to have with conservatives is dwarfed by what is ultimately a social constructionist interpretation of gender identity.    Granted, I'm not sure that this is anything more than motivated reasoning, and I suspect that if you probed their worldview and found an intersex condition they couldn't account for with this justification--the testes-at-twelve kids, for example, who I'm sure they're happy to foist a masculine identity even as they continue to regard trans-men as lost lesbian sisters--they'd be happy to paper over it with appeals to compassion, followed by scathing admonishment and swift retreat. I'd expect to hear something like, 'Intersex people have been horribly mutilated and stigmatized since the inception of modern medicine, and now you want to use them as ammunition in your cheap political disputes? How dare you, sir!'"
"Fuckin love 11:20"
"Historically speaking, we've seen completely differing and sometimes contradictory expression, and cultural definitions of gender. Gender is mostly a social construct, but that doesn't make it any less extremely important to our identities. Because it is a socially and psychology constructed, it changes and doesn't always fit one type of body. Science is on that size, you really can't argue it without denying about a quarter million years of human(ish, including a few evolutionary ancestors) of observation and, a bit more recent, culture. Also, trans men know what it's like to have a stigmatized period and it can be even harder for them mentally due to the way society stigmatizes it."
"The male privilege thing really hits home with me. I'm a white cis man in his twenties so I'm very much privileged. I like cars, video games and have a bad sense for interior design. (Hope the tongue-in-cheek comes across here. My house is very nice actually)  On the other hand, there is an edge of feminity in my soul or whatever and I'm just not really one of the guys, not being able to fit in. I often experience that guys don't really know how to deal with that and have gotten shunted socially (by women too because I couldn't possibly understand these issues, right?) or even beaten up many times because of that. Hell, I'm missing ten real teeth in my mouth due to being beat up, but it did give me a glimpse of mysogyny so maybe that's nice.  I can't even begin to imagine how that is for someone who is truly gender queer, but hope that sharing my experiences makes those of you fell less alone, because you definitely aren't!"
"You are absolutely amazing and I love watching your videos. Thanks for sharing your experience and wisdom with us, Natalie. ❤️"
"This was really interesting, because I've been called a TERF, a couple times... And I see how that could have happened now, even though I think it's completely wrong.  I dislike the concept of 'female brain', and 'female soul', in a male body, and vice versa, because those specific ideas do reinforce stereotypes. The second you start saying I'm a woman because this that or the other thing... I mean... You're taking probabilities and turning them to destiny. That's it though, I'm just a philosophical nitpicker.  I would call you Natalie, or she... And anyone who doesn't, is a dick.  Critiquing what you wear is superficial. In the end, I'm just bit utopian. I think you can be a she, and we can understand that there are statistical differences between genders, without reinforcing male/female brain stereotypes. You seem to agree which is nice to hear.  The only place this is a real issue, legally, is in competitive sports. There is quite a bit of money in that field too, that women are just begining to get a taste of... I think it's a bit rude for trans women to be breaking records in that space."
"Love these videos. Trans problems, and you especially, really helped me get out of the 'anti-sjw soon to be nazi' stage. I was surrounded by people who would hate on feminism, etc, all of these things, and I'd be in the back saying 'Oh yeah, fuck feminism! I'm an egalitarian!' but when they would go after trans people, and just say awful things, go after trans rights..  It didn't feel right. When some big anti-sjw I would watch would call a trans woman some slur or the other, it didn't feel right. And eventually, I felt like I was surrounded by bigots, but still, I thought, It was the better of the two 'sides'. And then I started listening. I found Shaun via his cinema sins videos, started watching his other content, reluctantly. Through him, I found you, practically a caricature of what the anti-sjws hate, and you are GREAT. And far more logical than any of them.  Today, I'm happy with who I surround myself with, and who I watch, and how I feel about the world. Thanks, Natalie."

"I'd already been dying to share a few ContraPoints videos with my mom, then you posted this and I knew it would be the PERFECT first Contra vid. Mom fights the social justice fight as best she can but at 80 she needs some remedial learnin' on some things. I knew the fast pace and many of the meme references would be difficult for her, so I waited until I could be there with her so I could pause to explain, etc. She did find the pace frustrating and I suspect she wouldn't have hung in there for the whole thing without me. I don't know why I didn't think to set the speed to .75 at the time, but it would have helped a great deal. I'll definitely tell her so she can watch more.  She just LOVED the video, especially the style (and that Natalie is the spitting image of my sister's younger daughter- who is frikken *gorgeous* of course). It really opened her eyes to a lot and after the video we had a great conversation about trans issues and gender in general that she wouldn't have been able to participate in as well before. She and I thank you so much! Big love from the Deep South <3"
"Hey, I really like your videos. This one didn't sit right with me though. I think at the heart of the issue here is the fact that each side to this debate feels personally attacked by the other; each feels that the other's criticism is based on prejudice rather than concern. This was certainly how gender critical people were represented in this video. I am totally aware that there is sadly a community of terfs who act very aggressively towards trans people. However, I feel that you made a big generalization in implying that all gender critical people are aggressive and hateful towards trans people. There were some interesting points raised from the gender critical perspective which I felt were treated very dismissively because they were portrayed as coming from a place of hate, which isn't always necessarily the case. I would have found this video more interesting if the topic was approached from a more objective perspective."
"Something, something, something about critical thinking, I don't know I forgot, so here's a Like instead."
"I’ve been trying to understand this obsession with identity for 20 some years now. Ive noticed that people who are genuinely creative are much less concerned about their identity and how the world thinks of their appearance and presentation. This isn’t to say that they don’t care (they often do to a great deal) but they are less dependant on other people affirming this identity."

"TERFs are what happens when Handmade's Tale type women finally begin to understand that 'love is war' is just a really good rock'n'roll lyric more than a Bible quote, and a baby is the result of a union, not the other way around; see also, rabidly sexist effeminate men in Southern Christian American society, and their wives' immaculate Tammy Faye makeup."

"Okay also I can't not not not take your troll bait I guess. I have a white trash degree in Computer Science and worked in Video Game Design (well, testing) for awhile. While everyone brags that the latest 'Madden' will sell more than any Hollywood Blockbuster, the BIG PROFIT ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM is The Sims is by far the most profitable video game franchise in history in large part due to the fact that it appealed to women—and interested them and reached them as new gamers even—in almost equal measure to men. I have a legit entry for the 'but that's adorable though!' oppression olympics: Sim Video Game players, as gamers, represent a huge market of actual customers and profit and yet still remain ignored and erased—pimply teens I'm frankly a bit too young to be hanging out with remain the public/commercial face of American Video gaming, yet my parents generation JUST BARELY missed the boat that I and my husband now sail upon: video gamers with GUPPY privilege. But even as communities like reddit are 'irony-bonding' by calling themselves in their notorious gaming community 'THE PC MASTER RACE' I remain a second class citizen, as apparently needing to simulate entire cities or planets in vivid realtime 4K JUST FOR MY USER INTERFACE doesn't require real video game cards just like a chick who plays guitar doesn't need to worry about what kind of amp she has, maybe use her boyfriends? :P"

"Because I both accept gendering and genderistism as real reified things within a shared fiction of reality, and I also accept that bodies and minds arise from the same source but are meant to diverge, I can accept the fact that my affinity for Joan Didion makes me hetrosexually-leaning bisexual, literature-wise. I guess somewhere between Maria in 'Metropolis' and 'that Sharon Stone character' in 'Casino', I came to terms with the fact that when only ever celebrated as goddesses and whores, you never get to fall in love with women as women in love with men :\"
"OKAY BUT SEE YOU JUST MADE MY POINT WITH PLATH: ever since I got MY slice of academic privilege—in English literature—I have been unduly and explicitly PISSED at the quazi-lesbian relationship she had with Sexton, but I now I realize they were both wishy washy twinks who couldn't even cheat with each other let alone please the men they claimed to love. And even in that segment, he writes like a dude. :P  Would anyone with even a SYMBOLIC maternal instinct end their greatest poem with a line like 'The child's cry melts in the wall'? This is America, only MEN really need confession. ;P"

"wow. I haven't seen that cops video in years. YEARS ago, I watched that clip and laughed at the stupid 'tranny.' I look back and cringe at the views i used to have. I hadn't even accepted myself at the time (my icky gayness). Thanks for reminding me how awful i used to be, and how much I've grown"
"Immense Lugshurieauxahns."
"TERFs become SUPER INTERESTED AND ALLIED with gay men whenever transmen come up in conversation. Yes, I can confirm, all hot twinks are fucking hot, so yes, I can presume, they can't fuck hot gay men and are jealous of hot twinks and cubs who can and that's part of TERFdom."
"Also: 10:43 'Solanas be praised'... I'm WEAK"
"aww I'm nonbinary can i join the table?  lol.  Great video... that greer quote made my skin crawl.   I agree that gender is a social construct... but, in my opinion (i'll play nice) that doesn't mean that people don't have gendered experiences that stem from something outside one's gender assignment... or rather, that stem from inside.  I find it contradictory that a person could say 'gender is a social construct'  and with the same breath say that someone can never be anything than the gender assigned to their sex.  If gender is a construct, it's a set of symbols that communicate meaning.  If gender, then, is a set of symbols that express a person's lived reality, why is it so hard to understand a body using the language of gender to express a lived reality that is different than the one forced upon it by 'the patriarchy'?   Just sayin', y'all.  ContraPoints did a great job of articulating just that around 10:00 in. Now can all us 'feminazis' (lol) play nice together for a sec and use our energy and big sexy brains to target institutions that are actively opposed to gender equality instead of tearing down transpeople?"

"I stumbled upon this channel from another comment page on a Three Arrows video. Five minutes in and I'm already loving it! It's erudite, entertaining, and most of all, enlightening. Thank you for being here, and thank you for doing this!"
"I have an opinion about this topic, but i don`t know how it is seen by a trans person or if there is a problem with it, please coment.   I believe that the gender is not important, as simple as it sounds, i believe that the personality of the person is the real matter. Is not my problem how a person like to dress, an judge someone only for his appearance is stupid and cruel. The real problem in my opinion is the superficial judgment of the society, values are less important than beauty for a lot of people, and the people don´t live only for fuck, if you will not wanna have sex with someone, why is a problem for you how a person dress or sound? or what have this person between legs? i really don´t understand."
"TERFs are a straw man, but I do know that millions upon millions of women are TEFs, and the aren’t going to be convinced very easily."

"So should trans women be allowed to compete against women in Sports?"
"I've never heard mensurators.  I have heard uterus owners, though.  Not every uterus owner menstruates, but there are still common concerns when you've got a uterus.  I'm sure it's problematic on some level, but we'll keep working on language- that's the lovely thing about it.  Humans are all part of a vast and beautiful spectrum of experience and language is flexible, so we *can* keep changing it until we find something that works for us in that moment.  And then we can change it again as people discover more about themselves and our culture changes."

"6:08 What if he does care though? What happens to your argument if the individual in question does in fact care about the perfectly valid argument being used to contradict your views?

"Transwomen are transwomen and that's OK being trans is a beautiful part of the human experience, where there will never be consensus is where you insist  that you are actually the same as women in fact  your own video contradicts that ."
"Do you think a trans woman should be able to compete in women's sports? I subscribe to your channel and I'm generally in support of the things that you say. I'm not sure that the mockery you engaged in this video is helpful though. For the record, I am a woman, cisgender and all that."

About 6 months ago I've been consciously trying to change my dangerously hateful mindset. Now I'm watching your vids for the first time and I have to tell you I am sorry. Great video, thank you for it."
"Go watch his interview with blaire... I'm not certain how people say transgenderism has biological roots when this is clearly an identity disorder.."
"Sure- pick the nastiest TERFs you can find while ignoring the incredibly rapey, entitled, vicious language of the nastiest trans-activists. You present things like talk about reproductive systems as an ongoing debate - as if the most virulent trans folk are reasonably trying to find a compromise there - when the fact of the matter is the worst of them ARE trying to shut down talk about the very very sexed nature of reproductive oppression by declaring that all of that language is wrong. You ignore the fact that the worst trans activists don't want us to talk about socialization because it makes them insecure. And you entirely ignore the fact that unlike most trans activists or liberal feminists, radfems actually have a cogent, supported, philosophically sound understanding of why patriarchy happens: reproductive vulnerability.   Shitty, asshat TERFs and shitty, asshat trans activists are the people that make exploration of a lot of actual common ground here, like the acknowledgment of gendered socialization AND the acknowledgment that someone can totally socially transition, possible. While I appreciate and actually agree with basically everything you've said here, this wasn't an argument in good faith. I guess it's to be expected, though, when your base is full of twitter zealots."
"31:49 YESS 👏👏👏👏"
"I luv u contrapoints"
"just to start I'm a genderfluid person (amab) I've watched this video a couple times because I absolutely love it and I showed it to a bunch of people. I noticed that the one thing that makes me feel very uncomfortable is the part in the video when these people's shitty forum post are read making fun of how trans women look. Like it honestly makes me skip that part because it almost makes me feel like I should give up my other half. But I then thought more about it and I really don't fucking care what these people say. It still hurts a little but I have people around me who super supportive and make me feel good about who I am. Thank you for the video you're the honestly the best!"
"why did she censored “trans women” in 27:29? could someone explain me?"
"♥"
"I used to describe myself as a radical feminist and I felt so proud for having come up with the questions your TERF-persona is asking, this video has changed my views, thank you!  (to be fair, these were valid questions I had that noone ever bothered to help me with without shouting hate to me and this video really helped)"
"great video! The first video I watched was the one about being genderqueer. In that video, you said you wouldn't transition, now I'm eager to watch all the videos and see if I can observe any changes in opinion or believes regarding that decision."
"Fantastic video. Thanks a lot! But no plz don't destroy my video games!"
"I feel like our world has transformed into the right wing - panel of Hieronymus Bosch's triptych, the Garden of Earthly Delights.

"I really appreciate this video. I dabbled in the terf community on tumblr for a while in 2015-16 because I was questioning my gender and sexuality and did not feel at home in the general LGBT community. I saw almost no 'cis' GNC women, just all trans men and non-binary people, and didn't identify with that at all (despite experiencing dysphoria at the time and still do to some extent). I felt like if I wasn't a cis woman who embraced femininity, then I wasn't a cis woman at all and/or had no place in the community despite being bi. So to see a bunch of lesbian and bi women who weren't feminine and some of whom had also even experienced dysphoria like me was amazing. I did have some issues with the way being trans and gender as a whole was being presented and talked about, but it wasn't really an issue with trans people, it was an issue with myself. I didn't realize this until later, though. I had previously thought I was trans and would fantasize about medically transitioning to a man a lot (my identity crisis lasted several years), so I didn't connect with the transphobic part of the community. I somehow surrounded myself at first with 'gender critical' women who weren't outwardly nasty to trans women, so when I did encounter them I always was disgusted by SO many of them being nasty and outright dehumanizing toward trans people.... and soon realized it wasn't just a few bad apples but the majority of the movement. I still felt like it was the only place where my specific identity could belong so I put up with the abhorrent things they would say for a lot longer than I should've.  And once I finally did leave I still felt like I did not belong in the general LGBT community and now did not belong with others 'like me' either. Nowadays I've become a lot more comfortable with myself and my gender identity. I still feel out of place amidst my cis women and trans friends, but I guess that's just something I'm going to have to make peace with   There were a couple of genuine concerns that I had about gender but as I've gotten older I realized almost none of them held actual practical merit and I was just being a tight ass who didn't know how to deal with her own problems. My main one was the entire Abolish Gender point, but seeing as I was 16 I didn't quite realize was a pipedream that was. Another was some people calling lesbians 'vagina fetishist'  or sex vs gender and how to categorize attraction based on which. I was hoping you would touch on that, but I understand why you didn't. Again, thank you for this video. I still have ingrained 'terfy' feelings sometimes I got from just being embroiled in that community and it's stuff like this that really helps to sweep them away for good."

"A little bit tipsy, trying to formulate a question: Is part of the motivation behind TERFS that transgenderism has shown that people (both cis and trans) can find gender identities enjoyable? I understand and agree with the point that we should be critical towards conforming gender identities, but on the other hand, I find e.g. the traditional aesthetics of masculinity and femininity also to be a great source of joy, and see transgenderism as an opening and exploration towards the enjoyment of these identities in a freer, less restricted way. Simply put, some traditional feminist perspectives seemed to simply state that 'gender identities = bad', which transgenderism however challenges.   You're looking on point by the way, red suits you"
"sir"
"I feel obligated to come up with a good comment if I'm going to say anything but all I can say is this: I really hope Contrapoints (thou? what is the tense I'm supposed to use? IDK if anyone will read this) is able to have a private life while talking about private things on youtube. Having a lot of exposure comes with a lot of responsibility and going through major life changes is difficult no matter who's witnessing it. I'm really thankful for all the work you do as a leftist, as an artist, and as a trans person (I can't relate to trans womanhood but I can relate to transness and identifying with womanhood on some level).  Also would you rec ketamine y/n?"
"Holy shit contra still has ads up❤💗❤💗❤💗"
"Disgust is not just some primitive reptilian, hind-brain reactionary behaviour. It is actually one of the few features that make us human.  It is not fully explained but core disgust,  animal nature disgust and finally moral disgust are 3 categories of the study of disgust.   What disgust at transgender people seem to trigger are the body envelope part of the animal nature category and moral category of disgust. The anterior insular is most probably part of the process.  I'm trying to study why I myself felt disgusted at the thought and sight of transgender people and to be honest it seems to be a combination of those 2 categories."
"Wow, you are highly intelligent, highly amusing, incredibly creative, with an impression of a real sense of justice and fairness, and yet with so many gifts, you still have such a sense of humility and grace.  What an amazing and attractive woman.  I could listen to your ideas and thoughts all day, and I think you could persuade me of just about anything. Ever considered world domination?"
"Ultimately, I think that saying 'trans women are women' erases both of our unique set of experiences. You are valid, not matter what, so am I. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging that trans women are trans women, who still have biologically male bodies (medically, having different needs than natal women).   There may be disgust about trans women in that small subgroup of rads you derisively speak of as TERFS (that group doesn't have a lot of power you know), but you're not mentioning the violence that trans women like to joke about enacting on TERFS (e.g, the bloody 'I punch TERFS' shirt') Joking about violence against women seems a lot like what MRA folks like to do. I don't want trans women to be treated as a point of mockery, but I don't agree that trans women are women (because they're still biologically male); Women who have trauma from rape shouldn't be expected to welcome people with penises into their spaces (gyms, baths, etc...), because they may have panic attacks and an intense fear of dick, we can't ignore their real suffering.  My problems have been defined because I was born a natal woman. But I'm not saying your problems aren't real, they're just different. What's so wrong with trans women being trans women? Because it feels like male-bodied people are coming in and saying that they know what womanhood is and should define it.     Not passing is not terrible or disgusting, and you don't have to pass to be a woman socially. If you want to be called a woman and live as one (whatever that means), then by all means do so. I'm not deriding that. Even if I could tell you were a biological man dressing as a woman, I wouldn't misgender you, and would ask your pronoun preference. I don't think every trans woman has the ability to pass (so it's already a privilege to do so), and it shouldn't be the gold standard or define them as successful if they do or don't.  You want to be open minded though, while suing a word that may incite violence against women, whom you claim to stand by. >.>"
"What is 'period equity'?"

"Contra you look so much better and cuter without makeup! YEEEEESSSSSS!"
"I find that the way trans women revel in their beauty very inspiring to all women"
"I feel bad for asking this... but first, I do want to say I appreciate all your content on gender.   However, I love your videos where you explore wider societal topics, like that two-part series on Capitalism. I wish you'd do more of those because of how fiercely intelligent you are. There are so many people terribly uneducated about US society, US history, our culture philosophy, and where we are headed/we we CAN go if we were just more thoughtful and perhaps intelligent.   Could you do more videos pretty please, espescially now that the campaign season is underway. I don't want more Trump, and I feel people need to be woken up a bit more. You'd be a fantastic help in this area."

"Wait who the fuck is this and what is this readout?? Please please pleeeease tell me this is ironic! Poe's law is scary..."
"I wish more people would respect each other's life choices. For all I care, there could be three genders if that would help transgenders getting treated fairly. Afterall masculinity and femininity are not completely black and white subjects. It should be seen as a spectrum where everyone could be placed in between, at least in my opinion."
"This is amazing."

"Contrapoints I really want to thank you for what you do. I'm a cis woman diagnosed with end stage adenomyosis and endometriosis at 21 years old and am debating getting a hysterectomy or keeping it to try to have children, but not without overwhelming outside commentary about what I should do and what it means to sacrifice or preserve my potential 'divine role' . I really love being able to see into another type woman with an 'unconventional' I  guess you could say life, just living and talking about it. Even though our femininity is so extremely different in how we got to it, I somehow feel like I can relate to you and other trans women who do have to spend energy and money to maintain their womanhood-welfare much much more than the other women in my life who insist I'm just born defective and therefore deserve no support.  The whole idea of basing womanhood around sex exclusively is damaging not only to trans women, but to cis women like myself, born not with a penis just a totally useless cancer-inducing womb that will kill me if I don't have it removed.   I feel so understood and connected when I watch your content, in a way I can't find when I'm trying to connect with other cisgender women, especially who don't have my diseases.   I know people like you never just show up without going through a lot of crap to get where you are but I just wanted to say, if you've ever wondered if you're doing a good thing for other women, you're literally my role model and you make me feel worthy  and beautiful even tho my sacred passage is high key  Donners Pass."

"Starting at 30:00, especially with the story of your ecounter with the Chicago trans woman, this video just hit waaaaay too close to home. Thank you so much for your work."
"There's still one thing I don't understand but I don't know if you can answer   I can understand wanting to look a certain way but why do people want to change their pronouns ? And is that all what being trans means? Not everybody transitions or wants to and not everybody follows pink or blue social norms  So if that's all they changed then why ? I don't understand why people care about being misgendered  I guess cis people also care so maybe anyone can answer this  Or no one because feelings are complicated   I'm personally not that attached to any kind of label regardless of gender and I guess that's weird   And I don't understand what gender and she /he mean   I see you as a woman because that's what you say you identify as but if you were a man I wouldn't need you to change to believe you   What's the difference between a trans woman and a feminine man other than the label ?"
"im a cis lassss who presents in a super masculine way it really hit me when yall said that cause ive never really tried to relate trans peoples experinces to my own but if i think like that for a sec i reflect on experinces with wankers and i really see a glimpse of what a trans person would encounter and fear frequently and its not okay at all, hopefully soon it wont be okay to openly do that shit"
"Omg love this video !"
"Is it weird or problematic that I find it hard to watch your earlier videos? I find you far less funny and charming as a boy. Thoughts?"
"Wow, I'm all for trans people but I did always get a little agitated at the lack of female oppression transgenders had to go through. Now I know I was just being stupid, thanks Contrapoints!"
"Nowadays I perceive myself as a lesbian woman and for some reason that allows me to do much more 'manly' things that I would when I was using Him his pronouns. Also I'd like to beggin taking hormones and think when that happens I will probably stop wearing so much make up and stop waxing and even maybe start training box and cut my hair very short like I never have before."
"Great video Natalie!"
"this is the best channel on YouTube, no contest."
"If you look, or trying to look, like a woman, I’ll call you she. Same if you look like a man. If I can’t tell one way or another, you can work around the pronoun thing and move on. This is all so unimportant and you can’t make people by what you are selling. I don’t care if someone doesn’t like that I’m gay, just don’t discriminate against me. The problem is that there are situations (most) where proving discrimination is difficult."
"Great work as always. Really like the way you make very clear what your point is."
"You know, I’ve been watching your stuff for about 2.5 years now, and for some reason I’m just now consciously realizing how funny you are."
"This is my new favorite channel."
"Oh my lord I need a bloopers video."
"I’m cis and I basically had no idea what trans people and non-binary folks have to deal with at all. My friend (who is trans) showed me your channel, and I’m so glad she did. I’m sorry for the blind hatred you get, and thank you for being such a great role model to my friend. She’s pretty great and she never deserves to feel like less than a person."
"I dated a radical feminist, and she has said some form of each and every one of these 'concerns.' This video really helped me more understand how toxic and bigoted she really was, and helped me start to unlearn some of the lies she told me. Thank you once again, Natalie. I will be sharing this with everyone I know who will listen."

"Always believed gender has little to do with biology and more about social interactions. Always also believed that behavioral changes between genders is mostly caused by the way they grew up etc. So I'm all in about 'abolishing gender' (as much of an utopia as it sounds). The question is, if they do believe all the above how can they be against transsexual people? In my opinion, transsexuals prove exactly the 'oh so frightening' branch of feminism known as 'gender is just a social construct' for they are able to be re-birthed by changing their behavior and their body into matching their identity.  Simply put: Transsexuals prove the whole point of that specific feminist theory by 'changing socially' in order to show who they truly are. So if anything, if they wanted to truly abolish gender they would make transsexuals their best examples in their account, but I guess that wouldn't allow them to complain all day without doing anything for an actual social change now would it?"

You're such an inspiration. I'm glad I discovered your channel!!! ❤"
"Hi! I was wondering if there is just as much controversy over FTM transgender people as there is over MTF. Whenever the topic comes up in conversation transgender women are the main subject of the discussion, and hardly anyone mentions transgender men."

Thank you, from a dumb cis boy."

Thank you for bringing such level headed, unapologetically fabulous, nuanced answers to these mind blowing questions.)"

"'You don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized...' Talk to a fat cis woman about this. Some of us DO know. Maybe not in the same way you do, but as you say...victimhood one-upsmanship is useless. So why did you do it?"
"Initially I was extremely sympathetic to trans people as I would be for any oppressed group. However, over time I have become more and more opposed to any of it. I personally don't give a crap if you live your life as a woman, but your characterization of why biological women would object, seems perfectly reasonable on the surface, but is skewed by your (understandable) desire to be vindicated.  Trans people lose their shit when Rachel Dolezal is mentioned, because it is an exact spot-on analogous situation. Except that when black folk said 'Uh, fuck no', everybody pretty much said OK because telling black folk to shut up about blackness is pretty much seen (correctly) as Not Freakin Cool. The more I hear 'terf' and see the calling for violence against biological women, calling us 'fish' and all sorts of other bullshit, the more I think, you are NO ally of *mine*. So how can you think that we should be allies to you? That is just silly, or worse, the typical expectation that OF COURSE women will make way and cede position, like they have been forced to do for eons. Which is a very male way of thinking.   I can't and wouldn't declare myself a Navajo, swan on in and start telling Navajo people what a 'real' Navajo really is, redefined to include myself.  It's both ridiculous and wrong. And yet, here we are. A video deconstructing why women might object to sharing social and *political* space with a 'person with a penis', as you might say, with a suitably clownish caricature speaking as the sock puppet with easily discountable straw man arguments.  How about a video outlining how trans people could be allies to *women*. For people who proclaim the desire to *be* a woman, many of you seem to *hate* women. For myself, that engenders a white hot rage. Clearly this needs to be pointed out, but it's not women killing trans people, it is men. I have yet to see a headline telling of the brutal death by beating of a trans person *by women*.  You think the dude in the bar cares what the feminist intelligentsia thinks when he discovers that the chick he was macking on has a penis?!   There is WAY more to this story than straw man arguments."

"as a dfab person, i find it really funny that terfs think they can identify a trans woman just by looking for “masculine” traits, considering i have large hands, huge feet, and i sometimes grow a bit of facial hair. what am i to a terf? a mystery??"
"I love you Natalie, thank you for everything that you do, I'll always be an ally to trans people, it takes allot of guts to go against what society expects and be different and I'll forever support and defend people's rights to be themselves, that's really the least I can do. You are a wonderful human being."
"This video made me a TERF."
"thing is, trans women tend to be seen as the girls they are but trans men are still treated as fragile if they were closeted around the people they came out to for multiple years and were not considered super butch before. (again, based on my and trans guys i know's experiences)"
"Oh my god you're beautiful"

"I like contrapoints's videos. Natalie is really good at explaining the issues in a nuanced and intelligent way that neither seems to be judging nor talking down to me. I feel that she is a very effective advocate for the trans commu...  'I despise the west'  nvm where do I buy a MAGA hat?  /s"
"Ugh, I love this ❤️"
"i'm getting STRONG early 90's Wynona Ryder vibes. I approve."
"Thanks for making this, and the rest of your videos. I've read about these subjects online trying to understand them on my own, like from 'The Intersex Roadshow' and many other feminist blogs years ago. Seeing your videos has really given me the feeling that these nuanced ideas about sex and gender (which helped me as a young gay man wondering what this all meant) are more popular and widely held then I previously thought, and not just confined to academia or small internet enclaves. Your humor and explanations really help in making these ideas easy to understand. Also I love the fun atmosphere and creativity of these videos."
"Imagine a society that realises there musn't be minorities to be hated. Uh, I really don't know how it feels like to feel like in a wrong body, but for sure as hell I know the feeling of a desperation for leaving my existence as a human being, as it comes with all those traits that make the world wicked as it is. I am ashamed of myself just by seing the limitations of others, because my foolish ego tries to convince me that if everyone was like me everything would be so much different, right? Just gross, naive and utterly disgusting."

"'Oh, it rattles my chromosomes!'  Why did it take me until my 7th viewing of this to catch the Baphomet pose"
"'I'm literally just throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall, hoping a glimmer of feminity will shine through.' This really got me. I'm a CIS woman and I relate to this a lot. I'm not making an equivalency claim, because the stakes and variables are obviously different, but I think that a lot of CIS women go through similar things to try to present as 'feminine enough' for society to see them as feminine, so there should be more understanding of the reasons and struggles of transwomen.  This is a small example, but I can remember getting many bad haircuts as a kid that made people refer to me as a boy, everywhere I went, and I remember that being a really crushing feeling, not being recognized for who I was. As a teenager, I went through a similar thing when I started wearing makeup and skinny jeans because I felt like I didn't look as feminine as I felt without those things. Now that I'm in my 20's, I tend to go for a more androgynous look most of the time, with simple clothing and little to no makeup, because that's how I feel comfortable at this point in my life, but for anyone who has to work at presenting the image that matches how they think of themselves, it would be a pretty crappy consolation prize to criticize them for putting in that work, or expecting them to just not care how people see and interact with them based on how they look."
"5:53 YES. THIS RIGHT EFFING HERE.   These kinds of questions are exclusively used to waste your time and ruin your mood, and nothing else."
"That was a really long narcissistically drawn out way of saying 'I'm prettier than you' lol (typical response from a transwoman when asked to clarify your definition of gender). Unfortunately for you, that's not really what feminism is about. Hint: it's a movement for the liberation of females from patriarchy. Try again."
"Having dysphoria isn’t about “boohoo my pain is more severe than yours suffer suffer suffer”, it’s about making sure people who transition aren’t about to put themselves through an possibly unnecessary and irreversible process, only to detransition and blame the trans community for letting them. Gender euphoria, most often, is a symptom of dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is literally the main symptom of being transgender. People without it and publicly say you don’t need it should be respected, but should also question the common problems with “tucute” mentalities."
"Oh my Lord. I use he/they pronouns. I came out as trans male in my late 20's but haven't fully transitioned yet. I was trained, by my mother, while growing up to deal with cat-callers with an eyebrow and deep critical frown. I was out in a skirt, because it was the easiest thing I have to put on with my broken ass elbow, and a man whistled at me and my partner. So I turned on the look and sent him on his way. I lamented this issue to my mother, that regardless of how passing I make myself look, this still happens when I wear anything (including long baggy shorts) men still see me as a woman and still catcall and I still have to break out The Look  'I taught you that! And you're joining the enemy with it!' My mother. A mother to four sons, and a step son, and a grandmother to more grandsons than granddaughters. Said this to me, her trans child.  Also? 'A tongue pop is the answer to everything' girl you're not wrong"
"Can we all just agree the agender Contra was so cute, she blew our fuses?"
"In fact, I just want to know that trans people are on my side as a feminist when it comes to the struggles to dismantle patriarchy.  For sure patriarchy is the fundamental cause and model for of all oppression, still running that biology=destiny idea all around the world. Dismantling patriarchy is what's important to me, not how anyone identifies, as I'm cool with however anyone dresses or makes up or pronouns themselves. So, sisters and brothers, trans or cis or intersex, are you up for pulling apart the gender/sex equation?"

"idk i kinda disagree with the point at around 19:50 bc i,,, really wouldn't describe dysphoria as 'despising your body.' kinda reminds me of the terf idea that trans men/transmasculine people just 'hate their bodies' due to some 'internalized misogyny' or something,  rubs me the wrong way. i'd say at its core it's more like a,,, disconnect ?? which can manifest as a hatred towards your body, and does for a lot of people, but i wouldn't say the hatred itself *is* dysphoria. idk if any of this is making sense but yeah, just a point that bugged me a bit, along with comparing transmeds to actual transphobes. trust me ik a lot of them can be gross but i think comparing them to terfs is kinda wrong. buuut i still enjoy your videos, they're really well done and entertaining"

"Notes on point 3- I've heard time and time again that gender identity is not the same as gender expression yet when you mock abolishing gender you get rid of your gender expression (make up, dresses, etc). The idea is not to get rid of these materialistic things but instead to abolish the connection it has to one sex or the other. Keep wearing your make up and dresses but abolishing gender means to accept yourself as male (sex) whilst doing these things. Gender is a social construct and these material aspects are not part of femaleness. Female is a classification of people that have a common attribute and that's their biological sex (same goes for males). Clothing is not an attribute as not every woman dresses the same or every man dresses the same. Behaviour isn't an attribute because not all women act the same or all men act the same. These groups are connected solely by biology. Abolishing gender means to acknowledge biology and let people dress and act however why they want."

"I first heard the term 'gender critical' about a year ago from the girlfriend of one of my friends, and she identified as such. As a non-binary trans, the term really bothered me but I couldn't explain why as I'd never heard of it and I had no idea what it fully encompassed, though I guessed (correctly, as it turned out) it meant TERF dressed up in 'nicer' language. At the time I asked 'have you ever met someone gender critical who wasn't a TERF?' and she replied 'oh yeah, loads, they're really nice'. Yeah, well, plenty of people, including racists, misogynists, homophobes etc can be 'nice', especially to their own kind. 'Nice' isn't all it's cracked up to be.  And now a year later I finally have a good rebuttal video to send to her, full of great counter points and easy-to-understand analogies. But unsurprisingly we don't talk any more :')"

"I think you did a pretty great job (as always!) with this video and it was awesome to see that although you were mainly speaking from your own experiences you did mention trans men and nonbinary people's experiences at times (this enby appreciates it!). But since you said to leave my concerns below: it's worth addressing at concern 6, that not all cis women do have periods. Some might be infertile and can't give birth. So even if we take all trans and nonbinary people out of the conversation, it's kinda weird to assign being a woman to having periods and an ability to give birth."

Well, fuck that. I enjoy my very masculine vulva and clitoris, I have no qualms about my breasts (although I am having them removed because I had 36E tits and a 29 in waist and they hurt my back), but LO AND BEHOLD I possess XXY sex chromosomes, so if anybody can medically show they are not cis, that'd be me, I just lack dysphoria and am very comfortable in my skin as it is right now with 4 years of hormones under my belt, literally. My mind might change as medical practices become more advanced in the reconstruction (My absolute terror of losing my nipples is almost crippling and would rather bind than risk this at this time), but I have no desire to have a penis."

"I didnt like this video as much as the others. Somehow it feels like you were more respectful to incels than to terfs. Which are both not respectable groups. But both most certainly have some reason for their crazed hatred. Which you addressed breifly as being the case but then quickly brushed over that fact. Tho I suppose that is understandable since this group is directly attacking you specifically. But the defense you gave is also not as nuanced as your other videos of the trans experience. So it'd probably be better for the people on the fence to go watch those, because I don't think this would be convincing. I especially didn't like the mocking voice used for the Sylvia Plath quote since she said nothing offensive and I dunno why her point can't be taken seriously. Anyway yeah not a fave video of yours."
"I'm a recent convert from the alt-right, after watching a few pewdiepie videos and laughing at some of the memes I became a full blown National Socialist sympathizer.  However after watching this video, I realized how stupid I was and now I've become fully deradicalized. I owe this woman my life. Maybe she can make a video for all us new converts, maybe some beginner tips for anal sex and wearing makeup and where to get poppers and things like that. This is all such new territory for me.

"I think a lot of the outrage against Germaine Greer is overblown, and this is as someone who bought into it initially. SHe's deep into thoroughly biological female issues and in that context maybe it makes perfect sense to hold to the distinction between trans women and biological women. I think trans issues really just aren't her area and she keeps getting thrust into it over what she's said and written in the past.   It might just be maturity or absolute disgust with the state of the Internet or general-purpose existensial horror but the outrage simply isn't fun for me anymore having seen what it can lead to.  She might indeed be a TERF but she ain't the worst TERF, just a big ol' dick sometimes."
"It rattles my chromosomes!! 😂"
"A TERF was invited to speak before a House committee a few days ago. There was a Congressional hearing about the Equality Act. Mainstream media, and even so called independent progressive news sources are basically completely ignoring it. No one is talking about the fact that the Equality Act that would add sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity to the groups federally protected from discrimination. Right wing shit stains are framing this as an assault on cis women, and no one else is talking about it at all. I am a cis lesbian, and I'm far more concerned about the fact that I can be fired, evicted, or denied emergency medical care in thirty US states than the fact that trans women might complicate conversations on gender stereotypes.    This act is likely to pass in the House but very unlikely to pass in the Senate. I feel that you should mention in a video, and on your social media accounts, that people should be contacting their senators early and often to demand that they vote yes on the Equality Act when it reaches the Senate. It is still completely legal for queer and trans people to be denied housing, denied employment, fired, evicted, and denied medical care for being gay or trans in THIRTY states in this country. The Equality Act would finally give us legal recourse against this kind of discrimination. It is actually getting worse for gay and trans people in many of the thirty states that don't have anti-discrimination laws to protect the LGBTQ community. For example, a bill was just introduced in Texas that would make it easier than ever for lawyers and doctors to refuse service to gay and trans people.   Long before that most recent bill, Texas has been very clear about it's contempt for the LGBTQ community. In Texas, it's not only legal for teachers to be fired for being gay, as you can be fired from any job in Texas for being gay, but even straight teachers can be fired for being supportive of their gay or trans students. A TEACHER CAN BE FIRED FOR TELLING A CHILD THAT THEY ARE A GOOD PERSON AND THEY SHOULD LOVE THEMSELF. This is the sort of hatred and discrimination we are facing in the majority of US states.  Please use your platform to urge people to contact their senators and demand that they vote yes on the Equality Act, especially if they live in a red state."
"Hi, I love your channel, share your point of view on many issues (neoliberalism, white supremacy, free speech, philosophy as a possibly misguiding abstract tool, how to deal with bigots) and - 'as a cis white woman' - am really thankful for your courage, wit and patience, because that's how I came to know and understand many things about trans people, womanhood and me as well. I m writing to you now, because I would like to thank you in particular for what you said in this video about supporting the struggle cis women specifically face against the patriarchy (and about that, I would like to add that I think reproductive rights affect not only the social experience of individual women, but also capitalism's way to reinforce its structure and to reproduce its race, gender, and class hierarchies, and to me that's kind of the point). I always felt, but now I know, that I should support trans women and men's specific struggle as well: it's really a sisterhood thing. I consider my self a feminist, but if that's transfeminism, count me in girl!"
"at-least radfems dont pretend chromosomes are a social construct and the radfem definiton of woman which is an adult female makes sense and is true, your belief that a man can become a woman and vice versa is biologically wrong and is no different to flattards saying they feel the earth is flat or a b747 fan saying they feel like the b747 is safer than the dc-10 because muh grounding."
"I adore you, this video was amazing. I really appreciate the explanation of the TERF point of view and eloquent rebuttal. The idea that women's 'femaleness' is rooted in our oppression ignores the fact that women around the world experience oppression in varying ways and intensities. To assert that a trans woman is not a real woman because she hasn't experienced the painful formative misogyny of a cis woman is as naive a claim as insisting a first world cis woman is not a real woman because she hasn't experienced the intense misogyny that women from more misogynist cultures have.  At the end of the day we can't define our womanness by how men mistreat us because not only are those experiences so radically different from person to person and community to community, but also, we're once again giving men the power to define us. The only person who can define our womanhood is ourselves. Like Catherine MacKinnon said, 'anyone who identifies as a woman... As far as I'm concerned, is a woman'. Keep kicking ass, you're the bomb 💪🏻"
"damn I almost listened when you said that men should leave but I'm glad I stayed"
"Where was this video three years ago? I used to obsess over this questions (specially the ones about what constitutes a 'male' or 'female' brain, or if the gender binary was even a real thing I should support). For a couple of months I couldn't think about anything else. I wanted desperately to know what was the difference between female and male identity, what made a person decide to transition, what made a person decide to identify as something most people have never heard of. This was on 2016, the highest point of the SJW bandwagon (or whatever you want to call it), so it kinda makes sense this was going through my mind. It didn't help that I never fitted in the average girl image, I had spent my teenage years as a bisexual girl and I wanted to look more masculine if anything, and was starting to wonder if that desire could actually correspond to a non binary identity. Then I discovered anti SJW Youtube and found a place where they gave clear answers to those questions that I could agree on (mostly because the people giving them were a fun girl or guy with a sense of humor I could relate to, instead of an angry stereotypical non binary person that probably hated me for even dating to question the foundation of their identity). Now I look back on some of your videos and I can see that many times they were mean to or even bullying weaker people (like Milo in his first videos). I still follow some of them because I enjoy their new content, but most I have unsuscribed.  Good thing I just gave up caring and try to find 'the truth', because there is no truth."
"God I love you"
"Sorry I know this doesn’t have a fat lot to do with your video( which was great to watch btw) but I found a channel and I’m sure there are many like it but it was mostly a woman going on about how women are destroying society and men are the victim of western culture and that men are the people who created and built society and oh men are so much better than women. For some reason I found myself crying lol as she went on about MGTOW and how feminism is death for society. In short I feel quite thrown and I’d like to know more of your thoughts. There were comments on the videos like ‘ Stop using tax payer money for abortions ‘ ‘ shame women who choose to be single mums ‘ ‘ increase the birth rate like how Russia did ‘ and they all just sound like nazi ideals like the kinder kuche and kirsche and I don’t really get it ahhhh. But if you ever read this thank you :))"
"My concerns come from working in a section of healthcare that occasionally has to be aware of sex-specific considerations. The most famous example of a sex-specific concern is arterial plaque buildup (concentrated in cis men, diffuse in cis women). I can’t find any quality research on whether trans patients are more likely to have patterns consistent with their chromosomal sex or if a full medical transition causes the pattern to be more consistent with the patient’s chosen sex (sorry if I bungled any terms). I guess my concerns may not be the average person’s concerns. Thank you for a video that took the questions of people unfamiliar with trans matters seriously."

"Hi. I think I've been watching your videos for a while now and I'd just like to thank you. You're an amazing person and your videos are spectacular.

I just wanted you to know that your videos are getting me through a very rough time in my life and I just wanted so say thank you."
"it sort of makes me uncomfortable to see the two-spirit ideology slammed in such a manner; these are aboriginal traditions that extend above and beyond the concept of nb/transgender. it is a common practice which has existed far longer than the modern, or even archaic, Western world? the idea being that when a member of the tribe/family dies, their souls are oft 'reborn' into the body of the newest infant, usually a close relative. esp. in inuit traditions it is common practice to give a child a name, and then also another name which is that of the passed relative   it's an entirely separate identity from nonbinary or trans! these things can't really be compared. but as ever I appreciate the work that you do"

"I love that as a straight cis guy I watch most of Contra's videos and she talks about issues and arguments I never knew about nor likely ever would have to encounter and I can just sit there and say, 'Oh yeah I can see how someone could feel that way toward trans people. But Contra's right I definitely see why it's problematic and they should try to overcome those prejudices.'   And then I walk away never having to deal with it because of my male privilege and I can just bring up what I learn from her to impress other students and girls with how enlightened I am."
"There's a weird Russian movie recently shown in Cannes somewhat about trans people in rural societies - 'The Man Who Surprised Everyone' - I would not say that it is nesseserly a  'good' movie, but it is weird and close thematically. And not nesseserly about trans people, I can not really tell what this movie is about."
"a comment"
"Dear ContraPoints,  Do you think al right-wing politics is bad? Maybe more specific, do you think progressivism is always beter than conservatism? I'm truly interested, because I do like your videos and generally agree with you, but I think that both sides of the duality are important to keep both sides in check. I understand that this statement, at it self might, sound quite conservative and bourgeois, still I would like to know your opinion on this topic.  Sincerely, Merlijn"

"Thank you for this awesome and thorough video. I especially appreciate your vulnerability in sharing your personal lived experience of 'male socialization', which is something i struggle with constantly as a nonbinary AMAB person. I have always felt a little alone in having once been a shitty cishet teenage boy, and i've learned to sort of hone in on those rare moments of gender experimentation that i had in high school just to legitimize my current lived truth and the personal growth, change, and transition that got me here. But now i feel a little less alone, so thank you for that."

"this might rub some people the wrong way, but it seems to me, as a cis woman, that a lot of terfs and other such “feminists” use their womanhood as an excuse for cruelty, even though their suffering was minimal. i grew up white and wealthy, so my experiences are nowhere near universal, but beyond the gender norms pressured upon me from a young age (which men experience just as much) i wasn’t really ever discriminated against. yes, violence against women exists, but, to me, it seems like, to the vast majority of terfs and their ilk, they haven’t experienced much of it."
"your point about abolish gender was amazing. yes ti is a valid concept and you should never treat it lightly, but transwomen are not the poeple you wanna target with that concept since they're the most vulnerable and biggest bearer of that very standard of gender dichotomy. you have other people whom you should be educating about gender abolishment."

Well your video strike a cord with me.    Also I swear I'm not one of those stalker types, granted that's exactly what a stalker creep may say, but it's true.

At the root, I suspect a lot of judgmental attitude slinging and attempts to define who is in/out of any subset of humanity is about sex (the act, not the naughty bits). It is people wanting to know who they can sleep with and who they have to compete with to sleep with the people they want to sleep with...and only insecure people are really bothered by anyone not being what they think they should be in a narrowly defined way, so they know if they can sleep with them (the way they want to, if they want to) or know how to compete."

"I have been hearing great things about this channel for a while now, and finally got the chance to check out some of your work. I have to say, this is incredibly well done, and I learned soooo much from this. You have a sub from me!"
"Hey, Contrapoints! I have a few questions and I feel like you'd be the best person to answer them. (Even though you will most likely not see this question and someone in the replies will answer it for me.)  First, a little background information on myself to give a better view of my stance. I am a cis man, I do not personally know any out trans people living in southern Georgia, and I am gay but I don't really think that matters too much for my question. Anyway enough of the foreplay, onto the question.  A few weeks back, I'd say early March maybe, I was in the library of my high school taking my online class (not actually) and some reason or another, my friend and I got on the topic of gender politics. I'm an open-minded person and gave them the usual rhetoric concerning gender. 'It is a social construct blah blah' Then this dude, who I have never spoken to before rolls up to us and introduces himself and says, 'Hello! Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and had to say something.' Being where I live, expected the same southern ignorant speak of 'only two genders!' which is not even my argument, but he shocked me. I assume this guy is conservative and probably had good intentions as he proposed a pretty good argument to me. Anyway, back to the story; we begin talking about our stances and debating on gender politics and trans problems. I don't know why he ended up saying this, but it stuck with me for a while now... he said;  'What do you think the suicide rate is for trans people before and after their transition?' 'I don't know, I would assume less.' 'No, it is near the exact same.' (I think to myself that it is a BS lie, but let him continue.) He then goes onto say, 'What the studies show is that no matter what Trans person does, they can never reach their goal gender to their level of standard.' At this point, I'm pretty pessimistic about what the guy is going to say next. 'Take for example other mental disorders (We both agreed that Gender Dysphoria is a mental disorder) like anorexia. You do not help an anorexic person reach their goal weight, if you do that they will die. Instead of trying transition transgender people, why not mediate the problem through medicine and therapy like we would with any other disorder?'  I'm not going to lie to you, that argument sounded pretty damn good to me. We continued a little bit after that, but I forget the rest. That however stuck with me. Being the person I am,  I wanted to ask more questions about it. I figured asking another cis man would get me nowhere, so I wanted to ask a Trans person. I don't know anybody Trans as I stated earlier so I took to the internet which was a pretty bad idea. I went to a couple of discord channels and got nowhere... I went to a forum and get zero replies. And now, here I am, asking the comment section of one of my favorite YouTubers. Anyway, that was a lot of build so I am going to go ahead and ask the questions.  1. As a trans person, do you feel you will ever reach a point in time in which you are completely satisfied with your gender and how the world views you or is it a fruitless endeavor?  2. Is Gender Dysphoria on the same tier as Anorexia or OCD to you? Or is it an entirely separate thing?  3. As a trans person, how would you feel about medication that could mediate the problem or completely eliminate Gender Dysphoria?  BONUS: Who is your favorite drag queen and how do you feel about the 11th season of RuPaul's Drag Race? (Of course, this is assuming that all LGBTQ+ people watch Drag Race, and not just gay men.) (I also wanted to ask this question just because I recently found the show and have been enjoying the hell out of it and had no one to speak to about it.)  Anyway thank you to anyone who read that mess, and if ContraPoints somehow sees this; I want to thank you as I steal 100% of my views from your videos like the sheeple I am."
"I'm hearing rumors of another rising wave of demonitization of political themed videos and 'inappropriate content',  Is this affecting you?   If so I may finally, bravely, heroically come out to my friends and family as a ContraPoints subscriber to maybe get you more and keep up the production value (though your old videos are still just as fun as the new, and totally rewatchable), and push your uncertainly of how much ego to grant yourself as your fame and infamy grow.    I am becoming a humble patron regardless since I want a comfortable excuse to be indignant if one of your future videos is sub par,  but if your videos are currently under attack by YT it'd be useful to know your thoughts on why, and if there's anything the we can do to help mitigate it"

"As a 49 year old hetero man - I've seen lots of people in my Facebook feed post meme's about 'Gender Neutral' and things mocking it.

I hung back because my hope was that I could discuss that with somebody in that position in person someday to better understand it before I formed a hard opinion. This video has done a great deal to get me the information I needed to understand where they are coming from. You are doing a service to the human race. Thank you for helping the rest of us catch up."

"I think addressing transphobia is great. And it needs to be said that hate is hate no matter what you call it. I get it. But I didn’t feel there was a great deal of depth to the analysis of queer theory. Certainly I think Natalie has analysed an arrival point of queer theory —or where it’s at now...but there is very little analysis of the two base camps—the essentialists (birth defines roles) and the constructivists (linguistically defined social bodies). Also a lack of analysis of actual ‘feminism’. Quoting Greer (an easy scapegoat—I mean who likes her anyway) and yea gods (Catherine McKinnon conservative anti-porn legislator) does not a feminist analysis make. For people watching this the first time—won’t know who yr talking about or that yr talking about second wave feminism at all or the victories they won and the damage they’ve caused my trans brothers and sisters. I feel you’ve only just scraped the surface in comparison to earlier videos that were much more in depth and better researched when less personal. Also find the suicide reference a little trite and glib and a vague attempt at humour fell flat for me. Other than that I love the Apollonian/Dionysian Natalie’s which may have been a stab at Camille Paglias Female suprematist BS but I’ve been wrong before...I like the dialogue and is vastly entertaining. Still as a famous fashion oligarch once said ‘less is more’ too much information overwhelms rather than satisfies—and this may take a while for Natalie to master the soft touch...(sigh) And to cover less topics (fine tooth) more thoroughly esp. when dealing with Feminism and Queer Politics in just 30 mins unless. A) u be trans and b) u be so qaf that u carry a fkn card and a PhD to boot. Sooooo that being said TERFs still needed to be tskd tskd and that kind of made my day! Sometimes though when things are personal we can’t see the wood from the trees and I get that. Still the personal perspective is totally valid and beautiful which at essence how trans folk make space for ourselves in a hostile world. keep it up :p) ur loving qaf trans brother from straya.

You might not think that's possible, but I wanted to let you know I really appreciate how much more nuanced and understanding this video was than your 'TERF' video, which to me seemed really misogynistic and like a giant strawman. There was some of that here with your 'crazy witch inner TERF' or whatever, but overall I commend you for trying. You gained a lot of respect from me"

"Great video essay, but please slow down. Some of us dummies need time to digest info. as you move through topics. ;)"
"As a trans man... totally not a fan of being called a 'menstruator.'  But then, I'm also not a fan of menstruating at all, so there's that.   I've had a--let's say 'interesting' relationship with the concept of gender growing up. I was raised in an incredibly conservative, anti-feminist religious denomination (which was *totally* not a cult, except it kinda was) in the Bible Belt, and even though there were definitely a lot of signs I wasn't a girl, I actually managed to repress the whole 'I'm a guy' thing until fall 2018.  I didn't even know trans men or nonbinary people existed until I was around 20, and the very little I knew about trans women was so bigoted and inaccurate.   I stumbled into a rather liberal pocket of the internet when I was 20 or so, by total accident, and made friends with some (lovely) people before I actually realized they were The Dreaded Liberalz.  So then I had a crisis, because these people were very nice, and their beliefs honestly made more sense to me than my parents' views, and cue the crisis of beliefs. For maybe half a year of my transitional period from sheltered 'anti-SJW' to flaming liberal, I guess I held TERFy viewpoints, but those were shut down pretty quickly when my best friend-slash-future partner hinted about maybe being transfeminine.   Around 22, I started questioning my gender because female didn't fit right. I wondered if I was nonbinary but that didn't completely fit either, but I didn't actually accept that I was a guy until several months ago, after moving out of my parents' house after getting married (to the aforementioned partner who is so good about my gender situation).  So that's been fun.   I said all that to say that, because of millions of layers of repression, I definitely do identify a lot with the 'female experience' and oppressions, even if I'm still not a girl (please, TERFs, stop calling me one). At the same time, I also seem to have subconsciously picked up on a lot of the same traits that my dad instilled in my cis brother, so... Idk, still working that one out. Essentially, in my experience, I find my upbringing was quite *similar* to the 'female experience' but there was also some dissonance in some places. (Edited to add: of course, I recognize that if I come out and transitioned and society saw me as a man, my experience would become a lot different, naturally.  Hell... I'd settle for not being called 'ma'am' every time I check out at the grocery store. Seriously. Every. Time.)   Anyway! I first found your channel through your video on the term 'trap' (because one of my friends and I were currently having a debate on the subject) and I've quite enjoyed all your videos that I've seen so far.  The amount of thought that you put into your content is impressive, and I always feel like I end up learning something or thinking about something in a new way, even if it's a subject I've put thought into for a while myself.  It's really rad.  (Not in the 'radfem' way, but in the 'slang from back when my parents were younger than I am now' way.)"
"The thing that gives us the qualities that we see as feminine, masculine, whatever, those are genetic qualities. That essence runs through your entire being; it's not just the brain that is male or female, it goes down to the code in ALL your genes. Thus why I've never bought into the idea of a 'male brain' or 'female brain'. If your brain is that, then your entire being is too."
"That Sylvia Plath quote was beautiful. It made me cry."
"Video games peaked with Cooking Mama 3"
"I loved this! Mainly the part about abolishing gender, which is something that always crosses my mind. These kind of gender normative things always confused me. Once I had a guy teacher whose dream was to wear big crystal rings. And I just couldnt understand why wouldnt he simply ... Wear them. I think society has a way of loading specific meanings into objects... An habit that can be very harmful. These ideas are really very nuanced, as you said. I am a woman who generally speaking does not identify with 'feminine objects'. I loathe doing my nails and my make up but I totally encourage it in other women. I think 'being a woman' has a whole universe of meanings behind it but It always  comes down to: do you feel like one?"
"Hey @contrapoints what is the definition of 'woman' or 'womanhood' you're using? I'll admit that I'm clueless on the topic of transgenderism and trying to be open minded about it but I don't know what it means to be a 'woman' from a transgender point of view. Is it just the social identity I.e everyone refers to you as a woman and uses female pronouns or is it something more, less or completely different from that?"
"Thanks for taking on the TERFs! Even as a cis woman feminist, they drive me nuts! Women are women and men are men whether they're trans or cis, regardless of what particular 'plumbing' they're born with!"
"I work with people with dementia. I met one transwoman et one trans men with dementia. They forgot how to feed themself, how to speack, how to use toilets....they never forgot their gender. I pretty sure that's the proof that trans-identity is totally natural.  All social-construct like hygiene, forks, clothes, where forgotten. But their gender, not the one they got assigned to but their real one, stayed until death."
"You suck"
"Ya estan los subs en español! Aguante!"
"I didn’t even know ‘terfs’ existed. Seems mad that any level of feminism would exclude trans females from the feminist agenda - the whole point of feminism is to highlight the inequalities women face in society - to be a trans woman is to be a woman + all struggles met with being a trans individual. This video has helped me to understand the dangers and extreme views under the ‘feminist’ banner. Fuck them bigots, trans women are women."
"The part where you talked about the disgust felt towards and by trans people about us, I won't lie it made me tear up a bit.  I'm in a place where it isn't very safe for LGBTQ people and I get those disgusted looks every day.  Sometimes it just seeps into your head like spilled bong water on a carpet and it's so hard to scrub out the stains it leaves and even then the scent lingers.  That's what it's like to have all eyes on you, people staring and whispering things, the obligatory 'what is it?'.  But much like the bong water in the carpet, a little alcohol and a 'don't care' attitude and it's like it never even happened. 🍸"
"Insightful as always, I love that there are videos like this out there.  I'm a decent enough person that the worst opinion I think I could ever have ended up forming regarding trans people would have been a very 'yer' dad' one.   You know?, 'Well I don't get what the fuck is going on, but whatever, let people do whatever makes them happy', that kind of thing.  - but videos like this that break down and explain the subject are incredibly helpful and allow otherwise well meaning but ultimately ignorant people to listen to actual trans voices and form something of an understanding of the subjects discussed.   Also the teapot bit almost killed me, never stop doing what you do."
"Wonderful explanation! Thank you!! I am wondering if things can be made easier by having both gender and sex on document? So that gender is completely self-identified (faster recognition for trans), while sex is medically assessed (for medical inclusion). So that women's book club welcomes cis and trans women alike, while female sports competition (where hormone level makes a difference) only permits female."
"So, as an actually gender critical straight cis white male, this video is incredibly enlightening. The part about talking about abolishing gender being used as a bludgeon against trans-individuals instead of against actual perpetrators of our patriarchal culture (both toxic masculinity and commodified femininity), really hit home.    My criticisms of transgenderism falls squarely on wondering if sex change surgery is really an appropriate measure, as to my mind it equates to self-mutilation, and there are studies that showcase the unhappiness of post-op individuals. To me it feels like an extreme solution. But, even as a male who is much more emotional than my female partner who has always felt more at home with the women in my family than the men, it isn't my struggle and I can't know what it is like to feel alien in my gender expression.    I know what it is like to struggle with depression, and perhaps its easy for me to see parallels with a sex change to suicide that aren't there (that is an imperfect and permanent solution to a problem it likely doesn't fix) that may not be there.    Thanks for making this video, and all your others. Each that I've watched has been well made and informative. Keep up the good work :)"
"OMG, I just had to pause your video and try not to fall out of my chair when you picked up that teapot!!! (I'm, uh, still at work this afternoon).  LOVE YOUR CHANNEL!  You are wicked smart and absolutely beautiful, please keep doing exactly what you are doing!"
"15:04 Half the time the only thing stopping me from drinking tea straight from the spout of the pot is how silly I look doing it. Thank you for that gracious proof of concept and I laughed really hard."
"Another great video. But I do think people aren't going to tell you the truth,  which is that your new joke delivery style in this video often doesn't work, doesn't land, and kinda betrays the overall tone of gentle education. At this point, edgy nihilistic commentary around these topics is so culturally mandatory, now gentle Dad jokes and friendly supportive explanation are the only subversive answer."
"Incredible! Thank you! <3"

"What a cruel unfeeling stance GG takes on trans people. I was born with a vagina but I have to take androgen blockers because of PCOS; otherwise, I'd look like a german shot putter. In which case, i too would disgust old Greer tits with my hairy back and man acne.  Sad times. :( In brighter news, I love you. ♥♥♥♥♥x"
"I'd also like to add that one of the best responses to terfs saying that having babies or uterus is the only way one can be a woman is just like, that's so unfeminist to say. A woman's right to be a woman doesn't sit on her ability to have children that's what conservative politicians say to tell woman who don't want kids that they're wrong. What about the cis women who have amenorrhea and don't have periods? I am not a cis woman I do have a uterus but I also have PCOS and I've read so many blog posts and comments on pcos forums about cis women struggling to connect fully to womanhood b/c of the infertility and pain and hatred of their uterus that PCOS causes and that's even without the fact that 70% of of people with PCOS produce more testosterone than the average afab body which causes even more issues with feeling disconnected to womanhood and being made fun of for looking too mannish or for looking looking the way a woman should. Like if TERFs really cared so much about protecting women they would care that so much of their language and definitions of what it means to be a woman or posts about how to 'clock' a trans woman hurts cis women too. But they don't care about that because it is just primarily a hate movement. And that's one of the biggest ways to know that."

"You had me nodding all the way through, and even literally pausing the video to mentally repeat your arguments in my mind. We may not have experienced the same kinds of oppression, but all who have been oppressed have that in common. Can't we just get along?  But also, as a public speaking prof, I kinda want you to vary your hand gestures. Maybe it's the extra long nails, but the gestures feel unnatural. Consider facing your palms to the audience every once in a while. The couple of breaks (e.g. sipping from the teapot spout) are marvelous, and remind us of how real you are."
"I love the way she claps to emphasize a statment."
"I basically just failed to identify as female for most of my early life (Aspie late bloomer), and I feel like I experienced male privilege to a surprising extent, just because I didn’t respond to anyone as if I were a woman. I wasn’t harassed as a kid. I wasn’t much flirted with, because it was pretty obvious my interest wasn’t there (again, late bloomer). And periods were my best time of the month. Feminists used to yell at me that I was just afraid of the term, but I basically had to learn about what other women faced, in my mid-twenties, and I was being told that it was men’s and trans women’s place to shut up and watch while the real women spoke, and based on everything they said, I wasn’t one. There was a gap of six *years* between when I started performing femininity and when I finally came out (to the tiny circle of friends who knew how knotted up I’d been about it) as a woman. But I think I caught everyone off guard with how much I transitioned, after that — once I gave up on feeling loudly excluded from a gender that I kept being loudly told was both my responsibility and my birthright. I still identify very strongly with the position trans women are in. I was born with a vagina, but we’re still basically in the same boat."

You *were* directly quoting me in *that tone.* In a vid about TERFs. Just no  :P  You're better than I am at a good number of things, and I enjoy the way your vids help me to improve myself. *I was trying to return the favour* bc for once, I'm good at smthg you're not good at. Idgaf about gender, so don't make it about that. I offered legitimate and constructive feedback on your singing. It was about the *singing.* Nothing more. Don't take my advice if it doesn't matter to you. You don't have to sing well bc you have an army of bobbleheads who are too enamored with you to tell you the truth when you're bad at smthg, so w/e. But don't assume that everybody who criticizes you always does so bc of your gender change. I grew up with transwomen, and really. Idc about that.   I think the worst thing social media has done to the glue that holds humanity together is the damage to everybody's ability to take constructive criticism. On the internet, there is almost no such thing. People are always either advertising a product and writing in super amped marketing language, or they're trolling. We can't tell somebody how they can improve smthg if we don't want to get called a hater or a troll or a TERF.  You're smarter than that, so don't fall into that trap  ;P"

"Hi Natalie.  Love it love it love it.  Can't thank you enough for the education.  I have a question - although ignore if you have already covered it and I missed it.  Now, I'm not denying body dysmorphia at all, but I wonder about the narrative that tends to bracket all trans people as body dysmorphic.  I guess that's a historical issue, in respect of the medical profession, under the auspices of an 'ignorant' society at large, misunderstanding, coming to terms with the increased visibility of trans people, and especially younger people identifying as trans.  The question is, are we moving on from the medicalisation now?  How do the trans community feel about this issue (although I do think this is a vital question for society at large too)?  I'm pretty sure many young people questioning their gender identity are still getting shoved straight into the doctor's surgery and coming out with a diagnosis; where support, love, validation, education, knowledge and encouragement would have been the better option.  I mean, I guess some trans people are relieved at the bd diagnosis because it sets them on their chosen path of transition, whether that be straightforward recognition, or treatment and such.  That's it.  Forgive any of my own ignorance or improper language, if I have strayed into difficult waters.  I just instinctively feel, we should be opposing such medicalisation in the same way we would oppose the incarceration of women for 'hysteria' (which I frightfully fear may still be happening some places).  Thanks again.  You're the best teacher, ever!"

"I wish transmeds weren't so demonized. All we believe is that dysphoria is needed to be trans. No matter how much, no matter when you decide to treat it or how you decide to treat it, or if you spent decades repressing it before you realized you couldn't anymore. We don't think you have to be suicidal from it, we especially don't think you have to absolutely hate your body. Most of us don't hate our bodies, we just wish they were aligned with how we see ourselves and how we want to be seen. I love your content about 80% of the time, and I don't hate or even dislike the parts I disagree with; I only disagree with them. I fear that even your brief negative mention of us will have your rather large fanbase attacking us, and that is not a good feeling when we already are so often rejected from spaces intended for trans people the moment we disagree with anything."

"I'd take Contra to a nice fancy dinner and then ghost her completely."
"You touched on this briefly but I feel it needs reiterating: terfs like to say that the way trans women identify calls upon patriarchal constructs of gender and patriarchal concepts of femininity. Then they turn around and implicate masculine oppression as a requirement to being a woman. Both those things are statements of womanhood relying on men to define them. Just another hypocritical defense exposing the true nature of the beast."

It's only been a bit over half a year since I came out as nonbinary, and having gone from an outside to *sort of* an insider in the community (I don't identify as trans for various reasons), there are still many things I need to learn.  I think there were some things I previously didn't understand that were cleared up by this video.  Also can I just say that I love the outfit you picked for the TERF persona?  That was just... amazing."

"cw for transphobia including internalised, dysphoria, depression and suicide ideation etc i suppose…  I knew… well I told my parents around… what? Age 3? 4? Maybe 5. I was shut down. I internalised it for years. Got heavy depression. I was already suicidal at age 10. I was in pain all the time and wanted to jump from the wall at the back of the school ground, onto the floor below, something like 20 feet down.  It came back to hit me around 11 years old, with puberty and swimming in PE. I came out to some friends shortly after. I was shamed for it. My cousin shamed me for it. When I came out to my parents at age 13 they talked to me for literal hours telling me things like I would never be a 'real woman', that it was a phase, and asking me if what I felt (which I realised years later is heavy dysphoria) wasn't because I was abused by someone as a kid.  So yeah. If that's male socialisation, I don't know what to tell you.  It was a fucking war. I was given orders and expected to behave a certain way and it went against my very core and now when I look back it feels like it's still a raw wound that won't heal. Maybe that's why I just couldn't stand studying the book Regeneration in English Litt in High School.   As for the matter of dysphoria validating being trans? Hell, I feel less trans because of it. I can't even fucking accept myself. I see all efforts I make as not enough and just see… what's underneath all my clothes and makeup and shit… and I just don't feel valid. I feel like a ridiculous, grotesque freak show. And I look at other trans women like you and I admire you all so much. And I see you all being happy in the way you present and living your best life and I'm just scared and… UGH   I should probably stop drinking vodka and go to sleep."

"28:01 Since you're making this your definitive proof, I'd like to rebut that. What 'paradoxical' critique you're ascribing to feminists is in fact perfectly consistent with the critique towards both a man self gendered as woman, which in itself by definition and your own admission @11:36 is a misogynistic stereotype, that merely wears a façade of being a woman while at the same time acts with all the toxic masculinity of males. Loud, demanding, raging. You indeed don't see women indulge in death and rape threats ever. EVER. Which brings my next point.  And since you're delving into the nitty-gritty of the exclusion problem, I'll have to expose your dishonesty and that of the entire misogynistic liberal feminist movement calling feminists TERFs when they clearly don't exclude trans people at all but merely males. Trans females are more than welcome as they are not demanding and toxic. You can call them MERFs if you want but stop the TERF lies please."

"This was really helpful and important to watch, because as a cis female I didn't even realize that I was unconsciously / internally using a lot of the same rhetoric that 'gender critical' feminists do. Thank you for taking the time to genuinely address these questions. There's one thing I'm still confused about, however: why does that lizard part of our brain feel such disgust for trans people? Why do trans people feel this disgust about themselves? The best reason I can come up with it because it bothers us to not be able to fit things into simple, clean cut boxes, but I'm not sure if that's the 'right' answer. In other words, does anybody know why the disgust that fuels transphobia (and gender dysphoria) exists in the first place?"
"> 'I had an irrepressible need to become a woman' That's great, as long as you don't claim you're a female... Also since you seem to like men, as to your sucking dick reference, you probably don't feel the need to get into female's spaces nor demand of lesbians to consider you as partners, right? If so I don't think you and feminists disagree on much in fact. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBrQD9T-1u4&list=WL&index=1"

"11:36 That's a huge strawman, no feminist is saying 'don't be transgender', we're saying leave women spaces alone, stop claiming to be female and stop the whole female penis charade that's destructive as fuck to the feminist discussion of their oppression and the utopia in question. The strawman is there for a reason, you're not really interested in a genderless society utopia very much. Which is normal since you and I as males have had amazing lives and so see no urgency in ending the women's oppression that is gender. If I as a feminist man do not feel the urge to end patriarchy enough to even regularly attend feminist protests, you as barely a feminist probably feel the urge much much less."

"Simply substitute man with white, woman with black, sex with race, gender with culture and transgenderism with transculturalism in this whole debate and let's see how many of you liberals still agree with the trans side of the debate...

Now if 199 people speak French and one speaks Spanish, is it right to force everyone to speak English just so the Spanish person no longer feels left out? Changing fundamental things like language to accommodate anomalous groups just feels like excessive political correctness. I mean,  don't we need to be respectful on a one to one basis, but be proportionate otherwise. And it is women once more who get moved down and displaced.

"The problem here is really the extent to which the trans narrative has become a meta-narrative that is policed and enforced. Any dissenters (TERFS) are reported to the thought police (social media high-ups who have the power to ban), and are rejected from the platforms and the discourse itself, or else they are put on ban-lists so people never even have to encounter the ideas, or else they are rejected from their local queer communities because any word not fully supportive of transness is taken as meaning they are hateful and bigoted and do not deserve a place among the few people who share their sexuality.    While the abolition of gender may be a utopian ideal and the freedom to transition should be retained, the hostility the trans narrative forces upon gender-critical feminists borders on totalitarian control or religious brain-washing."

"Oh also I wished you had talked about how in the grander scheme of feminism across the political spectrum, TERFs tend to fall right of centre. Voting habits, especially outside of the US, skew towards conservative political parties. There's hardly anything radical about their feminism, they work more to maintain existing social structures even more than liberal feminists do."
"The VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE don't recognize the idea of gender separate from sex. Not just the 'TERFs' in your radfem hellworld.  Sex is a better predictor of behavior than any social construct/personal identification, the problem is that surface-level behaviors aren't the best indicators of what's actually going on. Think about why there are so many more trans women than trans men, and nonbinary females than nonbinary males. It speaks to something intrinsic.  And none of this is a scientific issue. We hardly have a reliable model/theory of mind, let alone identity. People who say that the concept of gender separate from sex is scientific are being completely ahistorical and not telling the truth about the history of feminism and gender theory.  MORALIZING what is a metaphysical/ontological issue will eventually backfire. The wave will roll back, especially as slogans such as 'trans women are women' are pushed, and the idea that straight men not willing to date trans women are bigots. Then maybe people with dysphoria can actually get effective help instead of having enablers cause them more harm by reifying their delusions.  Dismissing the real criticisms of contemporary gender theory as 'troll questions' shows only denial. I don't want you to not exist. I don't want you to be harassed. I don't even want you to stop believing the things you believe. I do want you to stop moralizing a philosophical point that most people don't understand for obvious, understandable reasons. If your identity rests on MY accepting an untenable ontological position then it has no base.  At the end of the day, dysphoria is not valid epistemology. How you feel doesn't say much at all about what you are. If you can't agree on that then we're not on the same plane of reality. As long as the 'trans women are women' line is being pushed then transsexualism is as much of an enemy to coherent thought as transubstantiation. It's just doublethink.  And yes, the gas station attendant is being polite because he's on facebook. We're all reading the same histrionic shit and it's much less of a hassle to just humor people. I'm not so boring as to spend my time hating and being disgusted by trans people. It's the extremely basic political dialogue around them that I hate."

"I have a question about personal thought and if it can be gendered. I've studied a bit into gender & linguistics (actual name of the course), on here you speak on the performance, the persistent acting of one's social role, but what about thought? I don't feel like I've seen anyone ask about thought. But do you think like a woman, me like a man? What does it mean if we do? If there is gendered thought, is that something into which one may transition, is it an eternal carrot on a stick, ... is it just not a thing? Personally, I've always had an itch in the back thinking that I think like a girl. This is the first I've really given it glare with pursed brow, however. I always kinda brushed off as, well I might just be gay and waited for enough the tequila to twang my curiosity. It did. And now I know I'm not, which sucks because now I have resign myself to potentially missing out on some really unique and special experiences. Poor me, but I digress. Back to the topic at hand, discourse and performance and a pretty clear social value, but thought is pretty detached from that value, I think. However, the two former are used to build understanding, which takes place in thought .. and I don't know. So, I turn to you, smart human."
"What an incredibly nuanced and intelligent video, thank you for this. This is the first video I’ve watched from your channel and I’ll definitely be coming back."
"You don't have to be a radical feminist to know males cannot be females. It is best that transwomen accept this reality. It is so absurd to spend this much energy into denying a basic fact."

"Is it the same thing as in his video about TERF's?"
"Reading the GenderCritical subreddit for 3 minutes made me feel really really upset and angry at how these women are supposedly acting in the name of women. Well, they don't act in my name."
"I am a cis hetero (flexible) feminist woman and I love you and support you <3  Thank you for making these videos, it brings clarity and makes it easier to explain to other people. Trans women are women!"
"Sorry, but the claimed 'ick' of two men kissing has basically nothing to do with some lizard part of the brain.  Kids raised by gay parents dont have it, just like people raised by straight parents and surrounded by straight culture dont have it (mostly) when they see straight kissing.  Essentially, and to sort of go against what I just said - we ALL ick over ALL of it - but become use to it and then we do not care.  My straight brother is like the perfect example.  Oh, and myself, a gay man, am too (the first time I saw two men kiss, it was very, Very, VERY odd)."

"Why not just have separate causes because the way you described the experiences are different. So why not treat them that way? Why do minorities with different experiences insist on being grouped under the same banner? To do so seems to create endless contradictions, and I also believe that gender identity and sexual identity are completely separate issues and should each be given separate attention.   I'm interested in peoples take on this?"

"You’re my absolute favorite edgelord, and I’ve spent the last week reading K. C. Green comics, so that means at least a little."

"This was a great clarification of some of the questions that have floated around in my head. I've never had a problem with inclusive language or gender identity, but I have worried about things like gender stereotyping, whether or not conversations about reproductive justice are transphobic,  and how male privilege works into all of this. Nuance is exactly what I needed. 💚"
"Your talk about every woman being able to 'clock a tran' reminded me of something that I did that I still chuckle a little about but also feel bad at the same time.  (Also I had never heard that phrase before. <.< . . Also yeah that's not rational at all. )  I had a transwoman come into a restaurant I was waitressing in.  It never occured to me that she was trans.  Had no idea.  Looking back I'm sure other people could have said she was but I just don't really think about those things. She hinted at it in her conversations with me as I served her pizza and refilled drinks.   I tend to be a little clueless to the point of totally missing social cues.  So when she went to pay she handed me a card to pay that had a man's photo on it and a male name.  I was confused but the man on the photo had the same nose and general face shape.  She asked me if I could see the resemblance and I said ' of course I can. '   She seemed pretty sad but said it was her brother and I was minimum wage so I went ahead and used the card.  She left and it was roughly two hours later that I realized that I had probably really hurt her feelings.  I laugh at my own cluelessness but feel awful that I may have hurt her feelings.  I'm afraid she may have thought that I saw her as ' a man ' and not how she wanted to be perceived.  In reality. . I was COMPLETELY clueless."
"Leftist euphemisms,  Pro-choice actually means pro baby killing. Feminist actually means misandrist.  By calling baby killers 'pro-choice,' I am legitimizing their slaughter of babies. By calling feminists 'feminists,' I am legitimizing their hatred of men.  I mean do what you want, but calling people what they call themselves doesn't legitimize shit. It's just being polite. It is a good way to start a conversation if you actually want to change minds, and not create more division."
"Fuck yeah"
"A slur is not ''A pejorative that targets someone's race. religion, gender, or sexuality.' That is unnecessarily specific. The dictionary defines a slur as an' insinuation or allegation about someone that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation.'   This is what the left does with the term racism as well, and they are rightly mocked for it. Racism doesn't require 'power,' racism is hating people for their skin color. Stop trying to win arguments by making up your own definitions."

I've also been searching for a friend of mine for several years now. I know she's dead. I know it in my heart and soul that she's dead. But I want justice on some level for her.   Swerfs are trash. Legislation policing the human body is trash. People that exploit the fears and vulnerabilities of sex workers are trash.   If you feel like covering this, i...I....Well....I couldn't love you any more at this point but....I guess I'd just worship you a bit more vocally"
"The use of 'Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy' in this kills me... so funny. Also, Natalie, you're radiant!"
"another big thing i think terfs gotta understand is that issues can coexist and at the root of what they are doing is exactly what they are fighting “against”. yes trans-women undergo a different experience, but it isn’t any better and does not invalidate their experiences. we need to work towards solidarity. we respect and support trans and non-binary people in this house! i’m still learning so i am extremely thankful for ur videos to help guide me natalie! :)"
"The moment with the tea made me choke on my own tea that I was drinking.  I first encountered /r/gendercritical quite naively.  The idea of 'gender is silly, why am I making myself suffer for stuff that's just inside my head' had some appeal to me as a way of coping with my personal problems with gender, but yikes, it was/is a scary place."
"i thought she said timbs"
"I'm literally crying from laughing so hard. The video was beautiful, and so well done. I stan a queen! <3"
"I want to have the mental strength to talk to people who might be legitimately uninformed, but I can't muster the fucks to give. Dealing with people is hard enough in my daily life, and I don't have the energy to talk to people like I wish I could.   It's the same thing with many of my other trans friends, and even an intersex friend of mine who isn't trans but deals with a lot of the same harassment from people who yell about chromosomes and insist that there are only 2 biological sexes. It takes time and energy that many of us just don't have.  It feels bad not being able to stand up for myself, but if I engaged everyone who called me a 'confused lesbian' or a 'snowflake', I wouldn't have any time to go about my life. The only two places I'm safe are my own house and the basement of my local comic shop, and even the latter is only after a grown man got kicked out for harassment."

"Dost thou laugh?  No good coz I rather weep at thy good heart's oppression.   Are Jordan Peterson quietist Christian conservative types laughing at the deadly enmity between trans folk and terfs? Well, laughing at people is bad manners, laughing with is okay. What we can stand for and revere and ' conserve' ( the clue is in the name) is old stuff that is not broke and does not need fixing. So...good manners, common sense, minding yer own business, having few laws and simple ones. There's nowt so queer as folk and folk have always been queer. There is no novel reality that popped up in the last 20 years that ancient laws and customs do not have answers to. Rights of trans people ( of ALL people) are as they ever were. No law can outlaw hate just as no law can compel love. Recourse to the coercive power of the state sets everyone at each other's throats. A hypothetical law proposed by a creature of myth with scope only in your inmost thoughts, enforced by no police, weirdly impractical, beyond human nature, beyond reason:- Love Thy Neighbour. Now THAT is some radical thinking right there. Contra points is there or thereabouts already methinks. Hence the appeal to dreaded right wing types. Peace. Out."

"Thanks for posting this. There were some questions(confusions?) i was always too ashamed or embarassed to admit thinking, and definitely never wanted to bring up to my trans friends for fear of alienating them (or myself). I really appreciate the way you address these things, thanks for handling things so well and not making me feel like too horrible of a person for not coming up with these answers myself."

"The point of 'abolish gender' isn't to become a genderless robot being (although that sounds fucking *lovely*) but to do what the fuck makes you comfortable without inserting yourself into society's boxes. It's an aggressive refusal to conform to the categories offered to you, not 'alright I just won't use anything from any category.'  At least how I use it anyway. Which, yes, does lead me to criticize people who insert themselves in the 'cis-whatever' category simply because they think they should."

"Many people drawn to terf ideology have had some “trans” type feelings or experiences which instead of putting down to gender dysphoria have put down to living in a misogynistic society. Many women have experienced gender dysphoria due to traumatic experiences or even just the way women’s bodies are viewed in society. It can be unpalatable then when some trans activist try to frame gender as a question of merely “identifying”... as though there is a kind of element of choice... some women find it very hard to identify with being a “woman”, it’s forced on us in a way. I’m just worried that the current discourse around gender erases that aspect of womanhood and frames all cis women as happy and content with their gender, otherwise they must be trans, when that might not be the case."
"Thank you for this amazing video! I will be directing all further TERF-related questions here until future notice.   Also. Girl. Either you’re wearing makeup in the genderless utopia or you have the luckiest rosacea placement of all time. CAN’T FOOL ME."
"Honestly I once saw a terf passing around a list of ways to clock a trans woman on tumblr. All the hair ones except stubble applied to me, a cis woman. They don’t know shit about how to tell if someone is trans or not beyond stereotypes that often might even apply to them"
"Thanks for setting aside the whole issue of suffering as the forge of validity and womanhood. I really wanted to like The Bell Jar (I remembered how subtle and incisive her poetry was, it's meant to be a feminist rite of passage, and that quote about road crews genuinely resonates with me) but putting it aside , having tried to occupy its corrosive mindscape for hours, was the best thing I could have done."
"Thank you so much for saying end the victim one upmanship!!! Almost everyone in the USA is victimized to some degree or other. Almost everyone is privileged in some area. As a society, we need to identify how we are victimizing others, stop doing so & cease trying to minimize others suffering compared to our own.  Let the accusations of mansplaining begin. I'm white straight & 40. I didn't check my privelege properly. Tear me up, i don't care. Will still do my best to make the world better starting with myself & those close to me."
"Is the music in this video meant to sound like Wendy Carlos's synth-y classical music? Sounds a lot like her interpretation of Bach on the Moog back in the 70's? Just wondering.  (appreciate your video's btw!)"
"Im for the abolishment of gender. If they were serious about abloshing gender trans acseptence is one of the larger steps. Im grossed the hell out that terfs are using it as an attack."
"I'm left really concerned with your argument against the abolishment of gender.  What I think of as 'abolishing gender' generally concerns refraining from using labels for forms of expression (e.g. to be caring is feminine; to be crass is masculine), and not to abolish expression itself. To group together a series of traits under the umbrella of a single gender is absurdly broad and unnecessary; the hyper-generalization of traits is the reason why many feel that they can't be well categorized into any of the genders that are commonly found in a single culture.  This model may seem utopian, but it's not very complicated to stop labelling items, actions, and appearances as 'manly,' etc., and it seems too dismissive to classify the abolishment of gender as some far-off and unachievable goal."
"May I say that you look especially beautiful today? And your background is amazing...so is the content of this video!"

"Love the video, but I’m from Cincinnati 😩"
"Obviously, this is an amazing video chock full of insightful and strong arguments. But before I take in the rest of the video, I have to comment on what an amazing look you're rocking. The veil covering one eye? The contrasting teal flowers against the red shirt, hat and lighting? The smokey makeup and gold jewelry and lips? The luxurious background? Fully fantastic."
"Good video as always. Keep up the good work."

"so goddamn great!!! <3  THANK YOU"
"Is it me or is she looking more and more feminine by each video? You're slaying it sis !!"
"TERFs are even worse than Manny Heffley."
"Thank you! I struggled with some of these questions (especially with the fact that I interpreted trans women as reinforcing gender stereotypes) and this really helped me understand more <3"
"You’re so awesome. Fuck these ignorant feminazis"
"Great video as usual but I feel like I need to point out how GORGEOUS you are looking here. That make-up is slapping me in the face."
"RadFem: you're not a real woman, you're not XX anyone: how can you prove us you are XX? have you ever checked?"
"Love your content. Super interesting video. Random thing and I'm not sure how to word it exactly, but at 15:05 you look/sound/feel 120% feminine and it's beautiful."
"I actually would call myself a 'gender critical' feminist but also agree with almost everything you said. I didn't appreciate the suggestion that I am just saying the stuff I do to thinly veil my hatred for trans people, of course, but looking at those fucking forums I can see why you would say that. I don't look on those for the same reasons. If the dreaded 'trans orthodoxy' followed your theoretical framework I would have 0 problems. I used to be 100% pro-trans-everything until a few things happened, including the insistence that trans women never benefitted from any male privilege continually popping up, and I questioned what became the 'orthodoxy' at my uni and in my friend/acquaintance group. I wish we could all start again from a respectful point of view, I really don't rate Germaine Greer and her shit breeds increasingly unnuanced stuff from the other side that I have felt has worked to invalidate and dismiss any method I have of describing my oppression. You don't do that. I love your videos and have been watching for some time. Keep up the good work."
"PLEASE PROCEED FREELY TO YOUR DESTINATION"
"What was that game show clip lmao"
"You're only a year and half in?!  That gives me a lot of hope.."
"And then Terfs will cry how gender roles are a construct of society!"
"I thought this video was quite entertaining and very well done. I'm still blown away by how people actually think Male privilege is a thing in the west. This terminology of oppression is tricky and quite often unempowering. But to the point, in my own perspective, women have it better in the vast majority of ways compared to men. So this race to supreme victimhood seems more like a victory lap. Otherwise this was very informative."
"I really loved bringing up how being a woman is not a homogeneous experience. Cis women do not universally have periods, pregnancy or experience oppression based on their anatomy. It is simply a fact. It is not a good argument to make about trans women, because it isn't even true of all cis women."
"I genuinely love your videos, and I think you do your research. This video is great. That being said, while it isn't uncommon for people in the transmed community to attack others (something we need to work on as a community), I do think the arguement was a little miscategorized here (I apologize if I used that word incorrectly). I won't deny that there are more radical individuals than I am who do think that way, but the majority of the transmed community doesn't define dysphoria as hating your body. I'm a firm believer that any level of dysphoria is 'enough' dysphoria. I would never tell someone who experiences even the slightest dysphoria (which I am defining as discomfort or distress in being percieved as the individual's AGAB/feeling uncomfortable or distressed by things about yourself that remind you of your AGAB), physical or social, that they were invalid.  I apologize for the long paragraph, and I hope you're having a good day. :)"
"I learned a lot from this video and it was really entertaining. Thank you!"
"this is a fucking masterpiece thank you so much"
"Thanks for articulating this so well! I was recently talking with someone who genuinely wanted to know why I thought trans people shouldn't have to divulge that they are trans in both nonsexual (make out session,  dates, etc.) and sexual situations (head, anyone?). I cited violence, harassment, and 'none of your damn business', etc., but I think there is just more to it than that and I'm not aware. Do you think you could do a video on that?  Also, I think that some 'TERFs' or maybe just less aware feminists in general are upset that, in a way, trans isssues have made decent progress and that they feel women's issues are still being left behind (?)."
"She said adult human females. I suppose I cannot watch. lol!"
"ladies, lets get these rights"
"There's seemingly a lot of similarities between TERFs and Incels."
"A friend had sent me this video as I'd had some genuine questions that I didn't totally understand about trans-women (due to my own ignorance) but was struggling to find answers to (that I could fully comprehend) and therefore struggling to understand and compete with existing thoughts that have framed my whole understanding about gender and society.  You've REALLY explained it so well and I'm so grateful he directed me to your page - making my way through all your videos now, you've got such an engaging, comedic, thought provoking and entertaining way of exploring complicated concepts and issues.  THANK YOU!!!"
"Your hat stole the show though. Lovely."
"Cincinnati Chili is amazing you don't know what you're talking about! It's all we have!"
"Wait, why can’t you get conservatives drunk anymore?"
"A thing that I saw happen, having friends on both sides of the shitstorm, was a pagan event that had a single 'biofem only women's mysteries' class.  It was all 'moonblood, and womb worship'  The Actual concern (apart from a potential TERF connection by the woman leading it) was one nobody would bring up publicly, was there were a couple trans women in the community that any time 'Women's Issues' came up, they would derail the discussion and make it all about Them and their transness, when it was Supposed to be about 'moonblood and womb worship' and nobody wanted to deal with that.    The resultant fight caused a schizm in the community, who Should all be on the same side.     It got Really nasty and hurtful all around.  And apart from the outright bigotry, I could see from my very outside perspective where everybody was coming from, and it was like watching people bash their defensive wounds together.  And I, of course, couldn't chime in with what I was observing, where the emotion and immediacy of the fight was way to personal for everybody actually involved to...  There was no communication, there was just fight.    After watching that go down, I've been pondering this question, of how do you discuss some of the hard things surrounding the Difference, which there functionally is, between Born Women, and Trans Women, and where those differences Matter and where they Don't, in a way that keeps everybody safe?  I just don't know.  But I think that's a thing that needs to be explored-  but any nuance seems to be a crack that assholes come howling through with their disingenuous and bad faith arguments.  That seems to be a Thing with everything now.    This doesn't really exist with trans men and bio men- provided nobody's an asshole bigot-  that's an unfair thing, and partially a thing of male privilege (we are not defined or punished for our biology) and partially, well we're just not... share your beer, don't be an asshole, and we're cool, pretty much.  Our identities and worldviews around biology don't inherently conflict, in the way that 'BioWomen'  and TransWomen seems to in certain places (from admittedly outside observation).    I don't know.  I fundamentally 'get' *Other*, wrong skinsuit, all that jazz.  I've got some *Other* going on. What I wonder, is where is the line between 'reasonable accommodation' of *Otherness* and where we just have to accept that We are, in fact, a weirdo that must navigate a strange land and deal with our own shit in a world that isn't ever really gonna get us, IS exactly?   I think...( wow, I've spent way too much time on a comment which will likely never be read or discussed, but whatever) I think across the board with Social Justice and Identity etc (which I am all in favor of)  we Also need to assess just how much other people need to give a shit about whatever we've got going on that doesn't apply to them, beyond basic human decency.  Some things, Yes need more attention and specific respect, some things, I think anyway, we've just gotta get right with the fact that we're an extreme minority weirdo (not so different than Nat's utopia thing).  I don't know what those lines Are.  But I think that's a discussion that needs to be had, without malice or affront."
"I'm a gen X'er so all this is still new to me.  My memory sucks so it's hard to memorize all the gender labels.  For me gender is a non issue.  I may have a narrow cis view of what's really going on but to me it seems like the people who get upset the most are the people who are afraid of falling for someone who isn't the gender & identify with the gender they feel its acceptable for them to be in a relationship or sleep with.  I hate labels and I hope that someday we all learn to love people for who they are and put less emphasis on gender and appearance.  Anyway, that my 2cents."
"3:42 So this is Abigail Cockbane's true form..."
"A thing that always seemed weird to me about TERF arguments is that it seems awfully exclusionary towards cis women as well. Amenorrhea exists and there also are older women who no longer menstruate. There also are many women who can't have children - and significantly more who didn't become pregnant yet. It sounds a lot like patriarchal mysogyny."
"congratulations! youtube is pushing your faggotry to unsuspecting people"
"I really want to see you respond to Jamie Shupe's article where he said his entire transgender/non-binary experience was a sham. De-transitioning is a topic that never seems to be covered and I think you would be the best person to make a video on it."
"I miss portuguese subtitles :("
"You are the entire bomb. As a cis female feminist and mother of a genderfluid teen, I am very pissed off about TERF's usage of the term 'gender critical.' The gall of some people. I mean, if anyone is critical of gender, it's trans people. I feel like TERFs are appropriating the term in order to rob it of its value and undermine any actual critiques of the status quo. I hope we evolve past our tribal mentality soon, so this divide and conquer crap can stop being so maddeningly effective."
"LOVE WHAT YOU MAKE!! Thanks!!"
"Whomst...well, just whomst."
"***Disclaimer: I say all of this with the idea that I hold views similar to feminists, but I also realize that feminism is a broad category. As such, I'd like to note that it is absolutely likely that there are other feminists who disagree with what I've said. I didn't mean for this to be a summarization of feminist view points. I just meant this as my perception through my own feminist lens. Also, at some point I use words with strong connotations (oppressor and suppressed). I don't mean it as intensely as it sounds, but I just don't know what other words fit there insofar as ease of understanding my point. /Disclaimer.***   “TERFs” bring up two genuine concerns I have/had that directly relate to feminism. One is that by dressing in overly/extremely feminine ways, transwomen were perpetuating a stereotype that only encourages the seemingly patriarchal ideal that women are supposed to go through extended effort in order to make themselves attractive for men. Meanwhile, I also hold that belief for women in general.   The bad thing is that dressing in overly feminine ways irritated me more with transwomen because it's as if they're saying that this is what it means to be a woman. This is what women are. This is how women act, behave, and dress. The summation of it is insulting. It’s as if transwomen are the people in that Always commercial who are told to “run like a girl” or “throw like a girl” and they’re doing it in a stereotypical “girl” fashion. It felt, and perhaps still feels, like the 'oppressors' are taking something distinctly from those they're suppressing and trying to glorify in its suppressive qualities. It's like they're taking this unhealthy idea about our gender norms and are trying to keep us down by perpetuating it.   However, as soon as you said that transwomen feel the need to be overly feminine because they fear so much the idea of being mistaken as a man, it made sense. And I can understand that. So, I'll try not to be so bitter about it, especially because you're right; abolishing gender is a completely unrealistic ideal, and it shouldn't be fought at the expense of others.   The second issue I take is with the very idea of wanting to be or the idea that one might feel like one gender over another seems to be an idea that encourages these sexist divides, like one is putting a value and idea of what it means to be that gender vs one's own. And I think that's another issue that feminists have with the trans community. It is, at least, an issue I have with it.   I think transgenderism is a fruition of an unrealistic expectation of societal beliefs on what men and women should be. And being transgender is an acceptance and surrender to those expectations, which feels like a smack in a feminist's face. It feels cheap (in two ways, but for sake of length, I stick to the previous sentence). Really, it isn't fair to trans-people. Cisgendered people accept and surrender to these expectations daily - if not hourly. I succumb to these roles often, despite my best efforts to avoid doing so. Yet because it's normal and expected for cisgendered people to follow their assigned roles, it's harder to detect. Meanwhile, trans-people aren't a norm, which acts as a more pronounced reminder to feminists of the unrealistic roles and expectations that we're subjected to.   Basically, what I’m trying to say is I think you, ContraPoints, did not fairly represent those points (not maliciously, of course). Granted, the people you encountered were ignorant, so I understand the position you’re coming from. But posing in stereotypical “girlish” poses is insulting. That’s not all we, women, do and are. I know that’s not what you’re saying and that isn’t what people mean when they do it. But I think you can also understand why it would be interpreted that way.   TL;DR: There are serious concerns in regard to gender roles and transgenderism. However, I think that transpeople are not the source of it, rather they are the reflection of it. This creates a constant reminder and emphasis of our gender roles, which is frustrating for feminists. That doesn’t mean it is okay to degrade, demean, or exclude transpeople. It simply means we need a better understanding of each other – and I do mean each other."

"the goth-y persona has an awesome necklace"
"Hmmm, there is probably a good chance that you wont read this and wont want to read this, but I'll still try. I'm one of those 'not particularly feminine cis women' and my take so far as been that I do see some of the more generic points made by 'gender critical' are somewhat interesting. But at the same time I do think that most radfems appear to be assholes and that any arguments they make are made in bad faith and hence it's pointless to discuss them. It's kind of like there are probably genuinely structural things worth criticising about islam as a religion and religion in general (just like with catholicism or hinduism), but right now the only people who want to obsessively talk about this topic are racist assholes. (and I do think that you are on point in regards to people having a negative gut reaction and then inventing a moral system to justify it)"
""
"I have read some of the terf arguments and there are some places where I can sort of see where they are coming from? But never to the extent that any of the conclusions they draw from it are justifyable. Like I don't think that any of that really justifies obsessing over it, excluding people over it or sending people angry messages."
""
"Anyway, here are my thoughts on some of those issues."
""
"1.) No gender/stereotypes. Again, this as all opinions is a pretty selfish one. As a woman with some non female typical hobbies/lacking a lot of female stereotypical hobbies like fashion or shopping, naturally I'm very much on board with 'these signifiers don't define me', aka boys can wear makeup and skirts and have long hair and act girly, women can wear pants, have short hair, act brash etc. So to me the way some transwomen express themselves does sometimes come off as trying to hard. Like maybe it is influenced by having to prove to the world what you are. Most cis women just have never had this experience and hence it feels very foreign to me. And it  often makes me wonder: how do you know that what you feel is 'woman'? If woman is just a vague feeling and not something you can enshrine in long hair or periods or babies or dresses? Like I get how one might feel that what has currently or what is approach as currently is not what one wants, but how do you know that the other you want is really 'woman'? Like, you are sure that you are not-A, but does that necessarily mean that it's B? Especially if it is really vague what B really is? How can you be sure that what you want or are is really B and not just the stereotype you built up about B? (admittedly I do have this feeling way more with how men portray women in movies and how transvestite dress, and I do think that transvestites and transwomen do have a very different feel in how they carry themselves) Can anybody really say for sure what B really is?"
""
"Based on things you have said in other videos my guess would be that maybe you have read books by women and maybe what they wrote resonated with you on a fundamental level in a way other things didn't? But to me that usually brings up more questions, surely no women can speak for all women? Are there really any traits that are or should be exclusive to women? Like being meek or being desired or having great hair. If anybody wants these, is there any reason why they should not be enjoyed by others? Are women just whole bunch of typical traits that usually go together and most women usually have at least some of them, though usually not all? (I should probably mention that I think being a woman in my eyes is neither something to strive for nor to run away from. To me it's just a trait)"
""
"I've read that hormons make a difference and cause big changes, which again makes me wonder, how can you sure which part is you and which part is hormones. Would hormones give the same stuff to anybody even if they didn't have the inclination before?"
""
"I do think that some element here is exposure though. It's not like there aren't any transwomen who regularly wear just baggy colorless clothes and have frumpy hairdoes and no makeup, it's just that you usually don't see them in the media/on youtube."
""
"2.) Childhood experience/Male privilege: I do think that boiling this down to male privilege is super stupid and I do think that acting like getting cat called at age 9 is somehow quintessentially woman is also stupid. But it seems to me that a lot of modern feminism is a lot about the media and the expectations put on women. Like what you get taught as you grow up, what behavior gets encouraged and discouraged, what the people around you expect of you, what kind of stubject you get encouraged to study. These don't even necessarily boil down to oppression even, but to me it still seems very different."
""
"And like I said I never had to struggled with proving my gender to people on a fundamental level, so that seems like a pretty core experience that most cis women are missing compared to trans women. So if chances on both sides are pretty good that we grew up very differently, aren't the chances also pretty great that the results and experiences are somewhat different? Again, it doesn't really offend me if you still want to call the result 'woman' either way, with just two different flavors, cis and trans. (but I guess this is the gay marriage debate all over again, where you have 'this things has been defined by these people for this many years' versus 'what are the fundamental traits that make marriage meaningful' and most people agreeing that those traits are 'people who want to share their lives and spend it together, ideally forever', but again, what are those traits for 'woman', if it's just a vague feeling, how can we ever be sure that my vague feeling ever matches your vague feeling? But surely there must be more to it than 'I think the word woman sounds kinda neat')."
""
"3.) Celebrating female bio stuff: My impression on the argument is that terfs claimed that there were some tumblr style trans types who complaining that bio stuff celebrating made them feel bad and left out and hence shouldn't be done. I have no idea how frequent that actually/whether it's actually false flagging. And I do think that as usual the reaction along the lines of 'Aha!!! this proves that trans women want to oppress cis women and shame us!!' is completely overblown. But that's what my impression was what the original arguments were about. That they were more like 'you were fat shaming/living out your thin privilege by posting pictures of your thinness or your weight loss success' style arguments."
""
"4.) Terfs say we act too male and too female at the same time: I think the main narrative of terfs is that (some) transwomen vibe male because the terfs feel that they exhibit some behavior that others have criticized as typically male. Like in modern feminism there seems to be a lot of debate on how men tend to act very entitled, from 'manspreading', to talking over women, interrupting them, making everything about themselves, whining if it is every not about them, being bossy, being competitive etc. So acting 'too feminine' can be seen as just another version of 'oh typical man, always overdoing everything.' Like it's kind of a 'Dances with Wolves' type situation where the outside comes into a community and immediately wants to become the leader and dominate the conversation. Then the whole debate 'it should be okay to reject a transwoman as a lover because she just does not like penis', again is usually framed 'this is just like the straight men who obsessively want to get into our pants'. Same with 'transwomen just like men get into your face or get physically argumentative or get into fights'."
""
"Again, as somebody reading the debates about this, I usually feel really skeptical how often that really happens and how much is just made up, hypothetical fear scenarios (a lot of these things remind me of anti-refugee/anti-immigrant/anti-muslim/anti-black debates, particularly also with the whole 'I'm just not attracted to [insert race], I can't help it' whining you see in some racist places)."
""
"5.) Terf as an insult or slur: My impression is that it is clearly a pejorative word and I do feel like it seems to get thrown out sometimes quickly to stifle debate or criticism, but I also do think that there are a lot of real hardcore assholes out there who deserve to not get talked to. It's complicated. On one hand I do feel like a lot of these things are very personal feeling based, so in reality there probably are a lot of limits to whether there really is a lot of discuss. But I do think that there are cases where it seems to get thrown around very defensively. And just because a group has good reason to feel defensive doesn't always mean that it's necessarily always the best reaction in every situation."
""
"I dunno, these are just my thoughts when seeing some of those arguments. It's not really something I share, whether online or in real life."
""
"My basic summary to transpeople is more like a 'I'm not sure I get all of it, but you do you' (and of course the physical integrity of everybody should always be preserved and people should try not to be shitty if they can avoid it)."
"'oops, wrong channel' I WAS WATCHING THAT YOU TWIT"
"Loved it!"
"Off beat, I know, but your set design is out of this world. Fucking love it"
"15:09 Ditto!"
"I was wondering what you thought about trans women in sports. Personally I believe trans people should be able to compete. I also believe women with naturally higher testosterone level should also be able to compete. I don't believe they should have to take medication to change their bodies."
"The feminist goddess we need. <3"
"I think Dworkin - who in my opinion is misused by TERFs - wrote some of the best radfem material, particularly in Intercourse. It's kind of the epitome of what Nathalie is talking about at the start of the video in terms of describing a world in which womanhood is dangerous, the world is a patriarchal dystopia and the female body is always engaged in the struggle to become a subject rather than an object. I like to think there is a lot to gain in engaging with some of that earlier radfem material, and since Dworkin was fundamentally against abuse of power I highly doubt she would approve of her material being used to bully and abuse trans people or any other marginalised group.   Also, this video was brilliant."
"Fuck that cop but I am truly interested in this stuff i might not agree with everything but I will keep watching some more of your videos"
"What do you think about the trans women dominating all the physical sports and competition's is it ok that the woman doesn't even have to right to know"
"excellently made, thank you!"
"After hanging out in Twitch gaming livestreams, this REFUELS me"
"No feminist is saying gender non-conforming men aren't oppressed and mistreated."
"And I will never believe that you are born gay trans or even straight this is believe that this is all development and kids changing is just wrong to me as a adult I have no objections"
"Why don't you dress in straw, it would fit your pretzel-twisted arguments better?"
"Nat...did you choose the Nutcracker theme because TERFs like to Crack down on peoples' Nuts?"
"I do believe that you are only men or women and if you feel that you are a woman then that is fine but you are not a biological woman you choose to live as the other way ok but I am never going to see you the same as a biological woman and I had trans people say i am against trans people because I won't date one and I believe that before any sexual act's take place you should legally be required to disclose this fact"
"What about the talking point of trans women in women's sports?  I am pretty much in line with Contra in pretty much every issue but I simply can't argue with the inherent advantage that trans women have over biological women in some sports."
"Superb. My only concern (or perhaps it is just a sense of confusion and incredulous wonder) is that there is not a single thumbs down anywhere in this entire thread. I dont this is a bad thing at all. On the contra, I think it is wonderful that this is such a supportive environment. Maybe I'll head over to twitter if I feel in need of some strong tea. Bless you fabulous one. x"
"My recent confusion about trans is the trans who compete in the girl races. I'm okay with trans compete in pageants but trans in woman athletes make me fell unfair because their muscle is different."
"God there's so much focken tea"
"It horrifies me to know Germaine Greer was once a radical hippy. ;Now she;s just a whinging pom."
"Natalie, I'd actually be super interested in you talking 'bout games - I love them but boi they have problems"
"Still a gender critical feminist or (as you prefer to call me) TERF. I'm not disgusted by trans people and hate people who are disgusted by them (like Germaine Greer). You misrepresented the core idea of gender criticism by comparing it to homophobia or racism. Gender crits don't want trans people to stop existing. We want them to thrive, to be happy, to be accepted by society. I am respectful of trans people's feelings, I don't deadname, I don't misgender. But gender crits just question the need of some people to transition as something that was caused by a sexist society. A society that hates feminine/gender-non-conforming men and masculine/gender-non-conforming women. Gender crits know that gender dysphoria exists but we ask if this psychological condition is fueled by society. If we lived in a society,that was much more accepting of gender-non-conforming people, would there be less people who suffer from gender dysphoria / would there be less people with the need to transition  ??? Terfs answer this question with yes and they are hated for it and misrepresented by you. You can't compare people who call themselves gender critical rather than TERFs to racists who call themselves race realists.  The core idea of racism is that people are defined by their race, the core idea of homophobia is that people are defined by their sex(you aren't allowed to be attracted to the other sex, you should conform to gendernorms); the core idea of gender criticals is that people AREN'T defined by their sex. That's why a lot of gender crits are LGB or detransitioners. Gender criticism isn't Transphobia, Gender criticism is a countermovement to homophobia and promotes acceptance of gender-non-conforming people."
"Here Not queer Reads a lot of Germaine Greer   Belly laughed at this, Natalie you are the bessssssssst"
"PROSPER!"
"I'm actually a pretty fashy person but your channel is the best among political ones. Love you"
"I’m a straight white male. I thought this video was good. Am I allowed to have that opinion in feminist theory?"
"This was amazing and illuminating, as always! Loved glimpsing the behind the scenes and out of character moments in this one :)  Keep it up, nat!"
"I guess I'm too new to this channel, so I'm a bit lost by what appears to be an in-joke about gamers."
"The only time I have ever felt my tinge of gender critical feminism escape was surrounding the “women’s day protest”. I saw plenty of people I admire, of all identities, write off the protest as anti-trans and trans exclusionary. Particularly citing slogans of “pussy power” and others that focused on female biology. It felt less of a stand for trans rights and more of a way of separating those who are more educated on trans-feminist theory and those who feel the oppression of our society but don’t, due to what ever reason, have the chance to interact with feminism on a academic level. It also felt like a further way to shame others for their biology and owning their own biology; especially those who meant to only empower and not exclude."
"this is why contrapoints rules. she can empathise and understand and therefore reach people on the right."
"Joyous."
"ohm, u have boobs now"
"I didn't even know you were trans until you mentioned it in a video once, and you look completely feminine with and without makeup on- the last thing id see is a man :)"
"Excuse my gamer beauty."
"the visuals, NICE"
"In 1980 :  i will be in flying in car by 2019.  In 2019 : i identity myself as a flying car. If this is what progress is, i would rather head back to tribal life and I believe many more will do. #change_is_not_always_progress."
"Why be trans if it is a choice? It only makes sense if one experience body dysphonia. Why be trans if it is not necessary and only bring hate?"
"Oh jesus I broke down at 'take a fucking sip babes'"
"This aesthetic has a Sam Esmail vibe"
"Yeah, sport issue, can you explain in a video why medical care tell transwomen that their level of testosterone shouldn't be under a certain level otherwise they will suffer physiological problems ? (a level that is still higher than the average women who do sport, or do not do sport)"
"If they were women, there would be no problem at all. It must have a logical and scientific explanation."

"Absolutely amazing video, much love from the UK 🇬🇧 Keep on being you Natalie, you’re an icon. Now, excuse my beauty 💅🏻"
"This has been the most informative and important episode to me. While I am and have been supportive, (at least the last few years, wasn't always on the right side by any means) of the trans community, I did kinda feel like it clashed with the main idea that gender rolls are wrong in the first place. And I never feel like I can, or know how to ask some of these questions I have, because they could come off as offensive or like someone just trolling. I just want to be a better person and understand an idea or behavior foreign to my own, but I also don't want to hurt anyone. I was happy to understand better here but this took it even further and really opened my mind a bit more. Sure gender roles need to be fought but one battle at a time, and right now, there are more important battles. And maybe some gender rolls are ok, as long as they are never forced or expected.  Thanks for this video. This question has been tugging at my mind for a while now."

"If you want me out, I'll leave, although I'd've thought you'd want more views. Isn't excluding 49% of the population in the first 2 minutes of your video bad strategy?"
"So much strawman in 30 minutes, incredible. You deserve an award."
"I think this is my favorite video from Natalie so far. This gave me a great deal of insight into the trans experience and answered some questions I had thought of, but hadn't found a satisfactory answer to yet."

"What are your thoughts on transgender athletes?"
"I am in love with you."
"I'm very conflicted at this moment in time about transgenderism. I feel that something is very broken around some of these issues in our culture. And not just the things that trans people say are broken. OTOH, what the cop did was cruel and wrong. The way TERFs act is cruel and wrong. But I also feel that a lot of people are transitioning right now who will ultimately end up regretting the decision and be stuck in a place where they've destroyed a lot of options for their life. And that also really concerns me."

"Another great vid Natalie, I must say as a masculine gay dude in his late 20s it was hard for me to understand the plight of the trans community but your videos have really opened my eyes And make me more empathetic."
"Contra, potentially dumb question, but whenever I talk about you with friends I sometimes stumble over exactly which pronouns to use. I would assume you prefer she/her but for some reason I remember hearing that you also will go by they/them. If anyone knows exactly what Contra goes by I'd love to know. This is an honest question, just want to give you the respect you deserve as an honest and genuine person."

"I don't like things that are 'gauche' is funny because in French 'gauche' litterally means 'left'."
"I would love to see you do a video on the 'transtrender' phenomenon, mainly becuase its only a matter of time before conservatives start using those cases against the trans community (I can feel it in my bones). Now I can understand if its not something you want to cover as it primarily affects FtM people, as it's often caused by mistaking body dismorphia (more prevalent in girls) with gender dysphoria. But i feel like it's an topic that can be explained very well by your style. It's a really tricky subject that i think is getting overlooked out of fear of being politically incorrect by saying anything."
"Contra, you are a genius illuminating what must be seen, is it sexist to say I'd like you to sit on my face? Anyway thanks for the great content!"
"The last phrase from Natalie makes me start fangirling A LOT."
"4:51 that cute laugh is like 90% of why I watch Nat's videos"
"God these videos just keep getting better and better. Can we just give Natalie her own tv show already?"
"Nice makeup in this video, Natalie."
"I read Conundrum, by Jan Morris in the 1970s. That has helped me enormously in puzzling out a phenomenon that leaves most of us conforming to our bodies' gender at birth in the dust. Hell, all of us born in the 1950s are a bit bemused. But it's up to us to catch up."
"'Ackshually Kropotkin...'  That is me 😂😭"
"This was incredible. Thank you!"
"Sjw pos"
"Man, I feel like a woman"
"Thanks: probably the best explanation of this topic that i've come across in years."
"Aside from her transphobia, I find it abhorrent that Germaine Greer didn't immediately condemn FGM and called opposition to it as an 'attack on cultural identity'. It does nothing good for women, and it causes serious, life-long health issues, both physical and psychological. Cultural relativism ignoring the rights of the individual is bullshit. Yes, this is a hard and fast judgement that also has emotional aspects for me, but I don't think that is always a bad thing. All evidence indicates that it is harmful, and it stems from regressive and misogynistic ideas about purity. I can't take any 'feminist' seriously who thinks that the individual rights of women and AFAB people in general should ever take a backseat to cultural norms like that."
"Wait, didn't TERFs invent the word TERF to describe themselves?"
"btw, Theres no way someone could accidentally mistake you for a man. Even when you talked in a robot voice you're beautiful and obviously a woman. <3"
"Thank you for yet another amazing , informative and humorous discussion on a topic that needed to be addressed."

"This is outstanding and well put."
"I'm a trans man who has been seeing a rise in TERF rhetoric in online circles, and this video perfectly dissects all of the arguments I've seen, and effortlessly tears away the blinders to reveal what this really is: Transmisogyny and transpobia. You're so brave and I can only speak for myself, but I'd like to believe that a lot of the trans community has your back. We love you."
"Hi hi hi Miss Points, as always another great video on a very interesting subject.   I do want to object to your 'gender abolition' section, and wanted to share another opinion with you. I'm a pansexual cis male who enjoys wearing traditionally women's clothing and supports beautiful transpeople like yourself, (imo not a dirty TERF) but I too think we should act towards the abolition of gender whole cloth. I believe that the expectation to act within the constructs of a gender binary acts as a form of social exploitation, and forces humans to restrict their personality into categories and refrain from embracing all their authentic interests and self-expression. The end of gender looks a lot more colorful than your bland, androgynous (but still cute) interpretation at 10:43   To borrow a quote from a ted talk by Scott Turner Schofield (an FtM transperson) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWubtUnSfA0  'I'm not for us all shaving our heads and wearing baggy clothing. I want us to be beautiful and I want us to celebrated using all the tools of gender and all of the tools of beauty that we have'  In fact, I think that the existence of gorgeous transpeople like you, Natalie, and even before your transition, is proof that people can and should express their beauty using traits associated with both femininity and masculinity.  Just wanted to share the fact that there's multiple viewpoints and reasons for wanting to abolish gender. Please keep doing what you're doing and being a force for leftist queer good on the internet <3"

"I think this is a really thorough video but I would've also liked, if possible, to see a response to the specific hate that people like Arielle Scarcella /AfterEllen are directing at trans women from a lesbian perspective-- eg 'trans women are forcing us to have sex with them!'. In general this video doesn't seem to cover that we do have a specific TERF problem in lesbian communities at least in the US -- in the UK it seems to include way more straight women."

"I really appreciate what you said at 20:45 because it bothers me when trans women are anti abortion or dont take into consideration the difficulties that come with female reproductive issues. I know we both have our different issues and I support you 100% in the problems you face that we don't but it important for you guys to support us the the things we experience and you don't too. We should be supporting each other. Its hard for me to deal with the possibility of pregnancy but its also extremely hard for you to deal with the fact that you cant biologically carry. We both have our problems and it important to support one another on our differences."
"I was onboard until that reference to the 'excuse my beauty' line. That was *not* a good example of resilience, Contra. That was an example of a delusional shield stubbornly raised in the face of an ugly reality. It's not resilient to pretend, it's desperate and helpless! By using that example, you're adding weight to the TERF argument that would call you a poor, delusional male oppressor."
"So this is kinda like gatekeeping womanhood? 'I've been listening to Muse since their first album, you're not a true fan!' kinda gatekeeping? I'm simplifying of course, but I can already see how infuriating this would be."

"Disclaimer: I am a (mostly) cis male.  I have to admit that I am considerably sympathetic to the radfem perspective on most issues, but not this one. What I observe in 'TERF'-y radfem discourse on this issue is not only transphobia, but anti-outgroup hatred that most visibly manifests in transphobia. But, make no mistake, they can be almost as vicious when talking about liberal feminists, anti-feminist women, women who perform femininity, and, of course, men. And they will tell you that it's justified, righteous hatred. Basically they engage in hatred of outgroups to build their ingroup. However, crucially, I think they are right about pornography and about prostitution, and equally crucially, I find their perspective on these issues notably absent from left-wing discourse if radfems are not present. And, they are often the very people building rape crisis centres and out there on the front lines fighting for abortion rights. So I very much don't want to see them ostracized from the left, even though I don't like the bigotry, and the legitimization of bigotry, that one often finds in their spaces. I have many disagreements with them outside of this - chiefly, metaphysical disagreements with their extreme social constructionist stance - but I have disagreements with anybody, and building political movements that can have success IS about overlooking such disagreements where possible.  The real kicker, though, is that the isolation of radical feminists from the left, even for real bigotry, _even when that segregation is self-imposed,_ is having a very pernicious effect, of amplifying the most bigoted and transphobic voices coming from that corner, and slowly erasing the distinction between radical feminist and 'TERF.' Which, by the way, is a term I don't like. On the other hand, I see problematic demonization and hatred coming from their opponents as well. 'Punch a TERF' is a vile notion, and you can see that easily enough if you visit the Chapo Trap House subreddit, or innumerable other left-wing hangouts that are in theory supposed to be pro-feminist. Further, while I have always considered myself strongly sympathetic to trans issues and trans rights, I don't agree with some of the new fringe ideas that have come out of queer theory - like the idea that you are however you choose to identify, and you get to define your own pronouns, and if anybody doesn't respect your they/them pronouns then they are a TERF and are fair game to be demonized. I think this is crazy and it's divorced from the struggles of most trans people who have always understood that changing one's appearance and social performativity is how one gains acceptance as a member of one's target gender, whether one 'passes' or not. In other words it's the group who decides what gender you are, not you. This is, of course, problematic for people who feel that their internal state doesn't align with their external presentation.  I guess I would just like to see more respect on all sides, and fewer hard lines in the sand. LGBT activists in leftist political parties have always understood the need to make alliances with progressive groups and individuals who have unfortunate blind spots and bigoted attitudes. I guess there is a sense that in 2019 we shouldn't have to do this, that anybody who doesn't accept you as you are can not only take a hike, but has no place in civil society. I don't like any kind of bigotry but I also know that the world is full of bigots. Most racists, sexists, and homophobes who are otherwise progressive find ways to mask their prejudices. It's increasingly difficult for transphobes to do this. I'm rambling now so I guess I'll stop. Thanks for the video, Natalie, I enjoyed it!"

I don't need to post a hot-take on anything you've said; it would be redundant after this flawless iteration. I just want to say your CRAFT is flooring it and we haven't even begun to see what you'll donate to this century, Natalie 💖"
"While you got the definition of transmedicalism wrong, I can very much agree that there's far too many, and I mean WAY too many, transmeds that genuinely believe that and attack+misgender those who don't fit stereotypical gender roles or their beliefs. It really is an issue that should be fixed, especially since even other transmeds are realizing this and are so disgusted by it. Generally, it's a mess lmao, absolutely chaotic  anywAY fuck TERFs, while a select few are just severely misinformed or were raised in their ways and are struggling to get out of it, that's not only absolutely not an excuse at all, but also a large majority are just transphobic assholes."

"God, I love watching your videos. Simply put, you are slaying the Youtube game. Keep up the good work, Contrapoints."
"I don't know how you do it, but your videos are just getting better and better. I loved this. I am a cis woman and while I have always been supportive of and defended trans people, when I was younger I did privately struggle with some things you talked about (namely, the male socialization and experiencing male privilege before transitioning), because I personally have had to deal with a lot of abuse and hypersexualization from men. I just never said that shit out loud because I knew I was the one who had the problem and needed to change. I really hope this video can get through to people who are open to changing their viewpoints. If not, fuck em.   Also your highlight game fucking MESMERIZED ME this entire video. I think I haven't been applying it to the right areas of my face."

"So entertaining watching the Left eat their own"
"1) Nat's Sylvia Plath voice is my new obsession. 2) This color on her brings me joy. 3) As a cis feminist, I needed this video so much. Thank you!"
"Hi contrapoints! I hope you'll find this amongst the deluge of comments you get.  I wanted to note that even medical language is not going far enough. The hospital where I had my kid completely erases trans men when it comes to pregnancy. The only place they concede that a scary tran can have a baby is on the exit survey, and the only gender options are 'female' and 'non-binary'. (Makes the pride flag they were flying outside a bit hypocritical)  So yeah, it's frustrating that because of terf panic over 'pregnant people' (what's wrong with the phrase 'women and pregnant people'? idk) instead of a nice slightly painful confession of being non-binary at my next midwife appointment, it happened in tears, ten minutes before an emergency c-section. Thanks, terfs.  Anyway... Uhm... Hope you're doing alright out there. Videos like yours make me want to try making my own."
"Wow!  Brilliant!  Thank you for making this!"
"Natalie lashing out at gamers, how will Hbomberguy respond?"
"What really bothers me about TERF ideology is that they can follow the 'abolish gender' mentality without putting down trans people. I don't think gender or biological sex should matter all that much and I also believe trans people should be allowed to dress however they want without the anxiety of whether they pass or not. Parents should raise their kids with the freedom to explore their identity and not let social norms hold them back.   It's also not like trans people will suddenly be comfortable with the body they have just because gender is abolished, making everything gender neutral isn't going to eliminate a basic desire to want to look and feel a certain way.   Heck, those who believe gender should be abolished shouldn't have to give a shit about someone using a different pronoun. If pronouns can be interchangeable and have no regards for biology then that's a great argument for why gender is irrelevant and based on a pair of arbitrary standards that aren't even consistent. It demonstrates that gender roles aren't biological, anyone can take on the role of a man, woman, both or neither and qualify as such. That is already one step closer to abolishing gender and is way more effective than putting down trans people who want to dress in hypermasc/fem ways."

"MaGa. Its the only way to end this insanity."
"I'll identify as whatever I need to in order to watch this video"
"I saw a lot of critique of this on Tumblr but after having watched it...none of it sticks.   Doctors referring to uterus-related medical care as women's care continues to prevent trans men from receiving medical care...especially in rural or conservative areas. If they see 'm' on your ID many gynecologists, midwives, providers of birth control etc will refuse to see you. Even if they will see you, your insurance may not cover that fundamental care for men. Trans men unable to access critical cancer screening is deadly, which makes terms like 'women's health' deadly too."
"TERF ideology and the way they view femininity and womanhood is similar and comparable to Nazism and the way white supremacists view whiteness. Both ideologies should be de legitimized and not given the time of day to spew their vitriol"

"And as a woman I have to ask, what did we ever do to deserve this lady?"
"Okay, totally unrelated, but Natalie has such a nice smile!! Y'all. Also, the 'FREE CHELSEA MANNING' Patron is a mood."
"If women are defined by shared oppression they themselves are excluding other born-female women. They boil femininity down to a collection of suffering that I've never felt or experienced. I was in my late 20s when I first really was made to feel that I was not identical to a man in brain and wants. Thats probably later than most trans women. It's sexist in it's own right from where i'm sitting."
"I'm a (cis) woman and I've never had to deal with cat calling or oppression from men and I don't mensturate. So that, I guess,  makes me a man."
"You are not helping with your example when you abolish gender with how cute you are like that."
"I'm the mother of a transwoman and while I have no problem accepting her as a woman (I agree with the person who said that if you identify as a woman you're a woman, never mind your chromosomes) I have no idea how to help her beyond make-up and clothes. What are the resources available that I could share with my daughter?"
"I learn new things from each of your videos. Like, I’ve felt that the post gender tactic was just that- a tactic. But I’ve never had the right way to go about nailing it down. Thanks Contrapoint!"
"I like because of the cool costumes, plus the thought  of how much effort that goes into making them."
"I’ve been watching your videos for a few weeks, at the recommendation of my girlfriend (who is a trans woman and finds you to be a trans icon) and not only are they incredibly well put together and educational, but they’re hilarious as well. Thanks for videos like this, it’s really great to have videos like yours circulating. Even if I don’t understand what it’s like to go through transitioning, something both cis and trans women have in common is our ability to keep pushing through in the face of a society that dehumanises us. Having common misconceptions and wrongdoings pointed out and explained in regards to how harmful they are is really important in understanding each other and shaping society in a better way all while working together."

"Concern 2 and your answer to it really resonated with me, as I'm a woman who has never really 'fit' the feminine stereotype and I have sideyed the hyperfeminity of trans and cis women before because of it. It may sound stupid, but I suppose it can feel threatening at times, as if some sort of ideal I do not adhere to gets projected on me, or is expected. It's very valuable to see the side you presented, thanks for that!"
"Natalie, you are an absolute womanly snack. So 1950s femme <3"
"My only issue here is that most transmedicalist just believe you need some (at least minor) social/gender dysphoria to be trans. While some go overboard and say you need crippling body dysphoria to be transgender, those people are for the most part in the whole 'truscum' community. Maybe I just have a weird view though, since i'm a 'trans-neutralist'"
"I am 20 minutes into the video, where you talk about how trans people can experience a type of femmephobia before they transition and I can definitely relate to that. When I was younger I didn't know what trans was, I just felt like shit all the time and didn't know why lol and people treated me accordingly. I ran away when I was sixteen, lived with my best friend, and I learned about trans people when I met a girl named Natalie who worked at the same place my friend did who happened to be trans. And something clicked, and now I have tits 😁 also just realizing your name is also Natalie and that's kinda cool"
"red seems to suit you.. maybe just the red light <3"

"About concern 3... I don't think the idea of presenting as 'genderless' is so far fetched. As an enby, instead of dressing masc or fem, I just dress goth. Sometimes don a Canadian Tuxedo or loose, early aughts garb if I'm feeling spicy. I think masc & fem are just 2 of many style choices."
"I loved this. I’ve recently grown fascinated with a particular group of people: they call themselves detransistioned people, or desisters. They wave a banner of “gender criticism” because of mistaking themselves for trans people when they were really gender nonconformists. The problem is, they argue for a genderless utopia, and deliberately or accidentally (I can’t really tell) end up throwing actual trans people under the bus."

"excuse my beauty"
"This was incredibly insightful. I’m pretty high up on the IQ scale but I know when I am soundly outclassed. Your wisdom actually astounds me in a manner I have seen by maybe 4 people in all the news and media I consume. I’m a cis white male who didn’t think much about trans people’s lives and issues much at all. I have always been totally fine with trans people but never gave it much thought. You alone have made me cry several times, and I can only imagine how many orders of magnitude harder it is for people transitioning. I’m rambling but the point I am trying to get at is your intelligence is placed exactly where it should be I think. Few people land where they are supposed to be and they suffer for it, I think you’re doing precisely what you should be. And I know it’s a lot of responsibility to have put on you, to express this largely ignored trauma so many endure. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. But you wear it well."
"11:40 LAUGHS IN SHCHENGEN."

"The way these terfs talk about trans people on their reddit is incredibly similar to how the incels talked about women before it was closed, just irrational utter contempt and disgust nothing truly rational, if only they were capable of that kind of self reflection maybe they'd identify their hypocrisy and focus on more important issues than just ragging on a more vulnerable group, it's honestly mind boggling that they do that as someone new to this stuff"
"Can you do a video about your experiences in society as a man vs as a woman? Like, how you were treated by people before you started transitioning, after you just started transitioning, and now? I think it would be really interesting to hear what things you've noticed are different.   As a cis woman I've always wondered what it feels like to be a man. I've heard people say that being a man in society can be rather lonely. My female experience has been that strangers tend to be more comfortable talking to me, which can be nice or intrusive depending on the situation/my mood. I'm wondering if you have any insights from your experiences."

Please, can you talk about that? #YesAllGamers #Mouthfeel"

"The great thing about trans women is that you could have been men but you chose to be women with all the bullshit that comes with it because you know it’s fucking great to be a woman. And you are not afraid to live out your femininity in all its ‘pretty’ and ‘less pretty’ aspects, because you are not scared to be called sluts, or considered a naive virgin or not taken seriously for being too feminine or not being considered desirable for not being feminine enough. Because as former males you know all these misogynistic standards put on us are bullshit. You know all these rules about how women should behave to be considered worthy are just a trick to control us and that the moment you satisfy one you inevitably fail at the other. You also don’t have the need to constantly prove to men that you are intellectually as capable as them, because well, you were men. Terfs on the other hand view womanhood as a cage which was forced upon them and they hate it and they hate anyone voluntarily coming into the cage and celebrating it. They have internalised the doubts and hatred for their own gender from the oppressors. They only know how to fight the cage by screaming about their suffering or by trying to be like their oppressors. Since you have a better way of being a woman, one which inevitably rests on pursuing personal freedom, you crush their view of the world. I on the other hand appreciate very much your contribution to our gender. As a woman, you make me feel better about being in my gender. You destroy the feelings of frustration of being a woman - your freedom makes me feel free. So thank you. As for experiencing sexual trauma as a girl as a qualifier of being a woman, that is some serious bull. Growing up in a post-communist society I have never experienced trauma or discrimination as a child based on my gender, nor did I experience being afraid based on gender because our society was very safe in general. It was only when I came to live in the West as an adult that misogyny started being shoved down my throat. I don’t believe that makes me any less of a woman. Plus if someone has always considered themselves a woman I am pretty sure they have internalised the suffering of women around them at least to an extent, as their own."

My choice to actively avoid reproduction and childrearing does NOT make me less of a woman or less valuable than my actively fertile sisters (whether they reproduce as hosts or donors). To equate womanhood with having a womb is to reduce womanhood to wombhood."
"some people have DID or some other condition that causes multiple personalities, and the other personalities don’t always match the host body’s assigned sex or gender. my gf (who is trans) started out with 2 guy alters, 1 girl alter, and 1 that was kind of neither in addition to herself (and she wasn’t aware that she was trans then). now she has an additional girl alter and the non-girl alters from earlier in her life aren’t really there any more. so at one point in her life, there was a female soul trapped in a body assigned male at birth."

That's just relating to this video I have loved all the videos of yours that I've seen and I greatly appreciate that you continue to make them. I'm genuinely sorry that people are still so neanderthalic in their actions towards trans and non binary people. Please keep making videos thank you kindly ma'am."
"It's interesting how some persons are annoyed with terms like 'pregnant people' and 'menstruators' but have let 'men who have sex with men' become so commonplace that the medical profession has turned it into a TLA. The terms have use. They are instructive to medical practitioners, a fair amount of whom are quite clueless and went to medical school for the wrong reasons, for example; a parent's love, enhanced dating options, or that infamous Beemer. Anyway, the terms! They get to the heart of the issue. If I'm talking to an MSM about STIs, it's because I'm concerned about risk of STIs; sexually transmitted infections. Thus, bicurious men who do not have sex with men need not have this conversation. (at this level; everyone sexually active is at risk of STIs, kiddies) If I am talking to a woman (not a menstruator) about altering diet to increase iron intake during menstruation to allow the body to more effectively replace blood lost in the process, this conversation is not assistive to a trans woman or a post-menopausal cis woman. Use of the terminology reinforces this idea, and I have had some coworkers sorely needing this basic level of instruction. Be thankful for these terms, patients, they are present for your benefit.   Thanks for another great video, Ms. Wynn!"

"Your point starting at about 9:20 regarding femininity, womanhood, gender-non-conformity, and the question about why feminists don't leave comments on Kardashian pictures regarding enforcing gendered norms by dressing fancy finally clarified a prejudice I've been struggling with for a while. As you said, I was/am one of those non-gender-conforming-cis-women who kind of side-eye the High Femme aesthetic many trans women adopt.    I've struggled with this because having the 'freedom' and courage to craft my own gender expression rather than conforming to feminine expectations has been a major part of my process of maturing and defining myself as a woman in our society. My girlhood, and especially my adolescence, was in many ways defined by defying those stereotypes and defending my clothing choices and (lack of) make-up and hair styles, mostly against other women and girls, while still identifying as a straight, cis woman rather than a lesbian. I was repeatedly, falsely, clocked as a lesbian in high school and college, and even accused of having a beard boyfriend, which made me very angry on my own behalf and on behalf of actual lesbians. It also made me reluctant to come out as bi for fear I'd be 'confirming' everyone's 'suspicions' about how I wasn't 'really a woman', or not the right kind of woman, i.e. a straight woman.   So I found it a bit off-putting to see my gender seemingly distilled into very shallow signifiers like fancy hair, nails, and makeup, which have been used by the patriarchal society to dismiss women as being 'too frivolous' and 'too superficial' while simultaneously demanding that women dress well and put heavy emphasis on how our appearance defines, or is at least heavily influences, our worth as humans. (And also, I realized an embarrassingly few years ago that identifying expertise in fashion, make-up, and hair styling as 'shallow' pursuits, or indicating superficiality on the part of people who excel at these skills, is also a symptom of our cultural misogyny, dismissing these disciplines as somehow more venal or disposable than other art, because their main devotees are women and gay men.)  Your explanation of why many trans women choose High Femme looks to make it crystal-clear what gender they are presenting as makes perfect sense. But the Kardashian example really clarified that I'd been staring 'downstream' at people who were negatively affected by societal misogyny and transphobia, rather than looking 'upstream' at the cultural messages and gatekeeping used to keep women obsessed with presenting as 'proper' women, forcing all of us, cis, trans, straight, lesbian, bi, into uncomfortable roles that don't fit the people we really want to be. Thanks so much for this video."
"I'm not trans, homosexual, or a woman...but a heterosexual male who's married with a kid (gasp!). Your channel is awesome. I found you through the podcast 'Stuff They Don't Want You To Know' about Involuntary Celibacy, where they reference and recommend your Incel video...and I'm so very glad I looked for that video because....Have I already said you and your channel are awesome?

"After going down the Anti-SJW hole a few years back, ContraPoints videos are some of the only videos I can watch on this material without getting the knee-jerk reactions I used to have regarding these subjects."
"i know for me that the fear of men and the childhood lessons on how to survive  (ie: don't go to the bathroom alone, walk with my keys in my knuckles, always stay in lighted areas, don't go anywhere alone at night ect) reinforced my transphobia. now as shitty as those lessons are they're sadly probably needed, but it wasn't until my trans teacher explained why it was okay for her to use the bathroom that i really understood. Now i see the whole bathroom argument for what it is: hate and fear.  One reason it was hard for me to accept myself as non-binary was i felt like i was turning my back on women and their struggles, like i was leaving them. Even though being called a woman makes me cringe. It was meeting and making friends with other people on the trans spectrum that helped me be okay with myself and other trans people. I was never a TERF i was just uninformed and uneducated and raised by a conservative."
"I used to be conservative, raised uber Christian. While I’m still a Christian, I’m no longer conservative. It was after I realized that what I was believing wasn’t even conforming to what Jesus preached that I found your channel. And I LOVE your channel. I have learned soo much. Thank you!"

"This was really helpful. Thank you!"
"I'm a cis-female feminist whose periods are hella irregular, I even kinda have a mustache, I may as well have PCOS, but the doctors looked at my ovaries with ultrasound and said that they were 'totally fine' so I don't know what fuck-all is wrong with me or my Shitty Body. I sometimes feel like my organs are just rotting from the inside out??   But even then, I felt like I had an annoying little TERF voice inside my head, full of these irrational 'concerns'. I knew the TERF voice was wrong, like, of course trans women are women, but since I wasn't a trans woman myself, I wasn't sure how much trans women experienced former-male privilege, if they even experienced it at all. Hell, I didn't even know gender critical was like, a TERF thing. Tumblr tricked me into thinking it was a separate thing all together.   This video not only help me put my mind at ease- like, of course it's right to side with my trans sisters, but also I think you spilled the tea so hot onto the TERF-voice's lap, that she melted away like a wicked witch.  Thank you."

"Thank you for your channel and everything you discover us with us, I really feel like everything you say makes incredible points n wish everyone would get on board. Anyhow I used to believe I've been a woman trapped in a male body since I could  comprehend the subject t and it's never really left my thoughts but you made a really good point n helped me also understand it at the came time. I just really lo e your channel, your topics, how fuckin pretty n beautiful you are, and how insanely funny you are too, I'm rambling I just want to thank you for teaching me so much. You are truly a gift to this world Tha kyou for everything you do to make this world and existence bearable."
"I personally thought there were issues with the male privilege and socialisation section of the video."
"While it's a fact that the experience in childhood will be different, I don't agree with the conclusion that it then means male privilege was experienced but rather it's a conditional benefit. This is different in the sense that you're implicitly harming yourself by sacrificing something to experience the benefits, similar to how cis women who receive more respect for degrading other women."
"Young trans girls don't experience these things as boys but as closeted young trans girls, and while it's a different experience to cis women, it's reductive of how diverse gender experiences to then say 'if it's not the experience of cis women, then it must be a man's experience.'"
"As an introduction for cis people into the many issues of gender critical people, it works but if we were to get into it in further detail there are way too many factors and nuances that must be considered to effectively cover sufficient ground of different experiences of trans people."

"I can't thank you enough for finally making this video. You answered the questions I had at a time when I was really sitting on the fence on this issue. I've been waiting for you to talk about this for a long time. I feel like all I needed was for a trans woman to admit her previous male privilege...it just needs to be acknowledged, not constantly but just acknowledged. Besides that I could never bring my self to side with Terfs because of the hate that they direct towards transwomen. I don't think you are going to make many friends however in saying that you are a woman who used to be a man...I hate to say it but it makes more logical sense. Like you can wish you live in New York but can't call yourself a New Yorker until you actually MOVE to New York. Of course as you said feminine men are affected by femme phobia and masculine acting in the closet transwomen are also affeceted by femme phobia because they can't express themselfs so it's not the same as cis male privilege but it's still there in some form."

"My comment to this is: thank you, Natalie! You really help us cis guys who want to understand it how the binary model with which I was brought up is far too simplistic.   I remember as a teen I had certain curiosity regarding gay/queer experiences, but living in a small town there were no safe places for experimentation. I think we should have those. I'm old now, but I think my grandchildren should have a better environment. But abolishing gender? Maybe let everyone have freedom to live as they want (providing that they respect others' corresponding freedoms), and not try to force people into stereotypes."

"“People with Prostates” I love that soo much lol... can we be called PwPs?"
"Yes, another video with contrapoints! Oh and get wrecked TERFs!"
"I've wondered about a lot of these sorts of questions, especially the one about how transwomen usually seem to go for feminine stereotypes. But the idea that they have to basically shoot for the moon in the case they might be able to land among the stars makes sense. It is still a shame that is seemingly? the only way they feel they can actually be recognised as a woman. But perhaps we are not quite up to the point of gender being viewed simply as an expression as opposed to something mandatory yet. People need to get used to the idea (for lack of a better phrase) that gender and sex aren't so concretely linked before we can move past that altogether I think. Although, saying things like people with vaginas seems really awkward to say, but at the same time saying females (as in based on sex, not gender) is exclusive to transwomen or transmen? (I'm not sure which, maybe both?) Can anyone help me with this last part?"
"I like how that, despite each layer you took off towards 'genderless', you were still distinctly feminine. No makeup? Still a chick. No body language? Still female. Herp derpery? Yeah, that girl's being silly. :o"
"I don't want my acceptance of transgender people to equal to transwomen being fully welcomed and celebrated in female-only spaces. Or female-relatable discussions and topics. I feel like that is just something transwomen will have to accept, and not try to shimmy into. Sure, join in on the conversation of it, but please do not act like womanhood is something to be interpreted by someone who has never experienced the cultural, biological and social predicament that being born in a female body will bring. Womanhood is and will always be individual, but it is still of interpretation by people born into a female body who have not transitioned to a transman before womanhood, or a transwoman.  I didn't chose my position in society. Just like you didn't."
"Out of curiosity I went on the gender critical subreddit..... I want to Stab My Eyes Out. Wtf. The lowkey hate towards bi/queer people as well as trans people like ???? Y A L L WTF"
"god I started tearing up at the end; I was too young to watch Cops when it was popular.  Your videos are honestly so cathartic and just amazing in general.  Thank you so much for discussing all of these topics so thoroughly and so thoughtfully."
"i just wanna say to the terfs who are whining in the comments over reproduction and periods and the ultimate act of womanhood being giving birth I am a cis woman who has seriously considered getting a hysterectomy because bleeding and cramping every month fucking sucks, and i don't think i ever want kids and if i do have kids, i don't want to have them with my own body. i do not want to get pregnant ever"
"I think this lays bare a problem of 'feminism' that so many tried to point out, but were just written off as bigotts: that feminist rhetoric is often misused for man-hating. Of course it doesn't help that there are real bigotts also attacking feminism. But maybe with this phenomenenon in mind some might get around the idea that there really might be some bigotted man-hating women out there who just use feminist rhetoric to cover up and rationalize their chauvinistic man-hating. This is a crucial problem, because it drives millions of young men into the arms of the altright."
"ContraPoints is the of matriarch of the free internet and the reason I try to be a more outgoing and understanding person"
"How is 'I live as a woman' different to 'I am a man who lives as though I were a woman?'  Why can we not just accept that there are people born male and born female, and people born intersex, who to be themselves live as though they were the opposite sex or somewhere in between? When we label people as transman and transwoman I think what we are actually doing is saying that these people are only valid if they are perceived as members of the opposite sex.  This is stupid and wrong.  You're still valid if you're a boy who lives as a girl and vice versa. You're still valid if your identity and biology don't align.  Gender-critical stuff basically says 'a transman is not male and a transwoman is not female, and that's ok' Because from a gender-critical perspective you should be free to express yourself as you wish and not face prejudice because of that, regardless of your biology. A transman expands what it means to be female, and a transwoman expands what it means to be male. And what's wrong with that?   Ok time for the critiques. 1. Holocaust denial versus Gender critical. Saying that there are two sexes, is nothing like holocaust denial. Seriously. What the fuck was that?  2. Abolishing gender is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change. Yes it is. Hence radical feminism. But the comparison to 'abolish borders' is not equivalent. Borders have not always existed. X and Y chromosomes, people born in between the typical XX, XY, and people who identify as the other sex to the one they are, pretty much have existed for as long as human civilisation at least. Also then saying 'denying transpeople their gender identity is like denying citizenship because abolish borders' No sorry, it's not at all. The metaphor is too imprecise. First of all, who is denying anyone their identity? Again the problem comes back to whether or not the terms man and woman refer to biological sex, or gender identity. If they refer to biological sex, it's not about 'denying' anything because 'deny' implies there is something true or due which someone is denying. Male and Female are not the same thing.  If they refer to internal identity, then you can make the argument that someone is 'denying' that someone else identifies as man or woman.  Being female is a biological reality and so is being male. I don't understand why I should have to start saying that one is the other, which is untrue, just because it makes someone feel better to deny their biological reality. These are my thoughts. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't choose to treat someone as they want to be treated. Look at it this way, I don't believe in god because I see no evidence for it, and I don't believe that transwomen are femal or transmen are male for the same reason. That doesn't mean I want to go around abolishing religion or telling every catholic or buddhist I meet that their beliefs are hokum. I don't live inside other people's internal realities. But being told I have to include catholics in the same category as atheists is just as hilarious to me as having to say that male is female and vice versa.  Men can present as women and women as men and go about their lives in peace. But they can't, at current levels of tech, be the other. I hope someday they can!"
"This video is amazing! Thank you for making such great content! :D"
"I think u have a really good sense of humor, and ur channel is always entertaining. I respect ur honesty, and that u don't seem to have a cultish mentality, and I love ur hilarious sense of humor. In the effort of having a constructive dialogue where each may hopefully understand the other side better I feel that I should say some things to clear the air.    Often times questions are not meant to disparage trans ppl but, simply to wrap one's head around it. Then when trans act like any views different from their own, or any questions are evil, it shuts down healthy dialogue and creates unnecessary hostility leading to a toxic environment between trans and not trans. There is a difference in believing certain things, and being disparaging, or having malice towards someone. Just b/c one believes ur not a woman doesn't mean they believe ur an abomination, think ur any less valuable as a human being, any less of a beautiful soul, or even hold hostility towards u. A man is far more likely to view u as 'monster gender' than a woman is, unless she's had bad experiences w/ trans. One can view u as a feminine man, and still love the fk outta u, and appreciate u as a human being, and not see u as a freak. I think the tendency to label those w/ different views as hostile enemies (or terfs or transphobes) is a self-fulfilling prophecy that only burns bridges instead of uniting. I think b/c trans ppl have been bullied it makes them as a community overly sensitive, and mistake things as malice when they're really not intended that way. Likewise us 'terfs' may take something a certain way when they don't understand the intentions behind it which are also rooted in negative experiences. Both sides can project the trauma of their past experiences to one another, and that can cause conflict. I think ppl should be able to atd w/o being disrespectful or hateful towards one another, and realize despite all our differences that we are all one, and best profit in peace and love.    The terms TIMs and TIFs are actually supposed to be the LEAST hurtful terms as they are basically stating what both sides believe in a non-mocking fashioned. If someone was trying to be hurtful they would just say tranny, crossdresser, heshe, and ect. But really though, when trans ppl use the term TERF, is it really any better? Esp. when u nvr see anyone say things like 'punch all TIMs' 'kill all TIMs', and ect.    What you are saying about trans metaphorically claiming to have female brains, may be true for u, BUT alot of trans mean it quite literally, and will talk about studies, even though there haven't been very many studies on trans done before cross sex hormones, and although the gay male brain is more feminine the the hypothalamus and vice versa this wouldn't apply to a hetero male transwoman who called themselves a lesbians though. Also some transwoman do think that feminine clothes and being female are actually the same, like that 'it's MA'AM' guy, or Catlyn Jenner, Riley J Dennis, and those that identify as trans but don't want to get the surgery, and insist that their body's female b/c they identify as a woman. Ik u obv hate them and cringe just as much as we do b/c ur one of the good ones, not one of those superficial hivemind idiots, that...unfortunately there are alot of. While many trans will say they understand sex and gender are different things, many will conflate the two, calling lesbians transphobes (and it's not just Riley J Dennis) b/c we don't want to suck or fk d!cks (even though after the operation that might not a problem b/c they'd have a constructed vagina, some insist they're penises are a female part and they're female confusing sex and gender). I think this is very much a source of contention. It annoys me as a lesbian when they try to call us terfs for not fking them, and it also gives good trans ppl a bad name.     I think it's good that u aren't of the hivemind, and are open and honest w/ the fact u weren't raised as a girl, b/c it's open, and honest. 'Terfs' don't wish to compete in the oppression olympics, and I agree that it's stupid to make it a competition when all should try to empathize w/ one another. Often when one points out women are oppressed b/c of sex and not gender, and points out 'male privilege' it's in response to delusions of trans ppl thinking 'cis women's privilege' is a real thing that exist, that genuine safety concerns are excuses (and we wish to point out u only think they're excuses b/c u have not had the experiences we had), that TRA's at the women's march demanding they get the vulva's off everything, and start calling their vagina's 'front holes', and ect. is unreasonable, ect. Things like this seem very misogynist, and creates Terfs, as well as the fact that many  trans want women to march for them but not march for the women. Pointing out these things, how u were raised as a male, is also to drive home the point that u most likely don't understand the safety concerns as being real b/c boys and men don't have to look over their shoulder like girls and women do as a whole, and to be so dismissive that u so naively think that it's just an excuse to make trans ppl feel bad, when in fact, b/c of biology, it is  real concern. U see, even if u could guarantee every real trans person was peaceful (which LMAO they're far from peaceful), u'd still have natural men who are misogynist rapist taking advantage of the fact they can enter a woman's bathroom just by declaring themselves trans b/c of identity politics.  Women are protective of their spaces not bc they hate u, but b/c we learned thru experiences that we need to be. Even disagreeing w/ trans ppl can get women killed or beat, so to me this just emphasizes the fact they shouldn't be included in the space. Women can disagree w/ eachother, and still keep the peace, TIMs want any 'TERF' that disagrees w/ them dead, not for bullying, but just for having a different point of view.    Hilarious point on the abolishing gender thing. LOL Ofc uk 'abolishing gender'' does not mean ''pretending the human species doesn't have two sexes''... ''Abolishing gender'' means getting rid of gendered stereotypes, and becoming a freer society. The fact that males and females physically look a certain way or sound a certain way (high or low voiced) isn't really a stereotype or social construct. Often questions arise b/c many transwomen while dressing stereotypically feminine, don't seem to think like a woman, or as u put it, have the soul of a woman. For instance there are many TRA's that will get violent w/ lesbian women for not liking d!ck, or what have u, and they get loud and violent, or they'll go to Rose McGowan's book signing only to interrupt her rudely screaming about transwomen's oppression when she hasn't done $h!t to them, then that trans person will be found out as a rapist. This is when women will reach PEAK trans and become a terf. Alas not all trans are bad, but there's alot of trans ppl that seem to be misogynist and wanna take everything out on women, which is another reason why 'terfs' will call out male privilege and socialization. The contempt they have calling out imaginary 'cis women privilege' when they have had male privilege, even if not as much at their more masculine male counterparts, and coming up w/ words like terf to berade women just for not believing the same way....while many men don't just disbelieve in trans ideology but brutally kill and rape them, leaves many women resentful. I think if we all felt respected, there would be alot less of this war of worlds.    Gender abolitionist and transphobia aren't really the same thing, and to think it is is just oversensativity on ur part. The gender abolitionist  sees a gnc person and thinks 'cool u do u'. The transphobe wants to beat that gnc person up, or to force them into a stereotypical role. The gender abolitionist person thinks there should be more gnc ppl. However if u were to say to them 'this is what makes me a woman or man, these clothes, and these mannerisms' they wouldn't would disagree and say, 'gender roles are bs, I believe your biology is what makes u a man or woman.' Again, this point of view isn't b/c we hate u, or want u to not exist. We just don't agree on the definitions, u see womanhood and manhood as gender, as we see it as sex and consider this a term of biology. Disagreeing isn't a form of hate, or the same as agreeing w/ POS that bully u and want u dead. I understand that bulling for @$$holes and trauma has made u hyper sensitive but, in reality I want every good person to be treated w/ love and kindness. I don't want non-violent trans ppl to be hurt or killed.   I think if more trans ppl existed like u there would be ALOT less transphobia. There are many good trans ppl out there but, sadly alot of bad overly aggressive ironically misogynist ones give trans ppl a bad name. This is unfortunate.I hope one day ppl will put aside their petty differences, and be as one."
"Absolutely fucking BRILLIANT. Thank you for calling bigotry when you see bigotry. Transphobia IS a sad, solemn little creature that comes from the same fetid swamp as homophobia and racism. I applaud your honesty and your openness; it is truly rare to see anyone admit to their own prejudices and possible mistakes in public.

"I don't normally comment on your videos but I just wanted to say that you looked really pretty in the red outfit. I really like your hat."
"as a trans guy, i have no problem with uterus related medical treatments and supplies focusing on women, but it gets to a point that is just ridiculous and unnecessary. i remember when i got my first adult doctor and my insurance sent me this long ass letter about how 'you're a woman now, womanly woman with many woman life joys and troubles ahead of you'.  and then there was getting my hysterectomy, and the whole shitshow with that. including recovery where the biggest message board for people who had had a hysto and looking for information was extremely transphobic and refused to allow trans men on the cite. like, they used the argument that they didn't want people who had an elective hysto to be on there because it would make people who didn't want it feel bad. but then, they didn't really regulate cis women and their reasons for surgery. then they changed it to not wanting men invading a women's space, but didn't care about husbands being on there. like, look, this is not some huge apocalyptic invasion of the trannies. we got the same surgery, i'm having pain and want to talk to other people to see how everyone else recovered. there are trans men resources, of course, but it just seems so stupid to divide up sources so much when we can all learn from each other. (not to mention the disparity in numbers)"
"Thank you for validating my utopian pipe dream."
"I usually forget to comment, but this time I remembered, so, thank you, seriously, for making these videos."
"No venom thrown at the late Mary Daly?  I'm disappointed."
"This was Raw. As. Fuck. I think I've never seen you this angry in a video before. I love it. Keep em coming. (And ty for the shoutout to nb and gender nonconforming people)"
"17:23 same. Also your videos are well crafted and informative"
"Excellent!"
"BUT MUH VIDYA"
"Since i subbed your channel i got interested in just listening to what you have to say and forgot about my prejudices. I don't care about what i think about a subject that's not really close to me, so i love to hear an intelligent view on it. The only concern I have is many people i come across are not as strong minded as you are, and i'd like to raise the subject of people transitioning for weak reasons that make them to committ to sufferings, both physical and psychological. I keep bumping into trans people that are not really as articulate as you are and seem to dwelve in very dark corners. There are some people transitioning while being vulnerable and/or unable to even cope with this radical change that seems to hurt them more than it brings them. You are indeed a model and i think you're awesome, but some people transition for reasons that defy reason. Not all people are so gilfted as you are, and i know you try to keep awareness as high as you can, but what do you think of people that just end up making choices that are in the end too radical for what they can endure, since it is no joke and well enduring."
"I think this was a bad idea"
"Every time I watch one of your Videos I learn something new and I laugh, I love your unique take on all issues. Thanks for being you!"
"I'm a non-trans Black woman, which sets up all sorts of failures in the 'Is she feminine (enough)?' sweepstakes laid out by TERFs, as there's a racism element in beauty standards. I can't help but think about how Serena Williams and Michelle Obama are discussed. There's a handwaving of how they're women, and how I am a woman. If it were merely a matter of suffering, oppression and misogyny, I'd check all the boxes. There's an inability to satisfy enough of their requirements to meet their sharply-conditional qualifications of womanhood, as they shift the goalposts anyway. It wouldn't matter how much I self-adorn.   I can tell I'll be watching this one at least a couple more times.  Stay beautiful."
"Wow, this Germaine Greer person is *talented* - I haven't seen someone so good at expressing pure, visceral hate through writing since I read some of H.P. Lovecraft's more racist works (e.g. 'The Horror at Red Hook' or any other one where the unspeakably disgusting eldtrich abominations are foreign/non-white people)"
"so you mention the cotton ceiling /'genital preferences' discourse in passing and then frame women who care about this (because it's obvious homophobia) as bigots and like noted homophobe Anita Bryant"
"15:05 take a sip babes"
"I wonder, are disgust and bigotry always linked ?"
"Hey Natalie, I'm new to the channel and new to your work and I just want to say that you are awesome. This is the first one of your videos I have seen and I laughed, I learned, and you better believe I subbed. Keep up the great work, stay beautiful, and don't let anyone rain on your parade."
"Bless you for these precious outtakes 🤣"
"Finally someone goes to the heart of transphobia, my internal, and others external disgust masked as critical gender reasoning. Breaking down everything to oversimplified stereotypes, prescribing delusion, or attacking how we present to pass, or how we present once we pass. I've done this to myself for decades, mix confused feelings to prescription and tagging by both 'professionals' and the average person alike. First it was, 'stop calling yourself a boy, you're a girl,' to 'the sexual abuse you suffered is why you hide behind presenting masculine', 'you still like *insert non gender conforming thing or act* see! You're confused!'. These are just the more recent ones after came out as a trans man. Before it was 'why I have homosexual tendencies is because I was molested by a female', 'you can't be bisexual, only gay or striaght', 'don't have a *insert masculine thing* they'll think you're a dyke!'. And when I finally stopped dismissing all of the personal tells of being transgender I didn't tick every box. I loved pink and was a girly girl until puberty, I grew up liking both males and females, and I continue to like non gender comforming things. So now I'm getting clocked as a lesbian or a gay man, and my transphobia family is trying to refer to this as a phase I will one day grow out of."
"Its typical white American bullshit, isn't it? Bury someone else's legitimate concern with dumb what about isms. Like the all lives matter movement by American nazis. Black people asked politely to not get victimized by the police and the American justice system and shitty nazis got up and were like, 'uuuh some white people have it bad too. Do you hate them? You're selfish and you hate white people, racist!' But disguised it as a transhumanism thing of all people being important and were able to totally stop and deflect the actual real concerns of people. It's the same thing turfs are doing now, being cunty Americans."
"I’d heard of TERFs mainly from Natalie’s videos, but this one made me go and actually check out the gender critical subreddit just to see what really goes on in these circles. Reading through posts about her and other trans women made me super sad and sick to my stomach. I applaud you for being willing to try and debate this stuff, because you’re completely correct when you identify it as just bigotry. This is a great video as always but I almost wish I didn’t know about gender critical feminists because their entire existence is so upsetting on so many levels."
"Contra Points vs Jordan Peterson plz."
"Your antagonist character is so fantastic. I love the visual, the costume, the background, the accent, the hostile attitude and through her it really shows that you have done your homework. You have really gotten in touch with the 'other side' and understood their viewpoint, even going so far as showing them another way."
"Watch out for sinister but[t]s is the name of my ted talk about my scissor sister tribute album about contrapoints."
"Thanks for 'excuse my beauty'."
"As a cis woman, this was extremely informative. It's explained a lot to me and helped me have a clearer understanding about some of the questions I had. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk about these sorts of things, especially why many of the transwomen I've seen express themselves with more femininity. It had honestly bothered me as someone who's not necessarily butch but not very feminine either, but honestly, I can definitely see it making your lives easier to live in this society. I was taking it personally when, in reality, y'all just want to live with less discomfort, and that's something I can definitely understand. I feel less defensive about it now.  That's just one of the things I've become more clear about. Of course, I know you don't represent everyone, but as a representative for some opinions, I appreciate you."
"Around 19:00 is too condensed and dry. Also this is probably the part where this is not meant for men, but male privilege my brain does 404 error on that. I just don't have that content in my brain and I feel pretty intensely that I don't want that in any case."
"Omg the bloopers are phenomenal. Also in future videos please"
"Where do I sign up for your seminar class?"
"Natalie, it's 11 months since I first got into your videos, and I gotta say, they've helped me significantly be a more understanding person in regards to trans issues. Love your work."
"9:01 Can I use 'functionally a woman' ? Like, would that be insulting to a transwoman ?  Kinda like, I know chromosomes and such don't match, but functionally, for what we're doing, it's the exact same thing as if they'd always been a woman so it's really no big deal to say, 'yes she's woman, there's an asterisk but don't worry about it, it just does not matter'"
"God, that subreddit is depressing,"
"a video that should be watched by everyone"
"3:40 this is expert framing of your story, I love it"
"Thank you, Natalie! May your clarity and poise grace us for a thousand years<3"
"So I'm at 1:25 and despite watching all of your video I still am not 100% on board with the 'be the gender you want to be' idea but slowly getting there. I have to say that quote from that bitch however, that felt so mean spirited. Even though, you probably can feel that repulsed about somebody really, really not looking like a woman.   What a torture this must be during the transition. And the worst part is that these a probably the negative feedback that points out exactly what you need to do to sculpt a female appearance and mannerisms which will eventually get you acknowledge as a woman."
"'You guys do know about trans men, right?' Me, a trans male: ..."
"My girlfriend is being brigaded by TERFs (I prefer Feminist Appropriating Radical TransphobeS) for making the same Anita Bryant comparison/joke. Its been a week and her mental health is taking a toll. Natalie, do you have any advice on how to handle being targeted on social media or surviving harassment campaigns? It started when she was asserting that TW are in fact women."
"Stuck around for the credits. Beautiful."
"Make a video on transmeds in more detail! i’m a transmed, but would like to know the opposing view from someone who isn’t a huge mogai person"
"this guy gets more crazy every year"
"Near the end where you mention that internalized phobia fucking hurts. It's sad but at least there's some solace knowing it's not a unique experience. Stay pretty."
"This is raining mike drops"
"The funniest part of being a trans man who is open about trans is how many people assume I'm a trans woman who is passing badly. I had one guy who literally bear hugged me regularly not realise I wasn't a cis dude until I excitedly started talking about my voice FINALLY STARTING TO DROP LIKE 7 MONTHS IN FUCK. People are TERRIBLE at clocking gender and they never learn if they are right or wrong about who they clock in public, so they just assume they've found All the Transes when they've actually just decided to call a burly cis lady sir. Which happened to me, before I started transitioning. I DID have a girlhood, and it was full of people either assuming I was a boy or treating me as invisible. I was a wrestler body type who built more muscle than two thirds of the boys I knew, I was brick-shit-house and girls aren't that, so I didn't exist to people. Fuck people talking about cat-calling as a universal experience of girlhood, when actually it's more nuanced than that and you have young girls wondering what's wrong with them because they aren't targets for that like they're supposed to be."
"“In denying trans people their gender identity because “abolish gender” is kind of line denying immigrants citizenship because “abolish borders”” ty for that allusion!"
"As a gamer, I feel threatened :(  Excuse my beauty."
"I wish I could like this video 100 times. 1000 times!!! 100,000,000 times!"
"I guess in a sense I *am* a transmed but the description used is very radical and I don’t relate very much if at all to that description.  If my b sees this: hi Kit"
"Natalie, you are SO strong and amazing! Thank you for having the courage to make this video and for educating all us peasants who benefit from your easily digestible explanations. As a cis woman who's spent years learning/doing makeup, your high femme-ness is really impressive. Even more impressive is the vulnerability you show in your videos. I'm so thankful to be subscribed to your channel!! <3"
"Your new character is a demon! YES"
"I like your hat."
"00:37 LUDGZURIEURIERNZSE"
"These are disgusting, and the worst part is that TERFS have a quite a lot of support, specially in the UK, and people are afraid to call them out because they hide their bigotry behind femenism."
"#PC RUN A MAC"
"This notion that TERFs are a hate group and trans-inclusive Radical Feminists are not, doesn't sit well with me. Either they are all one big hate group, or the hate and aversion they have for trans people is as tolerant and 'nuanced' as the hate and aversion they have for men. Is 'aversion' or 'exclusion' hateful? That's the question... and if the answer is 'no' then why are people complaining about Wakanda? It's not trolling if everything is a double-standard. : )"
"I think trans critical radfems are just as valid as trans radfems. They both hate men, one group defines what men are one way, the other group defines men differently. I think people should do what they want, and stop demanding other people use the same words they use. I'm not trolling anyone. I think some of the criticisms of transgenderism are valid. That doesn't justify hate. I just think people should be allowed to raise questions about something they don't think makes sense, and it's not trans people's right not to be offended."
"What a fantastic video, thank you!"
"This was incredible!!!!! Love youuuuuuu!"
"They call you miss and ma'am because they're being polite and don't want to upset you when you're trying. You don't 'pass' in the sense that anybody really thinks you have a uterus."
"Pussy bleeder, that's what we should call it."
"would it be bad for me to compliment the size of your boobs?"
"Thanks for another great video Natalie! I gotta go google Anita Bryant now...."
"5:16 You don't have to tell me about sinister butts."
"What you fail to understand though is that radical feminism IS the dominant paradigm in society. The TERF vs. intersectional debate is about tweaking the edges and trifling about whether all men are evil or if extremely feminized men can be considered good after they've castrated themselves, but the entire modern establishment insofar as gender/feminist laws etc. are concerned has essentially been created by TERFs."

"This was really beautify made. You are always so informative and funny.  ❤"
"This old white cis dude has now watched all of your videos in order (slightly sad that this binge is over), loving all of it, feeling better educated and enlightened and such and then your 'inner TERF' pops up and my male brain slams on the emergency brake and is all, 'WHERE DEM TIDDIES COME FROM??'  Sigh.  (Edit: I wrote this before I watched the gag reel at the end - was amused to see that even Nathalie was all, 'Where the fuck did THESE come from?')"
"STEP ON ME MOTHER"
"It's such a trip being in the comments watching cis straight men in your audience experience intra-feminist discourse for the first time. On one hand, it's hilarious and adorable watching them either hurt themselves in confusion or try to mine the video for insights as self-appointed anthropologists. But on the other, I feel like all our dirty laundry is being let out, and I don't want the *liberals and centrists* to see cis feminism's TERF shitstains. I am fully ashamed to have them in the discourse. I have to guess that this must be how some of your trans audience felt when you talked about topics like hons and autogynephilia. It's exposing, and now I feel a little squicky about how insensitive I had been to that. I still think you are right to say all the things you've said.  And I'm all the more grateful that you're the one saying them, creating your content. You're so spot on and genuinely enlightening. Thanks again.   Also I'm living for the big titty goth gf look"
"Thank you so much for this video, you brought together clearly so many arguments I've thought that I haven't been able to put into words."
"drinking from the teapot is such a mood"
"not a terf but i gotta point out a strawman. 'abolish gender' doesn't mean 'stop doing makeup or wearing dresses', terfs are ok with anyone dressing however they want, they're concerned about labeling traits as masculine or feminine. in a terf utopia anyone could wear whatever dress or suit they want, but you couldn't classify any of those things as belonging to a 'gender'; those things would instead be seen as neutral and open for anyone to do without shame. i'm on your side and i'm afraid that the 'gender stereotypes' section of your video is too strawmanny to convince anyone who's not on our side"
"Lmao, I love it when you crack up at your own jokes. ❤"
"Please talk about trans trenders"
"i love you so much omg thank you for living your truth,( as a butchier girl) idk genders confusing ya feel, either way youre and icon and this butch girl supports the bold, the brave, the beautiful Natalie"
"I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to manplain free bleeding to my 1st generation Latinx lover who grew up in a very sheltered immigrant Catholic household."
"Idk why but that distorted “feel like a woman” intro got my goat."
"the aspie in me actually closed this as i'm a male, until my bf told me mi could actually watch it..."
"Hey, thank you for this. Most of your videos address right-wing arguments that I would never be susceptible to. This one, though, addressed some that, as a post-menopausal cis-feminist (so, a woman and not a 'menstruator'), I have thought and had questions about. Specifically, I've had the thought that if we didn't have such rigid gender roles and expectations, if girls and boys weren't told 'boys don't do that' or 'girls don't do that' growing up, if we didn't smack down 'feminine' men or 'masculine' women, would anybody feel like they needed to be a different sex than what they were assigned at birth? Does the existence of more and more openly trans people actually represent a failure of feminism, because of that?  I've never spent time in any of the hate-filled online spaces you describe, so I appreciate becoming aware of how this stuff is weaponized, and I really got something from your 'abolish borders' analogy. Also, I read about trans activists protesting 'The Vagina Monologues' because not all women have vaginas, and thought that was ridiculous. But it's been decades since I've been a 'campus activist,' and I suspect that story is an outlier, another something exaggerated and weaponized by the right. Anyway, I really like your addressing these ideas both seriously and  irreverently, in good 'balance.'  You go, girl!"
"Natalie...How do you come up with all the costumes and characters?"
"I support most of the ideas in this video, but holy strawman, Batman. What starts as a pretty compelling set of arguments devolves into name calling by the end. And the logic behind some of these gets flimsier, and obvious counterarguments are not addressed. Even if you don't like them, you have to give your opponents at least the thin veneer of respect, otherwise you're just preaching to the choir. I'm disappointed, Natalie."
"“Excuse my beauty.” Oh I stan Stephanie.  Also, as a a gay, the term MSM is used for men who have sex with men or men loving men because not all same sex contact is between gays - this includes bi guys, and “Str8” guys too. I think having different language for medical versus social is actually a good thing. Gives medical clarity but social ease of understanding."
"When she says radical feminists that think the only difference between men and women are sex differences and that gender is a patriarchal construct, does that mean when Jordan Peterson pretty much uses the same exact language he is actually referring to TERFs? I never picked up on that before because I thought that social constructionist theories of gender are actually asserting that and in my gender class the only way my professor said this might be trans exclusionary is that trans people might say they 'feel they were born in the wrong body,' which I agree is likely metaphorical or speech that might not necessarily be accurate but is accurate in expressing the feeling.  I'm confused because I always thought that social constructionist theories, especially ones that argue how women are defined by men, did seem a bit uncomfortable to me because of how they seem to speak about gender in a really rigid way. I chalked that up to how many of what I read was not written in the last 10 years. Lastly, I always thought that these theories we are talking about do have room for non-binary identities because it seems to me that if gender is a social construct surrounding the natural fact of differences between men and women, then, given that these differences can be overcome, the social differences can also be overcome. So am I confused? Sorry for long comment"
"I don;t know why but hearing you talk fills my heart with hope"
"Informative as always."
"Came for the pizza, stayed for the video. Well done lass err, human, err carbon based life form, err. Hmm.   In any case, I imagine is must be difficult to hear, much less see, another person's point of view with ones head firmly stuffed up ones arse. Let's all pull out, stand up, clean our head holes and listen, then think about what was said. And eat pizza and chips."

"Alrighty so I am a gender critical radfem ftm (talk about a mouthful lol) and you brought up some great points and I really respect that you used real arguments and not strawmen. There's honestly only two things I disagree with you on  1) femphobia against males, although yes rooted in misogyny, is actually still a 'man up' type of male socialisation  2) gender critical feminism isn't actually inheritly transphobic. It's just that a LOT of transphobic people misunderstand what gc feminism actually entails so they use it as a cover to 'justify' their transphobia  If you ever wanna talk or get an inside trans perspective on the radfem community feel free to message me! My Tumblr is @/spooky-rad-luka, Twitter is @/spooky_rad_boy and I'd love to have a conversation!"
"Sometimes I feel like feminism needs a rebrand due to the consistent failure of mainstream white cis feminism for trans women and women of colour, I feel sad to hear some of my friends don’t feel included by feminism. But then I feel like changing it is just giving in to what misogynists want (‘it should be called humanism!’ ring any bells?). What are people’s thoughts on this?"
"I liked, commented, and subscriiiibbed"
"So I made the horrible mistake of looking up these terrible people. OMFG are they horrible, and mean."
"I loved this video :) keep up the great work Natalie!"
"This video was so moving. I've seen those arguments online and been genuinely confused and concerned. Thank you for helping to destroy any BURGEONING icky terfness in my heart. I honestly felt so relieved by the end. Now I can send this video to anyone else I meet who says something concerning. Natalie you are a treasure."
"Even as a cis woman, gender and I have an interesting relationship. As a kid I was taught by my (polarizingly) feminist relatives that I could not like skirts, makeup, the color pink,or any other feminine thing. But as I grew older, I realized I did like those things. Makeup is fun to wear as long as I'm wearing it because I like to, pink is a great color, and... well, no, I still hate skirts. They're uncomfortable. But what that taught me was that everyone identifies with and expresses their gender in different ways, and there's nothing wrong with expressing it in traditionally/patriarchally approved ways. TDLR? Hearing TERFs say trans women are faking womanhood by dressing the way that they feel the most comfortable sounds a hell of a lot like my aunt telling me I'm prescribing to patriarchal values by wearing lip stick. And it's bullshit.   Edit: Oh, and before anyone says the 'you only wear makeup/cute clothes/etc for men' line, I'm a lesbian. I haven't done anything for the sake of a man's opinion in years."
"What fucks me up is that, as a crossdresser, I get used as a weapon against trans women."
"I don't experience it in the same way that trans people do, but that 'monster gender' thing really got me. All it took for me to be monster gender was having man-boobs(for lack of a better term.)  Don't get me wrong though, it still happens but not even remotely as often as it did in high school. I can't even imagine it being constant after high school."
"God dammit, you are so great. Thank you so much for being you and for giving the world your voice, and wit, erudition, and artistry. We are so much better off just with your existence. You’re the fucking best. And thank you."
"Aaaaahh I fucking love you"
"anyway... i love being a lesbian and i hate penises."
"I'm a cis male. Watching for the humor and the trans issue insight. (Jk I'm here just because I've got a shemale fetish. Oh yeah, drink that tea)"
"I honestly love this lmao, your inner radfem persona looks so cool   I'm a ftm radical feminist and honestly a lot of women come into the community just to hide behind it to justify their transphobia. I made a video about it and a ''''radfem''' woman found it and has been slandering me on Tumblr ever since lmao  Fuck transphobes"
"'You're not a womz u need to have been assaulted at a young age'   Damn I can't believe I've been a biological woman this whole time"
"The only channel I feel like applauding for after every video."
"God you’re brilliant thank you for making such excellent content"
"I remember watching all of your videos when you only had a few thousand subscribers. You were one of a handful of youtubers (still are, actually) who not only understood the nuances of social issues, but explained them exceptionally well. I've just come back to YT and I'm happy that you've gained the following and notoriety that I felt you deserved. And you've transitioned so gracefully. Well done, Natalie."
"'doxing forums'....  is this a secret kiwi farms mention?"
"Ok. Best part is the pronunciation of 'luxuriance'"
"Not into starting a whole debate, but it's interesting how TERFs comment on trans women in the same way misogynistic men and women with internalized misogyny comment on masculine presenting cis women."
"I don’t think I’ll ever truly understand trans people, but this video helped quite a bit."
"take a fuckin sip, babes."
"I enjoy your videos!"
"I have to wonder if these 'radical feminists' (who I consider neither) aren't just picking on transwomen because they present an easy target for all their latent misandry? The female existence is varied, painful and wonderful, what's the point of denying other women their voices. It seems ironically patriarchal to assign women limited spaces and groups in which they can express themselves.    The in-video comments about people hands were especially hurtful and hateful. Not all cis women/ girls are blessed with dainty extremities, some cis women have body hair issues, some wear large shoes. Feck off with that exclusionist bs."
"This was a great video essay. But I kept getting distracted by how freakin fly that hat is."
"I want to be your friend."
"There was a terf on reddit the other day who was really mean to some trans people who I later got into a long discussion about her religious beliefs, which kinda amusingly ended up with her calling me smart whilst in the same breath trying to convert me. I’ll send her a link to this video, see if it gets her thinking."
"Natalie has made a great video as always, but that genderless robot joke from 10:42 just seems...like she never thought that agender people exist; so it kinda striked to me as insensitive when I first watched it. 😕 But I'm sure that she means well, I hope so."
"Oh that ending gave me goosebumps! Yes! 'Excuse my beauty.' That's so powerful."
"Wow....those TERF subreddit comments were really brutal. I'm transfeminine non-binary and it cut deep into the exact fears I have. They're nothing but hateful trolls, but thank you for engaging this in such a nuanced way that I hope changes some of their minds. Love you <3"
"This video really rattles my chromosomes."
"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE put 'Excuse my Beauty, TERF' on a t-shirt!!!"
"Shid, I'll be back later, cant watch this"
"i needed this, thank you"
"A great video, loved the person voice reading the quotes and poem."
"'i notice your're not suggesting people start talking anout the mouthfeel'"
"Good for you.  I've had male roles for a while.  It's really difficult to be a female in a male field, not just in the army.  They will not listen to you, and they will try to wife you out of there.  They dominated the shit out of me, and I regressed to a childlike state of a fairy."
"The aesthetic in this video reminds me of a wes Anderson movie because of the symmetry ...also great video thank you for having a powerful mind 😏😉"
"Ugh I hate that those people call themselves feminists, this is so not what I'm fighting for!"
"cant wait until this channel becomes a mainstream youtube channel with millions of subs, considering how much it seems to win over fence sitters."
"I never heard of Germaine Greer before your video - afterwards I looked her up and watched an interview about her perspectives on transgender issues and although I mostly disagreed with her, I actually liked her! She dropped the f- bomb multiple times and was basically like, “I’m in my 70s, I will say whatever the f- I like, and if you don’t like it, f- you!!” 😂 I can support that.  And actually, although I am fully aware of how insensitive speech toward minority groups can be dangerous or become a slippery slope toward actual real life repercussions or violence toward these groups, generally I support the “right wing” position that the “snowflakes” need to toughen up and deal with the insults hurled their way. No one is doing him/her/them self a favor by shedding tears over what some dumbass has to say about him/her/them."
"What is the answer to 'why can't you just be a feminine man?' It may just be the order in which I was exposed to the ideas of erasing gender norms and trans identities, but as a dude who's never quite fit in with the guys and their norms, I just say that 'fuck yeah I wear a skirt sometimes; my legs are hot af, and I wear what I want.'"

"TERFs never got out of the 'cooties' mindset..."
"I love you Contra!!!"
"All I can say is that my male experience has been nothing but cold, uncaring apathy. Nobody cares about my life, my pain, or whether I even survive, unless I am somehow providing value to them and as soon as I don't, they cast me aside. The moment I threaten their world view, suggest men have institutional disadvantages, legal discrimination and suffer from all the nasty social hatred and assaults on our very being (something one would expect trans people to understand) that's been going on lately, I get attacked and have a witch hunt hate mob going after my livelihood...  Tell me all about my male privilege. No, males don't have privilege, they have thier own shit to deal with. The grass is greener syndrome I'll call it. You want men to stop hitting on you? Too bad. Make yourself hideous. We men don't get hit on and the ones that do, are not representative of the 90% of men. Unlike women, who get more attention than an equally attractive man could ever dream of. Hell, even mildly above average women get more attention than a top tier man.   You wanna transition? Okay, make an effort and don't freak out when you're misgendered. Show the normies you aren't a threat and they'll at least leave you alone. You won't have that problem from me at least. I have sympathy for you."
"Just jumped into a Germaine Greer rabbit hole hours ago and consequently, have yet to finish this video. What an enigma this 'figure of feminism' is."
"32:54 'It's PC run AMACK' omg I can't even"
"I couldn't love you anymore if I tried."
"I think one of the main problems in society is the 'fear' of having to accept more gender orientations of people and/or that their own gender is somehow under threat? This is common in other issues too, such as racism. We seem to fear what we don't understand and this is a good thing to work at to build bridges with others who are different to what mainstream society calls 'normal'. (wow, it's a minefield of feeling like having to be careful what to say, but I'm no expert and please forgive me if I come across in an inappropriate way, I am a fair, nice person.. sort of hehe).  I hope that the future continues to make more room for people of different sexual orientations / genders/ whatever we can call it :) But it is something that we should embrace and respect. Cutting through controversy, let's see how society has been told to respect diversity amongst people with mental illnesses, or disabilities; Individuals would be chased out of town for trolling a disabled person, or someone who is 'different' tends to get called 'weird' and is isolated from the 'popular group'. It's not to say that gender orientation is a disability, but what I mean is we should be more educated and accepting of people who identify as a certain gender, because they are people!!! People who have just the same goals of enjoyment in life as everyone else.  ughh, if only the world was a nicer place eh? heh. It's nice to see people on the internet trying to forge a way forward into the future of society and you are giving a platform for others in leading by example, and with some intelligent humour too :)  All the best."
"Another beautifully crafted, gorgeous, thoughtful video. As a cis woman I know I have pondered some of these questions myself though I have never considered transwomen to be 'not real women.' Your nuance mattered to me and to my understanding. It angers me that there are women out there who would be so cruel to other women the way TERFs are, and armed with this new information, I can more properly defend transmen and women who need defending from such cruelty. Thank you for continuing to dedicate your time to educating people."
"From Sylvia Plath’s excerpt on what she covets about men, it seems that too is kind of rooted in a level of ignorance about the male experience. If you’re a dude, walking by yourself on an ominous street at night, you’re scared."
"love the video, content is excellent. however I feel the structure of the 'lets watch an instructional video' does'nt make sense as the host and the terf  characters are already there, it isnt really introducing us to a new thing"
"So all of the physical, social, and emotional experiences of being a born and raised a woman aren't inextricably linked to actually being a woman? I really don't want to be cruel, but I find it hard to get around this and don't think you successfully addressed it."
"Ummm the Jewish question!? I'm 22 minutes into the video and seriously that comment is lingering in my mind."
"The 'Abolish Gender' thing reminds me of the folks who responded to legalizing same sex marriage by saying 'the state needs to get out of the marriage business.'  Like I guess in an abstract theoretical void, you might have a interesting point, but in the real world HMMMMM you picked an interesting time to criticize people for not radically remaking societal norms."
"Just thought I would mention that transmedicalists do not think dysphoria is hating yourself or your body and we don't think that you need crippling dysphoria to be trans. We just think you need to experience some form of dysphoria in any amount in order to realise that you are trans, otherwise there is no difference between trans people and cis people."
"the teapot bit was so cute + sincere; thank you for leaving that in omg <3"
"Dear Natalie, thank you for making me a better person after every single video. With this one was not different. I would have also loved to know what you think about other issues that radical feminist researchers work with, topics like compulsory heterosexuality, for example. I totally agree that terfs are transphobic and transphobia is disgusting, of course. I am not implying anything other than that. But there were some contributions that radfems (and here I am talking about serious researchers, not the internet haters) made that were relevant on some extent, within the feminist debate. Thank you and kisses from Brazil (I am the creep in instagram who is always asking you to come and save us)!"
"Unrelated  and doesn't impact your very good argument at all, but Natalie with no makeup/hair not done/no nails is so pretty???? like... she's adorable i cry??? she looks so soft n femme."
"I love you so much. Crying as I watch this, 6 mins in. I need these answers!"
"I love the 'Yellow Wallpaper' vibe the title cards give off"
"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS QUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN"
"I'm happy to let everyone be whoever they are. The barrage of labels I'm unfamilar with is intimidating and tiresome. I don't like labels; shortcuts to not getting to know someone. I find high-fiving, and male posturing fucking annoying. Do any of these thoughts qualify for me to not be sneared at?"
"TERFs seem like Islamophobes who use feminism as an excuse to exclude Muslims. Except one difference: TERFs like Germaine Greer are otherwise legit feminists, not just using it as a club."
"As a cis woman l feel like feminists feel sometimes that trans woman take their radical space, and that's why they are afraid of the queer community sometimes. the queer community can sometimes be very unaccepting to cis woman, which makes cis woman feel like they don't belong to a place, and then they try to exclude the trans woman from womanhood as a self-protection mechanism, imo. l just want to have a place where intersectionality exists for good, and queer or cis people don't exclude each other from  alternative places. l guess cis people just feel like the spotlight is taken away from them in a way. This does not justify any hate towards anyone. How we can get through this is simple discussion and keeping our discourse like Natalie !! If we are in an ongoing empathy and conversation, we will ** have a togetherness"
"First let me say that I love, love, love all your work. My girlfriend and I await your new videos eagerly every month and I put them on at night to fall asleep to often. Thank you for being a literal genius. That being said, I was a little let down with this one and wanted to provide some feedback. In other videos where you break down bad ideas (I'm thinking Jordan Peterson) you engage with those ideas sincerely while poking a little lighthearted fun at those who embrace them, and I love that. Here though I felt you started out claiming to engage TERFy ideas in good faith but that quickly that no longer seems true. Like, yes the way that TERFs say 'abolish gender' when really TERFs mean 'abolish trans people' is whack, but lampooning the idea of abolishing gender as hard as you do takes attention away from the gravity of what they really mean (abolish trans people) and, as you later say, is more likely to provoke infighting between cis and trans folks at a time where we need to stand together. This is just one example; I'm not as good as arguing as you (few are) so I won't go on for too long. And also maybe I'm misunderstanding what you were trying to do here. But look: I too believe TERFs deserve a good dragging and I hope you had fun doing so. If you wanna really argue in good faith while poking fun, do that, or if you wanna totally skewer folks within an inch of their lives, do that, but be honest. I know you're good at both so I trust you will."
"Rewatching this to memorize the points like there's gonna be a test."
"This video is both informative and hilarious. Brava!"
"About the 'abolish gender' thing:  I personally believe in it, and as far as I'm concerned, I do not discriminate against transsexuals or harass them (and yes, I am not the one to judge about that obviously). But to me it's more about not seeing gender as this binary 'truth', but just realise it's a constructed system designed to categorise people. And categorisation of people is always the very beginning of opression, as is identity in general. Which is why I don't care what gender I am, even though I don't think anyone will ever assume I'm anything but cis-male. But I don't want that gender assigned to me, I don't want the boundaries of what is considered male, what is considered female, cis, trans, straight, queer, bi - I just want to be me. And *that's* what I believe in when I say 'abolish gender': That nobody should have a role assigned to them at birth, that nobody should have to even pick one of the roles, but for everyone to be able to do anything that is not harmful without having to conform to some 'role' or 'identity'."

"I love you and your channel so much. I struggled forever with my own gender identity and it made me bitter about a lot of things. To me, for a time, men transitioning to women was essentially black face. I hated being a woman, I hated  feeling like less than a man, I felt that I was too unattractive and unwilling to conform to gender norms to be loved by a man but was still cat called and harassed and abused because (from what I could tell) 'any hole's a hole'. I wasn't comfortable with my attraction to women and being sexually assaulted by them only drove my insecurities home harder. I wanted to have been born a man and I dressed as one and used male pronouns but felt I would never be satisfied with that because, to me, it would never be real. When I saw strong, beautiful trans women being strong, beautiful trans women in my youth... well I was pretty pissed. Here were these men, so happy to be what I hated being and doing it better than I could. To me, they were the privileged men who abused me changing into the prettier, more confident women that abused me but without ever having to experience any of the struggles that I had gone through to get there. I didn't hate them, I didn't want them to stop doing what made them happy, but there was bitter indifference, confusion, and no small amount of jealousy.   It took a long time for me to look inside myself and identify where my own trauma and self loathing was making me into an angry person. I also had to properly educate myself.   'Hard work, but work that must be done.'"
"You still haven't really addressed why you feel like a woman. It sounds to me that you're just a feminine male who feels so weird about it that you'd rather be seen as a woman...which says something shit about our society that we think feminine males are gay or trans or there's something wrong with them. That said, no one has to accept you as trans. You made the choice to transition."
"ur daily reminder that terfs are misogynists who literally cannot define womanhood without excluding some subset of women 🐸☕️"
"I just want to put it out there that I think you seem even more feminine in the white robe without makeup and clothing pageantry; evidence that identity comes from within, not from what you put on.   P.S. Love your videos! I enjoy how you deep dive into social and gender issues from a different and unique perspective, and how you make it accessible to people who would otherwise never get the opportunity to hear it. Cheers."

"Love you and i love that native am.she so awesome"
"I've been watching you since your Jordan Peterson video was recommended by Dear Coquette! You are hysterical, insightful, and I hope you never stop creating content."
"I always thought transmedical was moreso that you need some kind of dysphoria to be trans, be it mild or intense, social or body."
"I have gotten desensitized to most bigoted idealogy. Just when I think I can watch a political/sociological video calmly and analyse the points with a clear head, I get introduced to TERFs. Had to pause the video a few times so I could finish fuming. You would think that people who deal with discrimination and oppression would have some empathy but no it's all about bashing someone so you can feel better about yourself. CIS women who have gone through some trauma at the hands of some CIS men and therefore dislike trans women seems so sad. Solidarity folks!"
"15:04 omfg. Also, your eye look reminds me of Emily Blunt :)"
"You conveniently left out one of the main concerns which is men using the trans movement and the laws being pushed as an excuse to creep on women and girls especially in bathrooms and locker rooms. “But those are men not trans women!“ Maybe some of them are. But some of them actually do identify as trans women"

"Im not even a trans woman and the last few minutes of this vid were so inspiring"

"I hate terf's reproductive arguments so much. My mom (a cis woman) was never able to get pregnant and have children. To some terfs, that disqualifies her as a woman. It pretty much proves that terfs don't actually care about the ability to make a child, but about shitting on trans women in any way possible."
"Each video is more visually impressive and well designed than the last. Natalie’s one of the few awesome people who makes me proud to be trans"
"Wonderful video, as always. But I keep hearing stories about trans woman pushing themselves onto lesbians and even mocking lesbians for not wanting to have sex with them. Is this a thing? Because it seems like a major problem that should be discussed."
"Girl I'm living for this look"
"yeah, as long as you let these people control the game they'll always try their hardest to make you the lowest pieces. same with conservatives, same with whatever else, any extremist. you know what their goals are when you see their statements, they simply want to bend the way its presented to help dull the reality of the outcomes and origins of the way they talk and debate."

"This is SO, SO helpful. Seriously, thank you for taking the time to break this down. Some of the questions that were posed here were questions I had too because I’m only just now learning about Trans issues. What I found out is if you start looking for answers to these “concerns” on the internet many of the answers you find are written by TERF’s trying to push their perspective. So it’s really easy for people who are confused or poorly educated to get sucked into the “gender critical” spaces like that subreddit.  Anyway, this video essay really helped me understand the problem with TERF/Gender Critical arguments. Thank you again, you have one of the best channels on YouTube."
"I'm fascinated that your comment sections as ideologically-colorful as your videos are powerful. Fucking love what you're doing to this community!"
"I hereby declare your beauty completely and thoroughly excused. #TheCincinnatiQuestion #Mouthfeel"
"Thank you for this. As a cis woman I’ve often thought about the arguments put forward by radfems and have come up with some of the same responses you have. I think the nuance is important to voice whilst also admitting what the core is rotten. There are good yet nuanced arguments against radfems, thank you for making some of them in this form. Solidarity sister ✊🏻"
"I just think that my position as a cis-girl, or for a matter, anyone being born in a 'female body' is an inevitable situation."

"I know trans people must face difficulties, definitely. Things I will never understand. Especially the people who face gender dysphoria."

"I don't believe TERFs think you need to go through pain and suffering to be a 'real woman', just that in this system it is pretty much something unstoppable as someone with a female body to NOT go through pain and suffering."
"Me, personally, have not faced direct misogyny nor discrimination. But I've been on its sidelines, and it is a norm. Which is sickening enough for me."
"They are indirect comments about me as a female, about my body and my social situation."

"I've despised TERFs, but they have a lot of topics of discussion that make sense? And no, I do not mean TERFs that call people 'it' or are all about this: 'I can tell if someone is cis or not.' They are inhumane and behaving disgustingly. But a lot of those we call TERFs have valid and actually thoughtful things to say about the predicament that these XX chromosomes will bring to the baby, the teen, the adult, and the elder.  I hope you know what I mean."
"Kind of an irrelevant comment but you look very pretty in red"
"One of my coworkers saw me watching you and commented 'That looks like Winona Rider with nice tits.' There is your strange compliment of the day. Also very well thought out, funny and interesting video!"
"I seriously look forward to your videos whenever you post, Natalie. You're an absolute babe inside and out, and there is no one else doing the work you're doing here in a more informative or entertaining way. It doesn't hurt that your outfits are so beautifully designed and perfectly incorporated <3"

"Oh my god you have no idea of what being  a radical is"
"No cat girl; downvoted."
"I am just here to publicly say that i am attracted to Contrapoints"
"This video was especially eye opening for me, as a person who has identified with feminism since childhood I’ve struggled to reconcile the Talkingpoints of terfs with my own instinctive humanism. To truly spell it out like this, trans-exclusion is based on disgust, makes it much easier to disregard those arguments, and see them for what they are, a demagogic tool to disempower a population that provokes disgusts in those wounded people. This work was revelatory. Much appreciated, and I will share your great work, Natalie!"
"The music choice in this and some of your other videos always makes me so nostalgic for the cartoon Billy and Mandy. It’s not old enough to be a classic, nor was it very good on the rewatch...still, love the music! And also of course the video"

Also I'm a graphic design student and honestly, every shot you make is just perfect, each could be used as a source for a really good pallette... That's also the reason why I like your lipstick so much, because I wouldn't have thought before something this light would go well with a dress that brightly colored but it's just made for it. You inspire me not only intellectually but makes me a better artist/designer :). <3"
"What is a woman or a man, really? What are we identifying as? That’s the only thing that I don’t understand. It has nothing to do with privilege to me. I don’t mind trans rights or seeing them thrive , but I don’t see how changing anything about yourself makes you different from what you are born as. You can live through life however you want, it doesn’t change anything. I can see someone is trans and still use the proper pronouns because I don’t want to fuck up their day for no reason. No matter what though, they’ll also be that sex to me. They’re not the same as cis people and I think that’s okay. I get that we aren’t socially far enough for people to just be who you want. I think it’s because I was really masculine as a kid and the only thing that made sense was just that I was born that way. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t into anything “ feminine “ because I’m a female.  I really hate being on the wrong side of history, but no matter what I try, I just can’t get it. It’s not for me to get though I guess. It’s just about what makes others FEEL better . It’s not about what’s real or what makes sense I guess. Everything that you said about terfs are real though. I find myself constantly having to defend trans people with my family even when I don’t believe that gender and sex will ever be the same when switched. I keep trying to solve my cognitive dissonance but I’ve been failing so far on that point and only that point. Some people are absolutely insane when they’re talking about trans people though so it’s hard to be in the other side when the people are so ignorant and cruel."

"I appreciate a lot that was said in this video, my only concern is anyone who is critical of gender conventions will be lumped in with TERFs. I think it's being skeptical of gender norms is healthy and the idea of living in a more 'genderless' society is to me not about living in a world that is robotic and dehumanizing. There is nothing dehumanizing about the androgyny of Prince, Davide Bowie, and Grace Jones. I'm not saying that all trans people should be androgynous, trans people should be treated the same way cis people are with their identity and gender expression.  However, I don't want to get to point where the validity of trans people is being judged by how well they assimilate to mainstream cis beliefs on what makes someone a woman or make someone a man."
"I myself lean towards the mixed brains and bodies argument. I find it easier to convince my coworker's to show a little bit of tolerance  (so so little). I don't go for the more nuanced arguments because I know they're never going to do the hard work of thinking about it."

"Your point about gendered oppression is pretty lame considering that the feminist argument is, as I understand it, not “women are oppressed, but trans women aren’t” but rather, “trans women have not experienced the oppression that, in the social sense, makes a woman a woman.”  Edit: Oh shit, you got me on the very next point, holy shit lol I’m a terf whoops 😂"
"I enjoyed your video yesterday, but I just want to thank you for spending the time to rationally debunk emotional arguments. While it sucks that it's necessary to avoid dismissal, I genuinely appreciate being informed like this. I have trouble grasping feelings that should be obvious, and explaining things makes it easier.

"I want to start by saying I think comments like Greer's are disgusting, as is weaponized deadnaming, calling people 'it' and 'TIMS' etc. Yet I think you generalise simplistically from these kind of insults to infer that all people with some reservations about the philosophical basis of a statement like 'trans women are women' must be doing so from a place of hatred and revulsion, or endorse these kind of tactics.. I hope you can see the humour in me saying #notallterfs - but in fact there are plenty of people out there that will disagree with your ontology and *some* of its legal implications but actually still want you to live a good and happy life, overall feeling safe. Ultimately I think there really was a missed opportunity for dialogue here - like some of the TERFs you criticise you've fallen into the trap of seeing the most vile of those who disagree with you as representative of the whole."

"quote of the video :  The National Mall is not going to bleed on it'self.  Gold."
"It is disappointing and falacious (the classical ad hominem) how you start the video by insinuating that radical feminists have been 'traumatised' by men and that is why they hold their 'flawed' views. Quite the same argument as those who say trans people are so because they were molested as children. There is a biological and surely physiological explanation to transgender experiences, unless you believe in some supernatural impetus, and this is why negating their reality is not only inconsiderate (and even dangerous, I do not intend to frivolize), but also factually incorrect. That being said, the trans discourse many times presents the traditional genders roles as the elements that define the person's identity, thus validating these traditional gender roles. No, make-up, being soft spoken and wanting to shop in the women's section does not make you a woman. Surely the feeling is more profund and must have something to do with the structure of the brain, and the person does feel like a woman, but the rethoric around often reinforces and validates traditional gender roles and stereotypes- which, yes, are a contingent and very harmful patriarchal creation. Also, it is blunt disrespect- and also untruthful- to minimize the actual biological experience of being a woman, with all that entails and that you have never experienced in the same fashion. Sometimes what I hear is people used to live with all the entitlement that being male grants in our society, wanting to lecture those who have only and absolutely experienced being female on how to be female. You win the 'feminity' contest, though: I do not need femininity because I am female, I have nothing to prove nor I need to justify that fact. And probably neither do you! I do recognize that transgender women do feel as women and deserve respect. Just show respect yourself to women who may point out  that there are realities you may not share or understand. This is like the debate about transgender women competing in professional, high-level female sports: sure, after male puberty you are going to have an enormous advantage and push many fellow athletes aside, so much for sorority. For fun or on a different scale we can all play,  that should be a given, but in that case people's careers are at stake, for instance. 'Man hating', such extraordinary language. You may start calling cis-women feminazis along those lines. The excerpt you showed at the beginning was very hostile and insensitive (and deserves criticism), but to have you low-key saying that people who are critical of genderism- and who vindicate the trascendence and importance of their physical reality- do so because they were molested is also quite problematic."
"This may have been my favorite Contrapoints video so far, at least 10 or 15 times I had to pause and rewind and laugh over and over at a funny joke, and just as many times rewound to soak in the glory of Natalie's intelligent discourse. My life has been improved a million times more with her in it.    As to the actual discussion, I had never actually heard of TERFs before Natalie's videos introduced me a while ago but as a cis female feminist it always riles me up that there are women out there giving the title a bad name by disguising their transphobia as feminism. I don't associate with that, I don't relate to that, trans women experience the world the same way cis women do, and isn't the whole crux of feminism your experiences? Feminism is supposed to be about men and women being equal, and trans men and women are included in that as well as gender fluid, non binary, and others within our gender/sexuality spectrum. The whole point is supposed to be EQUALITY, by definition TERFs aren't feminists, they're cisgendered female superiority activists. I already had this discussion when it came to just simply men vs women in that usually the argument is that radical feminists see themselves as superior to men and that's something I've seen before and it's bad enough, but to also say you're better than trans men and women just makes you like a white nationalist but for cisgendered women."

"I was finally able to watch this. This was awesome! Really well thought out and beautiful as always 💜"
"I'm just gonna refer to terfs as she-incels from now on, 1) because they're the same breed of beta human scum that thrives on internet hatespeech 2) it'll piss them off"
"Thank you for this video. I needed this, I actually need more too. I had a hard childhood (not compared to other people of course) in a nuclear family as the only girl with an older baby boomer mother and father who pushed me into bows and stockings and 'womanly' duties from a very young age and I have a lot of anger. A lot. Directed at people who say 'what a woman should be'. I wasnt allowed outside of that girl sphere. Everything was expected of me. Everything I did wrong 'isnt what ladies do' Sometimes I feel like I was pushed so much into the oppressive parts of femininity that I don't understand why anyone would want to take it on. I feel angry when someone else doesnt understand MY oppression. That im 33 and still suffer with unpacking my bullshit. But I know that's my own self-centered view, because I'm hurt by how my parents limited me, I feel like I didn't fight back enough. I feel like I was weak, I am still weak. I feel like femininity failed me, but it is the only tool I have. Resentment mixed with confusion. My mother was a 'Perfect Wife' As an adult, the only skills I was taught was cooking from scratch, separating laundry, wrapping Christmas presents, throwing a dinner party, gardening, dressing up, how to shop for sales, how to sleep in curlers (thats right), how to make a bed and table (a big one with my mother). Don't get me started on their white-bubbles (read: RACISM). The last couple years I have felt like some trans women didnt understand my childhood oppression although as a *die-hard feminist* I would never say that to any of my lgbt friends because I consider myself a LGBT ally. I've always supported trans people because even if I didnt always understand every single detail of the trans experience, I knew it was my responsibility to educate myself and open myself to trusting trans women on my own. I went to college, I have my little English degree, I took Feminism 101. Because I knew I was being self-centered I was afraid to ask questions, I never want to seem homophobic, because I am a big supporter in my community of lgbt rights. Anyway, your video helped me unpack. I want you to know that I love you, and that you have helped me do that, and I am going to try to keep fixing myself and helping to make the world a safer place for me, you, and all women."
"I have to say: YASSS LOVE SHANIA, yes girlhood is tragic (that really resonates with me), and I LOVE YOU and thank you for making these videos."
"I dont understand this at all...If i dont realy belive in gender why should someones gender-identety bother my as long as they dont harm themself when trying 2 achive that identy? Its like if a ateiest would  say that there are no christians..."
"This is an excellent vid! I never would have been brave enough to ask for it, but I love it. Have watched it 3 times already. It clarifies so much. You are so honest and clear. Thank you!"
"4:51 'Hanukkah-tastrophy.'  No, no, please, my sides..."
"I've not spent a lot of time thinking about or caring about trans issues before but now that I've found your videos I appreciate and value your perspective. Your thoughtful, thorough, and nuanced arguments have caused me to examine my own reactions and beliefs about trans people, gender and many other topics you bring up. Thank you for the effort and thought you put into these. It has made a difference for me. Much respect"
"Humans are not always born with either XX or XY chromosomes. Humans aren't always born with a penis or vagina. Sex and gender aren't binary.  Many people are born with only XX or XY sex chromosomes. Others have XXY, XYY, XXX, XXXY and many, many other variations. The idea that all humans are born with one of two genders dictated by their sex chromosomes is absurd, and anyone who pushes that idea has no grasp on the science they are attempting to wield as evidence.  Welcome to the world of intersex people. In the past, people have called them 'hermaphrodites', but they don't like it, and it's inaccurate for a lot of them. The term hermaphrodite is a compound of Hermès and Aphrodite, one male and one female god, meaning intersex people are half male and half female, and like I said, that isn't accurate.   In the past, doctors who delivered babies with 'ambiguous genitalia' would make snap decisions immediately following birth - without consulting the parents - handing babies off to surgeons who just visually examined them and decided which genital qualities looked most prominent, and altered the genitals to look more 'normal'. Then they gave the babies back.  They were wrong. A lot. So when these babies grew up, they'd often be left with genitals they don't identify with, or dysfunctional genitals, or a host of other issues.   Today, because intersex people have campaigned for their rights, doctors no longer perform surgery on babies with ambiguous genitals, unless there's a functional issue. Like, the baby can't urinate or something.  Adults who underwent sex assignment surgery at birth have expressed the trauma they had to experience, and because our society is making progress, many intersex kids today don't identify with a 'traditional' gender. They also don't feel pressured into surgery and more and more people are rejecting the binary idea of gender, and feel like their gender identity exists outside M or F.  And just as intersex people are born without a fixed male or female gender based upon their physical biology, the idea that others are born with their identities in conflict with their non-ambiguous physical biology is obviously valid as well.   There are more than two genders, physical biology cannot dictate psychological identity, and anyone who disagrees with that is either grossly misinformed or is intentionally spreading disinformation to achieve an ulterior motive.  The facts are directly at odds with all the arguments these bigots make. Which is amusing, given that one of the most vocal advocates of the disproven binary birth genders based on sex chromosomes is infamous for his incessant assertion that 'facts don't care about your feelings'.   Well, facts have demolished that entirely false opinion concerning gender and identity. And I don't care how you feel about that either."
"hue hue hue... sinister butt~"
"The asmr is strong with this one. Also, the male upbringing/male privlege argument is a valid one and your nuanced opinions are appreciated. I think that trans women are used to having more  privlege because most trans women are raised male. When these women lose that privlege by transitioning I think it hits home a lot harder."
"take a fuckin sip, babes"
"My God Natalie! Are you feeling alright? You were wearing downright sensible headwear for almost all of this video and only had one costume change..."
"Thanks for informing those of us who have no experience or education in this realm.  Like all good little liberals, I make a concerted effort not to offend, misgender or ask inappropriate or uncomfortable questions of anyone. This, of course, hamstrings the effort at coming to any real understanding of the world seen from eyes other than my own. You have helped me see a lot more about what transgender folks go through.   I am currently binging your entire archive."
"Love you Nat!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈🌈 #ContraPointsIsAwesome"
"Non binary solidarity here x"
"As a AMAB ,Transgender person with Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome, feminist and a bit of a misandrist. Transgender Women are Women. TERFs can't agrue with my biology 😁"
"I understand hating one self because I have felt it many times (short amounts of time), but isn't it more proper to instead 'hate' the mechanics of reality? we ourselves lack any sense of sovereignty and are only experiencing ourselves and the so-called outside world. we ourselves have nothing to do with how we behave, act or feel. i think in reality, this self-hatred is really just the 'closest available simulation' of a sense of incongruence with reality and/or a disgust for it."

"Viewing your videos is like a constant wow-moment, I get so inspired!  The arguments, the humor, the aesthetics - everything! Thank you for your whole existence and for all of your marvelous contributions! ❤"
"Why cant people just live and let live? Getting to actually know one trans person would cure a good portion of transphobes. As for traps who claim trans women cant know what being socialized as a woman is like from birth, do trans people not have mothers, sisters and friends? I would assume that most trans women identified with those people in their lives much more emphatically. We mostly learn from watching those people in girlhood. Also, it's not easy to be socialized Male. Especially when you dont identify as one. Not being able to show emotion. Expected to be strong and tough all the time. I can empathize with both sides because my father wanted a boy and my brother wasn't born until I was 11. So I was simultaneously treated as a boy and told I was never going to be as strong or smart as a man. That I had to stay thin and act dumb if I were to ever find a husband. Individual experiences cant be put into these boxes. Ever. I wanted to add that I remember being about 13yrs old and hearing myself be referred to by female pronouns meant so much to me. I never understood why until I got older and identify with the gender I was assigned with at birth so I can only imagine how it would feel had I not."
"Since 30 minutes of conceding points and deconstructing silly feminist objections is exactly what I expected, I'll cut through to the heart of this:  Being a 'woman' means absolutely and precisely nothing, Contrapoints is arguing about a right to express the evocation of 'womanhood'."
"Not to be dramatic but i'd catch a bullet for you"
"I just need to excuse your beauty and let you know how much I love your outfit.  Thank you for the incredible thoughts that come out of your brain through your mouth."
"So I have no idea if anyone will read this or in fact care but this video made me so emotional because I was definitely a TERF for a good minute. I'm not sure if anyone ever called me one and I was maybe less vocal about it but I certainly harbored those beliefs. Nothing really changed until I underwent emergency surgeries to remove my ovaries due to precancerous tumors and no the eggs were not salvageable. I went through an identity crisis because one my hormones were different and some of the characteristics of estrogen loss are very apparent maybe not to everyone but certainly to me and two I was unable to yes ( this sounds dumb even typing this) be the gaia I was meant to be and harbor life although I still have a uterus and can in theory still carry a child I cannot without expensive intervention get the hormones or pregnancy that I had believed made me a woman. So I struggled and masked my pain in a lot of humor and reassurances to my partner that we would save a lot on condoms now and this whole experience shaped my empathy for gender dysphoric people because to me I still don't 100% feel like I should as a woman whether that's because of my pcos symptoms(Google it) or  post surgical menopause and I almost cried when I experienced a period again. But this whole thing boils down to these women mislead themselves into feeling threatened by people who aren't in this situation because they want to be but because that's the hand they were dealt and they are doing the best they can as we all are. So burn the patriarchy burn the bras but let's not burn each other. ❤"
"I thought you said 'Judy Greer' at the beginning as an example of a TERF, and I got so sad"
"If the antipathy, disgust, and revulsion towards transgenders arises from deep within the lizard brain, then this is too a perfectly valid identity. Being a 'bigot' is just as valid as being a 'woman'. There is no moral realism you can appeal to that I can't deconstruct as meaningless, so we are at a perfect stalemate."
"Re 'terf is a slur' : TERF is an acronym that was coined by THEMSELVES. That's not how slurs work. Also as a cis woman, TERFs are gross, trans women are my sisters."
"HOW IS SHE THOUGH"

"The writing is so sharp it makes me want to cry. You are a treasure.  also re chasers... i dont get why it's a bad thing. i can understand feeling fetishised as opposed to loved, but how is being a chaser that much different from being someone who likes blonde women or muscular men or etc? what's _wrong_ with being sexually shallow?"
"I still enjoyed watching this as FtM trans"
"This is the most thoughtful Transplaining I've encountered yet. Thanks for this video!"

"Hey who’s the broad in the reimagined Maleficent costume, she’s hawwwwwt!"
"NATALIE. Thank you so much for this. I used to be sympathetic to radfem ideology, and I was so excited when I saw your post on Twitter about this because you are the ONLY person I trust to do the topic justice. I never thought I harbored transphobia, and hated some of the awful things other radfems said about trans women, but had nowhere to go with my questions about gender and trans experience. I moved away from my beliefs gradually, not from an intellectual awakening or anything but by meeting more trans people and just chilling out a little bit (like, trans women are different from cis women but are definitely not the source of our oppression!!! Calm down). If I had seen this video five years ago I would have gotten to healthy place much faster. You nailed it, as I knew you would, and I so appreciate you taking these important questions seriously while answering them effectively. I hope more people recognize that screaming about TERFS, while understandable, doesn’t do anything to convince those people engaging in radfem thought in (sort of) good faith. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 💖💖💖"
"So tired of this 'AFAB solidarity' that feels like nothing more than TERFy BS."

"Btw /r/agender seems a bit 'gender critical'"
"'Denying transpeople their gender identity because 'abolish gender' is kind of like denying citizenship to immigrants because 'abolish borders'.'  Fuck that's gold."
"Wow, she mentioned nonbinary people. Should I feel grateful?"
"Imagine feeling so victimized that you attack a whole group of people that aren't actually hurting you. I would know because I used to be like that as an extreme anti sjw. That's why those two groups get along so well. The funny part is I only acted like that because I hated admitting that I sometimes experience dysphoria as a woman. And their argument about gender stereotypes seems pretty invalid because then what about hyper feminine cis women? And am I toxic for being more masculine? Their arguments have lots of holes. And I mean as far as abolishing gender, why would they claim that if they care so much about being women? Yes Karen, you are a woman, somebody wanting to identify as a trans woman does not change that for you. Just like how you don't have to say anything you don't want to say, it will just make you look like an asshole and an idiot when you call a trans woman he or it. My own mother is like that with racism and talking about trans people... 'I'm not racist but...' or (on a friends trans ex girlfriend) 'Well let's just remember he dated an unstable boy, that was the real problem'. A lot of people claim to be all inclusive then use the iconic 'but'. Like how people know I'm bi but I'm either a predator to women or want to fuck an entire football team of guys because like that's totally how it works. And don't think they realize using oppression is also a moot point because I'm pretty sure a straight cis woman has it a lot better than a trans straight woman. I understand abuse could also play a part in how terfs view the world, but it shouldn't excuse being such an asshole. Positive side note though: Love the aesthetics for this video. <3"
"America's Next Top Victim. omg too real."
"I am ashamed to say that I have thought some of these things in the past - the TERFy beliefs."
"You will always be male"
"so, facts don't matter because Contra needs more time to put on more fake nails, costume accessories and extra make up in an attempt to look less masculine and doesn't have time for facts? I don't understand, you're just being a long-winded idiot now?"
"Take your lithium weirdo....no such thing as 'trans'...there is only male and female....your body appears to be riddled with Y chromosomes, perhaps you have a few extra chromosomes as well..."
"Not sure how I feel about the lack of pink lighting in this video"
"Brava, Natalie! Wow! This definitely caused me to check myself: I think I had a little TERFy tape in my head after surviving sexual assaults that I had to change."
"I'm confused by the 'abolish gender' segment. She says she's going to abolish gender, and then appears costumed as if she's about to do Ophelia's mad scene from Hamlet. That's femininity of a particular type, and not genderless. Then she puts her hair under a cap, so that there's no hair to distract from her face. Since her face still appears feminine, this makes her seem more feminine, because it becomes clear that she doesn't need hair to appear feminine. Then she stops using words, and the mind no longer has to process what she's saying and focuses entirely on the image, which again seems more emphatically feminine because it doesn't depend on feminine speech patterns . At each step of the way, removing things that signal femininity without decreasing the impression of femininity makes her seem a bit more feminine as the segment progresses.  I don't know jack about makeup, but it looks to me like she's wearing blush throughout the segment, and there may be some other light makeup. Along with the Ophelia outfit, that would seem to undermine any effort to appear genderless. In addition there's the problem of subcutaneous fat softening the contours of the face and making it more feminine. And finally, even back when she was a cross-dressing man, she was a pretty girl. So take someone who's 'naturally fish', as she puts it, feminize the face with subcutaneous fat, feminize it further with a little makeup, and you don't end up with genderless.  She ends with 'I can't stand this. Fuck this.' What is it she can't stand? There doesn't seem to be an obvious reason for her distress. I'm not criticizing, I just don't understand the choices she made in this segment, or what she was trying to communicate.  Edit: Removed references to Natalie's beauty, because that wasn't what was at issue.  Second edit: I guess this segment is about disphoria? Sorry for being obtuse. To me it's not intuitively obvious that a beautiful woman, demonstrating that neither her beauty nor her femininity depend on the usual props of hair, heavy makeup, feminized clothing, or even female speech behavior, is feeling disphoria. I had to work it out intellectually, and intellect without intuition is pretty slow. Apparently, I don't have any intuitive empathy for trans women's disphoria. The only thing I can say for myself is that I'm sincerely trying to understand."

"I think I can add some elements to the conversation with my experiences. When it comes to having your life supposedly shaped by male privilege, this can be completed reverted by being 'fem' (as Natalie points out (lol miss Points)). As a gay male having  very easily identifiable male body features, I often find myself experiencing and understood what women go through... Because I wear heels and had lately extra long box braids, it became very common for dicknuggets to express whatever they thought about me outloud in the street. So when I went out wearing a skirt that week, I felt fear: I knew I was drawing the attention of these stupid people and I knew what I would be associated with... So I experienced life as a woman (eventhough these stupid guys weren't likely to sexualy harass me, which makes women case so much scarier) and my understanding of what women go through became visceral, I then realised how impossible it is to figure out what the real tee is when you don't drink it yourself, but how fast you get it tasting the tiniest drop."

"Loved it. Such a thorough analysis. I think it covered everything."
"I'm someone who really doesn't give much of a shit about gender. But I respect that it is very important for a lot of people so Ièm invested in the issue. I want my friends to feel comfortable and confident in their skin and presentation. But personally, to me, gender really doesn't matter. I just really donèt care what gender someone is or how they present, but I care about their feelings and how they want to be treated."
"LOve this and U!!"
"Oh one comment I have that isn't necessarily a 'concern' but I've seen a lot of cis women state discomfort with the idea that to be 'not trans' is to be comfortable in one's own body. I myself often feel a lot of discomfort with societal expectations as a lesbian and a woman who doesn't present as butch anymore but still doesn't wear makeup and isn't really good at 'girly things' and as someone who doesn't have a whole lot of love for their own body. It might be useful to reframe it as 'someone who doesn't feel as though they are the gender they were assigned at birth' rather than something to do with comfort e.g. you're 'comfortable' with the gender assigned to you at birth (which I see a lot) and which doesn't totally ring true to me or a lot of other cis women (especially lesbians.) Rather, I don't process this discomfort as a belief that I don't belong to the category of 'woman' but rather acknowledge that this discomfort is part of my lesbian womanhood.   I think too that people having similar feelings and coming to the conclusion that they AREN'T the gender they were assigned at birth feels somehow offensive because they feel that they're being told they can't process the same feelings differently. And, to be fair, sometimes I also feel that way when my nonbinary friends have asked 'are you sure you're not nonbinary?' It's difficult emotional work to be queer and it requires empathy towards the fact that people can come to different conclusions from similar experiences."

"Genuine question:  Is it not double standard for trans folks to be mean/exclusive/discriminatory others (cis/straight) while wanting to be respected/accepted/included? I mean, if other say anything mean/exclusive/discriminatory against trans folks, they'll be called terf or transphobe."

Not because of the subject matter (which was brilliant and well thought out, as always) but because you look so comfortable, confident, and beautiful in it. I'm so happy for you right now and I hope to get there one day."
"Great video, possibly one of my favorites, but my comment is shallow and has nothing to do with your content (sorry).  I never leave comments but I needed to tell you that you are so flipping pretty. Every look in this video is dynamite.   Oh, and you're brilliant, too. Complete package <3.  (I'll go away now)."

"There is a trans issue/topic I would love to hear your input on. I have been told that when I am searching for dates, it is transphobic to be in search of people who have a vagina. I am in an open relationship with a man (who has a penis, so I'm covered in the penis department) but I am sexually interested in female genitals as well. Why is it transphobic to be sexually attracted to specific genitals? I can't really help that."

"LOL. LOST LESBIAN SISTERS LOLOLOLOL. Ohhhhhhhhboy. I have not heard that one yet."
"Ugh thanks for outing Germaine Greer."
"Comment"
"Some of the criticism is valid, there is a lot of visceral hate in TERF forums that really is disgusting. But in real life, i've encountered a few very reasonable of gender critical feminists recently, and i'm kinda started agreeing with some of their points. The problem is, that it's very hard to have a discussion about this with trans people when they get offended by the tiniest indication of denyig their gender identity/womanhood/manhood, because they believe that's denying their existence. GCs belive gender identity is essentialism and doesn't exist. (That's not the same as when conservatives say that, because conservatives actually do belive in gender identity, they are just unaware of it and think it's unseparably connected to biological sex and gender expession.) So are gcs offending humanity all the time? The whole point of gender critical feminism is that NOBODY should (eventually) identify as any gender, we should only do it for emancipatory reasons, similalry to the working class. Questioning if  - in class sense - trans women are women is completely reasonable. The video didn't give an answer to that question either. (sorry for mistakes, not english speaking here)"

"I always appreciate the informative info and insight, but the icing on the cake is  your delightful infectious laughter!"
"The reality is life is not a competition!  We are who we are, just don't hurt anyone!  Who the hell cares what you think or what anyone else thinks?   However, we have a choice of being offended by perceived slights. To be honest, most people are just trying to make that the rent /mortgage ! The biological reality is women  give birth and menstruate!   It's also a biological fact that we have the same DNA that we were born with. We are biologically male or female! A biological female or male have a different biological make up and gender is a completely different issue!"
"Ah, so that's whst a TERF is! Hmm, I still often think about Rose McGowan shutting down a transwoman during a Q&A i don't remember where. I saw it as a video some time ago. I suppose that was my first exposure to TERFs. I didn't really understand because I generally align with feminist thought, but that was such a revolting reaction to me. Thank you for offering your perspective on this. I really don't understand why people can hold these types of ideas in their heads. What is wrong with people...? I know good people affected by this type of mentality. Also that damned teapot sip made me cackle loudly."
"You know, asking former gender critical women about their views on gender critical feminism is very interesting, but I'm still waiting for the day an influential leftist YouTuber will ask gender critical feminists who used to be trans-supportive, or even trans themselves, why they became like this. You may learn something that will help you self-reflect."

But also thanks for this,  I want to be inclusive but I do have questions and I’m never sure whether I can ask them when I meet trans people irl, and then I’m uncomfortable and can’t relax around them which can’t be nice for them either."
"A video on the topic 'Trans Women in Sports'? I've been seeing a huge discussion on trans women, with bodies better adapted at their sport than the females participating in it, giving trans women an absolute competitive advantage."

"woe woe woe... 'Not all gas attendants!' ;)"
"I really should stop listening to your videos while at work - it is very inappropriate to shout 'Yes!' every couple of minutes in an open space office AND I am missing the fab. looks!"
"This is my first time getting a close up on this 'terfs' (this is no issue in the third world country I live) and I can say I don't like them very much. Their sub reddit is full of 'removed' comments and intransigence. I don't see any difference between them and the average right wing biggot. I've always perceived myself as a feminist but never like that! Lots and lots of love to every feminist regardless of sex, gender identification or sexual orientation, just love to kind people that want to make this world a better one"
"I almost want to see you talk to Blaire again. Not a debate or argument but just a talk could be good."
"I had to identify as  a woman for 33 minutes just to watch this."
"You're my mom"
"TERFs hate a mysogynist view of what it means to be a woman but have a problem with body hair on women.... Right.... A bit like a gender neutral world with female only spaces... Hmmmm. Whatever... But the 'r' stands for reactionary not radical."
"As an actual Radfem, TERFs are disgusting and a disgrace."
"Terfs really have the wrong target when hating inclusive language around menstruating... Also, I '''grew up female''' (ughhhhh) and always looked like a girl but never got catcalled or harassed by men, does mean I get the terf stamp of definitely not a woman? Or is that not relevant because actually there is nuance and people have can have the same gender but have different experiences going up hmmm now lets apply that to trans people too Also also, it's a crime that we don't have a full version of 'no-one knows what it's like to be a sad tran'"
"I dont get all this BS I just have 1 question, does this Ho do ass2mouth or not?"
"There is a chemical wash that goes over a males brain at a certain time in embryonic development.  If this malfunctions then things might go different.  I have been called Mr and I am totally female cis but I wear Jeans, t-shirts and boots and I buzz my hair to 1/16 of an inch because of practicality.  I am very much a person who wants my stuff to have function like jeans with as many pockets as I can get on them and shirts with a pocket.  I used to be super female and now I just don't give a shit because I am fat and ugly so I will dress modestly but how ever I want.  I get sizes that are huge that will not be skin tight on my fat.  I feel guilty every time I go out in public.  I also have crossed eyes too.  my looks suck.  I stay in as much as possible so I don't embarrass my grown children by people finding out I am their mother. I love Cincinnati chili...3 way!"
"sis the production quality on this!!!! i’m actually shook thank u cxx"
"What are your thoughts on the cotton ceiling? I was disappointed you didn't address this point as it's a concern TERFs bring up that I can emphasize with.  As a cis woman it's not my place to speak for trans women whatsoever, but even I admit some of their arguments in support of the cotton ceiling sound eerily similar to conversion therapy talking points, even if not intended. I'm not coming from a place of hostility, but of genuine curiosity and hopes to better expand my view.   Also love your points about trans and cis women standing in solidarity. My experience as a cis woman is different from a trans woman, and understanding and learning from each other rather than pitting against each other is the best thing we can do from an intersectional perspective. The historical oppression of female bodies shouldn't be erased, nor should the existence of trans women. It's not feminist to not support all women of different stripes."
"You poor thing! your life must be so hard making over 20K a month on patreon."
"It makes me sad that a lot of gender critical women focus on so much negative stuff as a proof that women are women. Being catcalled, harassed, undermined. Do we have to suffer to be true women?   I am a woman who gets treated equally, even when I was a child, and also doesn't want children. Does this make me any less of a woman? No."
"Natalie you are a wonder ❤️"
"Add me to the list of stubbly cis women out there also the that Germpain Inrear is a TERF isn't a surprise I used to think she was a misandrist now I think the old bitch just hates everyone who isn't her."
"Natalie needs to set dress for other youtubers. Nobody has better sets."
"Your outfit is sick. Love the had."
"Genderless ContraPoints was pretty funny."
"The fact that these feminists attack trans people rather than the Kardashians is kinda like how the leftist factions warred with each other during the Spanish Civil War (despite having far bigger Franco fish to fry), and how universal religions denounce those who deviate even slightly from official dogma as being heretics (and tirelessly seek them out and purge them). When it comes to ideology, the more dogmatic you get, the more you despise those who identify as having the same cause as you, but differ slightly on the reasoning behind the movement."
"Fuck TERFs"
"wow Contra! you've really convinced me that a genderless utopia like 10:43 would be swell, thanks for making such a compelling argument for it!"
"Amazing I cried like 5 time ❤️"
"10:50 Long hair isn’t a gender signifier. Plenty of feminine females have short hair and plenty of masculine males have long hair."
"Your! Utopian! Pipe-dream! Is valid!"
"Ah. So terfs are....those same feminist that attack cis women for being too overtly feminine and tell us that all penetrative sex is rape, then when we are too ballsy and tough criticize cis women for acting like male pigs and giving women a bad name. The gender critical are nobody's ally. But I was born with a vagina so it's everybody' god given right to find excuses to tell me I'm living my gender the wrong way. Also, thanks, ContraPoins, for supporting my right to my own opinions and language, because radical feminist certainly won't."
"RadFems: > abolish genders > why do you say *Pregnant People*?!"
"Even though I'm a Cisgendered woman you made me realize things about myself.  You giving me a lot of good things to think about."
"11:00 Anyone else getting a Tilda Swinton vibe here?"
"Alright. Genuinely couldn't tell you were trans when you had no makeup on. You just looked like a girl."
"So TERFs basically say: if you're not traumatized by patriarchy you are not a real woman. It's a dangerous concept because it would mean that even some cis women weren't opressed enough to be called real women. This is using trauma as a rite of passage of some sort and treating it as inevitable makes it cognitively difficult to imagine it preventable. This worldview may make patriarchy stronger because it's portrayed as a foundation of woman condition and identification."
"also i will stop calling TERFs TERFs when they give the same courtesy back to the world and stop misgendering my trans sisters, stop calling them 'mannish,' stop talking about their 'male privilege' every time they see them out of the corner of their eye, stop throwing screaming tantrums when they see the phrase 'pregnant people,' and stop visiting communities like /r/GenderCritical. (ergo, i will stop calling you a TERF (which is what you Fucking Are) when you stop existing.)"
"YOOOOO i had to pause this to write this BUT OMYGOD do i remember watching those maury episodes when i was a kid. Shook little me to its core"
"god i love you so much."
"I'm a woman who doesn't menstruate. God bless the menopause!"
"Just to say that I'm really enjoying your videos. You think just right. Unrelated, but I can't withhold a compliment when a compliment is due, you look gorgeous. (I say so not meaning to diminish or judge you upon your appearance, it's just an observation and people often do appreciate when their looks are acknowledged) Lots of love."
"It took me a night and a morning, but im glad i finished that. And good tunes"
"this world deserves to be erased"
"Reminds me of how I responded to a 'gender critical radical feminist''s desire for debate. She said both the stuff about reinforcing stereotypes about womanhood thing and made fun of masculine trans women, and responded to almost all points with 'source pls' and insisting calling women men isn't misgendering, it's just her opinion. So I got a bunch of sources together, pointed out that trans communities challenge stereotypes far more with nonbinary people (whom she had called disgusting), and so forth. She didn't reply. I think she must've realised that I wasn't going to simply say flimsy one-liners OR resort to simply insulting her and decided I wasn't fun anymore. I had begged her to see the similarities in how MRAs and her crew (I specifically avoided saying 'TERF') talk and act about trans people, and she just claimed that MRAs actually like trans people (with no source) which somehow proved we're all really men. At least I got to see how their ideas are just paper cutouts, I suppose. She obviously didn't expect any trans people to actually bother responding to her."
"I'm a cis female feminist, and I've battled with some of these questions. This was incredibly useful for me, thank you."
"I was once speaking with a TERF about trans rights, who in one breath said trans woman shouldn't be allowed in woman's spaces because Trans women aren't female enough in how they act or dress and thus would scare all the innocent little girls and abuse victims, then in the next breath said trans woman just reduce womanhood to the patriarchal ideas of long hair and eye shadow. I'm just left thinking 'so you don't like it when trans woman aren't super feminine, but you also don't like it when they are'. Honestly there's just no winning argument against TERFS."

"As always, an incredible informative and well-worded Video essay. I respect you as a content creator so much.  I would probably group myself as an angry cis & queer feminist. I have no personal experience with trans people, so my view has no nuance at all. I just say: everybody deserves love and respect. That’s about it.   A while ago, I came across a TERF forum and read through a few of the comments. One thing really stuck with me and to this day, I have no idea what to do with it. The thread discussed the topic whether it is alright to exclude trans women from some female spaces simply for not being able to have certain experiences.  The OP described her deep fear of being sexually assaulted and getting pregnant from the experience. She felt like her trans friends and the trans people she talked about it to online tried to silence her on that matter because it is supposedly trans-exclusionary (since trans women usually can’t get pregnant). The OP wanted a space that people who are able to have these experience can safely inhabit and felt misunderstood and traumatized by trans women who felt excluded by the topic.   Now of course I can’t know whether the OP has ever experienced backlash from trans-people or trans supporters for wanting to discuss topics that usually don’t apply to the trans experience. But it really got me thinking. This is also a topic that women who can’t have children can’t relate to. Is it wrong to create separate safe spaces within female communities because parts of that community don’t and will never have any insight on a specific topics? I honestly don’t know.   Anyway, sorry for rambling. Great video!"
"They targeted gamers.  Gamers.  We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.  We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.  We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.  Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.  Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?  These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.  Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."

"Sinister Butt"
"i'm glad you brought up the bit about internalizing female socialization before actually coming out. this isn't everyone's experience but i'm autistic and even though i was definitely treated mostly as a boy until recently, i was never really able to 'perform' masculinity properly. to cope with issues relating to my autism i became hyper-observant but For Some Reason 'how boys act' was something i never completely got and would frequently get teased and mocked by the actual boys i knew until i started isolating myself (the cowards never straight-up bullied me bc i was 6 ft and had a knack for making teachers like me) but i absorbed female socializing like a damn sponge ever since i was about 12.  so i learned to be kind at the expense of yourself, be small, be unnoticed, be submissive, basically just be an object, which i found frequently stifled my natural disposition as a very bratty theatrical child who needed to be at the center of attention at all times as well as making me just completely unable to live up to people's expectations of me to be more assertive, to be ruder, to be louder and more aggressive and commanding. so my experiences don't perfectly match cis women's and we can debate all day who had the more oppressed experience but we're a lot more alike than one might think."

"Such good commentary and I am so impressed with the quality of your shit. As a cis woman, I can smell a terf a mile away but I also had similar question as some of them did and I'm glad to see them answered so well here. There are few things more satisfying than being entertained and educated at the same time. I found myself nodding along the whole time! I would just say one thing, and I'm sure you know it already. Many cis women can understand what its like to be rejected by society for the way they look, to be looked on as monsters becaue they suit a certain ideal. Fat women for instance, often have to have secret love affairs because the men who fetishize their bodies do not want to be seen in public women. I am sure that many differently abled people across the gender spectrum can relate to this. Ultimately, there is no ultimate victim card that can be pulled. Pain is pain but it is not all the same. We can recognise our differences without malice or contempt."

"Terfs are supposed to be the champions  of women presenting as butch or femme as they like, but mock transwomen for qualities that cis-women can have too. Cis-women can be very tall, very muscly, bearded etc and these women are not really accepted by society, and supposedly who terfs are fighting for. They are therefor hypocrites for mocking transwomen for their manly attributes, when they say that they want women of all shapes and sizes to be accepted by society. If I was a bearded cis-woman, then mean comments about a transwoman’s stubble would hurt me too.   Sidenote: A study shows that rightwing voters are more likely to feel strong disgust than leftwing voters and honestly that makes perfect sense. The lizard brain likes familiarity, and conservatives don’t usually love societal change."
"I really like this channel. I'm a cis woman who hasn't encountered many trans women (and who doesn't spend a lot of time in awful corners of the internet), so I actually didn't know that TERFs were a thing. And yeah, right off the bat, they and their beliefs seem ridiculous. Like this video said, all women (cis, trans and otherwise) should be uniting so we can faster streamroll towards equality for all. What a great video and thank you for teaching me something today :)"
"I've never met transperson in real life and also never been part of the TERF community, but your video was very educating for me and I think that soon you will be more popular! I hope you know how important you are for everyone and how you making real positive changes in every side of the discourse, because everything is connected and influencing each other. I'm just so glad that there are people like you who do this hard work. So thank you, Natalie, you are very cool person! (sorry, my english is bad but i'm trying)"

"Oh Fuck this was so funny. Spicy, yet very intelligent. Also I loved the out takes, I don't know what it is, or if it's even genuinely funny, but I cracked up every time with you."
"Also when it comes to vocabulary about menstruation etc, using woman is on the whole medically inaccurate anyway because there are many intersex people (those whose biological sex characteristics don't fall entirely into just 'male' or 'female') who do menstruate. They may identify as men, women, or non-binary like anyone else, but to deny that it's not just 'female-at-birth' people who can have a uterus and periods is ignoring a very xxtra biological way of being. Erasure of intersex people is a huge issue and they shouldn't just be used to tear down the strict ideas of gender and sex that TERFs have, but it is relevant to the conversation for sure."

"Another outstanding video!"
"Cis-Man here. I've been asking these questions in good faith for years, desperately trying to understand. I think I struggle with black and white thinking generally, and can't hear the simplified catch-phrases without them just sounding Orwellian. 'All women are women! Four legs good, two legs bad!' I struggle to talk to my ftm, mtf, and nb trans friends, because the questions I don't feel like I'm allowed to ask won't stop repeating themselves in my brain long enough to think of something else, anything else to talk about. I want to reduce suffering and promote flourishing, and calling people by the names, pronouns, and genders they request seems like a really low cost way of doing that. It's just when I feel like I have to accept claims that seem metaphysical and make no sense, I can't do it. And it's made me isolate myself more than normal because I'm afraid my only social circles, all of which are very trans-friendly, will find out I don't agree with the dogma and cast me out as a hateful bigot.  I dated a person who is non-binary, and I could never even quite figure out what they meant by it. Like, it was absolutely central to their sense of identity, but the few times I tried to gently probe so I could understand, it just sounded like they were upset that people care about gender in the first place. Which I can respect, but I don't get how that makes *them* not have a gender. And it always felt like they were doing double-think to hold that view while trying to also respect trans-men and women. But I could barely ever talk to them about any of this, because everything I've read told me that I would be invalidating them and causing violence and real harm to them. And I loved them (still do), and didn't want to hurt them. So instead I just kept myself at arms distance, because I also thought it was unfair to them for us to get closer when I so clearly didn't understand something so fundamental about them.  Natalie, I've watched and re-watched every video you've made on these subjects, hoping to come to some answers, and really hoped that this one would do it, but all it's told me is that you don't personally hold views as extreme as every single feminist I know. I don't have issue with any of the things you said (that I can think of, at least), but your nuanced views are so far away from everyone else in the trans community that they're basically worthless for me to understand what everyone else means. They're hella valuable in their own right, and thank you for making this, but they haven't helped this ally-wanna-be get any resolution."
"'Let's watch an instructional video' has become the lifeblood of my existence. 🙂 I was so excited to see this new instructional video, and I give you many thanks for presenting it.

I know that's not the point, but just know that what you do and who you are is deeply appreciated."
"Your Royal Highness Natalie, I hope that what I'm about to say isn't the wrong thing to say.  I want to be gender-affirming and tell you how much you still looked like yourself, and therefore womanly, during the agender segment.

"I have a question. I believe that non cis people should be able to live freely as they choose. I also believe that there are genuine concerns in the black community about the potential spread of hate when a non black person uses racial slurs. And furthermore I believe that the concepts of gender and race are extremely flawed with many loop holes in what defines them (like a woman with XX chromosomes can still not get her period and a there is no true “white race”). My question is how would I argue that trans racial people cannot exist to a troll if they come at me with race is a flawed social construct and therefore they should be allowed to say the n word because they identify as black? I’ll admit I haven’t given this question too much thought as I wasn’t in the mood to debate with myself but I like being as non hypocritical as possible and don’t want there to be any loop holes in my thinking"

"I'm not seeing any rebuttals in the comments, so here's mine. For one, I don't think TERFs have an issue with trans women being too feminine AND too masculine, at least based on the information presented. It seems like they have a problem with people of obvious male sex (hairy paw, neanderthal in his 50's) attempting to be feminine. In addition, using a desire to be regarded as female by incorporating societal stereotypes of what a woman should be into your persona seems like a cop out to me if you're really against societal constraints on identity. Lastly, I wonder what Natalie thinks constitutes being a woman, cause I didn't find her perspective on that. If it's not being 'feminine', and it isn't being born with XX chromosomes, what is it? A meaningless word, at least in regards to some real structure to the world?"

"I really hate the concept of 'troll questions,' for several reasons: 1) You're not a mind-reader and could be easily mistaken about other peoples' sincerity. 2) It's an easy excuse to dismiss questions that sometimes merit real consideration (applause to Contra for at least attempting to subvert this one). 3) Even a person who intentionally trolls you with a question may learn something from an earnest answer. 4) Answers can reach others besides the questioner. 5) It's pretty often used as a hypocritical 'troll answer' that makes you no better than your interlocutor.

"I genuinely appreciate your videos and was very interested in what this one would be like. I wasn't dissapointed, as you are always articulate and lovely, but do feel like you haven't approached the topic in very good faith (and if I'm honest I wasn't really expecting you to). You've rightly pointed out that so-called gender crit online has devolved into little more than hubs for bigots to express their...bigotry, but you've failed to acknowledge (or perhaps, minimised) that there are genuine concerns that have caused the core of friction between feminism and transactivism, which has been greatly exacerbated by a failure to engage with each other in good faith on BOTH sides. You highlight the transphobia of Germaine Greer and gender crit reddit, and fail to show one example of the misogyny espoused by any transwoman/man, in the name of transactivism or in general. So you somewhat paint women's concerns, inadvertently or not, as being silly and irrelevant because you personally are reasonable and can sympathise to an extent with the ones you present in this video. And also the fact that, like any social-political movement (including feminism), transactivism absolutely has flaws and does have issues (with individuals and as a movement) with how it relates to and engages with women and other LGB people. Particularly lesbians. I felt like....you almost acknowledge this but stop just short. I understand that this is a fairly personal video where you are simply giving a reasonable and level-headed response to a number of feminist concepts that have been turned into catchphrases by people who have never read a thing about them to throw at anyone who's trans. So obviously it's not your JOB to address any of this. I just felt compelled to share my own thoughts 😂"

So seriously thankyou. Even though i am Bisexual maybe pan... I have known for a while that i need these kinds of answers before establishing an opinion on all of these trans issues   The reason i don't know any trans people is because of where I live in the middle of conservative rural America."

"Look: I agree that radfem circles are often WAY TOO malicious. theres like, a lot of discourse about this on radfem tumblr actually. (but also: anti-terf people also regularly threaten so-called terfs in creepy sexual ways)  It pisses me off however that you didnt at all address that 'TERF' is very often used in place of 'biological female attracted to biological female'. This has been said to me after i expressed this of myself in very gender-friendly terms. and to me, when used like that terf is ABSOLUTELY a slur because it's basically 'dyke' veiled in progressivism.  also you never did in fact define womanhood which is why radfems criticize both passing and non passing transwomen. THERE IS NO INTRINSIC FEMALE ESSENCE. GENDER WAS INVENTED TO OPPRESS FEMALES. i wont deny that you face whats probably a mix of misogyny and homophobia but that doesnt mean you have to call what you feel WOMANHOOD because according to gender theory itself womanhood can be anything, is thus completely meaningless and useless as a term."
"Amo esto."
"there's one thing that i've found myself agreeing with TERFs about (HEAR ME OUT! put down the PITCHFORKS!) and it's pushback against idea that same-sex attracted people are 'genital fetishists'. now, the only trans people i've heard talking about gay people this way only seem to exist on tumblr/twitter -- i really don't think the Average Trans Person™  is super caught up in the idea that cis gays (particularly lesbians) have to be sexually attracted to them or ELSE, but the ones that do make me uncomfortable"
"I love your work. You've me make ask myself questions about a lot of things and grow as a person from the process. Thanks."
"Being a TransMed, is to on the base level to say you NEED dysphoria to be trans. this can come in many forms and doesn't need to be stereotypical to the 'I knew since I was born and it debilitated me' kind of story. Being a TransMed means you encourage others questioning to go see a professional to get it diagnosed, to find out if it is dysphoria and not some other thing going on in your brain. this is important, because if you transition and that isn't the problem, it could have some serious negative effects."
"Despises the West. Lives... where?"
"After listening to you speak I've come to the conclusion that you are brilliant. I was thinking that you, therefore, must be miserable. After the bloopers at the end, you seem to be having fun. That's great. I feel like I learned quite a bit. I personally believe 'Male Privilege' isn't all it's made out to be though... Privilege isn't the term I'd use."
"It's funny how males have discovered a new form of peacocking that is highly effective for catching attention of males and females: femininity. Contrapoints is really capitalizing on this trend. That's quite interesting. As an entertainer, I give them props. The costumage alone is almost as neat as the setting and lighting.   Transfeminism is an oxymoron. Transwomen have pioneered something women never could have---a form of phallocentric womanhood, where the penis is now, whether it's removed or not, the center of womanhood, where male reproductive costs are equated with female reproductive costs (because a male IS a female), and where female sexuality suddenly always includes males, often with penises. It's a conflation of the sexes, both form and function, i.e. a female does not come in a male body form, in fact it is the body that is male or female, never both, never metaphysically female while materially male. The body cannot be internally bifurcated on the basis of sex, it is always one or the other. It seems transfeminism is based on the varied social experiences of males who like to look feminine, as Contrapoints at 13:40 or so explains that feminine males like himself are not granted 'male privilege' when, for example, walking down the street. Contrapoints, just remember, you do have the privilege to be a female if you want and all that that legally entails, so... there's that. Maybe there's 'female privilege' which I'm guessing is just the ability to make money off of being sexualized and looked at or physically used for sex (#trans #transgender on Twitter are both filled with transwomen selling feminized sex), more so than any male.  No person is an 'it.' So... that's bizarre. Clocking a trans person is like clocking a fat person.... I mean, you'll see it if they are really fat. Try clocking a 'cis person' instead. Is that easy? Can you clock a pregnant woman? You cannot always tell someone's bodily state by looking at them, but humans are wired to investigate because we are most interested in each other.   If females at any point get confused and believe that they have the same reproductive costs as males, they will be disadvantaged.  (Having to specify male and female when talking about humanity really makes us sound like an animal specie---a primate where males often peacock for attention, heh)."
"Cool video, and I like your take on gender metaphysics. I'm cis myself, and haven't done a ton of study on the topic, so I'm not exactly super qualified to say, but since I'm allowed my own opinion, I think this is a good counterpoint (sorry) to PhilosophyTube's video on transphobia, which I don't think makes sense. Watching it, I thought that his claim that people must have a robust ontological understanding of trans people as the gender they identify as rather than simply saying, 'I'll treat them how they want to be treated' came off as an excessively cumbersome prerequisite towards anti-transphobia to ask of most people, especially if you actually want to reduce the number of transphobes, and I think your quote from Catherine MacKinnon really spoke to what I felt about that. Of course, you made a lot of the same arguments that Olly did, which is great, because most of them were good, especially pertaining to actually answering people's questions about trans feminist theory. That said, I think that as far as people who aren't really interested in metaphysics are concerned, that take is good. Very educational video, though!"

"Maybe you already addressed this in a previous video, but I am curious about your feelings on trans athletes, specifically the backlash happening with trans-women in competitive sports, is a weird situation. Would love your perspective on it. Love and Peace"
"I actually resonate with the idea that I used to be a girl and wasn’t always a guy. It feels dishonest to say I was always a guy (in my case) and it almost feels too controversial to ever say that in trans spaces 😅 Sorry everyone who says all trans people know they’re trans from birth, I never knew I was a guy until I was at least 20 years old 😂"
"thank you for being an amazing human being. lots of love"
"One of my best friends is a transwoman, she can't stand fake nails and make up, her favourite hobbies are seen as boys hobbies (video games, martial arts, comics), and she still identifies as a woman, her friends and family and school see her as a woman. The idea that terfs have that trans women are just 'girly men' just short sighted"

"I didn't watch all of the video, but I'm glad that you made this video to have this conversation. I love how you try to think critically about this topic. I find it refreshing how you are honestly taking on each of these concerns in a critical way. I feel like this is a place where I can honestly voice my concerns. I like how you come up with good arguments to honest concerns like myself and other cis-gender people have.   The feminist inside of me is one of the major forces that makes it hard for me to believe that someone can truly be transgender. I guess I feel that a lot of transgender people identify with a gender stereotype rather than actually being born into the wrong gender. The feminist inside of me says things like 'Just because a boy plays with dolls or wears dresses, doesn't make that boy a girl' or 'Just because that girl likes tools and trucks doesn't make that girl a boy'. Despite this, if someone asks me to call them by a different name or refer to them by another pronoun, I will do everything in my power to abide by those requests. I may not think that your gender dysphoria is valid/real, but I will do everything in my power to protect that freedom and right for you. It's a matter of respecting someone even if you don't understand them.  Why would this position make me transphobic?"
"Hey ContraPoints/Natalie, I just wanna say this in case you need to hear it today. I'm relatively new to your channel and the first video I watched of yours was the Incels one, and I ACTUALLY did not know you were trans until you mentioned it in that video. I absolutely thought you were a very theatrical cis woman. Have a good one"
"I'm sorry but this video goes against beliefs that I've grown up with my entire life and viewpoints I've shared with partners that I will pass to future generations. Cincinnati chili is GREAT."
"You'll never be a woman even if you cut off your dick"
"I get sick of what seems to be a false alternative we are offered in much of today's discussion about gender identity. One option is that we pave over biological sex like it doesn't exist and replace it with the concept of gender. That we should pretend that what's in your pants never ever matters. The second option is to erase the concept of gender and say that only what's in your pants ever matters. I love how this video takes a very nuanced look at the messy reality that's in between those false alternatives. And while I tend to have deep disagreements with a lot of radical feminist positions, I found myself in agreement with just about everything in this video. Touche for adding a lot of value to a complex topic. And for making me laugh hard and often."

In fact, I need to, if only because we all need to be reminded that we are all more alike inside than any of these MAGA kids want to admit. Thank you for your videos, they are inspiring, insightful, and entertaining.  I hope I'm a good enough father that my kids grow up to be like you.

"One question that I see a lot and was wishing would get tackled, but didn't, was women/radical feminists who reject the term 'cis' woman as it's commonly defined and applied, but also don't identify as agender/NB/etc. The way I've seen it put - and the way I'm putting it now, honestly - is if you take 'cis' to mean identifying with the gender you were assigned at birth and being comfortable with that, well, I don't fit that definition. I hardly identify at all with the gender roles, expectations, beauty and grooming standards, etc. etc. assigned to me by having been born female. But I'm still certain I'm a woman despite rejecting almost the entirety of my gender at this point. So I'm not really sure where that leaves me."
"'TERF is a slur to silence us!!' if only it worked tho...."
"Excellent video as always, Natalie. I feel I should comment on the first part though, where you say (paraphrasing): 'TERFs are not always evil bigots, some have just had negative experiences with men and cling onto a simple ideology where men are dangerous and women are safe.' Those are exactly the beliefs of evil bigots. Racists are not excused if they once had a negative experience with a black person, nor should misandrists be for the same reasons."
"I feel that calling transphobes TERFs legitimizes the perspective that there's such a thing as trans-exclusionary feminism, and that trans women are not women. Considering that these transphobes' behavior is not meaningly distinguishable from that of right-wing talking heads, we don't owe these people the 'feminist' label."
"Hahhahahaha wait did you just say that abolishing gender is the same as abolishing borders? So you admit women will always be fucked over and that's cool? Goooood to know."

"Whenever Natalie posts a video it’s like your mom handing you a good healthy snack 😊💕 Thanks Mom"
"wow, that sucked"
"Hey, can anyone explain to me what the difference is between being 'transracial' and being transgender?  I've always just seen it taken on good faith that they're not the same, but if we're not defining ourselves by negatives/oppression like Natalie says, then what IS the difference exactly?  The video brings up that abortion, birth, periods, etc. aren't things all cis women experience, but obv sexism is.  Can the same be said of racism, or am I putting my foot all the way down my throat?"
"I'd probably let your inner radfem domme me in all honesty"
"Is that Fantasia I hear? I swear its not the only thing I took from this video lol (Fantasia is underrated)"
"'TERFs think that trans men are lost lesbian sisters' yeah lol watch them try to make sense of me, a gay trans guy. A 'lost lesbian sister' who's actually straight? The whole assumption makes no sense once you stop assuming all trans men are straight. Speaking of which, I hope one day you do a video on the hellfire that is the trans masculine community, because the level of in-fighting, dysphoria and gender expression policing, and emulation of the ideologies of the 'anti-sjw's' who once plagued the internet to humiliate the most outwardly queer of us, internalizing those ideas and learning to hate their fellow trans people in the name of respectability politics, leaving those on the fringes helpless. They don't even realize they're harming their own community in this 'purge' of 'trans-trenders' because this obsession with getting rid of people who are 'not really trans' leads to thousands and thousands of even slightly feminine or androgynous trans men who don't have the energy to always hate their bodies agonize over their own legitimacy. That kind of self torture is not what you want in a community of such vulnerable people in society. Anyway I think it's an interesting topic that really needs talking about by someone who is able to go in as a more level headed neutral party, looking in on the community as a whole rather than being part of one group talking shit about another from within the community. idk"

"I can't remember the sub (it might even have been GenderCritical, or a meta sub like TheBluePill) but there was a link to a crazy rant doing the DM spam circuit. It was a screed against ciswomen, allegedly from a transwoman, calling for the discreet murder of ciswomen on a broad scale and the steady replacement of these dead women with transwomen, 'and eventually men are only left with transwomen to date, and they will prefer it since transwomen have male brains and think like men, thus eliminating the gender war' (paraphrasing)."
""
"It was such a ridiculous argument ('the trans people want to kill women!'), but the hatred in the rant was very real. It was clear to me, as it would be to most redditors, that the original poster was some anti-trans fuckwit trying to get ciswomen to join their bullshit, fashy cause. I didn't even need to look at OP's history to confirm this, but for some reason I always do - and there you had it in the history. A user who constantly posts on GenderCritical 'as a woman' and posts on the MGTOW sub as an angry dude."

However, I’m gender critical because I have seen how trans women and TRA try to shut down natal women from referring to their anatomy and reproductive oppression. Thanks for clarifying that you aren’t like that but you fail to address the TRAs who do this and who therefore do very much advance an agenda of female erasure.   Also, I’m straight but sick of all the rhetoric I from “transbians” who try to guilt and shame lesbians into accepting DICK. NO! Lesbians should never ever be told to they need to accept dick, that’s gross AF and yet another form of rape culture."
"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I’m so confused about how gender identity vs masculinity/femininity works that I’ve been questioning my gender identity for years; what it is and if I even have one. I’ve always felt so nonchalant about my biological sex, like I could be AFAB or AMAB and it wouldn’t make a difference to who I was and how I felt except for a few social things. So I’ve always wondered if this is how most people feel, and if so how being transgender fits into this, what are your experiences with gender, how any of this works scientifically ect."

"I personally still use gender-critical to refer to an overall gender-abolitionist ideology along with my feminist politics as a trans man, but you aren't wrong it gets used as a euphemism overall as well. I wouldn't be included to say its always terfs as an umbrella statement for the reason of how i use it, and ive found a growing number of people in similar political space to me using gender-crit as the re-align themselves in feminist politics to highlight those elements. It doesn't take long to look at someone's politics to find the issues if they are there though."

"the idea of feminism is centered around the idea of being able to put yourself in other peoples' shoes so the idea that the main problem of trans women is that they don't understand what it is like to grow up as a women implies that empathy doesn't exist. i would hope a trans women would listen to me when i talk about growing up as a women the same way i would want anyone to. i would also hope people who didn't go through the same stuff i did would listen to me talk about my health or economic background."

"I haven't read anything addressing this yet but I came away from the GC subreddit a little puzzled and had a thought---is TERFery partly rooted in a generational divide? I've lived on the east coast, west coast, and rust belt and never really met a lesbian who was transphobic. Are TERFs mostly gen x/boomers? Do others sense that millennial/gen z are less essentialist in their thinking around gender and biology and more receptive to notions of fluidity by default?"

"I doubt ContraPoints will read this, but here goes nothing.  Let me start off by saying that I agree with pretty much everything you said in this video, and now go off on a really wonky tangent.  I have a step-sister who is half-Filipino, half-mixed white European descent, who is going around saying she is a Native American... I told her that I thought it was offensive to appropriate the racial identity of a group that she has no connection with whatsoever and she cut contact with me.  Anyway, I had the accusation leveled at me that I shouldn't support transgenderism if I don't support trans-racialism (although she's not even claiming trans-racialism; she's outright pretending that she's always been Native American to the point of pretending her parents... aren't her parents).  While I have my own thoughts on why this is ludicrous, I'd be curious to hear what you or others reading this think of the subject of trans-racialism in general.  I think if nothing else it could make for an entertaining video, lol. . One of the things that I find strange about this particular situation with my step-sister is that unlike, say, white women using blackface as we've repeatedly seen in the news (and accusations from detractors that this is solely done by white women and is therefore obviously a byproduct of white privilege), my step-sister is half-Filipino.  It's part of the reason why she's easily able to convince idiots that she's a Native American."

Necessary that transgenderisim remains medicalized for things like being able to use insurance to have stuff like surgeries at least partially paid for and B.) That it's necessary to have gender dysphoria [As in having a disconnect between your gender and sex.]. Now of course, there's a lot of toxicity within the community, and I'm sure there are people who are exactly as you described, but either or, how it was presented in the video wasn't fully accurate, or at least from how I see it. Thanks for making the video, it was stunning as usual"
"I tried to explain this video to my mom, but she just didn't understand the idea of being transgender, and brought up the concern of trans-women dressing in a way that follows stereotypical female gender roles. I tried to explain the concept of needing to identify as one gender and not wanting to be misidentified, but she said she thought everyone should be who they are and ignore gender roles. I didn't want to argue it further. I'm a cis-gender male, but I understand and empathize with people. It can be frustrating trying to have a conversation about these topics, because so many people think transgender people are just 'making it up' or overdoing it somehow and fantasize about a utopia that doesn't exist. Even if they may have had similar struggles themselves."

One question that I’m too embarrassed to ask anyone but somehow feel comfortable in this anonymous cozy bosom of the comments section: do orgasms feel the same since your transition?  Red looks good on you, btw."
"Straight, cis, white woman here! Thanks Contra for explaining stuff so clearly for people! Your videos are always so informative but never boring. ^^  Anywho, I go to an art college, and probably like 50% of the school is LGBTQ+ (it's a very small school, like ~300 students). Sometimes I feel like I'm the minority, which might be true, who knows? Doesn't matter much to me. Your videos help a lot for me to try to understand better how to help out since many of my closest friends now are trans, gay, ace, and everything in between! 😊 thank you again natalie!"

"The whole ‘trans women don’t have Women Experiences’ thing has always felt like bullshit to me. Half the time I, as a cis woman, haven’t had those experiences either. We’re not a homogenous group. Culture, religion, country and social/economic class will have at least an equal impact. Is Queen Elizabeth not a woman because nobody dared to cat call royalty? Does a child ‘become a woman’ after being assaulted, harassed or raped? What the fuck happened to intersectionality? Isn’t the point that we all have different experiences and some shared ones?"

"It wasn't really touched on, but there is definitely elements of misandry in TERF attitudes. That is to say, they claim to be gender critical, but would shame even cis men who express in feminine ways. Not because 'femininity is bad' but because they see it as sacred.  Gender critical, even going so far as to claim they don't believe that there are male and female brains, and yet males are somehow *innately* rapey, regardless of socialisation.  I think it's worth recognising that unjustified hatred of males and masculinity is a thing, even if it's not as widespread as misogyny or transphobia."
"I think you make a very good point about identity as a whole when it comes to past experiences justifying where you are now. For instance, as a female in engineering I often hear speech from the professor to the class at the beginning of each senester: “you‘re probably here studying engineering because you liked to take apart the VCR when you were a kid” or “Because you know a lot about cars” and honestly that almost immediately invalidates a lot of women because that’s just simply something not a lot of them did."
"Natalie, something I'd really love to have some insight on, and something I've never really had the opportunity to explore in personal conversation, is what exactly what a trans person DOES identify as womanhood. I've heard a lot about what it's not (it's not your clothes, it's not your mannerisms, it's not your trauma, it's not your place in society, it's not your biology, it's not who you have sex with, it's not who you're allowed to marry etc. etc.) But what IS it? When you wake up in the morning and feel relief that you get to be a woman instead of being forced to act like a man, what is it you think of? I open the floor to anyone else who'd like to answer too. Any opinions gratefully considered."

You were the best youtuber, but you're getting a little bit boring. I know this stuff is important, but maybe try not to drill the same feminist / trans stuff so much without a break. Overall, still a great channel, just a bit less so, lately."
"This was very interesting but IMO it doesn't really address the worries of 'normies'. I'ts Trans vs Turfs vs a whole group of academics who are all the same; most of the rest of us don't have these concerns...    For me the issues never addressed are much more practical (where it spills over into real life).   Is sex with a trans women who passes actually rape and where do you draw a line with informed consent?    Do trans woman have an unfair physical advantage against XX women?  (Fallon Fox was a low level MMA fighter as a man who's career spiked after she changed). I remember watching her break a females Skull (before she was outed), I remember thinking they didn't belong in the same cage! With hindsight it looked like a man beating a woman. I don't know 'Gender Critical issues' but I do know a little about MMA and it was unfair; in a world where men can fight women you will lose all your female stars (a great female fighter is often beaten by a good male fighter). And again where do you draw the line with consent?      In the UK we put a trans woman in a female prison and she raped other inmates, don't you worry that allowing men who wear dresses to use female facilities will in courage some of the worst people to align themselves with you? Again in the UK the 'pro-paedophile' Groups are fighting for inclusion within the LGBT community.    I think Feminists et al all live in thought bubble, for the longest time Germain Greer tactics were accepted because they were used against SWM now she has turned them against members of the LGBT, you live buy the sword!   Personally I think the first side (Trans or Turf) to come up with honest answers and practical solutions will win the normal's but honestly sometimes it feels like LGBT is much more academic and doesn't care to win anyone outside their circle?"

"Oof. I agree with your points and this was beautifully produced as always, but as a nonbinary person I'll cop to feeling a little stung by the 'genderless utopia' moment. I don't want a genderless society--  I want everyone to be free to experience their gender the way they want to!-- but I do have a genderless personal identity, and that bit was a little... uncomfortably familiar. It's the kind of rhetorical device I EXPECT to see from the people who don't support nonbinary identities-- well what, are you a robot then? gender is an essential part of the human experience! you can't NOT have a gender! you're just broken-- and although I think I understand why it was used here... I don't know. It wasn't uncomfortable in an 'I should examine my thoughts on this!' way. It was uncomfortable in a 'wow I think that actually hurts' way.  Fuck TERFs, though, obviously."

"This video ignores the central tenet of the gender critical position, which is that sex is immutable, so no matter how much gender-bending you do a man can never become a woman.   This is quite important when you’re saying that trans women rapists shouldn’t be locked up with female prisoners, or that trans women MMF fighters shouldn’t be allowed to beat the shit out of female opponents, for example.   This was never discussed because the material reality of it is just incompatible with the metaphorical gender feelings and adamant thinking that support the trans position. It’s impossible to reconcile the two, so here we are.   The rest of the video is just squabbling over the most unedifying behaviour that you find in every corner of the internet. The fact that a lot of rad fems can be unnecessarily rude sometimes doesn’t mean the whole gender critical position is worthless. You wouldn’t want the legitimacy of all trans people to rest on the behaviour of the most violent and unhinged of your lot."
"im a female (not cisgender but i dont care enough to label myself) and ive never been sexually harassed or catcalled or anything. i still get way more respect from gender critical people than a trans woman who has experienced sexual harassment even tho 'you cant be a woman because you havent been harassed or assaulted.' in that case, im not a woman, yet im treated like one by the TERFs"

"there's a lot of philosophical issues with what you're saying here, but that aside obviously every human is a person and that's really what should shine through in general. honestly I don't give a fucking damn about your 'gender' and your biological sex is a totally separate thing which I see many issues with feeling the need to change considering that I agree that how you're born shouldn't dictate who you are but I would add that you shouldn't need to change how you were born to feel good about who you are as well. that's a whole other convo... this whole 'gender' issue is nonsense talk, what we're talking about here is YOU-ness. everybody is in themselves unique and trying to invent terms to blanket statement that fact is fucked in itself. JUST BE YOU AND STOP TRYING TO COIN BOX TERMS. You are biologically X but otherwise you're whoever the fuck you are and that's awesome. Convo should stop right there and we should embrace one another over exactly that."
"I wish you would have gone one step further in your analysis: I 100% agree that the petty cruelty has its origins in disgust, but the question is where do you go from there? Are we just supposed to somehow rewire people so that they no longer feel the visceral gut wrenches they do at seeing Ms Yellowhair? You're right to project the same feelings onto more mundane homophobia, but how are you supposed to get someone who perpetually associates homosexuality with anal sex and feces to not want to vomit? As much as you can work to change the culture, it seems to me that there are a large number of people who will simply never be comfortable on a primal level with some or all forms of queerness.    Let me put it this way - I know worldly, educated, sexually experienced people who are still nauseated by the notion of straight oral sex. They can suppress their disgust all they want, but they still will actively avoid the topic in conversation and prefer to be kept in the dark about it. I don't think you have to do much imagining about their feelings on more heterodox forms of sexuality. While these people are not in the cultural mainstream, the disgust mechanism carries over in the same way. How would you expect them to feel about the normal public goings-on at any major Pride parade? There's obviously a difference between the feeling of disgust and the bullshit that is imposed on queer people legally/physically/financially, but it seems like an inescapable situation for anyone that LiVeS iN a SoCiEtY that being a source of physical disgust to others is not conducive to everyone having a good time."

"Dead ass serious question drinking buddy, (and I want a response from you ContraPoints if you see this), are you a wine person? Cause I can't stand most wines to save my life, and that may strain our one-sided perpetual binge.  Also, what exactly are 'women's issues'? I took two classes for my major that at least touched on feminism, one of them about feminism in politics.   When we talked about increasing women's representation, gender quotas, legislating for women's issues etc. a big question was, aside from being half the country and it's fair (which rarely works historically) was why?   Do you think that more women in politics would fundamentally take the political process and parties in a less corrupt, more cooperative and humane direction, as was the argument of many Suffragettes back in the day once they realized appealing to the idea of it being inherently right and fair wouldn't suffice? Which many modern scholars point towards as still being 'ahhh sorta valid' due to social conditioning of women and girls? Or would they just end up being crooked and ruthless like most everyone else?   What are women's issues? I typically got answers about healthcare, childcare, reproductive rights (generally pro-choice), assault and harassment, etc. Things that tend to play into stereotypes of what women 'should' consider important. As a man, I have shit healthcare so that's an important issue to me. I really want to have kids, so parental leave (and it's almost always framed as maternity leave....like I don't deserve to see my child or some shit), daycare etc. are also important issues. I've had men and women say and do things that have made me genuinely uncomfortable. So what makes these things 'women's issues' specifically?   Should we really frame them as such, since there are probably a lot of men who could actually relate and see these things as important too?   Just wanted your opinion Contra. Cheers love."

But it seems somewhat important - I don't want to identify as male, if all that amounts to is assuming a socially oppressive role. Great vid, I learned a lot <3"

I sometimes hear the 'but if trans women and/or people who perform drag are presenting in a hyper feminine way, aren't they pushing womanhood into a stereotypical direction' line. Now if I ever hear that again, I will point people with that opinion to this video!"
"I like this video, and yeah I watched it to the credits. You're taking an interesting approach to this that I haven't seen or heard many trans people do. And I really appreciate that! And not to kiss your ass but only because you brought it up: you do look really good. I'm kind of newly radfem since just a few months or so, while still having half a foot in the trans community, hence why I'm here. I'm fine with the term 'terf' (and I agree it's not a slur, unless it's said to lesbians for the reason they're lesbians, then it's pretty much a homophobic slur, or used as one) although I think it's silly and incorrect, which is why I'll mostly be using radfem instead here. I like to jokingly call myself a terf, though. This is gonna get long, but I tried to keep it short... in vain.  My background is I used to be mostly transmedicalist but not very strictly so at all. I was fine with nb and didn't have a huge problem with non-dysphoric trans people. I still acknowledge that some trans people don't have dysphoria while some cis people do, cause it's not so black and white. I was part of the trans community for a solid decade as I was transitioning ftm cause I truly believed with my entire essense that I was a trans man since my teens. I also thought I was bisexual.  So then wtf happened and how did I turn terfy? I detransitioned, and on that way it was. Basically I started questioning gender because when my dysphoria disappeared I no longer felt I had any internal sense of gender, but for the first time ever saw myself as fully a woman, and loving it. I needed answers, and radfem had them. About 6 months later I realised I'm only attracted to other afab people, regardless of their genders. You know, like a terfy lesbian who doesn't like dick but could maybe get down with a trans guy, but is primarily into cis women. That didn't exactly fit the 'attraction goes to gender, not sex' view I had previously believed. Again, I was confused. And again, radfem had the answers. And an amazing lesbian community that surely got me hooked.   Shortly after that I considered myself no longer adhering to the trans community's views and joined radfem. *But* I still respect and care about trans people.  Because I still remember what it was like to have gender dysphoria and feeling like I really was a man in my past. And because I also remember what other trans people have told me about their experiences back then. I know that femininity and masculinity is not what makes trans people think they're trans, because I was a gnc trans man. And I know exactly what it feels like to 'feel' that you're of a gender different from your sex and willing to defend it to your death.  But I'm still not quite on your side of the argument just because I have a deeper understanding of it than most cis women and can regurgitate my former beliefs well. The way I see it...  is that at the core it's dysphoria that makes trans people think they should be of the opposite sex. And that's pretty much it. It's a belief that comes from that suffering or disagreement with your own body. However, I can also believe that trans people are the only ones who do have an internal sense of gender, cause it seems cis people typically don't. But regardless of who has it or what, to me it's just a belief, like believing god is real. I don't believe gender is real, although I absolutely understand that's what other people truly believe, and I respect that those who do, simply do.  Personally I've no issues with anyone transitioning (including non-dysphoric people), using the pronouns people want, and just being a decent human being about it, ya know. And actually I know that it's really only a loud but small minority of trans women who act like predatory creeps towards lesbians and women in general. Some actually do act like that, and it's the stuff of nightmares for me, but I don't think most trans women are like that at all. On that point, as with much else, I take an individual approach.   But I'm really not grossed out by most trans women. A lot of them are really beautiful, including non-passing ones. But even if not, so what. Beauty isn't everything. But I think that I see beauty in them a lot because I see myself in them. Not that I am, but I resemble. And to me seeing a badly covered stubble on the face of a very beautiful person who looks like a woman otherwise, or a deep voice, or receeding hairline, etc, is comforting. I usually can't see myself in other cis women anymore.  Also even I don't like the company of transphobic radfems (we call them 'rudefems' btw) and I specifically can't stand those who call trans people's medical transitions 'mutilations' cause well... that applies to me too, cause I was on testosterone and had top surgery, and I don't like being called mutilated for that!"

"The idea that you can preclude anyone from being a woman because they haven't had 'the universal female experience' is so fucking ridiculous anyway. There are all kinds of experiences that women have and some that a LOT of women have, and those experiences can be taken seriously and looked at deeply without converting them into a gatekeeping method. The fact that lots of women have been sexually harassed at a young age is a Big Deal, but there's a big leap from there to imagining that it's a Requirement for being a 'legitimate woman.' Girlhood isn't a monolithic experience. Even if we were just talking about Cis girlhood, THAT isn't a monolithic experience. Girlhoods are radically different - often directly opposite to each other in the very features we are told are definitive - depending on a lot of other circumstances; wealth, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, gender conformity, ability, and - yes - cis-status.  Some women, like Natalie, didn't have girlhoods because they were not, by their own self knowledge, girls when they were children.  ...But some women did have girlhoods which were made a particular flavour of difficult by all the people calling them boys. That isn't NOT a girlhood just because it doesn't look like a cis-girl's girlhood. Just like how a lot of those same TERFs' descriptions of universal girlhood include things like 'not being allowed to get your dress dirty, being kept inside to play with dolls while your brother gets to play outside in the forest, being raised to be pretty and helpless and dependent and decorative' which is actually a VERY SPECIFIC niche of middle class white girlhood and has no relatability for, say, sweatshop girls."

While this is not exactly a ringing cry for solidarity, it is a lot closer to one then the stuff she came out with later.     Basically, Germaine Greer was a one hit wonder. Nothing she said since has been relevant or interesting. But she keeps frantically trying to shock people to stay in the spotlight. At least that's my take."

"I'm sorry, that such a high percentage of people asking these questions do so in bad faith, because there IS a certain amount of people, who genuinely need to hear nuanced explanations at least once simply to understand a new, foreign subject. For me, personally, this was truly an enlightening experience and I'm very grateful for it."
"Fuck video games. Actually, fuck all games."
"excellent video, thank you for making this"
"Mmm.  I wish this was a more nuanced video because I am someone who is gender critical but I am not one to be nasty to other people ; there is no need to, plus it's rude.  I do not feel disgust or view transwomen/men  as less than. I just think the concept of gender as we know it is horse poop, which puts me in a pickle when it comes to the logic of trans-identities.  I am disappointed as I have heard some good things about ContraPoints, but (this being my first time watching ContraPoints) what I got was seemingly dismissive, mocking, patronizing, and funny commentary.  It seemed like the responses were delivered in the same tone and manner as what was being criticized.  I appreciate the cascade of funny,  but most of it seemed to be cloaked  in condescension.  This was supposed to be towards those who are genuinely curious,  right? Eh, maybe some other time."
"I am so here for the TERFs pooping their pants in shame and embarrassment, trying to justify their stupid hatred."
"I don't know who you are and I didn't know much about this subject but this was a complete, well thought out, fantastically delivered analysis of a subject that most people have trouble understanding and I appreciate your work. Less noise and more knowledge and we might even make social media worth the time we spend in it. Thank you."
"She’s actually so right like sometimes I don’t agree with contrapoimts but I sooo dooo rn"
"First time watching her.  Is she always this amazing?  If I had a fraction of her skills in communication and presentation, capitalism and the patriarchy would already be dismantled.  Now onto the capitalist one.  Happy TDOV (and can that just be everyday)."
"Great work! The style and humour of your videos is absolutely brilliant and you've raised many points that I've never considered beforehand which has made me rethink my previous views and ideas on the matter. Thank you!"
"She is so smart and articulate. What a blessing. <3"
"Natalie: This is for women only Me, an intellectual: * identifies as a woman for 33 minutes and 49 seconds *"
"'my inner rad femme sways in a gentle victorious samba'  your cadence is always so gorgeous and abstracttt"
"A  real thought I had as a cis gender women, 'Am I less women because I have never been sexually harassed or even cat called? Is there something wrong with me?' Answer: Swear word no!! But some conversations are really focus on those negative experiences men sometimes inflict on women as a pivotal part of femininity. As if it's some weird rite of passage in a girl's puberty to get unwanted attention from men.   I don't know, I think my privilege is spilling everywhere but I really appreciated your video. How men (or any gender) treat me does not make me a woman."
"Thank you so much Natalie, I really appreciate your videos. I thoroughly enjoy the beautiful art you create, and I love learning about your trans experience. I think literally EVERYONE would benefit from watching your videos. And um holy shit your makeup looks STUN-NING here, jaysus!"
"'9 times out of 10 that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities'... I don't think it's fair to assume intention unless of course you can read minds  I think I understand your points but I also think I understand the goal of creating a society where people can present and live however they want... A world where feminine and masculine fluidity is seen as normal.   and maybe in such a world there is less of a need to transition. Maybe it's as you say  a 'post modern Utopia'. But if we were in a world where people are free to live how they want without fear of judgement or alienation would that lessen the pressure of fitting into that box. Or am I misunderstanding gender disphoria and it's a fundamental conflict of living with ones own biological body parts?"
"Don't destroy all video games! I just started Sekiro!"
"this vid is incredible ily"
"Forgive me if what I'm about to say was a little quick to judgement, being that this is the first video of yours I've seen, but please don't tell men to leave at the beginning of this video. Like I get that you're trying to create a safe environment for your crowd, one absent of troll, but as a cis male this was very enlightening. I've never been against transgendered individuals, though I've never fully accepted them either since I was ignorant to the issue. Many of the questions you hit on, most notably the adaptation of gender stereotypes, were questions I had and never had adequately answered until now. Also Fan-Fucking-tastic job of actually arguing hard questions, not easy contentless questions."
"One of the best things about these videos is the comment sections. There's the odd scumbag, obviously, but it's largely people being kind and appreciative. The signs of a culture changing. Thanks Natalie!"
"Pearls before swine...literally. Please don't stop. I suspect you will eventually mention William S. Burroughs, and he's so easy to attack on so many levels...but...whatever, let's hear your take. No joke, I do want to hear it, but in your own time.  To be clear, I think he's possibly the most important writer of the 20th century. Even Samuel Clemens would have shut the fuck up in awe. And that's how I see you.  You seem like Burroughs. And that's no bad thing."
"Happy Trans Day of Visibility! 💙💗💙"
"One thing I always look forward to with your videos is whatever elaborate stage makeup look you're going to attach to a character. It's not the main draw by any stretch, but it's still something fun. You've outdone yourself with your TERF self character; it looked awesome. Anyway, loving the vids :)"
"The Nazis tried to save us from this dystopian future nightmare!!!!! They stopped this Jewish degeneracy for three generations yet here we are again because the Allies were the villains of WWII"
"very epic film (vef)!!!"
"So what do terfs think about ftm trans men?"
"Can someone explain the 'yesallgamers' reference to me? Apparently I've missed something there."
"oh, by the way. you know who else don't experience humilation and shape for periods? Infertile cis women."
"Wait, hang on. I just realized this was released on the anniversary of Stephanie Yellowhair's passing. Oh my heart. I guess there's nothing to add except - say it with me - 'Excuse my beauty'."
"I love what you do so much - thank you. You will never know how much you helped me."
"I'm Ahi tuna you're Mackerel sweaty. Take a fucking sip"
"She has a very soothing voice, I love how she pronounces certain words, like 'liquor store', she is a fighting Queen.  Also, Theryn <3"
"I wonder if you'd apply this logic to trans-culturalism and people who dress like they're black and tan themselves darker and claim they identify with the black community. It seems kind of asinine to make this argument unless you support the caricature of gender or culture.   The trans community can do whatever they want to do. I believe they should be allowed in all non-competitive OR non-prison spaces. But to pretend like, 'Oh honey, we're in this together,' when you choose to try to be a woman is kind of ridiculous. A lot of women just want to exist without having to conform to gender stereotypes. I agree that referring to trans-women as 'it' or claiming they have it easy is stupid as hell. Or excluding them from spaces where gender segregation isn't vital. But you are a MRA if you think for a second that you choosing to wear makeup or 'act like a girl' gives you the same experience as being born into a sex that is treated like a second class citizen. It's just silly.   And yes I watched the whole video. I enjoy your content and I think a lot of your points are strong- but dismissing gender stereotypes being displayed by a man to appear like a woman as not being a legit argument is nonsense. It would be no different for me to talk, dress, and look stereotypically black, claim I'm black, and not have any of the upbringing to even justify that behavior. It's just stereotyping when you weren't born with that culture."
"That ending was killer. You’ve always been someone who strives to reason people out of their bigotry. So when you told everyone that you can’t reason people out of their transphobia and gave them in your last line one big “fuck you”, I was like “oooo gurl snapped!”"
"I'm a little afraid to go looking for the entirety of that COPS episode, what was Stephanie Yellowhair being arrested for?"
"As always, an art goddess extraordinaire. I fucking LOVE your videos, they're a perfect combination of creativity and intellectual awesomeness."
"You look amazing as always Natalie. And your videos are always so well thought out, interesting, funny and articulate. I usually find it a little hard to sit through 30+ minute videos, but with you I sit from beginning to end, absorbing every word and thinking about the ideas and subjects you talk about after the video has long finished. You are one of my favourite youtubers, keep being awesome!"
"What’s the Jewish question"
"just sending some love over to you from berlin. <3 thanks, natalie. I love your videos and always refer to them when people should educate themselves on a certain topic. got great feedback so far!"
"Natalie, thank you for being out here and fighting the good fight. It wasn't Philosophy Tube, or Hbomberguy, or Shaun, or any of the rest that brought me around to being a full-throated supporter of trans-rights, it was you. It was your humorous, nuanced style and willingness to grapple with the questions non-trans people have that led me to the ideological place I'm in today and you have my thanks. Your voice has power."
"She SNAPPED and the world was never the same"
"Loved the last bit.  Trans women are beautiful in every sense of the word."
"Gender, shmender, the only thing that counts is ANDREW YANG 2020"
"First and foremost you are a human being.  And that is beautiful and amazing in and of itself."
"That’s a cute outfit. And personally those women who are pissed at trans people just need to get a life. Trans people’s lives seem hard enough without us cis women trying to put our uterus on a pedestal to their exclusion. And yeah, a few things suck about being a woman. But there are also advantages we have over men, such as the fact that it’s acceptable for us to express our emotions."
"3:43 is that background green-screen or a painting? looks really good"
"Lmao 'if women are oppressed why are most combat victims men' is the EASIEST question to answer. The answer is 'men brought that on themselves. This has historically been and mostly still is a intra masculine issue. Men killing other men has nothing to do with women and definitely doesn't imply that women are oppressing men, it just shows that men are fucked up in general and that includes to eachother'"
"Shania? YEE HAW!"
"Hey if you wanna be transgender, why don't move to Transylvania! Hahahaha got'em"
"Germain Greer really wrote a gripping paragraph tho    What u think about Trans athletes?"
"I agree with most of this video except the point of TERF not being a slur. I personally think it’s definitely used that way towards women who aren’t even feminists, or afab lesbians who aren’t sexually attracted to transwomen. Just look at how Ariana Grande was dogpiled for that one music video she made and how a bunch of people started calling her a terf because of all the vagina imagery. I also think gender critical women DO go after any woman who they see is “enforcing the gender binary”, especially when it comes to the modeling industry, or the sex work industry. Overall, it was a good video, but I do think in order to have a healthy discussion about sensitive topics, we should try to not only represent both sides as fairly as possible, but also the people who also don’t really fall into any particular side but are still affected by these topics to an extent.   Also, try not to worry so much about the socialization aspect, Natalie. Even women are socialized differently according to the individual. I honestly can’t say I’ve ever been catcalled as a 9-year old either."
"The Germaine Greer quote of her cruel treatment of a transwoman fan who found value and inspiration in her work really struck me.  Imagine being in the fan's shoes - meeting this feminist thinker whose work had inspired and moved you deeply - only to be completely crushed when you read THAT later and realize she was talking about YOU. Then watching as Greer went on to make a major agenda of constantly barraging people like you with hate.  Imagine how utterly soul-crushing that would be.   It's also worth noting that Germaine Greer has some VERY dodgy rapist-enabling & colonialist--dogwhistle-racist opinions about rape.  TERFism and soft normalization of white male rapists (while of course demonizing nonwhite males as inherent rapists) are major pillars of the brand of exclusionary 2nd wave 'white feminism' that people like Greer spew that reinforces the rape culture, racism, and queerphobia of white supremacism."
"This won’t add much to the conversation but holy shit did she look good in this video. Like, I felt I had to mention it because she looked so good. That cute ass dress and hat with those earrings and makeup couldn’t be appreciated with just one like."
"The aesthetics of this video, oh waow. I love it. Funny and relevant as usual."
"What's royally fucked up is that the disgust response you talk about is empathy related. You find it disgusting when your parents kiss because you put yourself in the position of one of those parents and its gross. You find it disgusting when two ugly gross people kiss, and many cis people find it disgusting seeing gay people kiss. It's animal brain you're right, but I as forward thinking as I feel I am when it comes to these LGBTQ rights I still have to hide my disgust response to two guys kissing. I hate that i'm wired like that."
"who is the voice in the background?"
"I'm disappointed that you have such a low esteem for the trades, and our sense of courtesy and mutual respect when it comes to using the pronouns you prefer."
"An absolute masterpiece."
"Re: gender neutral medical language -- some intersex people can be pregnant and may menstruate."
"Transition into male (TIM) = Trans man Transition into female (TIF) = trans woman This is how trans people and allies can switch up the opposition's hate into a useful conversation simplifier."
"great video + content but your skin looks so flawless and glowy what highlighter are you using????"
"In response to what you say around 20:20, I'm more than happy to publicly admit my attraction to your beauty, intelligence and wit."
"6:22 I've been trying to ask those questions seriously, with no trolling intended, for quite a while. I think a lot of people are in the same group. I've been watching your videos for a while now to try and learn more and it's really discouraging to hear you just call it trolling. Maybe it's because the people that speak the loudest are the trolls. I think a lot of people share the same ignorance as I do and really are just learning about this issue for the first time.   I really appreciate you answering those questions at face value and I hope you understand the majority of us are truly just curious on the topic and are just trying to educate ourselves on the topic.   I really hope you get around to talking about Tim Pool's conversation on Joe Rogan's Podcast though at some point soon. It was really annoying hearing him say garbage shit to the Twitter executive such as... 'Well you're excluding an idea from your platform that is primarily conservative, so you're picking sides!!!!' and no one being able to counter him properly (probably out of fear of losing people on their platform), when most of the 'conservative ideas' are incredibly transphobic.   It was akin to saying 'Well you don't allow people with racist ideas and that mainly exists in conservative circles, YOU'RE EXCLUDING ONE SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION! BIASED LEFTIES, REEEEEEEEE.' Like for some reason he just doesn't get how fucked up and dumb he sounds, yet the people commenting on the video ATE THAT SHIT UP.   Thanks for being so informative, you're sexy and so are your thoughts."
"A new contrapoints video is awesome! But a new contrapoints video on TERFs is the height of awesomeness."
"I’m not shamed to say that I like Natalie intimately, she’s awesome! Woo! 😘💝😍✌️"
"3:40 'Ugh, this is agony... I'm a biological woman, trapped in the body of a male narcicist!' That got me good LMAO. 8:32 '...i'm not real, and not valid' Oh god they just keep coming. 15:03 This is too perfect, i can't help but smile ear-to-ear. 24:47 God that's so dark yet i would totally listen to that if it was a full parody."
"this was great, and natalie, as a butch lesbian, we certainly can find a place of solidarity. write the terfs to shit <3"
"How do you manage to always find the perfect words?"
"❤️"
"I gotta say, your hoarse “”masculine”” laugh is adorable"
"IF IM PHYSICALLY  ATTRACTED TO YOU DOES THAT MAKE ME GAY?"
"There’s something incredibly endearing about your smile/laugh, also seems quite feminine."
"I like you talking about the disgust because I hear it all the time but if you talk about it with people you actually know then you have to admit to them that you feel disgusting and then perhaps you are and I know that's not neccesarily right but you know what I mean?"
"Tried to like this video more than twice :p love your content <3"
"I always enjoy watching your videos and love admiring your fantabulous outfits, CP."
"It's so funny how they claim to hate the patriarchy but they mirror it so completely."
"I would Netflix and eat ice cream with her. And bacon extra cheese pizza. :P 💝"
"I'm a dude....I'm sorry"
"Is there a car alarm going off during the rad fem sections?"
"I love her vids. They are so smart and funny 💝. And her voice is almost trance like :P"
"I love that you kept the laugh after the tea pot 😂 😂"
"AS A TRANS MAN, i really love it when terfs spit out the 'trans men are lost lesbians' narrative. i am over here thirsting over dudes and only dudes, and i REALLY wanna hear the rationalization there."
"Incredible video, amazing points, very well-articulated as always. Also, “No one knows what it’s like to be a sad tran” absolutely killed me"
"Natalie, I love your videos. I’ve been a lurker for years and wanted to finally comment and tell you how wonderful you are. I love your makeup and outfits! You’re gorgeous, informative, and you make excellent arguments. I eagerly await your updates in my subscription feed and I hope you get everything you want in life and more. Keep up the excellent work and stay sassy! Love you😘"
"On top of everything, that top is the TOPS!"
"Natalie I love you!! Woo!! 😘💝 I want you in my life 😍. Your a 10 in my book my beautiful songbird of love! 😘"
"No not the vidiya games! D^:"
"Why can't TIM mean trans men and TIF mean a trans woman? I feel like that would just be so much easier. I'm more in the know on trans things than my bf, so when I try to talk about a trans man/woman, he has trouble immediately sorting out who they were then and now. It makes me wish we had cute easily understandable terms like tims and tifs. Honestly, a trans person who identifies as male *is* a Tim and vice versa."
"Natalie told me to comment... So... The Nutcracker as the backing track on a video about TERFs is the classiest, most subtle and refined dick joke I've ever heard."
"Fuck yeah, sister!"
"'Listen sweaty'  Thanks for doing that"
"J'adore that red dress. And, if I weren't trying to over-signify my masculinity as a trans man to avoid being misgendered, I'd love to wear one like it."
"I feel this whole conversation is completely meaningless because there's absolutely no consequences here - nobody can stop you living as a woman just like you can't stop anyone from thinking that you're _not_ a woman, especially not when nearly all the arguments on both sides boil down to 'I feel a certain way therefore that's how it should be'. Nobody on either side is giving any statistics or studies, it's all just academic theory that's been bastardized toward whatever angle they're pitching. It's your word against theirs in the courtroom of who-gives-a-fuck.  This is the problem with every damn ContraPoints video: everybody talks about how great these are but this person doesn't actually _say anything_ most of the time. There's a great flow of ideas and a lot of big words and fancy concepts being bandied about but no actually substance to any of it and nothing ever truly gets proven or resolved in any way. It's the equivalent of philosophically arguing why God made certain atoms are lighter than others - _who gives a steaming shit_ ?   Like, I really don't see the appeal of these videos or value beyond wanting to know the opinions of a twenty-something American trans woman and her 'struggles' and honestly, I have see nothing relevant or interesting about that. Now stop recommending this crap to me, Youtube. Pretty sure I blocked this channel anyway, wtf..."
"'It's a Chanukatastrophe--' (snort).  I love it when Natalie can't keep a straight face."
"32:54 It's PC run AIPAC!"
"'Is Anita Bryant even dead? _Scholars remain divided_ '   *_I can'T BREATHE_*"
"I feel a little guilty for replying to a comment and not commenting on the excellent video itself, so here goes; I found your channel very recently and basically just kinda watched everything you've made all at once. It really helped push me towards simply being a better person all around; you're a talented woman with a killer wardrobe and an incredible well of strength that I'm certain i couldn't match, and you've helped me connect better with the trans people in my own life without pestering them for detailed explanations of what has been made clear by you are often painful life moments and experiences. what you do is wonderful, valuable and beautiful, and i hope you continue to do so for many more videos to come."
"I am so honored to live in the same city as you. YAS QUEEN."
"Does it still have its benis?"
"I am tired and a little drunk, and gender politics fascinate me. Prepare yourself for a long ass comment. I apologise for nothing.   Gender is a mixture of hormones, chromosomes, and the psychological need to feel as though we have a role in society. Humans are social creatures and we need to find a way to connect to other people while still retaining our sense of individuality and feeling important to our social group. So we gravitate towards people who have similar interests to us and we allow those people to influence how we think and what we do- we are socially conditioned by them. THIS DOESNT HAVE TO BE A BAD THING! Some social conditioning is good. 'Don't steal' for example, or 'be polite to others'. Social conditioning becomes a problem when we start to punish those who do not conform whilst holding our standard of conformity to an impossible standard that may be out with the person's control. For example our standard of womanhood might be described as 'be feminine, be more emotional and empathetic, have a vagina'. The reason this is problematic is that a) not everyone will agree on these standards and will try to argue or use shame to get others to conform to their particular set of standards, causing inter group fightung and b) some of these standards are completely out with a person's control (For example being born with a vagina) so they are immediately excluded through no fault of their own (which is bullshit!)  In order to solve these problems we need to 1) ask ourselves what our standards for womanhood actually are 2) ask ourselves if any of these standards are unrealistic or out with an individual's control and 3) bear in mind that different people may have different standards of womanhood to us and be willing to acknowledge that   I'm a (cis) woman and I like make up and boys and fluffy animals and knitting and dresses. Being a woman is a really important part of how I see myself in the world and in relation to my friends and family. I'm also a feminist and I'm happy to embrace the fact that other people see womanhood differently and have had it weaponised against them. And that sucks for them- but does that therefore mean I should give up my own experience of womanhood, which for me has been formative and generally positive? If the answer to that is no, then logically you must therefore come to the conclusion that nor should trans women. And if the answer is yes- then you are imposing your standards for womanhood on me. how would you feel if I did that to you? If I told you that just because I find contentment and empowerment in my femininity, that all females should embrace their femininity in the same way or they aren't really women?  In conclusion being a woman means different things to different people and it should! And Its totally ok to find people who have things in common with us and agree with the way we understand social situations, but it's not ok to impose impossible standards on others."
"big oof on that straw man of gender abolishing. bigger oof on you hitting someone. I also can't tell if your pro trans med or against it given your more recent stuff i bet your for it."
"Trans people are ill and need help. F>M aren't male, M>F aren't female, mutilation and drugging doesn't treat the dysphoria. No-one should have to face the difficulties trans people face and a solution would be worth more than just ignoring the problem. The discussion shouldn't be this pendulum swinging back and forth in both psychotic extremes."
"I am really interested in your use of 'Stolen Valor' and explanation that membership into this group, (Trans-people, women, veterans) is won only through suffering."
"Paused at 5m to say thanks for picturing 2 very transfobic and sexist presidents that seem to be ready to buddy up and make the world straight white male again."
"yo was that Natalie doing that aussie accent in the intro???  FML I've lived in Australia since 2002 and I still can't do the accent ;_; every time I try I sound like I'm taking the piss :("
"FiNally a Video !Oh My God"
"'So if transwomen being masculine is bad, and transwomen being feminine is bad, then there's really no way that transwomen could behave that TERFs would accept.'  So close to self awareness.  Yes Contra.  Everything they do would be considered bad.  Because TERFs consider transwomen to be men, and TERFs hate men.  They are anti male bigots.  The 'trans' part is incidental to them.  Thanks for nailing them on the anti male hate though.  Oh wait, you didn't even try to do that.  Because you're a feminist and '...Anti male hate?  Eeeeh whats the big deal am I right'"
"The only reason I didn't give this a standing ovation was that my dad was sleeping in the next room.  Bravi, bravi, bravissimi!"
"Okay so I've heard it used enough to get an idea, but can't ever find a proper dictionary explanation. What does it mean precisely to 'stand' someone? I've heard it used almost exclusively in the queerosphere so is it something more LGBTQ related?"
"When can we date"
"I'm in medical school, and I work at a hospital that has a very sick cohort of patients. I often see patients in heart, lung, liver, and kidney failure. I have seen patients deteriorate and die. The same 'lizard brain' that compels people to hate and disgust, has the potential to compel people to deep compassion. When a patient is suffering and dying, I believe that most people are more than happy to bring them any bit of comfort. Earlier this year, a patient came out to me as transgender. When I told the rest of the team, all of them had no problem making this sick person feel a little more human and cared for. My hope is that there is some way of scaling this kind of learned love."
"I'd like to see you go more into the importance (or lack thereof) of disgust and how valid (or invalid) it is for informing someone's worldview. It seemed like you just said 'they find trans people disgusting' and left the viewer to assume that's an invalid reason to dislike trans people, but I'm not really convinced by that. Why is something or someone being disgusting not a valid reason to dislike it or them? I understand that your criticism of TERFs comes down to them hiding their true feelings about trans people behind a radical feminist smokescreen, so that's fine, but I think there's a discussion to be had beyond that. I already knew TERFs are disgusted by trans people. When you read their content, you instinctively understand that. I want to be convinced there's something wrong with disgust."
"Some women don’t even get their period at all"
"Woah this video is amazing, I think it's the best video you've made yet!"
"You're videos are excellent and your positions well thought out. I'm such a fan. Your preference for socialism is unfortunate, but otherwise I think you're brilliant."
"Nails and makeup are cultural signifiers, hm. But you got to admit it reinforces... ah fuck it. Lets venture out together and scare alt right men, this shit can wait."
"Not in a very good commenting mood, but another fantastic video Natalie, I just adore you and your work"
"Cis male here. Its hard to both not sound transphobic and not sexist at the same time, but I would totally take ContraPoints out."
"In terms of not using gendered medical terminology: the other reason that it benefits CIS WOMEN as well as trans men and women to say 'people who mentrate' or 'pregnant people' or 'people with vaginas' when talking about something specific to those things, is it also recognizes the cis women who don't have periods/have had a hysterectomy/don't have a vagnia . These people exist and to imply that ALL women can get pregnant implies that women who can't (who are no doubt struggling with this reality already) are somehow less of a woman. I love the gender neutral medical terms becasue they're SPECIFIC only to the people that the issue concerns. Like 'people with cervixes should get a pap smear every 3 years' makes it clear that if you've had a hysterectomy or don't have a cervix that you don't need to get pap smears. This may be obvious to some but many teens don't know what a pap smear even is. It's just clearer and more informative than 'all women should get pap smears to be healthy'."
"Checked out the Gender Critical subreddit. Pretty horrendous opinions and encouraging each other to express their own hatreds for trans people. They also seem pretty horrified by the amount of Contrapoints fans whove flooded to the subreddit haha"
"Liked. This is my Comment. Already Subscribed."
"While I don't love the term 'menstruator', I can appreciate why it's being used.  It's more inclusive to transmen who menstruate, as well as not being exclusive to women who DON'T menstruate."
"She and Olly had way too much fun filming this."
"Mother of Dragons, please tell this lowly one where you bought your red floral dress."
"ugh. we stan an absolute queen"
"I only recently heard about the Gender Critical concept after it was mentioned here, and boy, their subreddit and internet forums in general make for some depressing reads. I was finding myself largely agreeing with most of their tenets as I was sifting through them, but then out of the blue they'd be dishing out vitriol used towards trans folk that I would expect an alt-righter or someone along those lines to use. It was baffling to see how people could act inclusive towards just about every marginalized group one could imagine, but would then foam at the mouth in seething anger and bigotry the moment the transgender topic popped up."
"What is also Incredibly disgusting about TERFs is that they Dare mask their transphobia with Feminism when so often they're spouting the same shit that feminism should fight against!! Let women have a hairy body, let women have big hands and long shoulders and let them take silly pictures in nonsense poses!! Admit it you just hate trans women and more often than not you're not the biggest fan of cis women either!! You're just a bigot who doesn't respect women and trans people!!"
"Not real???"
"I know there is like an 'average' cis woman socialization and there are things that most cis women experience, but looking just a little close there are just huge differences as well. Sometimes I can't identify with aspects of the average cis woman early upbringing and socialization, my parents had good paying jobs and wanted me to grow up as a leader, they got me legos and science kits, they always encouraged me to be loud and proud, to participate and take leadership in class. Of course I also experienced parts of the 'girl upbringing' but the thing is that there are many aspects that may change between early socialization of cis women from different backgrounds.  A rich woman will have a very different experience than a poor woman, the country and culture, racism , everything plays a role. Recognizing this differences is extremely important  and that isn't what separates us, it is important to acknowledge some women had different, sometimes even way way tougher, upbringings and that doesn't invalidate anyone's womanhood, prejudice separates our fight. Here in Brazil, one of the countries that kill LGBT people the most, a lot of poor trans girls, when they are feminine presenting from an early age, get kicked out of home and driven to sex work when they are as little as 12 years old. More than 90 percent of trans women here are sex workers due to lack of opportunity, prejudice and being abandoned at a young age, if that isn't absurdly opposite to a cis guy's social upbringing and reality I don't know what is."

"Hi Natalie I loved this video, but I did wanna say that I believe transmedicalism is less about intense agonizing pain and more about dysphoric being a prerequisite to being trans"
"The cop at the end was most probably a douchebag. But 'excuse my beauty'? Nope, that person being arrested is clearly *not* beautiful. Imho, this is what bugs people the most about gender-non-conformists: they twist the meanings of words and lie.  'Man' and 'woman' mean something - then some people come up and say 'that's not what you're supposed to mean by those words, you bigot!', 'That's not how you're supposed to think!'... If you tell me I'm not supposed to use a hammer to work with nails, without giving me a better instrument somehow, I'd be pissed.  Gay marriage is overrated. Seriously though, the solution we as a society settled it with was like hitting a fly with a cannon ball. It drove homophobia up, if anything. And potentially planted a bomb for a future cultural backlash.      Liked."

Alternatively it could just be a choice made because you feel like it but that wouldnt really validate gender dysphoria because it seems to conflict with the idea that there was something about you your sex conflicted with"

"Also my opinion is not that cis women find trans women dangerous, I think it’s internal misogyny that all our life we’ve been taught to compete with each other and now cis women see another ‘threat’ to their safe territorial space."
"I haven't commented on a YouTube video in years but this video was amazing and I clapped and cheered audibly many times. The segment about internalizing the disgust others feel for you in particular spoke to me as a lesbian who has never hated gay people and believes in LGBT rights but had found it so hard to be okay with myself being a lesbian. Thank you so much for this video, please don't ever stop being you and spilling that nuanced tea, even if you get dragged for it"
"Hell yeah terfs are trash. Stand with your sisters not just your cisters you six piece chicken mcnobodies."
"Just seeing those posts from the terf subreddit, it seems like they're a weird sort of misogynist. They are literally mocking people being feminine. Like, in an odd sort of 'mean girl' way. It's weird, like not every cis woman is super dainty either, so...are they gonna mock their 'big hands' or 'hairiness' too? Just....twisted..."
"Hi Natalie you probably won’t see this. I just wanted to say i am so thankful for someone who knows how to dress beautifully and lecture on issues that need to be talked about. You have taught me about climate change and that i should avoid men who like Jordan Peterson as well as making me want to copy one of your looks. Probably be downvoted but you’re a style icon to me and an prove the point that you can be both beautiful and intelligent,. In your red get up, you look like an extra in a Sofia Coppola film and yeah I’m gonna source your red kimono."
"The thing that I never understand is gender other than male and female. Being MtF or FtM has always made sense to me, but when ze/zim/zer and non binary genders came about online in 2014 (or thereabouts. Memory is not infallible.), I couldn't figure it out. Often I have heard from individuals the great deal of pain that came in their lives; people who are vengeful and bitter. That is not to say I haven't seen any that don't speak from pain; I have seen a fair few. But what makes sense to me is to pick one or the other biologic sex/gender--- and then just not give a fuck about gender stereotypes! Present as you wish but keep regular terms and pronouns, and then live without having to create plenty of new terms. Even changing them on the daily if one should wish but the creating of new terms--- especially when out of spite--- seems to just make more pain in this world. I don't know if you can give me a hand in that."
"wait who's that behind the camera"
"I love your content it is gripping, irreverent and just loveable.   I'm not familiar with TERF thinking and deeply want everyone to live their personhood and identify to the fullest.   I can acknowledge my privilege as being cis in many ways. However,  I would be lying if I said my gender identity was easy.   For much of childhood and adolescence I daydreamed not about being a boy, but of getting to live the life of one. And yeah maybe back in the Lilith Fair days you  could call me butch. It happened and it did ruin my day.   It was just easier to PREFORM the gender I was born into. And by college I was wearing fit and flare dresses and heels to class.   In grad school and in the job world it's a tight rope of performance. Dress like a woman. Wear makeup or G-d forbid someone will think I have the flu. But then lower my voice to be taken seriously, learn to talk sports and maybe try golf. Basically try to be more if a dude sometimes...super fun game show it isn't.  These are small aggressions compared to actual harassment and assault (yes both happened).   Yet, the reason I bring this all up is to say even though I'm Cis. I still have to think and act on gender ideals set not by myself and I despise a system that puts us all into these tiny boxes.   I feel like sometimes (not always!) Prillviage is a trade off.   I can't even begin to imagine the feeling of being born into the wrong body or the dating issues or safety risks my trans sisters go through.   And, yet if tomorrow I woke up passable as a man it would be liberating in so many ways. From the outside it can look as though trans women have been willing to trade some external prillviage they might have gotten as passable men. (Perhaps not unlike racial passing ....a historical issue I know little about, but perhaps there are parallels).  In an age where reproductive rights are under attack and a known pussy grabber is in the Oval...perhaps TERFS are fustrated and wrongly coming to the conclusion that this is all a zero sum game.   This isn't an argument. Just a moment to reach out and share and throw out the arms of solidarity to ALL my sisters.   Also, I would be really curious to see a video on gender performance that includes cis women. Especially, with so many IDW icksters insisting that lipstick in the cubicle is a call for sexual harassment."
"I am a cis woman (maybe) I was catcalled a few times but all before the age of 12. I haven’t been catcalled sense then."
"Great vid 10/10 would never watch cops again"

"Natalie in the white robes of an angel as she talks to us from the white light of heaven is an aesthetic"
"You give bad answers to your own poorly asked questions framed in a way that justifies your own viewpoint.  I am not trying to be insulting, and I am watching your video in an attempt to get both sides of the argument.   But it is what it is.  I will still leave a like in an attempt to show no hard feelings."
"I have a problem with science deniers. A woman is an adult human female, trans women don't fit that description, hence they are called trans women. I'm happy to treat trans women like natal women but don't make me agree with you in that you think you're just like me, because you're not. I'm not a bigot for acknowledging that biology is real. I don't know your experience and don't claim to to so, so don't claim you know what it's like to be a natal woman. I also have a problem with the mainly trans women who call anyone who doesn't want to date/fuck them are transphobic, and with self ID that gives males access to single sex female spaces without having ever seen a therapist it gone through any kind of transition."

"i really like you natalie, and i find you a wholesome activist, artist, thinker, etc.i am gender critical, i think that this vid was partially great, and that's because this issue gets in your nerves, i think you missed some points or you purposely caricaturized them yes, there is mockery and cruelty amongst women and MEN who describe transpeople that way, and yes also hate, that is transphobia, but not all gender critical people refers on those terms to trans people, its not hate what fuels me, for example, i don't feel you as a  woman, and of course, not all women have the same shared experience, but we do have a thing in common, all of us, rich, poor, pick a color, old, young etc. we are thought by men, conceptualized by the patriarchy as property, we are for men, to reproduce men, to enrich men, you name it, and that happens when our sex is observed at birth. in my country it is custom to pierce girls ears, that happened to me because i was born a girl. simply put, there are experiences that we all women share that makes us feel each other in a certain way, we sort of sense each other, we are relieved if there is a women in a place that you may consider dangerous or sketchy, and guess why is that, because of men of course, we band together for a sense os safetyness, and that feeling may not occur with a transwoman next to me the phrase trans women are women is a bit violent, it's something that you know it's not true, you may be happening as a woman now, and as you said, you weren't one in 20 years, that period of time in your life does not simply vanish as you say you are a woman, you obviously know this. i understand that this sort of reaffirmation helps  transwomen to cope with the hundreds of agressions that they face everyday, but you have to understand that it does rub in an obnoxios, almost entitled way, and it has material consequences, eg, sports, that's an issue where wellknown female sport players have raised some valid points that have been completely shutdown by transactivists, check martina navratilova i think you might try to give more time to your inner GC i look forward for your vids, love you natalie"

"What a profound disappointment Germaine Greer has turned out to be. I (a cis woman) idolized her when I was in my early 20s (this would have been mid-late 90's). There's a Sinead O'Connor album that opens with the quote 'I do think that women could make politics irrelevant … [by fostering] subtle forms of interrelation that do not follow some hierarchical pattern which is fundamentally patriarchal. The opposite to patriarchy is not matriarchy but fraternity, yet I think it’s women who are going to have to break this spiral of power and find the trick of cooperation.” That quote resonated so strongly with me and my social/political view at the time. It still does.   When I heard a few years ago that she was a TERF, I had been out of the loop for a while, and I was shocked. I was sure she had to have a good reason, or at least a well-articulated sense of the subject? So I looked up her more recent writings and speech transcripts and was really sad to see that, no: her reason was that she wanted to exercise her right to be a complete asshole about the subject of transgenderism and transwomen especially. She’s HORRIBLE. I’m embarrassed that I fell so hard for her. She should show some integrity and do some of that “difficult emotional work” that she needs to do.   Transwomen are my sisters, teachers, and friends. I really appreciate this video."
"Natalie, I love you so much. But I don't understand why you had to indulge in that drive-by attack on #allgamers. It honestly hurt, like being slapped by your idol and not even understanding why?"
"Yesss"
"Oppression isn't an immovable fact of the universe, it's arbitrarily forced on (not even all) women in varying ways and severity depending on their location/economic status; so to say that anyone who hasn't experienced a certain number of atrocities 'doesn't count' is ridiculous. By that logic, do we all belong to a different womanhood than that of our great-grandmothers because we can vote? Are white women 'really' female if we don't experience as intense a social and economic bigotry as women of color? The rabbit-hole's endless."
"Really wish I could stop glancing at inner-terf Contrapoint's boobs. It's disturbing. I know they're not real, I know I could do the same thing with a couple pushup bras, and some makeup, but...  ... *boobs*"
"i can't even focus on the topic, because that blouse and hat match is superior"
"How can I triple like this video?"
"I was far from socialised male but I feel like the specific type of isolation and targeting I got from boys.Because the way that I tried to relate to them and hang out with them made them uncomfortable and insecure in their masculinity mirrors the experience of cis gay or bi men a lot more than it does any cis women I've spoken to."
"'I'm a man/woman trapped in a woman's/man's body' was something I heard in the 70s  It was a way to show that it wasn't a choice or a way to rebel against society, this is how some people felt about themselves.  This phrase has since been taken as an insult by some trans people but it helped me better understand the issue."
"Well done Natalie: you did it - you abolished gender! Hallelujah!"
"Really interesting thanks."
"you are singlehandedley the fittest man I have personally ever seen. I'm serious."
"Interesting that Germaine Greer's comments seem to imply that CIS women can't have facial or body hair."
"While i don't fully agree with your views, i have to compliment your video quality. The red and dark backgrounds, outfits, editing, background music etc. One of the best on youtube. Also you sipping tea from the pot made me laugh really hard."
"I happened to stumble across this, and only planned to watch a few minutes. I watched the whole thing. Very interesting, well-articulated and well-structured, and hilarious all at once. You just gained a subscriber!"
"You look so gorgeous in this video 😍"
"I respect you miss points, so much, I think you are the most intelligent trans woman on YouTube... Please continue with your great work is amazing💪💪"
"Also, natalie, not only are you stylish and sophisticated, youre beautiful! It would be a shame if you put a knife to your beautiful person. I personally hope you dont end up doing that."
"The fact that people are disgusted by something says something about the thing, though."
"Just to be part of the comment-section that is nice  This videos was realy nice to watch again. As trans*person I feel so happy that there is some space for such topics. Thats great."
"This is really really good. I really enjoyed the talk between you and your camera person it was a really nice brightened. Your response to terms was really well done"
"Contra gives me both a physical and intellectual boners.. I love it !"
"side note: U LOOK SO GOOD"
"'Biological males who run rampant in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous dogma that boys can become girls with the change of costume!' That sounds just like the language religious conservatives use in the 'bathrooms debate'. It is also a lovely use of 'rampant' (Synonyms: erect, upright, vertical, perpendicular)."
"Terf is also used for men. It is not gender critical xD yah, I went there. Radfems need to know that."
"Whose voice is that in the bg? Has contrapoints expanded the channel?"
"I’m not sure if you even read the comments but I’m going for it bc I refuse to enter the hellhole of Twitter. I adored this video and deeply appreciated the points you made (and calling out transmeds that was nice of you). But the bit about gender neutral presentation and abolishing gender did come off as condescending or even mocking towards gnc or nb people especially those who try their absolute best to present as androgynous. I understand it wasn’t the intent but the way it was scripted seems to mock any efforts to appear genderless or genuine efforts to be that way, especially considering plenty of proponents of abolishing gender are nb or genderqueer people who are all too fed up with having to clarify a gender experience not related to traditional notions of gender or gender expression."
"How do TERFs feel about trans women who look more attractive than actual women?"
"Wowowo take it easy boi XD"
"I think its important to draw a distinction between an expression of sex identity and “gender”. “Gender” is an outmoded framework of classifying people according to certain characteristics, as opposed to the largely spontaneous, creative way in which we express our sexual personalities, our individual physical and social negotiations with libido."
"This was fantastic. New viewer and subsciber."
"You'd think TERF's - being feminists - would be a bit more open and understand the endlessly deep value of compassion. Bigotry creeps in through every unexamined crack in a human mind. It's terrifying."
"NO, not the games!"
"Ok, thought that this was serious and I was gonna fucking cry because I wanted to know what evil thing I had done to get Terf videos recommended to me."
"Has anyone else here thought Contra looked awesome in that black top ans has awesome boobs?❤"
"I wonder if most TERFs are also white? And also struggle to accept and listen to the racism and additional struggles experienced by women of colour?"
"Be still my beating heart"
"Fuck I've watched this 5 times in the last 24 hours"
"Also worth noting TERFs’ revulsion at “masculine” features in women (like big noses or facial hair or whatever) is like blatantly racist in addition to transphobic."
"16:18 it's 3:40am. I am struggling to not burst out laughing. But snickering wildly."
"What if she actually hit reply on Kim's instagram by accident XD"
"This is a very well put-together video! I enjoyed watching it beginning to end. A couple things to say:  I've noticed it's nearly always trans women that get the brunt of the harassment. Bathroom issues, safe space issues, sports issues, etc. Trans men are usually considered dumb / lost / pressured lesbians or tomboys, meanwhile I've seen trans women get 20x more harassment and everything else. 'Trans women are stealing what it means to be women, they're perverts trying to rape women, etc.' That kind of thing. I think I know why that is, it's just something i've noticed from personal experiences. Speaking of which...  As a trans-man myself, I've had scrapes with these kinds of 'gender critical' people before that make me wonder how people like them can even exist. I once had someone argue that I was a 'lost lesbian who is being told  to be a man to seem normal,' and that I should 'embrace my inner dyke and start dating a real woman.' I felt disgusted and ashamed of myself in that moment, since being called a lesbian / woman is one of my biggest fears and taking top spot along with someone finding out I'm trans and doing something to me.   Gender critical people have concerns, yes, but they're so dumb that they...really shouldn't exist in the first place. Just the idea that any trans person is lost or creepy or disgusting for us being trans."

"Can we all take a moment to appreciate just how much trust Natalie is showing us her audience and appearing on camera with little to no makeup? Like she's clearly explained that the reason she has all this makeup and clothing used to socialy que us into perceiving her as a woman so for her to do otherwise implies a huge level of trust and ask the audience to accept the reality of her Womanhood without the material signifiers. Honestly I get so frustrated with some of my fellow members of the audience because Natalie doesn't have nearly as much responsibility as a representative of the queer Community as you all like to put on her especially for someone who is still so early in her transition!!!  so be grateful she's willing to show herself and express herself and be this vulnerable for the purposes of her art that takes a level of Courage that I don't think a lot of people house especially in marginalized groups."
"i don't think you understand that Sylvia Plath quote at all."
"Kim Kardeshian is a conformist and wealthy. Emma Watson was critiqued as she bared breasts and calls herself a feminist. So, it's okay to bare breats but be a femmoid as incels would say but not be a feminist. It's similar to how Jewish and Muslim girls are called whores if they dont dress conservatively and wear some some sort of veil. Whereas their male counterparts whore around but thats boys being boys =/ Contra says it right."
"Great video. Very emphatic but also critical again, I kinda feared you lost the first quality a little bit. Your sets and costumes look better than ever, wow. Stop being such an inspiration."
"Where are the contra points? This is just some creepy narcissist wasting my time."
"Everytime I watch a Contrapoints video I am overwhelmed by how much I've learned and the beauty of the entire video, from props to language, it does good to the soul. From the bottom of this latin american cis male's heart, thank you so much."
"That red outfit is so gorgeous,,,,, and I am so, so gay"
"Yes it's 'disgust', but also,  I think it sometimes goes deeper than that. I think most of these people take extreme pride in their sex/gender. Like a sense of purpose. 'this is *my* club, this is what makes me me, you don't belong here' etc, etc.."
"I was talking to a friend once and trying to make them understand what trans people are about and how they feel (to the best of my cis abilities). But then they asked me: 'How can people feel like they're part of one gender over another if gender is purely a social construct?' And I was kind of stumped because I do agree with them but then it makes dysphoria that much harder to understand. How do you 'feel' like you're part of a gender, or that you're not?"
"Why does female appearance matter so much more?"
"Just wanna let you know, I was never anti trans or anything to begin with but as a right leaning person your videos make it 1000% easier to learn and understand these things!"
"you are disgusting"
"People who menstruate is probably a better option than menstruators. But having an inclusive term like that is very important. It reminds me how in Psychology we no longer say schizophrenics, depressives or psychopaths. Language is a very powerful tool that can make people feel strongly, or can have an impact that we are not even aware of. There is a lot of power in language.   Thank you for another amazing video!"

"Nice video!  It would have been even greater to have gotten a little bit more of an intersectional analysis thrown in there as well.  You did a bit about class privilege and with including the COPS video, but race could have been good to have delved into further since most murdered trans women are POC.  Also, an intersectional analysis further discredits TERF's insistence on a homogenous experience of all CIS women."

"'take your shitty chili elsewhere' I DIED"
"great video as always, but i dont think u understand what transmedicalism is/why ppl are so vocal abt it. what it actually would be defined as by most transmeds is the belief that u need gender dysphoria to be trans and that u shouldnt transition if u dont have gender dysphoria, especially not medically. it sounds like simple common sense but unfortunately there are a lot of false definitions of GD floating about, and with them the belief that anyone can be trans. the belief that GD isnt necessary to be trans leads to cis ppl transitioning and consequently really regretting their decisions and detransitioning.  this might sound like a really extreme case but i personally know three girls who have done that exact thing and one of them got as far as taking testosterone. sadly its also not unlikely that detransitioned women become terfs and think that trans men are all either butch lesbians or gender nonconforming straight girls who are in denial and the usual disgusting spiel abt trans women."
"'excuse my beauty TERF.' LOVE IT almost as much as I adore you. 😂💚"

"NATALIE! THIS IS NOT HOW I EXPECTED YOU TO MENTION CHATTANOOGA!  WE GET OUR ABORTIONS IN KNOXVILLE!"
"Oh my goooood great job! (Just doing my part)"
"That head dress though.."
"There isn't anything inherently wrong with video games or people who enjoy them.  Are you seriously advocating for the destruction of an entire art form @ 20:37?  Making this declaration in the middle of a seemingly well-reasoned diatribe seriously undermines your credibility.  I assume this was just a joke or at the very least hyperbole?"
"10:43 im dying hahahahaha"
"Luv u natalie💕💕💕💕💕"
"How do you identify as a gender? I have a penis and other biological male characteristica therefore i'm a man, i didn't identify as a man, just like i don't identify as a human. If you have  male biological characteristics, you are a man, doesn't mean you can't play dress up and  pretend to be a woman, but changing your fashion doesn't make you into a woman. Maybe one day with gene therapy you can become anything you want. I'm against any mistreatment of anyone, that doesn't mean i accept your explanation. If trans women are real women, than what is the definition of a woman? My definition is biological, which doesn't rely on fashion and culture to  know what a woman is. A real woman doesn't need technology or fashion, she is a woman because of her biology."
"Oh Natalie..  may want to make a note that by 'clocked a trans woman' you don't mean that you punched her because as someone who is not part of the LGBT community, I thought that's what you meant! I gasped! And then I realized you didn't punch her."

Thanks so much keep up the amazing quality work xx also the part about being called 'it' really hit home. it happens to me a lot by people i see at collage, and i'm in Brighton which is like the most accepting place in Europe so i really feel so awful for the people in less accepting places."

"This discourse is so incredibly informative and important for me and other cis men to hear. It is so dense, I will be able to re-watch it several times and pick up new things.    Thank you so much, I recognize the vulnerability laid bare and am able to empathize."
"I like the video but I would enjoy a video on the more thoughtful 'gender critical' views, like the ones developed by Kathleen Stock and other philosophers."
"Personally, I feel bad for Trans Men: you suffer sexist hatred from birth cos the world thinks you're a girl..and when you come out & transition the people who _should_ support you (Feminists & Progressives) feel you don't matter because you're a dude. I mean, if ignoring the existence of Bisexual people is Biphobia..then ignoring the existence of Trans Men is Transphobia, isn't it..?"
"Nice outfit!"
"Outstanding video Natalie! Your arguments are so well presented"
"Yay!!!!!! I missed you soooo much!!!!"
"This is filth. Pure sickness."
"Male and female brains are statistically different, but what's more important is the theoretical wiring that seems most different. Like how women are less visual than men. That isn't something you can see on a brain scan but is accepted as true."
"And fuck you, you mind-numbingly manipulative narcissist. Comparing feminists to racists- as if not wanting a man in a women's prison is the same as not wanting a black woman in a women's prison. You're the racist, and everyone that falls for your horseshit is just a goddam idiot. We will look back and laugh when we're done crying."

(ps from one adult human female to another, ya look great and i love your nails. i would love to have long ass nails but i work with dogs sooo i cannot)"
"Abolish gender = abolish subconsciousness"
"Nobody cares about your beauty, silly, you're just not a woman, and you need to stop trying to force your beliefs on others like some sort of lgbtqa+ whatever version of the Christian right. Feminists aren't interested in 'denying you your gender' whatever that means, we just don't regard 'woman' as a gender. It's a sex, the female sex, specifically in humans, and it's down to what type of gamete you produce, not any sort of psychological state you may experience."
"can just there be no fucking genders? what is a man and a woman? fucking nothing, having long or short hair, make up or no make up, boobs or no, vagina or dick, your brain is the same, these are just tastes and preferences in the appearance, nothing more. I don't saw anywhere that feminism is against gender expression, in the opposite feminism taught me to accept any women expressing herself as feminine or masculine she wants, not shaming women who accept traditional patriarchical stereotypes, I am one of them lol"

"15:00 GAGGED!"
"you misrepresented the views of transmedicalists. saying you need dysphoria, feeling disconnected from your birth sex and gender in order to be transgender isn't always akin to hating your body."
"My friend and I watched this late last night while super high off of different substances, and we were both speechless. This is the angriest I've ever seen Natalie in a video. And I've seen everything she's done. Well done. You're one of my biggest inspirations."
"I love your work and your persona so much, you deserve so much more recognition for your work, from the light to the text your work is so fantastic. And thank you for the french subtitles !"
"ive never watched anyone with such a great sense of style... every single one of your videos are works of art and so are you <:3c so enjoyable"
"Hey Natalie! :) No idea if you will see this... And I know my opinion doesn't mean much... But I wanted to say that this cishet man (for one) does not find you disgusting. I think you are a neat person and I admire your intellect and strength."
"One minute and im heavy breathing..."
"You always make me laugh and think.   Thank you for the brain-food. x"

"transmedicalists, shut up. also the cis people in intercommunity discourse? ew"
"Jeeze what I am doin"
"I don't really agree with most of what Contra says, but I appreciate the production quality of these videos. Also she's really gorgeous and her outfits are great. It gives me a chance to see what kind of ideas more left leaning people think about, and gives me the ability to critically think about problems from both sides of the aisle."

"Makers Mark, eh? Good choice."
"The thing is, the idea that all or most trans men experience what it's like to 'grow up female' is certainly not uncontested in the trans community. I myself am a trans man who considers himself to have very rarely if ever meaningfully 'experienced' misogyny (inasmuch as growing up in a patriarchal society at all regardless of position in the hierarchy doesn't count as experiencing misogyny). I grew up in a household that had very few gendered expectations for me, was never bullied or abused or sexually targeted (for gendered reasons or otherwise), and internalized gendered messages from society that were more directed at men (ex. I was an edgy 4chan misogynist when I was like 12-13 and it basically never occurred to me that I was technically a 'girl' too). I came out at 15 and started hormones at 18 and have never/will never experience adult womanhood firsthand.  For a while, my own experiences kinda put me in the 'trans men's gendered socialization is much more similar to cis men's than cis women's and the ones who say otherwise are just trying to deny their own privilege' camp. Now, though, I realize that, like you, my experience was tempered by my whiteness, class privilege, etc. much more than it was ever really about my casab. Trans men who are more marginalized than me along other axes (and/or whose families and environments happened to be more sexist) usually also experience significantly more gendered trauma because all systems of oppression are closely intertwined. I'm glad you're starting to touch on how other trans women's lifelong gendered experiences, especially for women who don't have some of the other privileges that you have, can also be very different from your own and that it isn't casab that determines how your childhood gendered socialization affected you."

"About the question: Why are mans the 97% of fatalities? Is NOT trolling,but a fair question. An oppressor don't go to war to protect his victim. Mans through history have been the more caring and loving than woman. So... you are welcome Male privilege doesn't exist."

"Hello. I like your videos. Can you talk more about your personal experiences in regards to issues? You already do to some extent and personal stories can be invasive, but I think it gives me personally a way to frame a position. Understanding a criticism is one thing, but it takes me that extra little bit of personal experience to feel strongly about something. I enjoy your content very much. Thank you."
"What's wrong with video games?  T-T"
"Thank you for making this video. I hope those who are curious about actually having progressive dialogue find this video and learn something. Thank you for your strength and openness as well. It helps me a lot."

"Natalie, you are amazing! <3 It is so REFRESHING to listen to you. Your videos are legitimate education. You are helping people with articulating what they know is true. It's really cool."
"Look, I hate being That Guy, but WHAT HIGHLIGHTER ARE YOU WEARING? It's beautiful, and it looks beautiful on you, and I just want to know what the hell magical sparkle powder you're wearing on your cheeks.  Also, thank you for the video. It was excellent."

"wtf now i want to hug contraopoints and every other trans person and assure them that they are most likely beautiful people and that they will find the power within themselves to escape the shackles of society and their own selfhatred"
"37 year old cis white Swedish male here.   Amazing video (as always), but please, please, please, don´t start interacting with the people behind the camera. It comes across as 'fake' (I hate channels/presenters that do that) and really snaps me out of the video.   Keep  the bloopers at the end credits, they where hilarious"

"Finally! There's such a discourse(tm) against 'socialization ,' and terfs think it is terrible, and the 'progressive ' inclusive groups swear it doesn't matter. Trans man here to testify misogyny is a thing I experienced in my youth and seriously impacted me."

"Brilliance. One of the most entertaining content creators on Youtube. I am still laughing!"
"Damn. Every video you get better and better. I love to watch each of your videos as it unpacks more and more of my transphobic beliefs I didn't know I had or answers questions I've wanted to ask, but didn't know how.   Thank you, Natalie."
"I don't know how I got here at all.  That said, the wardrobing was exquisite"

"Natalie!!! Hasan Piker has been wanting to have a good discussion with you! You guys have almost identical views on things and that would be really awesome if you guys did a video together or had a discussion on his live stream :) ! This was a great video and love this so much! I'm a hetro male and I haven't known too much about the trans community, your videos have taught me so much and they are always extremely educational, interesting, and so god damn funny and entertaining! Much love thank you for all you do! and anyone out there in the LGBT community, stay strong and love you all!"
"First of all, who thinks street harassment makes you a woman? Really, Becky? Is that the world you want to live in? 'You haven't been harassed in over a week Julie! What kind of a woman even are you?!' Really? ReALLy?"
"Damn, your footages gives a new perspective to look on some things. Aaaaass a ciiiiis maaaan, describing myself as tollerant ant leftist, I`d never thought about issues you`re talking about. Good job. Also, great sense of humour. I watched clip about incels twice already :)  BTW. Excuse my boldness, you look great without makeup. Love your style, but that was also something new and interesting to see."
"It's funny with the TERFs who take the 'There's no female brain' route, because lesbians typically have a bigger frontal lobe than most women, something that is statistically larger in men. So, by their logic of trans women having 'male brains', I guess...lesbians are manly and masculine, because they have brains more similar to men?  PS, on that note, did I miss a day in gender school where your brain and what you're more inclined to be good at decided how you should act and what gender you present as?"

"Every video you post literally gets better and better"
"In the end, measuring worth of gender by who has the worse trauma is one of the things that disturbs me most. Why does being a woman require suffering, abuse, and oppression? Why can't people just be glad that a woman (ANY kind of woman), is able to live a happy life? Misery loves company I guess. All this does is normalize abuse, tbh.  America's Next Top Victim indeed.   I think anyone who wants to look plain and live simply should be able to do so. And anyone who wants to look fab and live a loud life, should be. I know it delves into the whole utopia issue... But why can't everyone just enjoy being beautiful in whatever way it means for them, whatever form it takes? It just makes me sad. :("

"this video managed to perfectly articulate the thoughts that I've been having abt TERFs while adding more, interesting info on top of that. what always bugged me about TERFs was the arguement that trans women have more privilege than cis women, which you managed to counter wonderfully. great job!"
"its very sad seeing germaine greer in this new light shes a legand the female eunuch is masterpiece not  i owe her a lot she shaped modern feminism  but i guess my fave is bigot and i have to deal with it now :("
"i'm a gendercrit lesbian, because the material conditions of female/afab people in and outside of the western world just doesn't add up with any other worldview i could espouse. i also have endless sympathy for trans people and have distanced myself from other radfems/gender critical people in the past for being completely deplorable. i feel that some parts of gender critical thinking were misrepresented (as they usually are) (i.e. how most of us are lesbians and women of color), but i genuinely appreciate and understand, empathize with, and agree with what was said here!! obviously some gender critical women are committed to being as transphobic as possible under the guise of feminism, and obviously some trans women refuse to accept anything that cis women say about our lives/bodies/experiences (or are...downright misogynists), but there's a lot to be learned from every voice and solidarity goes a long way. don't be afraid to ask questions or just not agree with every single part of something, it's all a learning process and discovering what *you* believe is most important!! (and maybe don't tell every gender crit person to like... die)"
"May have been a little much to start with a full-blown Germaine Greere quote, it was a bit rough to hear. That said, another excellent video!"

"5:37.  This question is actually one I ask when it comes to trans.  It is not hatred...it is what I live.  I do not identify as a woman, but I do prefer things normally assigned to women.  Note that word 'assigned'.  I was told when growing up how boys behaved, how they dressed, and what they did not do.  All children are pushed this sort of thing.  I was told when I wanted to wear a skirt opposed to pants that boys didn't wear skirts.  When I stated I did not want a hair cut I was told that boys did not have long hair....and while being told these things I was seeing girls wearing pants, and having short hair.  To me the issue is not that I 'feel like' a woman...but that the rules foisted on myself, and likely others are the problem.  The concept that gender is a social construct is an accurate one to me.  Or more correctly, Gender stereotypes are socially constructed.  They are also harmful for many.  Many of those mannerisms Contra does would be considered inappropriate for a male to do...unless that male was doing drag......but why?  What makes things 'masculine' or 'feminine'.  Why is it a boy is shunned for liking 'girly' things?  What pisses me off is when people seem to know what my sexual orientation is based soley on my clothing.  Another is judging my mental stability based on my wearing a skirt, hose and heels.  This is not helped by most every time a child (usually a boy) shows up to school in clothing or styles not fitting the stereotype of 'male' is now considered to be Trans.  NO!!!  He may just be a boy that was like myself that saw even at a young age what non-sense it was that boys could not do things that girls could do (and later learning what nonsense it was that girls could not do things boys could)."

"This was a good video.  Once upon a time i was concerned about Natalie's internalized transphobia ('the aesthetic' and parts of 'incels' were real cringe for me)... not in like a 'Contrapoints is cancelled' type of way, just like... ouch sis, you may want to not. It second-hand hurt for her to see. I don't know Natalie, but i'm jazzed that she seems to be overcoming it. The overall empowered end of the video soothes.  and (AS A TRAANS MAAN) big thanks for all the inclusion in the discourse which i personally don't see often!"
"This was an amazingly educational video! I'm so glad I subscribed!"
"Well, this was pathetic. Really disappointing... I mean this is beneath you Natalie (see that, I have no issue with your pronouns or your chosen name, because I can believe something and still be polite/decent to others). You didn't even try to address GC concerns in good faith, as evidenced by your conclusion. You clearly don't understand what gender abolition is, or what it aims for. And please, who are you trying to fool with your invitation to 'ex-GCfems'? If you extended that invitation to actual GC feminists, then perhaps I could take you seriously, but no. I'm a gender critical feminist, but I don't frequent the GC subreddit. I don't like it, I find it too extreme. Try the debate sub instead - r/GCdebatesQT if there's any genuineness to your open-mindedness. Plus, let's be honest, TERF doesn't actually mean anything, since it gets lobbed at basically anyone who doesn't agree with the most extreme opinions held by (some) trans activists (and their allies). It gets lobbed at men, women, radical feminists, non-radical feminists, folks on the Right, folks on the Left, and guess who else... yes, that's right, other trans people who hold different opinions about their experiences. I don't get offended by that acronym personally, but I do find it inaccurate and intellectually lazy."

"If having having a traumatic experience with men is enough to justify hatred then how is that any different than someone having a similar reaction after a traumatic experience with another race, Liam Neeson for instance. In fact I'd say there are many people who've had bad experiences with other races, consistently, or significantly enough that they use it as a justification for their fear, hatred, dislike, disgust, etc. of any other member of that group. That doesn't mean their views are accurate, everyone's experience is individual so what may be 'true' for someone might not be true to the next. These are the same people often referred to as bigots because 'there is no excuse.' Playing by your (proverbially) game, that means that no bigotry of any kind is excusable, but maybe all of it is. There is always a reason WHY someone is a racist. They don't just wake up and choose to be. It can be from ignorance passed on by their elders or other role models or T.V. or the internet or a host of bad experiences or a combination of the two. If you can afford to give man-hating women a voice you should be able to give black-hating whites one too, if you are operating under an actual principle and not just bias."
"There are distinct differences between the brain of a male and a female (like penis and vaginas 8:10). Research has been published that men have larger amygdalas and woman have larger hippocampuss. The physical differences also manifest in many ways such as how drugs affect the body and basic differences between males and females such as stress responses and neuro chemical reactions (Cahill 2006). I am for inclusion of all regardless of the decisions they decide to make, but gender reassignment seems like a brash and crude answer to gender disphoria. It is obvious that if one wants to be identified in their daily life as male, female, or transitioning, that can be done with a fair amount of work (cosmetic and psychological). I wonder what the physical augmentation of the sex organs gives to the receiver besides a placebo? I do not have much experience with gender disphoria, but I know it is controversially classified in the DSM-5. I can't imagine a physical change of the genitala can combat the root of the disphoria. I would also like to say that I do not support the disparaging of people who are trans, and communities that do that are problematic regardless of their ideology viewpoints."

"Queen! Being judged as unworthy by femenists is something a lot of cis women deal with too.  Their rejection pushed me down the  anti-feminist rabbit hole for several years until I realized that the real problem wasn't feminism in itself, the idea was basically good but some femenists have bad execution. To me femenism is supporting the right of all women to live as they choose without experiencing oppression or violence. That's the goal right? But some femenists want to dictate what that life *should* look like. No stay at home moms. No sex workers. No plastic surgery. Don't be too conventionally pretty. Don't be a Christian. Don't play mainstream videogames. Don't wear dresses. Go work in STEM, even if you don't enjoy it, we need numbers damnit. Don't be a nurse or a teacher. Don't ask questions. Fall in line. If you disagree with me it's just your internalized misogyny talking, you poor thing. Etcetera. I'm sorry that trans women have to deal with that, may it serve as a small comfort that being badgered and bullied by a bitchy subset of femenism is definitely part of the female experience. Love you, sister."

"You do an amazing job in applying dialectical materialism to contemporary trans inclusive feminism.

Now when there are men with beards they chop people's heads off and force women to walk in bedsheets."
"My one criticism (as a radfem): you never discussed the main concern radical feminists have about trans politics, the idea that lesbians have to include trans women in their sexuality. While I see the other things you talked about, I can’t believe you never addressed that main reason liberal feminism because radical feminists"

"there's no reason for this to be so complicated. some men feel more comfortable trying to pass as women, so they've defined themselves as trans women, meanwhile for females who feel more comfortable as men they present as male, hence: trans men. that's literally the reality of the situation, it's not that deep. if they were not as they are the word trans wouldn't exist and they'd be cis. that's why it's ridiculous that people argue that trans women are women when they literally exist as male, and vice versa. you can't debate your way out of the truth so all these twitter wars and whatnot are useless because words don't change existence"

"Natalie, I've got a question: Why are you portraying a world without gender like a white and empty space? That's bullshit. You would still look exactly the same without gender roles. The only thing that differs is that your cloths, your makeup, your hair, your voice etc. wouldn't be associated with gender anymore. Nobody would dare to call you a man because nobody would care. Every person could wear what it wants without refering to itself as a man or a woman. The world would be exactly as colorfull and diverse as before.  To me it seems like you fetishize your concept of 'femininity'. You want to be called a woman because you love this gender role. Otherwise you'd just give a shit and define yourself as a person. This radical gender identity is enforcing the existing categories because you still have to decide between being 'male' and being 'female' (or any other kind of gender).  Let's stick with your border example: Do you think that radical nationalism will enable us to get rid of borders?"
"I'm never gonna hear that Shania Twain song the same way again, and I'm okay with that.   On a more gushy note, I finished watching this video last night and hit replay as soon as the video ended to watch again. And now I'm watching again. Do we stan? Oh, we stan!"

"Glad to see that Winona Ryder has her own platform. I like when anyone goes to the effort of making a film and making a point about anything they may believe is a worthy subject.  Many of the world has no idea about variation by choice or by hormonal genetics/ or the combo. Also comedy in no longer a right, you can practice law and medicine but no practicing personality.  Is this a scripted short, or is much of your dialogue plain out in the moment improv. What was the full pre production film clip time of this 33+ minutes. My former business partner and still elder cousin, is a male that has medically transformed his body into one of a female. This occurred at age greater than 50 and internal conflict of desiring to be feminine since early childhood, closet cross dressing with the wardrobe of his much larger mom's clothes (we are supposedly to believe this was in complete. I was right in deciding he fully preferred women as partners and that has not changed. He was married with a son. I have no judgement in non-crimiinal activity. I am too busy trying to keep my own butt on the straight and narrow.  That is an old term. Straight meant at one time, a 'righteous & good well meaning lifestyle.  I was brought here to understand the fear a modern comedian has in trying to remain an individual and express what they think is funny without fear of jail, social poverty, career and possession loss.  There is a lot of education here, it is a walk down awareness lane. I do not want any judgement on my ability to not bow down to anyone. I may recognize anyone, I may not understand them, generally if they are not dependent on me, or I o them, I move on.  My cousin has also made me too aware of adjective pronouns, he & she, and possessive his/hers. So I now avoid them at al;l using you your their. Hey you! Don't get upset if I am illiterate to your language and definitions. Like the many songs we grew up with Spencer Davis Group's I'm a man',  Beautiful moment in time for some.  Even they were criticized for stealing Kool from the blacks, as if it was a racial trait.  I graduated from SFSU in Cinema (Doc) so I am in a tiny position to express my limited awareness, which cannot be right or wrong. I never was aware of mensturators, even youtube wants to autocorrect me.  Yes, I would like to know the status of one I am attracted to. To accept their position, and either continue or abort my intentions.  It is not always about sex. Perhaps knowlege, referral, or just plain friendship. Re we allowed to choose to MAKE a friendship or is that a bad thing now????  Well I will con tin my quest to learn the fear that lives inside the current comedian who must be so PC that they just are not fulfilled.. Walking the line was much easier, Chirsi Rock, Pryor, had privilege.  Gilbert Gottfried and Kramer (Michael Richard) were stifled quickly. Poor Pee Wee, was shot down for doing a normal thing in an abnormal place at the wrong time. , Advice- Never suggest money with anything you do. Aways tell women that the sex is free and that you expect no compensation, so you never get stung by the police department, no matter how hard they might try. Seduction is a one way street, only one is holding back for some reason.  Only do this if you record it and have a legally astute friend. Because being right and smart is not free.  Ask how much does a one hour massage cost, what is the range, never ask what they do in that hour. Do not agree or suggest. If they say 'would you like ......'  just reply,  I do not make suggestions, it is the decisions of the masseur/seuse as to what they wish to do or not. I expect any professional to be concerned utmost about their customer, do you agree, Wait for a yes...... if not they're probably a cop or a reserved employee.  Oh yeah, we were talking about 'blue comedy'. and its persecution.  BUT George Burns did pretty darn well, and I would have been him way before Lenny Bruce or Robin Williams- he had control, lots of it."

"oh fuck new contra vid hell yeah"
"Damn, I really hate to hear that 'gender critical' is being used as a dog-whistle... I consider myself critical of gender because femininity/masculinity as defined by social behavior is a spectrum filled with often arbitrarily-defined 'gendered' signifiers. I don't see the complete abandonment of gender as realistic, at least in the short-term, but the pressures put on people to conform to either extreme of the spectrum is silly at best and extremely harmful at worst. A cis or trans man should be able to freely enjoy 'feminine' things while still identifying as a man, with the inverse being true for cis and trans women. And for those who feel a connection to both or to neither end of the spectrum, they shouldn't have to experience pressure to conform to one side or the other just for the sake of making other people feel more comfortable. That discomfort is irrational. At the barest minimum, even if someone cannot empathize with or understand those who don't fall neatly into hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine identities, tolerating flexibility within the gender binary is a pursuit of doing the least amount of harm - if someone is happier living as they are as opposed to how one thinks they should live, then why insist on the alternative? I recognize that this is an idealized view of how society SHOULD be rather than a reflection of what it is... but still. I don't like a phrase that is so broad being used to label such a very specific and narrow definition of how one should or shouldn't perform in the social gender construct. That flavor of 'gender criticism' is just reinforcing the gendered patriarchal divide that feminism-as-gender-equality aims to deconstruct and fight against."
"*me getting out*"
"'fair and balanced' you know that is TMd by some news dude, right?"
"I don't agree with you on a lot of this, but nonetheless I still enjoy your videos."
"There's a big point that got missed I think, which would go right about where the genderless skit went. Basically something like 'it's gender stereotypes and society that's set up all this is a man this is a woman stuff, so why can't you with all the clothes and makeup and fabulousness, dating guys, whatever, ALSO be what a man (XY) is?' I don't think the reenforcing gender stereotypes argument's opposite is genderlessness. Like, why can't this be a man you can 'miss/mame'? I feel like if we just came to understand gender as independent of sex, even if it's statistically correlated, then you wouldn't have to ride or coopt sexual terms so that you can have gendered features and treatment? which really has a lot of problematic aspects that... although you address them and make sense of WHY you do it and should do it, is just not accurate at the base level. You have XY biology. This is the confusion... if you take 'woman' to mean all the gender norms then yes you're a woman and more power to you, but why can't all this be you being a man? This is why I think a good compromise actually is 'transman' and 'transwoman', and realizing that those are just as equal as man and woman, but it also recognizes the physical reality. We can say a transman is a real man but also a real female/woman... masculine female? And this is the nomenclature problem that's causing issues with gender norms, imo. I hope I explained that right. Anyway, Great vid as always!"

"'women who had traumatic experiences with men and found comfort in a binary worldview where women are safe and men are dangerous' Sorry Contra Points, I know this is unpopular, but there is a HUGE elephant in the room here.  You are basically defending trans women by saying they don't count as men because they are discriminated in their own way, implicitly reinforcing that men are, in fact, intrinsically dangerous and deserving of prejudice by women who found comfort in a binary world view.  I'm not sure this is what gender equality should be about Perhaps that binary world view is a problem. Just saying.  I know this is a delicate matter because if you dare show any consideration for this kind of concerns you will alienate the public and become hugely unpopular. But I think you're better than that."
"I loved the bloopers lmao <3"
"Thowing your hand in someone's face and dismissing their comments about 'more men dying in war,' or men being incarcerated for double the time for the exact same crimes (etc etc.) only makes you look like an ideologue more interested in maintaining the integrity of your worldview (and your standing amongst your peers) than accepting things that are true, but which don't happen to fit very neatly within the accepted dogma of your chosen 'side.'  I mean, Jesus, did you really just say that you were able to walk around completely fearless late at night in a big city at 20-years-old just because you happened to present as a boy at the time?  Well, I've lived as a 20-year-old dude in a big city, too -- and I say you're full of shit. I don't remember EVER walking through a dark alleyway late at night in Chicago or New Orleans without worrying that i might get mugged, beaten, or killed before I reached the other side of it.  And here's the thing -- YOU don't remember doing that, either. You KNOW you're lying about this. You are acquiescing to wrong assumptions and kow-tow'ing to ridiculous, bumper-sticker clichés just to get along -- because you don't want to risk angering this cultish little agree-completely-or-get-out social club to whom you seem to have grown so beholden.  It's obvious, and it's also beneath you, sweetheart. I know you ain't that dumb.   And I see you."
"Concerns have been raised about how hot you are Natalie."
"We also have channels like this one, spreading misinformation. Good job. But.... I do think this is one of rare watchable videos on this subject. It is not the typical trans nazi BS. Just try to stay away from mainstream, shallow buzzwords that show how poorly you have done your homework on certain things, or you just wanted to score some cheap points with your community."
"Happy tdov everyone"
"I really appreciate your attempt to reach out and try and educate the misinformed, it gives you a really approachable persona that's still somewhat lacking in a lot of other content creators I really like, so thanks very much for that. One thing I would say is that I do feel it would have been worth bringing up how lesbian lifestyles/identities are often brought into this - as someone with a lot of lesbian friends and icons, I'm seriously fed up with how it's being appropriated by TERFs, particularly in regards to lesbophobia. I was reading an article by Gay Star News showcasing a very clear example of lesbophobia in action, about how the lesbians being killed in Chechnya were talked about far less than the killing of gay men, because of how it tended to be carried out in secret, the lesbian victims being women tended to be dealt with by their families rather than in public. And in spite of this showcasing, some fucker still decided to comment that Gay Star News was somehow complicit in lesbophobia by being pro-trans. They were literally bringing the topic away from a serious discussion about an intersectional human rights violation to flaunt their first-world transphobia. It was immensely sickening. Outside of this discourse, I do feel that a lot of high-profile feminists tend to be heteronormative in their approaches - a lot of feminist pieces I find of relationships and sex seem to be almost exclusively about dating and sex-ing (not a word, but should be) men, so I kind of understand why lesbians are feeling erased, the 'gender critical' ones are just picking the wrong target. You mentioned something about cis women and trans women being pitted against each other when they really should be putted up a united front against social injustice, and I agree, and I think that's as true of lesbians as anyone else. I don't want this to feel like I'm bitching about your video, because it was incredibly well-made and has continued to cement your position as one of my favourite content creators of all time, this is just something that has been building up under the surface for ages and I needed to vent. :o Oh, and just to be clear, regarding my comments on Chechnya above, OBVIOUSLY I'm not saying that the killing of gay men being talked about means that everything's fine and dandy for them over there."

"This is the first time I'm commenting on your videos so I'm just here to say thank you for opening up my mind and assumptions of people and communities I otherwise would have disregarded. Even though I am a Black Lesbian Woman, I am not exempt from biogted views which you have successfully swayed with constructive arguments and rebuttals. I would just like to leave the comment that I am so happy you brought up the Trans-medical community, because most who make up the community I find, are trans people who go after other trans people for 'Not suffering the way I suffered and thus not being trans enough.' Which is something you also hinted at with this video. I used to watch Kalvin Garrah, Blair White, and few others who eased my mind to be transphobic and bigoted with those who were gender nonconforming, nonbinary, etc. I find that the LGBTQ+ community should stop attacking each other for 'not being the real deal' to 'not make the conservatives and under cover bigots hate us more' because this divides us and dissalludes what we REALLY should be after, AKA the asshats who force us to want their stamp of approval. I honestly without a doubt hope that you can talk about this situation/topic more and create a larger dialogue about how we [those who identify with LGBTQIA+ community] can try and combat not only our inner conflicts but also our outside oppressors.   (post, scriptum. Your make is amazing and I appreciate your voice and opinions :^)"
"i love how that reddit TERF you quoted tries to be a feminist, by enforcing strict stereotipical beuty standards on women. i wonder what it feels like to be a cis woman insecure about her features not being 'feminine and dainty' enough to satisfy societal expectations, and stumble upon a coment like that"
"Jesus the whole trolling bit about 'defining womanhood' is so on point, recently terfs brigaded a fairly small lesbian subreddit and all of this things were written word to word."
"Thank you, Natalie."
"Huh, beauty  got some schooling so this was totes useful and also funny, and I do feel  kinda weird because TERF is hella yummy, but in truth you seem much cooler. So, thanks, I do so love learning new things. Keep up the good work.  Also music is tight."
"good nuance."
"dan natalie ur bobbie s       I'm.... very sorry. I could not resist saying that stupid meme. great video though, I really respect how you always look at nuance and the reasons for why people hold TERF opinions."

"I've been clocked as a trans woman AND a trans man, AND 'they/them'd' a lot when 'woke' ppl clocked me as non-binary. Plot twist, I am actually none of these, I'm intersex in an obscure and complicated way (that I'm sure ppl are tired of hearing about, and I'm tired of explaining, so don't worry, I'm done), and basically my actual point is that being 'clocked', imo, often means absolutely nothing, and Natalie, you are very, very correct that cis ppl (esp. TERFs) think they have a kind of 'trans-dar' and I can guarantee they don't, and they're actually really, really bad at it. Being short gets me called a trans man, wearing makeup gets me called a trans woman; it can be as simple as that. So for ppl who've been hurt by a cis person 'clocking' them in a mean, non-solidarity way, I want you to know, it oftentimes isn't you. They're just seeing ANYTHING as 'potentially trans' because they're often paranoid bigots, so."
"This was quite interesting and covered many points that I sometimes wondered, not being terf but being quite unfeminine cis dyke. Some extra points come to mind - if transwomen glorify certain type of femininity, so what? It's not like the rest of society will hold them up as role models for everyone. Also, as a soon to be ex-menstruator, somehow these criticisms are not aimed at women who have had a hysterectomy or for some other medical/physiological reason cannot bear children or don't have periods."
"its kinda silly that transphobic feminists are called anything 'radical', when they are the more conservative ones?? like, they still cling to this idea (created by patriarchal society) that gender is a binary, esential  characteristic determined at birth by whats between your legs, when we are more radical, cause we moved pass this view. lets call them 'reactionary feminists' or something"
"One thing I think might help dissolve the conflict on some of these points is to differentiate between 'gender' in the sociological sense that has to do with role and presentation, and 'gender' in the psychological sense of how one feels about the sex of their body. Without that distinction it's hard to describe something like a trans tomboy, who feels uncomfortable with a male body and more comfortable with a female body, but prefers a masculine presentation and role, the same way any cis tomboy might do without thereby ceasing to be a woman."
"20:39 Why not better play to videogames? Though there are a lot of bad games and bad gamers (in the sense of being assholes to everyone, specially to women [both cis and trans]), there are also a few good games and you can create your own gaming groups too. Also most games are for one player (with or without a multiplayer option), so you can play alone and, IDK, cook, defend people in court, go to war (as both soldier or officer), lead a country... You can do everything, and as far as I know many games allow for both male and female avatars (or have non-avatar characters), which make some stupid pieces of shit go crazy for things I though were over by this point..."

"I found your channel about a year ago, and I've loved every video, I struggle to comprehend a lot of social issues and as a gay man that likes to be informed and 'stay woke' it was always a thing I was insecure about, especially concerning the experiences of women. I'm a feminist because that just makes sense, I wanted equality as a gay man so in what way can I deny equality to women? But the concepts you delved into in this video just really opened my eyes and helped me understand a lot that I had no idea about (that Sylvia quote especially). And obviously about the trans experience in contrast. All with amazing commentary along the way, mixed with your own personal style and form of comedy that I've (and I'm sure many others) have come to love from you. Really well done Natalie <3   p.s please keep the bloopers in that shit was so good, seeing you break character is so cute and it's amazing, and Kim Petras???? OH WE STAN."

"You're a true blessing, Natalie. You handle all that vileness so gracefully, I doubt I could do that if it was directed at me.  When I was a feminist kid, I didn't understand trans people and was very confused by their existence, because abolish gender. But when I saw the first transwoman in real life, it was obvious to me I needed to rethink my opinions rather than stand up for myself in a way that invalidates someone's whole existence -someone, who frankly, has probably a lot more bullshit thrown at her than I have for being a cis woman.  You can't uphold a TERF stance when you have an ounce of empathy, imagination, and the knowledge that trans people are real."

"'These titties, I saw them and I just lost it' xD"

"Very nicely put.  Excellently and earnestly responds to what might be the good faith questions the average person may have about gender identity while remaining unsparing in illustrating how and why much (most?) self-described “Gender Critical” points are simply veneer for loathing.  Maybe one or two quibbles, but excellent."
"KIM PETRAS 💗"
"being a nonbinary person who gets periods, the thing that causes me most dysphoria is when people equate menstruation/pregnancy/the uterus/etc with being a woman. it's not a woman only thing, but that's what society treats it as, and nothing makes me more uncomfortable than when it's included as a part of womanhood. it's an important part of my life and i want to join discussions of oppression relating to my reproductive system, but it's so often spoken of with gendered terms and that sucks. if periods weren't seen as a womanhood experience, i think a lot of my dysphoria would go away. i don't think there's anything wrong with looking for inclusive language to discuss these things because it hurts a lot of people if we don't."
"24:48 That was... that... I don't even know..."
"TERFS are still bigots."
"Thank you for this. :)  As a teen I tried to become as androgynous as possible and actually succeeded in convincing people I was a woman, until I opened my mouth and shattered the illusion I projected. I was catcalled. But unlike a REAL woman I found this endearing, simply because it filled me with a sense of pride at what I was accomplishing. I had really not experienced sexism and misogyny in the same manner. There simply is no comparison between a biological woman's perspective of her world and a biological male's, even if they share a lot of overlap. I'm glad you're honest about this, perhaps even brutally so. If we're to ever accept the nuance and complexity of gender we need to be fair first and foremost and accept our limitations.  However, for much of my life I felt out of place, uncomfortable. Even though I blended with men and could interact with them with success, I never felt right. I never felt at ease (without a shitload of booze first) and find my mostly redneck brethren uncouth and difficult to take in large doses. I was always weaker, more emotional, and found their rituals distasteful and unnecessary. I never saw a future of a wife and children and husbandly duty without wanting to kill myself and kill myself (with a shitload of that same aforementioned booze) I tried.  Transitioning was something I only really discovered recently and it gave me hope at a future I could accept and work towards. That being said, I often questioned myself. Feminists say this. Cis say that. Even other transwomen have their opinions and those opinions can cut to the bone. My motivations have always felt scrutinized and dissected beneath a microscope.   * Do you hate your penis? No. But I can be quite indifferent towards it. * Are you really wanting to be a traditional woman? No. I have my own vision of womanhood. * You aren't super feminine, is this what you really desire? Yes. Again, own vision of womanhood.  So on and so forth...  It humors me how often the people who want to shed the gender and sex roles are often some of the most rigid traditionalists out there for those same roles. Sorry but I don't hate my penis. Sorry but I don't want to wear dresses constantly and tons of makeup. What I want is to have my hair in a ponytail, wear my nerdy ass glasses, use a light, modest amount of makeup and bask in the sin of plaid shirts and fucking denim while I smash the buttons on my playstation controller like a guerilla with my massive fucking ape hands. THATS WHAT I WANT.  This video makes me so happy because it argues the points that I've been wanting to argue for ages and how ironic it is that even those supposedly fighting for equality and an eradication of ludicrous social norms are still often being ensnared by those same norms. We will only be free of these shackles once we accept who we are. Both the things we're hurt to admit and the things we hide within us and are afraid to indulge to the fulfillment of our lives.  The only norm I give a shit about at the end of the day, personally, is finding a husband to my waifu and again, that's all down to preference."
"love you so fucking much mom"
"i know the genderless thing was a joke, but juxtaposed against the justification of Natalie’s usual high femme presentation it’s actually incredibly comforting that she is still clearly a woman. i don’t know how to explain it, but it’s really easy to associate your gender entirely with your clothes and makeup even though that’s not how it works."
"Thank you for introducing me to the Stephanie Yellowhair clip.   That was really powerful. I'm going to remember it. It's like fuel to stand up for myself and others.  Also, you do a really good job of putting together the inconsistencies and exposing the underlying rationale.  Even though my arguments are similar, you do it so much better that I feel like I'm learning."
"Although I'm far from any kind of Terf ideology, I think the way you disregarded the 'Abolish Gender' argument is quite disingenuous. For me, it isn't about removing 'gender signifiers', but rather, it's about fighting against the idea that these practices should be thought of as inherently masculine or feminine in the first place. Basically, the goal is for everyone to act how they want to act, and wear whatever they want to wear, because they are individuals and not members of some gender group. I wouldn't 'deny trans people their gender identity' -- you can call yourself whatever you want to, and I'll address you however you wish, if it makes you more comfortable. I just think it's unhelpful as a whole to insist on upholding these labels, when they don't make an accurate distinction between individuals : i.e just because two people use the label 'woman' doesn't mean they are similar in many respects.  I think your analogy with the 'Abolish Borders' ideal is slightly flawed. While I do believe citizenship is also theoretically as arbitrary of a label as gender, in practice they are different. Practically, citizenship is steeped in international bureaucracy which determines people's rights and laws -- changing it would be one hell of a hassle. On the other hand, changing the meaning of 'Male' and 'Female' to refer to what kind of reproductive organs one has, would change next to nothing. People should just be individuals who act how they want ; the labels only refer to their genitals.  (again, let me re-emphasize that I have no problems with you identifying similarly to the traditional gender stereotype of a woman, whatever your biological sex -- that's fine with me. I just think you should do so as an individual, who has their own set of beliefs and differences with respect to that stereotype and thus shouldn't try to describe oneself by it)."
"re:  MENSTRUATORS:  Yeah, I’m fine with being “erased” by the general terms “women” and “women’s rights” when it comes to menstruation, pregnancy, etc. A simple “some trans men still need women’s health exams/supplies” is a good and reasonable way to make people aware of my situation. Changing the entire way we talk about this shit to suit the minuscule minority I’m a part of just makes it seem like society views me as a whiny baby who will cry if I’m not included. 🤮"
"As A cIsWoMaN, I too love sucking dick and collecting ceramics. That being said, as a kid I wondered if I was trans. As an adult, I realized I'm very comfortable as a woman, I just hated the constant, rigid gender role I was forced into by my strictly religious family. I wanted freedom, and the only way it seemed attainable was by becoming a boy. Thankfully they were so not LGBT friendly that I never said anything and didn't try to transition."

"I recently saw a video from Rationality Rules called: The Athletic Advantage of Transgender Women (And Why It Is Unfair). I felt uncomfortable agreeing with him, but I felt like he made good points. So I was wondering what your take might be on this @ContraPoints. What is the morally right view?"

"“I am the tranny one percent.” I almost spit out my water 😂 Edit: I really appreciate the nuance you provided about socialization, and how it continues throughout life. Like, it irks me to no end when people criticize trans women because they “don’t actually know what it is to be a woman because you weren’t raised as a woman.” While that’s all well and true (I suppose), I’ve also never had to experience the emotional turmoil (dare I say, trauma?) of gender dysphoria."
"my only concern is the transmedicalist comment. transmeds don’t think you need AGONIZING dysphoria to be trans. we believe that there must be some sort of disconnect between your assigned sex and your gender to be trans. u don’t have to hate your body."

"I think, as far as being a physical woman from birth goes, the idea is that you are a woman to society in your formative years.  Being treated as more of a 'thing' than a human happens to women, and in the years where your mind and body are still growing, it becomes a lifelong challenge of despair...not just an event that can be forgotten about, or something you can get a drink after. I know this doesn't happen to all women, but I know many who would not have been treated as they were (myself included) if we were men."
"And feminists wonder why their movement has always roiled and repelled the rank-and-file.  If you sit around calling everybody around you assholes and asshole-abetters all day, then you shouldn't be too shocked when your date book begins to gather dust."

"[non-native english speaker here, srs question] I must admit I didn't get the 'Excuse my beauty' part. What did she mean? Like 'excuse my (lack of) beauty'? As in 'sorry officers, that I don't meet your standard of feminine appearence, which is apparently the reason you harrass me...'? Or what does that mean?"
"I just don't get it. If your actually a 'Gender Critical Feminist' or simply 'Gender Critical'. In other words you take apart and are critical of notions of Gender essentialism then the existence of Trans people should be food for your ideas. In that the very existence of Trans people at the very least puts into question, at least, certain notions of Gender essentialism and certain attitudes that Gender is binary.Instead 'Terfs' after talking about the absurdity of Gender essentialism then proceed to embrace Gender essentialism!!!! What the fuck!!! I just don't get it.And what makes it even funnier is that at least some Radical Feminists, such has Catherine McKinnon and the late Andrea Dworkin were perfectly willing to accept Trans Women has Women.I read The Transsexual Empire years ago and I have recently reread it. You know there is some actual points worth thinking about in the book. (Particularly the stuff about Transsexualism being used to push a binary attitude about Gender roles.) However virtually all of that is lost in a sea of essentialism, bile and hatred. (The chapter Sappho by Surgery is especially repellant.) It is just so sick and silly."

"I normally find your content incredibly well-argued, but I have to take issue with your assertion that Men's Rights Advocates 'don't actually care' about male victims of violence.  Why would this be any more accurate an assumption than that feminists 'don't actually care' about rape or the pay gap? It just makes it seem like you're not actually interested in engaging with opposing views (something that you accuse anti-SJWs of doing). When you present feminist dogma as so self-evident as to not even warrant rebutting, it comes off like you have a vested interest in depicting people who approach gender politics from any other perspective than the feminist lens as ignorant and brutish, and that you've come up against an argument that you can't rebut within that framework.  As yes, I realize that this is off the topic of the video, but you can't just drop a bomb like that an expect it to go un-challenged."
"Thank you Contra. TERFs are part of the problem of modern (sexual) moralism. The weird need of some for defining good and bad sexual behaviour for OTHER humans. Their vision is of exclusion. It is mental state of weak slave morality which cannot cherish life as it is but rather seeks to eradicate those 'disgusting' things from the world, through alienation and peer pressure. Slave morality at its purest form with nothing honorable or worthy in it. They are the sick fucks who should be stomped to the ground for their worthless worldview.  Have my gratitude, thou fine lady of mysterious pleasures. You give birth to understanding, love and beauty into this world. Let the CIS-women AND TERFs keep their uteruses all by themselves; this is MUCH more glorious and sweet. Keep those knockers up and shaking, much nice they are!!   Thank you. <3"
"I love and agree with almost every second of this, except one of the very last things you say, “there’s just no reasoning a transphobe out of bigotry”, was that it? I may not have gotten it word for word, but that was the point of what you said at the very end, and I’m like, wait a minute, what has this channel been doing for the last couple years then?!?! I mean, I know that that’s probably not the *goal* of the channel, or maybe it’s one of the hopes you have.. idk, I obviously can’t read your beautiful mind, Natalie, but I’m just very confused by that statement.   Sure, transphobia is largely a lizard brain, disgust response, I agree with you for the most part, but isn’t your own movement to acceptance proof that it can be overcome?  My thing is I know several people who were transphobic, some of them pretty hardcore, and they were quite literally reasoned out of their bigotry by this channel, and concurrent “educational” experiences over the last couple years. Forget transphobia, I can think of a bunch of bigoted perspectives that I know people like you have helped people to break free from.   Am I just missing something here? Surely you must know that at least one of the byproducts of your work has been getting bigoted people, transphobic or otherwise, to see the light? Are most bigots convinced? Definitely not, but even if it’s just getting no more than 5% of people to open their eyes, that’s a really, REALLY big deal!   I’m sorry if I misunderstood you, or took that out of context, but that was the one thing in this vid... really in the last several of your vids... where I just really get thrown for a loop, a fruit loop.. lol.. Anyway, I doubt you’ll see this, Nat, but maybe someone else can tell me what I’m missing. ❤️🏴♾"

"Another great commentary and totally right on Cincinnati Chili! Beautiful city otherwise, just let that sludge chili go gang."
"-phobia isn't really a suffix that works. The end makes it here very clear. It's -misia. Hatred. The replacement also protects people that have Phobias, like arachnophobia. Remember: Phobias limit the life of the person that has it. Misia limits the life of others."

"I'm leaving this comment here too because effortpost:  I liked this video but I just wanted to say that ime a lot of TERFs DO relentlessly attack cis women's expressions of gender, even famous ones. Some of the most virulently transmisogynist sites out there are full of self-described 'gender critical radfems' specifically  imageboards are dedicated to gang stalking both cis and trans women, with a focus on cis women who they deem to be unfairly tarnishing the reputation of the female gender (on some imageboards, there are hundreds of threads dedicated to trashing 'e-girls' who they deem to be amusingly mentally ill and unhinged.) Of course the great irony here is that the TERFs are the most active womanhood policers of them all towards trans AND cis women which obviously results in the perpetuation of gender stereotypes. My personal opinion and by examining the demographic of people who tend to be 'gender-critical' (personal experience too) is that a lot of these women feel threatened not just by trans women, but by cis women who they perceive to endanger their sense of the potential for self-individuation via femininity. Sure a lot of TERFs have been sexually traumatized or something in the past, but this just seems to result in their ironically clinging to womanhood while paying lip service to abolishing gender as a coping mechanism. Also, all of this animus results from the fact that a lot of gender-critical people describe themselves as 'apolitical' and thus lack any serious political convictions, let alone a sophisticated analysis of capitalism and how it affects gender and identity politics. Makes it easier for the gender critical people to engage in this endless projection game focused on individuals rather than structures ('patriarchy' in TERFdom is usually too ill defined and mercurial to be an actual structural analysis)"
"[Sigh, placeholder for this long fucking story, which I really have to put in a video,  in which my 40some year adult started realizing that who I claimed to be when I was a teen was still who I was later, and the misogynist stank of one of my interlocutors amongst the rabble young would toss a wench who was a lad then (I can't do this faux-sprach, but I'm really insisting I finally do a video on how it was strangely the boorish version of this person from a while back both made me remember who I was, yet still keep me closeted.) But yeah, I was socialized as a female,, something for which my Nazi fuck father hated, and I'd expect my relation to women... OMG, I will stop now, because I'm bored by this right now.]"

"'excuse my beauty...!' hahaha, this is what grates me about terfs, their lack of appreciation for femininity, in itself misogynistic. As if women aren't supposed to ever WANT to be feminine; there are so many pressures, but I think it doesn't take much to notice the feminine women role models who MEAN their femininity; nor the basic dynamic of sex requiring a complementary relationship, at least between straight couples or masculinity and femininity as gender expressions in a more abstract sense. There's no reason to assume short hair or leg spreading should be neutral rather than masculine; nor that having long hair and wearing makeup should be feminine rather than neutral, on an individual basis.  Femininity is totally valid, and if some of it is derived from physical sex, then in that sense, it IS meant to complement the male counterparts - which is a funny point because by the lesbian terfs' own argument, their identity should be invalid because a female body is meant to be with a male body. It's so deeply cognitively dissonant."

"So, interestingly enough, there is actually more evidence for the 'female born in a males body' argument than just brain makeup. In essence during prenatal development hormones have a much larger impact on the way a person develops. These are called sensitive periods. Females who experienced extra androgens during certain developmental periods actually showed more male characteristics (Better performance on spatial tasks and more likely to play with things like trucks). This is important, as a lot of research shows that men perform better on spatial tasks (Yet, worse on other things, this isn't some kind of weird superiority argument). It's also been proven that boys with higher testosterone during sensitive periods are more likely to play with male typical toys. This was true regardless of socialization. The inverse of this phenomenon has also been shown to be true for males who received too little testosterone/too many estrogens  TL;DR When people are forming in the womb and shortly after hormones seem to be a determining factor in the degree to which a person expresses gender identity, at least in terms of the simple testable markers in current studies. (Female spatial task ability, gender typical toy choices) Socialization was not a factor in these studies (In fact, often parents had tried to socialize them TOWARDS their gender typical activities and failed This goes beyond the brain anatomy of men and women The affects of hormones aren't as strong outside of these sensitive periods SO it is possible that trans people genuinely have developed a 'soul' that is the opposite gender of their body."
"Thank you. Like seriously thank you for answering questions I have. No I'm not Transphobic and i honestly think that people should be able do whatever they want and I'm not one to stop them. But I was concerned when my friend transitioned from a she to a he and all he changed about him was the way he dressed. I was worried about him but now I guess I kind of get why??? So thanks."

"I was recently in a bit a drama with my old 'gender critical' or 'RadFem' gang and while I agree with their gender politics, that gender should be abolished as a necessary component of women's liberation and that it is a system of class oppression to maintain certain reproductive norms... They did often use this as a way to hate transwomen specifically and often be quite harsh to transmen as well. None of their theoretical basis actually even supports the conclusions they've come to, but really they just have for some reason thought that 'The Transexual Empire' is somehow not as bad as it is. I remember distinctly someone referencing a passage about how transwomen *shouldn't* be allowed to transition at all in any capacity (socially or otherwise) in order to protect women as an example of it not being 'that bad' when this was worse than I thought it would have been. Interactions with these people has moved me from radical feminism to Marxist feminism. I still disagree with liberal gender politics, but the fact these people contradict the positions of Shulamith Firestone(who called for the abolition of the sex distinction) or even Dworkin's stance that trans people should have full access to the means by which they can transition, is really painful and has pushed me out of their circles. That and some of them are culty as fuck and it seems a few of the women there prey on the other, and often younger, ones. Which is... Concerning... And even more so when there narrative is that basically every predator is actually a transwoman, sometimes they even just let cismen off the hook and view them less critically. It's weird and discomforting"
"love the video!!! my only addition would be that if TERFs truly cared about 'male socialization' they would ally w trans men, who experience 'female' childhoods yet also male privilege. i don't know about other trans men but i certainly still have instilled fears associated with the 'female' experience, like the constant awareness and fear of the possibility of sexual violence, and memories of my parents not allowing me to do things that my male friends could for fear of being raped. like if any men can empathize with that experience it's trans men!"

"All these gender criticals appear to me as if they have a deep spiritual wound to the feminine, receptive principle of their being. They essentially mock any expressions of femininity, trans women being the easiest targets. I feel it is like a projection, where they reject those qualities in themselves, because being feminine made them feel powerless and hurt in some point of their life, rendering femininity as weak and something to protect. And by ferociously protecting, they are taking up the masculine principle, making a(n angry) disbalance... That all being said (by me, a person who felt degraded and used for being a really feminine girl), hate speech is not the way to healing, which they unconsciously seek."

"Yes, exactly - the point of troll questions is they waste a lot of your time (and if you are not willing to waste your time, the troll takes the point). My new approach is to take the time to thoroughly answer the questions, with the proviso that the troll will listen throughout, will read (if applicable) and comment on, as well as review cited sources. BOTH of our times are gonna be wasted (the the case of a Gish gallop that can be a lot of time). And if a troll refuses to invest that kind of time in their own questions, they are loudly and publicly proclaimed a troll, and thus irrelevant, and from that point on any of their discourse on the subject on which they were trolling is ignored. And PS why do trolls always have all those stupid points and non-trolls don't? Because if you have one, good reason you tend not to sit around bolstering that good reason with a lot of shitty ones, and if shitty reasons are all you have, you try to have as many as possible.   Amazing video, as usual. Smart, insightful, frankly ridiculous production values."

"I don't know if that was supposed to be a joke (cause I'm stupid) but who the actual fuck is cat calling a 9 year old girl?!"
"When I was younger, I was very much a TERF, but like, without knowing what that is or anything. I thought, here are these guys just waltzing into our space after enjoying a life of privilege and putting on a minstrel show of what they think it is to be a woman - boobs, hips, dresses and makeup.   Growing up, I wished that I could be a man, but the surgical transition from female to male (especially in terms of genitalia and its sexual functioning), seemed mutilating. I came to the conclusion that I could never be a man, that even if I were to transition to being a man, that underneath it all I would still be a woman because of the years of conditioning as a woman. So I resigned myself to being a woman, but I decided to not let my gender stand in the way of who I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, and where I wanted to go (or at least to the extent that is possible within legal and social restrictions).   I guess this is why I disliked transsexuals. It was in part a sense of jealousy at how much easier it is (at least by perception) to transition from being a man to a woman. I figured, if I can live as a woman and be satisfied simply having male tendencies, why can’t these people just live in their assigned bodies, and do what I do? Secondly, I found it annoying (and still do really) that transsexual woman get so much attention from the media while trans men are left in the shadows. It’s like, even when presenting as women, men get more spotlight. Thirdly, I thought, why in hell would a man want to give up all the privilege to become a woman? I thought, if they knew, like really knew, what it was like to be a woman, they wouldn’t do it. So to me, that willingness to transition was a signal that trans women had a very simplistic view of womanhood.  But with some thought, I realized that transitioning comes with its own set of issues and dangers, and if someone was willing to go through all that, then who am I to add to their burdens? I still think the world is sexist and it’s not fair, but transsexual men didn’t make it that way. They’re just as much a victim of this shit as anyone else, often more bc as you said, at least I’m a “she” and not an “it” and the people I sleep with (in general) will publicly acknowledge me. I can retreat into my sex and “hide” whenever I need to or want to, but as a trans, you’re putting yourself out there in a way that’s scary and bold. And for that reason, I’m a little bit in awe, because anyone brave enough and resilient enough to live life their way in the face of dickheads and assholes is admirable. (And isn’t living your life with grace, inner strength, and resilience the essence of being of woman?!)"

"15:30 on the topic of masculine uprising. Content(warning): male tears:  This was one of the biggest things keeping me out of feminism, the way male uprising is treated as some form of gift. For sure, it is a position of extreme priviledge, and for sure, the role young girls get is usually the victim of that system.  But being rased as a winner in this sick hiearchical system is, ironically enough, not a treat. The role of a master is psychologically damaging, leaves young men with disfunctional feelings and severed sense of humanity, and forces them to a constant battle against eachother and oppressed groups. And while that role is definitely antagonistic and deserves to be fought against, the priviledge is never enough to satisfy.  This leaves us men in a weird spot. We carry out the same sins of our fathers, but it brings no joy. For most it's a role of misery and pain. We are told the only way out of those 'growing pains' is to rise to the position of masters of the status quo, become the fully aknowledged part of the hierarcy, and constantly strive towards a higher position. At some point this starts probably starts feeling okey, and at the end when you are fifty and people forgive you for shittalking transpeople because 'you are old and important', your head is probably deep enough in your own arse that you tickle your own prostate.  But in my opinion, never does this system actually benefit most men. That's the thing about hierachies. Most supporters are there to lose less - not to enjoy their priviledge. The elevated position is just a couping mechanism for dealing with even higher elevated position.  Opressing and hate can never truly fullfill ones needs. And for me, that summarises my experience as a man. And that is why im feminist. For my own sake, so I myself one day could suffer less from the toxicity I used (and still) inflict on others.  Now some want to call this mentears and whatnot. And that is fair. My point is that men-tears actually come from the same origin. The priviledged class is not a winner - we men just lose less. And that message is an important weapon for connecting with young men like myself, who so often - as we are trained to react - attack feminism because young men feel it's a threat to our personal success. In reality, young men suffer from perverted definition of success, fighting against eachother and hurting those in weaker position, to climb towards a role that can never truly satisfy human needs.  I don't wish to define genders, but I do wish to destroy any hierarchy assosiated with them."
"I two or three times said to you that you look pretty in some videos of yours and on the one hand I feel... sad or called-out that I did that, that I should do better and no 'evaluate' you only after your looks and that's how we as society do with women. But on the other hand I think it's nice to hear that someone calls ou pretty or beautiful. Maybe if someone is used to that then not really, but I rarely hear that so for me is a compliment like any other. And I think that some of these comments (mine too) were said to assure you that you pass. Because you do. And looks are defintely not the only thing that makes people watch you."

"I think you can reason some transphobes out of transphobia. When i first saw trans people when i was around 16 i didn't understand, i didn't get it at all and said vaguely transphobic things, like 'why do you want to be a woman', 'you will never be a real woman and you won't be able to give birth'. I saw trans youtubers say 'i am a real woman' and i just didn't get it, so thought they were delusional. What changed my mind was when a trans woman simply expressed that they know they aren't a biological female, but they feel happier living their life as a woman, now that i could understand, i have always been of the attitude just let people live the way they want to live and express themselves they want to, so simply saying they feel happier living that way was enough to then make me accepting. I then learned about the difference between biological sex and gender and the brain structure evidence for trans people.   Then many years before the 'are traps gay' memes and debate, i saw a ted talk basically explaining that anonymous data collected from all the porn sites showed that a vast many straight men watch porn of trans women, the reason being they look like women,  men are mostly visual in their arousal, so seeing breasts a feminine face and body all still arouse men. It made sense because gay men aren't for the most part aroused by feminine bodies and appearance, they are attracted to masculine bodies and appearance. People are not primarily attracted by genitals , you can't see them when your in public, but yet you still see people that are very attractive to you.   So rather than giving up on reasoning transphobes out of transphobia, i think it is likely the only way forward, just saying the discussion is off the table isn't going to work. Gay people would have never got acceptance if it wasn't for them explaining to people how they feel and the hate and abuse they have received and the science backing it.  Some people may still consider me a transphobe because my understanding from the science is there are 2 biological sexes, i think gender can vary, but the reason i understand biological sex is truly binary is because biological sex has to do with reproduction and to reproduce you need 2 components, 1 sperm and 2 an egg. Intersex people exist ofc but to my knowledge none of them have 2 sets of functioning reproductive organs, so they can't reproduce with both sexes, i haven't seen any intersex people that are mid way between sexes, i have only seen them as like 98% 1 way or the other with a medical condition that is an anomaly. A persons sex isn't solely determined by genitals or gonads, its a combination of traits and structures, just like being human is not defined by 1 sole feature, its a collection of features and structures. Humans typically have 2 legs, that does not mean someone born with 1 leg is not human or that humans are now on a spectrum of how many legs they have, no they are fully human just that their amount of legs is anomalous in the population where the other 99% of humans are born with 2 legs. Exceptions to a rule do not disprove a rule, unless there are more exceptions to the rule than apply to the rule.  I am willing to change my mind on the science, i am willing to be shown to be wrong, but so far i haven't heard a convincing argument or seen evidence contradicting my view."

"I wouldn't say I was ever a TERF, but at an earlier point in my life, I shared many of these concerns about what transgender people meant to the feminist discourse I knew.  [Long story warning!]   I was a huge tomboy as a child, and enjoyed stereotypically male play and clothing. I found it extremely unfair that the type of play I enjoyed and clothes which were actually comfortable were the domain of boys. I remember saying something to the effect of 'I wish I was a boy!' to my mother at around age 9-10. In the early 2000s, my mother interpreted this as me rebelling against gender norms. She subscribed to the 2nd wave feminist views she grew up with in general. Her insight helped me through those feelings of inadequacy and rightly identified that it was a case of what would nowadays be called 'gender non-conformism'. She bought me what she considered 'unisex' (now, gender-neutral?) clothing (it was boys clothing that didn't scream BOY), let me cut my hair and took me to Judo class. After puberty, I became more feminine and gender conforming and my life became a lot easier.  When trans activism started gaining traction recently, I went back to my 9-year-old tomboy self and asked: 'If this were today, would my mother have thought I was a transgender boy?' This bothered me deeply. I thought 'How many girls like me could be misinterpreted because of gender stereotypes!?' This lead me to have many TERFy concerns expressed in this video. Mainly: 'We should be moving AWAY from gender' and stuff like that, especially when it comes to children. Stories about parents letting their trans children pause* puberty to facilitate transition later horrified me.   Of course, I never really wanted to be a boy. I wanted to be free, like Sylvia Plath, of what I perceived were tethers holding me down because I was a girl. Once I realised this distinction, between gender non-conformism and gender dysphoria, I started taking some steps towards more sane lines of thought. I wanted to understand what trans people thought of gender issues. After I opened my eyes and actually decided to hear trans voices, I pretty much alleviated all of my concerns.  I'm now proud to call myself an intersectional feminist and hope we can achieve gender equality not only for our cis sisters but also for our trans sisters, who came to share our gender later in life. I hope we can break these rigid gender norms together and allow girls and boys of the next generations to be free.  *edited"
"Everyone has two parents.  Gender absolutism is a myth.  We all round up to be a man or a woman, more or less as needed, to simplify our gender status.  This is a personal process that is not largely open to social understanding.  We should all stop thinking that we know other people better than they know themselves.  Respect the complex math that is involved.  In conclusion, Natalie + Kim Petras = 2 Sweet to Deny."

"Kim Petras still experienced a radically different childhood from cis women/girls because she had a say in things. That's not to say that she chose to be female, but she did choose to be treated as one by coming out. Perhaps she was choosing between life and death there, but she still chose nevertheless, and that's a choice that cis women never get. They get womanhood violently forced onto them from birth and never have a say in the matter or get to formulate thoughts on their womanhood until much, much later. The understanding of gender and agency that trans girls (and I mean girls, not women) have is something that cis girls never have.  I think that age of transition matters a lot less than what people around you treated you as. Sure, the life experiences of a trans woman who came out as soon as she could speak would be different from an old trans woman who had a wife and several biological children before coming out, but I would still say they have more in common with each other than the early transitioner does with a cis woman."
"I still have issues with the 'abolish gender' question, I haven't thought of it as a weapon against trans people, but rather something to empower them. Like, it doesn't matter how the people identify you as, if you act however you want to. What matters is the material effect you produce out of your actions. Ofc this doesn't happen at all in current society, but this should be my ideal world."
"My two cents are, as always, quite light — but man, I truly do hope the 'menstruator' terminology does not catch on. It provokes the same visceral reaction 'bleeder' does, so I definitely do understand why someone might automatically peg it as misogynistic. (That being said, a gender-neutral term people who menstruate void of such unfortunate associations would be a-okay.)"

"In a world where law enforcement and society isn't quite sure how to deal with cyberbullying, we have a heroine named Natalie Wynn doing God's work."
"I think the transmedicalist position was a bit over-simplified. The only 'doctrine', so to speak, of the transmed ideology is that some level of gender dysphoria is expected- not an intense self-hatred but at least a disconnect from your assigned gender. The majority of us seem to be trans men who are tired of this idea that anyone is trans just because they say so, which leads to peoples ideas of being being able to identify as attack helicopters and detransitioners and people who think they can 'experiment' with gender by going on hormones only in the end to cause themselves actual dysphoria. Saying your transgender without dysphoria is like saying you're depressed but don't experience depression. There's just integral part to the experience of being transgender that can't be ignored without consequences."
"I wonder if TERF angst has something to do with the envy that they think they can't choose who they want to be. To be clear, I don't think it's a choice being trans like it's not a choice being cis-hetero or any other configuration. What they  fail to see is that they don't have to live the stereotypical cis-woman's life. I don't know, these are just thoughts of a cis-woman."

"I know that the gaming community at large is TOXIC, but derailing a toxic society is hard and takes a lot of work from those trying to oppose it, and to say yes all gamers is kind of ignorant of some of the efforts by gamers to really change the culture for the better. The super smash bros community, for example, is highly toxic and although there are prominent females in the scene, they are constantly berated and attacked for anything they do, BUT there are some people who publicly oppose this culture and they shouldn't be attacked for trying to experience a dynamic piece of art and better its community. Omni for example, who has a youtube channel by the same name, frequently speaks up about these issues and has called out the misogyny of the community every time it prevails. He's even made donation funds to go to top placing women at tournaments. I won't pretend even for a second that he's perfect, but if the argument here is that gamers are bystanders by participating in toxic communities, I think he derails that a little bit. I'd love to see a more measured response from you about this issue, whether it be in a video or just on twitter, because I'm sure you have your own good reasons to believe it and I'd like to hear them.

"More and more I find that it is a privilege to be able to calmly discuss the issue at hand without becoming emotional and 'losing it'. People who have had traumatic experiences are often unable to make the best arguments, because the bitter taste in their mouth is such that they can only scream. If you've had cock shoved down your throat (often literally) your whole life, it's understandable that you'll have a hard time feeling safe when there's cock around. If you've been expected to hide and apologize your whole life, then it's understandable when you lash out at the insinuation that you should 'tone it down'. I feel I've worked on my trauma enough to be able to do so and not scream, so here are my concerns.   I feel you make a number of great points, Natalie (and thank you for taking on this wasp nest of a topic) but when you talk about the reptilian-brain disgust-type response to trans people, it strikes me that mysoginy works the same way — there's no shortage of gay men and trans women expressing their disgust of the female (xx) anatomy and bodily functions. It is dehumanizing and hard to defend, even though I am aware that the people spilling this crap are often very traumatized, as I've mentioned above. I'm sure you too, Natalie, as a student of all things bigoted, have read the violent, slurry discourse online from both sides (transfeminists and radfems).   I watched this 'internet feud' dismantle some of the most powerful feminist online spaces and have since taken my activism elsewhere (offline) because I was losing my mind. I can put a man in his place at 8am before my cup of tea, but I can't be knocking down other women in a space meant to be safe for women. The feminist internet battlefield is a patriarchal dream. In my personal experience, the Trans v. TERF battles showed up largely as an issue of access, and I honestly don't see the harm in most instances of so-called exclusion. To me, it's alsmost a non-issue that some feminist spaces will naturally be oriented to cis-women, and that others will naturally be oriented to trans-women, and that others will be intersectional and larger. They don't need to be officially exclusionary, but it is a very organic thing that the more specific a discussion becomes, the more exclusionary it will feel — I mean, can you imagine a cis-lesbian claiming protagonism at a trans forum and calling everyone 'lesbophobes' because the topics of discussion don't apply to her experience? Of course trans people have a right to define their experience (and need the time and safe space to do so) of womanhood, but the vaporization of all things 'woman' does make it hard to have the conversations that are necessary to healing, for both cis and trans women, I'm guessing. I wonder if it'd be as comfortable for  a trans woman discussing an experience related to her own 'female penis' (for example) to get vulnerable online in a community where a cis woman might 'chime in' without necessarily being invited to do so. Frankly what I see (as a privileged 'not so broken that I can't think about it calmly' cis woman) is a two diverse groups of traumatized people who are hurting so bad they need healing spaces.   Also, I notice that people who have been disenfranchised for a long time have a hard time acknowledging that they do have some power to hurt another. But here's the thing, though: when transfeminists and radfems are pitted against one another online, this makes the inextricably  connected — and this is heightened when we only amplify the most radicalized voices in both sides of the dispute: the violence against the (perceived) other is soothing for the traumatized at a certain point. Yet both transfeminists and radical feminists, including the 'gender critical' in question, have more pressing issues to address than each other. That's when actual radical feminist theory comes in handy. Transfeminists and radfems attacking one another do less to expose the other 'team's' phallacies and blind spots than to give a pass to the real oppressor. You know, the ones historically killing us off and brutalizing us? The root of the problem so to speak?   It bothers me immensely that radical feminism has become (on the internet anyway) synonymous with 'don't bring your trans girlfriend to our soirée' — it's a spaying and neutering of a brilliant theory that describes the world in a very accurate way. Just as marxism, it describes the world based on a particular point in history. Is marxism a perfect way to describe the world in 2019? Fuck, no. But it is useful to describe changing dynamics — like a pair of glasses you can put on to look at something from a Marxist perspective. Radical feminism is a very useful way to look at the power dynamics in the gender binary, and while it does not account for the whole gender spectrum it is certainly useful to understand historical patterns in this changing world. I suppose what really bothers me is the silencing and fear that pushes 'moderates' to the sidelines and turns the entire dispute of online spaces between TERFs into a screaming match. Can everyone just put down the baseball bats for a second? Here's hoping. ;)"

I’m not interested in having my own kids the “traditional way” but there are trans men who totally are and can you imagine what navigating the world during that time frame must be like for them?

"Germaine Greer really is an awful human being at times."
"Love u Natalie but u seemed 2 be insinuating that trans people don’t need dysphoria 2 be trans......can u explain?"
"22:34 Isn't this argument just 'no u'? Who cares about concept erasure or some out-there stuff, how about we just let medicine be medicine, everything else is just larp."
"At this point I honestly don't know how I lived my life before I discovered your videos.   Aaaaaaaas a traaaaaaans woman, you have honestly helped give me so much hope and confidence in my own transition, and every time I start having imposter syndrome you make everything better for me. We love you!"
"I love that you have to wear like 20 layers of makeup to even remotely resemble a woman, but a woman can be in a coma and literally unaware of her own existence but SHE as a BIOLOGICAL woman can get pregnant and you can't."
"This is exactly what I needed to get me out of this hangover."
"'I'm Ahi Tuna'  Bwahahahahahahahahaha, this is my new line!  Thank you ContraPoints."
"Fuck. I just realized my first exposure to transgender people was through Maury Povich."
"ContraPoints back at it again with a great dose of humor, education, production value and weirdness. I stan!"
"I'm a cis  woman, but I've always gravitated towards gender neutral presentation. In high school, because I didn't look feminine and had a bunch of traditionally masculine hobbies, a whole bunch of people would never refer to me by feminine pronouns, almost exclusively calling me 'it.' Not a good feeling. It's not just being misgendered, it's being dehumanized. Because I was an 'it,' I didn't count. The whole idea of calling someone 'it' just makes my blood boil. And I'm cis, for fucks sake. I cant even imagine how much it hurts trans kids."
"Natalie without makeup looks for all the world like Agent Olivia Dunham from Fringe."
"I wholeheartedly reject the idea that my identity as a woman must be defined by the worst things that have happened to me, which is how I see the essential core of the 'you don't know what it's like' rhetoric. Like... I've been sexually abused, but my womanhood is not contingent on that. I've already spent too long defining my life by what happened. That's (part of) why I'm in therapy now, so I can stop doing that."
"i disagree with the part about transmedicalists. yes, the transmed community can be shitty and i wouldn't want to invalidate someone's negative experiences with it, but it also isn't how it is described in the video. transmedicalism means that one thinks that being trans is a medical condition which is rooted in gender dysphoria. the intensity of dysphoria doesn't matter. if you only experience some dysphoria then that's good for you! gender dysphoria doesn't equal self hate or being suicidal. unfortunately, many do experience gender dysphoria more intensely, but that doesn't make them 'more trans'.   well in any case, very good video! #yesallgamers"
"I’m really surprised you didn’t mention ROGD! Would it be possible for you to do a video addressing that particularly TERF conspiracy theory?"
"The biggest issue is the safety of children.  There is obviously going to be men who use the guise of a trans women to gain access to public restrooms and other places mostly inhabited by women.  The fact that people care more about their feelings of identity over the safety of kids just makes them seem demonic.  Which they are."
"I'm not entirely sure if this is going to make a whole lot of sense, but when it comes to whether I always was a man or became one when I started transitioning I've always come out with 'was always a man'. I would constantly mentally correct people when they called me by female pronouns, I never managed to consider myself 'one of the girls' despite only ever hanging out with them, and if left to my own devices I would always find ways to act more boyish. It was more like people perceived me to be a girl and therefore only interacted with me as if I was a girl, rather than me being one. Like the people around me never saw 'The Real Me'. And if they never saw the real me, can I ever claim to have been a girl? I'm not going to claim we're two completely different people, but if I could always look at her and say 'Practically none of this resembles me at all. Yea, you've got the basics, but it's all twisted into a fundamentally different framework. How could I ever look like that?' can I reliably claim that 'I' was a girl?  On a different note, I'm kind of curious as to trans men's and NB's place in this discussion. It feels like no matter where I go it's mostly either people hating on trans women or trans women making the best of their situation. Even with people just citing trans people it always seems to go back to trans women with two exceptions that I've found so far. NBs haven't even got that though, as far as I can tell. It sometimes comes off as if we're hated as a byproduct of people hating trans women, and that we're mostly forgotten by the side fighting for our rights and wellbeing. I don't think that's necessarily the case or that any of it is done intentionally in the off chance that it might be how things are. I completely understand that trans women have a lot of things to deal with, especially if you're part of another minority group as well. I don't want to undermine or take away from the struggles you go through. I'm more curious as to whether these feelings are somewhat justified or if I'm just really bad at looking for these things"
"Damn, Nat went to town in that summary."
"I haven't even gotten past the 1:13 mark and I know we're in for the good-good today. Love you,  Natalie! Thank you, honestly and truly for all the work you do <3 <3 I hope you understand how many people you support and know that we support you too"
"i just recently became a gender critical radfem so i was excited to see this video in my subbox. i wished however that when you were disputing the point about gender stereotypes you didnt just say 'no thats not what a trans woman feels when she says shes a woman ' but like described feelings trans women share.(i know this isnt your job but i was just expecting that from the introduction) because i too dont get what this 'feeling' is of being a woman. also about the slur thing (i dont think terf is a slur too) i wished that you at least mentioned how its always 'kill terfs', 'rape terfs till they arent transphobic' ,' they just wish they had the balls to transition to men' or 'shoot them all in the pussy' and of course 'DONT INTERACT WITH THIS POST!!' i personally became gender critical because of this in the first place. i believe its important to study and dispute the other sides points.  anyways still an interesting video. :)"
"I can't wait till women hating women gets passe. The whole 'I'm not like other women/girls', the slut shaming, disgust at someone who don't follow in the lines, the anger, body shaming, and self hating fuckery needs to go. When little girls don't feel the need to label themselves tomboys or girly girls to feel included. When will we stop hating each other just because someone doesnt fit the feminine ideal if society or one person's ideas. When will we stop turning out lips at others identity expressions. Let people be people. 'Your utopian pipe dream is valid' I hope so."
"Gotdamn!!! That last line was killer! One of your best vids."
"Your.👏 Utopian. 👏Pipe dream👏. Is. 👏Valid👏  🤣🤣🤣 When she said that. I don't know.  I'm tired."
"what happened to Cockbane 😭"
"FWIW, although Gender Abolition is often co-opted by bad faith TERFS, it's also a concept that's been developed by a lot of trans people (myself included) who think of abolishing gender as exactly that long term project that abolishing borders or prisons is, with the goal not being abolishing gendered characteristics (everyone being genderless robots) but for gendered characteristics to not be attached to symbolic power structures that restrict gendered expression and play, and I don't think it's exactly fair to characterize it as a pie in the sky Utopia when the reality of the process of gender assignation at birth is something is something that intersex people advocate for the end for because the specific violating way that the process affects them.   Abolition isn't destruction of gendered characteristics, it's a deconstruction of the system policing it, and reconstructing a new system that works for people who aren't just binary (this is in line with a lot of writings on Prison Abolition by Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore if anyone's interested on the history of Prison Abolition as a concept!)"
"NEER NEER NEER NEER NEER"
"What annoys me also about TERFs is a lot of them complain about trans women in female spaces such as meetings of feminists and lesbians yet are usually the biggest slacktivists for women’s causes on earth. I was truly shokt that enough of them got off their asses to march in London. Didn’t know they had it in them."
"I like the style, but honestly really don't understand what any of this is about."
"Instead of TERF, I use the term FART- feminism appropreating  reactionary transphobes"
"You're a riot Natalie ❤ brilliant on point as always. XO"
"Love your work xox"
"I see r/gendercritical isn’t freaking out at all in the wake of this video"
"You squeeze mine, Anita. ;)"
"It causes me endless amusement and disdain that TERFS reduce women to biological function and sex organs ignoring...cis woman who have no wish to reproduce, or cis women who have hysterectomys, or cis woman who are infertile or otherwise cannot menstruate or reproduce or simply that reducing women to biology and sexual function is...kinda misogynistic. Really, cis women, trans women, non-binary people, femme men or just queer men in general...fuck it even cis straight men whether they are men on colour or not, in some degree, we are all harmed by the structure in place and should all be able to recognise each other's struggles and experiences and find some common ground under the umbrella of feminism. Cis women and Trans women, and trans men, should be able to relate to each other and see we are in similar boats, floating in the same sea, and have tools we could offer to help each other navigate the shit we face together and individually far more easily than anyone else. It's sad how that is lost."
"My queen is Contrapoints Your queen is a lizard"
"Nice one Contra - you have exactly nailed (esp. from 31:20) what it is about trans women I have always admired and which prompted me, from the first, to lend them/you my solidarity. Go grrl."
"I don't even like gender as a way of categorizing humans.   I'm a very emotional man who cries in movies, loves the arts, and would rather go pick flowers with my son than go to a bar with the guys.    I get called effeminate often.  But I'm also strong and athletic and competitive.  I can start a fire and want to bite into every cow I see.  I practice mixed martial arts.  What's wrong with relying on biological sex to differentiate us rather than some semi-rigid list of personality traits and interests?   Are you not a biological male who simply likes and enjoys the things you like and enjoy like I am?    Without gender mucking things up do you think you could more easily own who you are?  My sex is male and I like a lot of 'girly' shit.  I'm good with this."
"Just because people call you 'miss' and 'she' it doesn't mean they can't tell you used to be a man. They know you're trans and just call you that."
"Cried at the “COPS” episode part. I’ve had cops dig through my stuff  to try to  really shame/hurt/provoke me in a deeply personal way, and I cannot imagine what it feels like when you wear those vulnerabilities on your sleeve. Very very moving. Still crying. Cheers."
"I wish I had an ounce of your wittiness."
"What do u think about trans ppl in sports? even though I am a transwoman I dont think transwoman should be allowed into female sports. I had a change of mind after seeing this vid  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Iok5At7Hw"

"Your use of classical music is top notch. Bravo!"

"You laugh as you proceed to drink tea from the teapot is life."
"You win for best costumes and set design on youtube. Very impressive!   The part with Stephanie Yellowhair made me cry. I hadn't seen that video before. So fucking depressing that beautiful people have to be around that level of ugliness."
"leave my cincy chili alone 😭😭"
"I love this video along with so many others of yours but the only issue I had was the poor representation of what transmedicalism is. Transmeds do not believe that being trans is based off suffering or hating yourself. The only belief transmeds have as a whole is that you need gender dysphoria to be trans. You can love yourself and be trans. You can be GNC and trans. You can be happy and trans. But you are only trans if you have a disconnect between your mental gender and body (aka dysphoria). It’s a medical fact and dysphoria is what drives trans people to, Well, be trans. If someone didnt have a disconnect with their birth sex, why would they want to transition? And if they do transition, they’ll only give themselves dysphoria when they end up looking like the opposite sex when they didn’t want to, Being trans is not a choice and LGBT people have to fight to let people know it is not a choice but people who are against transmedicalism make being trans out to be a choice."
"8:02 Can I just say I'm proud of my country for actually doing scientific research into transsexuality?"
"As always I gasped when I saw this in my notifications, new Contrapoints videos are always the highlight of my week! You've really outdone yourself this time, especially with your Inner Terf, when she was revealed I just about screamed."
"about feminist activisim - here in Argentina we are currently fighting to legalize abortion, and the whole language issue came up obviously (nobody wanted to be reduced to being baby-making incubator bodies) and it's still work in progress  but something i can tell you, is that in every protest, assembly, and march, is that there are trans people, both women men travestis and nb, whether people like it or not. what happened to the good old 'you don't have to be part of the cause to support it'?"
"What a legend!"
"wow I love a woman"
"This is what happens when we give women the right to vote."
"'Excuse my beauty', in that situation, to those people... I just have no words. That woman is made of fucking steel. She has nothing but my utmost respect."
"ok that quick boob lift was HILARIOUS    also, this is the first time I've heard someone else behind the camera, warmed my heart :D"
"it took me very few contacts with TERFs and their rhetoric to recognize that their core beliefs are centered around making their poorly concealed,  bigoted hatred for trans women seem like a rational thing to do if you want to fight for women's rights, and as it always happens with ideologies based on hatred and exclusion, a lot of their rhetoric makes me, a cis lesbian, feel extremely unsafe, constantly patronized and objectified for my womanhood. in attempts to exclude trans women as much as possible, TERFs will and do attack other women for performing their femininity wrong, ostracize them for not doing the right kind of feminism or purposefully misgender them for standing up for trans women. i feel reduced to bunch of glamorized stereotypes of abstract female goddess hailed for having ovaries by TERF/radfem crowd, instead of just a human who happened to be born female and is comfortable with it   i know and acknowledge that the most of the heat from TERFs and radfems is aimed at trans women, but as i look at how many young lesbians adopt radfem lite ideas and then start openly supporting trans-exclusive movements, i look how radfems are outright using covert tactics, akin to crypto-fash crowd, flirting with the ideas of how much you can exclude from LGBT without outright stating 'drop the T' and see what starts rooting in queer spaces (see tumblr now). i think that a good way to start diverting young women, especially queer, from being recruited into this movement is by learning that TERFs are not friends for cis women either."
"one of the best so far"
"Watching this while nicely drunk on a Sunday at 3pm, hope you approve! All the love."
"❣️"
"You must really dislike Cincinnati 😂"
"Nice china.  'The Menstruaters' is a good name for a punk band."
"What a fucking shit show.   1) you insult womanhood about 60 times. How you ever claimed to be a feminist, before transitioning, is laughable.   2) Claiming some male asshole at the corner store is the result of some barely known or read Greer is fucking ridiculous. Barely anyone is reading radfem literature or discussions. The world is a TERF.   3) TERF is a slur, because it's centering radfem on gender ideology, not the actual tenants of radfem. Yes, GC can be a fuckin cesspool of obsession and hate speech, but it is not the core of radfem.   4) Sincerely, how the fuck are you more sympathetic to incels than women you claim daily existence with? Is it that you still believe fuckability is more important than human functioning? This channel has gone to shit in the past year. Must be nice to be raking in the dough, when being a failed student led to you to create more honest and morally true content. #peakcontrapoints"
"Production quality just went up to 11."
"Today on, 'What the fuck is this and why is it in my recommendations?'"
"I absolutely loved this video! Fabulous introduction to these issues! However, it made me curious as to what the more fully developed opinions and theories are of those presented in the 'gender metaphysics' section. Does anyone know good papers or thorough, scholarly work on gender metaphysics?"
"So what do you think the guy on the steps of the liquor store would say?  I think he's the guy that would die defending you on the street. HUN."
"Although there are transmedicalists who love to claim victim status, so they complain about the pain of dysphoria constantly, most actually don't. The main point of being a transmed is to bring awareness to the fact that gender dysphoria is indeed a real condition that people suffer from and that the only way to elevate that is to transition. Because of this, transitioning for any other reason is pointless and can be very dangerous (especially if you're physically transitioning)."
"ContraPoints videos should be shown to anyone considering taking gender/womens/sociology studies at college. They're the purest form of aversion therapy. Each one a perfectly contained example of insanity."
"Abolishing Gender is not really THAT utopian. Portraying not gendered people as asexual robots is kinda like saying that socialists want to collectivise your tooth brushes. I mean, if I'm already for abolishing of borders, capitalism, patriarchy, imperialism and other systems of opression, why not add gender to that list? PS: Actually, Kropotkin..."
"Your outtakes are amazing.  Not as amazing as the video, but still just 100% greatness"
"'your utopian pipe dream is valid' 😂😭"
"It's the likes of blaire white and myer who made me dislike trans people when I didn't even comprehend the concept of transgenderism  because one is an anti feminist bigot and the other an MRA ( idk if she still is) until I stumbled upon your videos thank god"

"You twits do realize that life exists outside of the internet, right? Normal, average people agree with gender critical feminists on this issue. So, you guys are basically just campaigning for a Trump 2020 victory when you push this fiction into people's faces harder and harder."
"I have never commented on a contrapoints video because I'm always watching on my tv so I can't comment. But today I'm on my laptop and just wanna say once and for all the times I wanted to say this before: THANK YOUUUU NATALIE WYNN. seriously thank you for gracing the world with these well researched and pointed  and nuanced videos. About to go become a patron because I'm ashamed I wasn't one already."
"that wallpaper is fuckin unreal"
"This beauty was posted on my birthday, thank you so much Natalie for the best gift I got for my birthday."
"Not all transneds thinks you need to hate your body to be trans. Many think that its important non dysphoric trans people wont give themselves hormones because it can actually give them a reversed dysphoria and it drains recourse from actual trans people. It also makes it look like a big joke only fueling terfs and right wingers transphobia and the stigma surrounding trans people. Youre very rational contrapoints shouldnt you be able to see this."
"Dunno if you'll ever see this comment, but, i remember like a few years ago watching a video where you had some back and forth with the golden one, and i thought to myself that you looked like a dude in a dress. Now, though you have changed quite a lot, you're very attractive even.  A rather successful transition if i say so. Cheers."
"I was socialized as a girl, and I have actually never been catcalled. It’s bullshit to say that all “women” has this homogenous experience growing up. Yes, there are elements that are similar, but it’s not like we all experienced the exact same things."
"The logic of TERFs  confuses me , the idea that to be something you have to experience the oppression of that thing. I grew up in a open and excepting household so I barely had to come out as a lesbian and so I am not as afraid or self-hating  as other LGBTQ+ peoples. Does this mean that I am not a lesbian because I do not experience the oppression of it?"
"I don't find your depiction honest at all. You've assumed bad-faith throughout. Every 'open-minded' statement comes with a back-handed jibe. You've admitted there are good points being made, but *hand wave* it doesn't matter because trans people are oppressed and terfs are evil, or *hand wave* I don't actually agree with that anyway and terfs are still evil. You've cherry picked a lot of stuff that makes terfs look hostile and hateful, but you know full well there is 10x worse from trans people that could easily be used to characterise them. Most noticeably you haven't engaged whatsoever with probably their main criticism: Self-ID leading to an erosion of female protections - whether in terms of safeguarding or in the job-market or in sports. I see myself as a 'centrist' in this discussion, and I don't agree with a lot of what terfs say, but I see way more shady tactics (no platforming, aggressive behaviour, ad hominems, logical fallacies) on the trans side of the discussion and its hard not to factor that in."
"I'm completely onboard with this line of thought.  I'm wondering if this also commits us to parallel views about transracialism.  The biggest differences that I can see are that there doesn't see to be a trans-race community, so perhaps there is less seen to be at stake, and that a transracial experience may not be as characterized by suffering.  But I think the main objections to transracialism would be met by similar responses offered here."
"you look absolutely gorgeous in that white robe .... my goodness"
"First of all: thank you for making this video. I have tried to find other sources to where these conversations are had, but it seems in every forum I frequent these discussions and the people trying to have them have been dismissed as transphobic. (Which I also understand better now, after you explained how it's often used as time-wasting trolling. I kind of feel like I should have understood it without explanation considering I have experienced the same thing debating incels and nazis... so I guess that's on me.) I understand the need for trans people to protect their own mental health, but for me it lead to random tumblr posts of varying terfiness being the most readily available source material on these things, which is... not ideal. So again, thank you for taking the time to tackle this and present your viewpoints. It has helped clear up some misunderstandings I've had about how radical feminism and trans feminism fit together.  About the 'abolish gender' argument: I get where you are coming from, but at the same time it frustrates me when people simply dismiss it. Partly because we have actually made progress towards that goal. Partly because I actively try to break free from and advocate against gender roles in my everyday life and encourage people to not let gender roles restrict them, and I experience the social repercussions of it: awkward silences, ridicule, contempt, or just plain disgust. I absolutely agree that the 'calling out' should be targeted primarily towards influencial cis people, because, well, they are the ones doing most of the influencing... And I act accordingly. But when people talk about how their barista should have known not to call them by a masculine pronoun because they were wearing makeup, or how their parents always knew deep down they were a boy because they liked trucks, or how they just love doing housework since they began taking estrogen, they still validate the same structures. Again, I get that trans people risk worse backlash than I do and need to protect themselves, and that drawing upon socially accepted discourse helps them do so, but it does not make encountering another argument about the 'female soul' any less frustrating. Especially because libfems and antifems are always so quick to jump on it and go 'yes, see, women are just naturally like this because nature, no need to think about social structures'. And honestly, I think a lot of the backlash against trans people, nb people and other members of the queer community exists precicely because people are stuck in the whole evo psych 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' gender binary bulls*it, and simply can't handle the thought of people with prostates wearing dresses.  If anyone reading this feel like they have something to add or disagree with me on anything in this post, I would be very thankful if you took the time to reply. I am legitimately trying to work this stuff out, but I'm not perfect."
"HANNUKAHSTROPHY"
"You say that you perform over-the-top femininity because you're afraid of being misgendered or not being seen as 'woman enough' - what does that say about transgenderism? That in fact there is more to manhood and womanhood than performing masculinity and femininity. Performing femininity is the only thing that is stopping you from being recognised for what you are - a male. It's an illusion, a performance. You're just overcompensating because you know that people will see you for what you are if you don't. Most natural women don't have to worry about not being perceived as a woman even if we don't act super feminine because it's evident by just looking at us and listening to us. We have female voices, female bodies, female bone structure, etc. I've yet to know of a transwomen that doesn't speak like an extremely effeminate gay male. We have different bodies and that is reflected in how we are perceived. Transwomen may be able to imitate certain body parts and gender affectations, but they will never be a whole woman."

I grew up bullied by a lot of people which i think  helped me grow up into a person who tries to empathize with other's experiences but it's videos like contrapoints that really helped put a voice to those experiences."

"It's funny because, being someone who *kinda* get some points of both sides of the matter, TERF still sound kinda ridiculous to me for many points The only situation that I'd slightly agree to their point of view is when someone tries to 'justify' (as if it needs to be justified) their trans-ness by lines such as 'I liked playing Barbie as a child!' 'I like pink!' and very simple things culturally associated to the female universe. But it's simply rude to think only your way of thinking is valid and deny that trans women find a safe place in the 'female universe'. Why can't you just let people be what they want to be and feel more comfortable being, when it's not harming you or other people?    Another thing I don't get is the *literal* 'man-hatred'. First of all, because it ends up adding to that 'feminists hate men' thing and makes it seems like a true statement. Second of all, because the 'all men are naturally scummy and will always be' is basically adding to the patriarchy conception that men have the right to do some scummy actions because that adds to their masculinity."

"As a guy who does not really identify as a radical feminist, but is mostly in agreement with their arguments, I may have a biased or sometimes wrong view on where the radfems do indeed stand, but I still feel like I can add a bit to the discussion.  Many of your radfem arguments are things I have heard or read them say indeed, so kudos to you, for not misrepresenting those. Nevertheless I feel like you don't really engage with them fairly. One of the problems, is that you make concessions the trans movement in general doesn't seem to make. For example you are saying that it is ok to call male people words that reduce us to our genitalia too, but in the end it is just not done, so the question prevails: Why is this sort of dehumanizing language mostly used for women? Also why not use male people and female people, aren't these perfectly fine words to signify biological sex? Furthermore, radfems use the terms TIM and TIF for very similar reasons, you have for using the term TERF, they think they otherwise would be making concessions to an ideology they do not agree with and which they think is dangerous.  Another thing is that you say, they are acting in disgust, because you have seen a few radfems being disgusted by a transwomen, I agree that some do behave like that, but to me that does not seem representative of the movement. You say that 'there is no way, that transwomen could behave, that terfs would accept', because they oppose 'transwomen being transwomen' but I think you slightly miss the mark here. They oppose the idea that transwomen can be women, which also means they have a problem with most transwomen regardless of how they behave, as long as they seem to believe, that they are women, most of them (but not all) seem to be fine with dragqueens for example. They simply think any transwomen who says they are a woman is delusional (the same obviously goes for transmen who say they are men).  In my mind suggesting to transpeople to undergo transition to cure their dysphoria seems akin to telling a paranoid person: ''They' are really out there to get you, but don't be afraid, I can sell you a gun and home security systems.'  There are also a few important arguments, that you seem to have missed, but I think this is enough textwall for now."
"I was tearing at the end. You're awesome"
"As a trans guy (biologically female) I’ve never been shamed for my period. Ever. Lmao"
"I just came from r/GenderCritcal. It was everything I expected and more. Their reaction to this video was pure yikestiny."
"The ceramic teapot-feel"
"I swear you amaze me each and every time. I love the way you jump over the intellectual  hoops that society throws at us. Its good to see a transwoman  who can balance so many  elements and nuances and present them in entertaining and thoughtful way. Cant wait for the next one!<3"
"I have the one question that matters, in all time. How does one walk in heels."
"How this channel doesn't have a million subs yet is beyond me"
"TIL that me identifying as a cis-man is actually incorrect, because at age 6 I decided I want to have long hair and thus was dismissed and harassed as a girl to the age of 16. Actually I'm non-binary, because I experienced oppression as a female as a child and young teenager, while experiencing male privilege (and problems) in my late teens and as an adult."
"I love the outtakes in this one! They really show how much fun you have making contrapoints!"
"I'd just like to say that no one person has the same experiences, and that trying to say that a group of people goes through the same things is ludicrous.  I mean, I grew up female [and identify as a NB female [okay, so I'm old and this is new to me?]], and I never had a problem just free ranging around by myself up until my 20s.  Anyway, I've never had the time for anyone who is a hater, including TERFs.  I might mess up pronouns for some folks [they as a singular is still hard for me], but if someone identifies as a woman, then, as far as I'm concerned, they are.  And if someone identifies as a man, ditto.  Anyway, I think you are a lovely, witty and clever young woman, and I'd like to thank you for your time in putting all your videos together and sharing your thoughts."
"I require outfit links in the description because ICONIC and I need the red hat!"
"Had never even heard of TERFS before, great video nonetheless lovely"
"Goddamn it where do you even GET all these utterly amazing outfits..."
"Thank you Natalie! I fucking love you"
"Thank you for this, I really did appreciate your approaching with nuance and I hope I listened with nuance as well. I'm a cis woman who has never been educated enough about feminist theory to hold an ideological stance, so nuance may be the only way I can engage in this space anyway (I'm 57 now and only learned ten years ago that feminism came in waves). My experience of being a woman was growing up as a tomboy, being interested in science and making stuff, being told I must be a lesbian because of that (and experiencing a lot of confusion about my sexual attraction to men as a result) working to he taken seriously in male spaces (physics major in college being told - literally, in those words - by professors that I don't belong, ocean going engineer being told - literally and accompanied by physical intimidation - that I don't belong, decades of such experiences).  So. I was with you on almost everything here. But one thing I was hurt by was your somewhat mocking tone when you read the quote from Sylvia Plath. She was expressing very precisely something that gets directly at a source of very deep pain for me, that is also directly related not just to my hurt feelings but also to professional struggles and the way I have had to work much harder and be much better just to fight my way to a place at the table that cis men were granted without question. So I guess my point is, please don't mock or belittle that.  You have experiences that were every bit as difficult, of course. It's not for me to grade whose shit stories are more shitty, and you were careful to make that same point - again, you have approached this topic with a nuance I've not heard before (from cis or trans women, but then, and I'm not a gender theorist, just a person doing my basic things). So. Here comes the thing that is my personal source of frustration, and the only thing I have to say that I would I guess like for a trans person to just acknowledge as valid. What I see a woman being accepted and taken seriously in tech spaces, or gamer spaces (accepted as a player, not a entertainment streamer), I get super excited. And then it seems that a high percentage of the time (considering the numbers ratio of cis women to trans women in the general population) the woman turns out to be a trans woman. My heart sinks a little because it feels like cheating to be able to get a seat at that table as a man and then transition or come out as a trans woman. I really, really hope that trans women who do get that seat at the table will reach down and help women up, not just other trans women but also cis women who, like Sylvia Plath, have been longing their whole lives, yes, since very young girl hood, to be accepted there. I say this hoping it's not taken as an attack. I entirely agree with you that trans women have experiences of womanhood that are shitty, and are at greater risk than I of violence, and experience much greater workplace discrimination than I do, just for being trans. This thing I feel is just a twinge compared to all that, and compared to the very significant consequences that come with being a woman of any description. I know it's a twinge I can only have because I am in a position of privilege from being white, cis and middle class. Anyway, I'm hoping to engage, and hope I don't invoke wrath by invading a space that is safe for trans women. Causing offense is certainly not my intention, and I'm open to criticism."
"I appreciate this video, though i have a question.   As a person who actually cares about other people for some reason, i often advocate for trans rights.  However, as a man, I'm often told by TERFs that telling them that their errr... 'concerns' about 'trans men invading women's spaces' are silly is 'man-splaining'.   How do you respond to that?"
"Not queer tho? :("
"YASSSS get em killer! Someone had to say it (: you are one of my favorite people on this earth"
"Honestly used to side-eye trans women who present in a very feminine way, mostly because I was scared they would expect me to do all that as well (I'm a cis woman, kinda butch a bit). I like your explanation though, and I agree, there should be solidarity there."
"Never knew how to argue these points to cis women ‘with concerns’. Thank you for your grace and articulate thinking"
"I love you so much!! Your work is valuable and appreciated"
"Damn youre good! Keep it up sis! PS i love you!   To all TERFs, We aint going nowhere!"
"Trans women arguably understand what it means to be a woman far better than cis women. They might not suffer from sexism as much until they come out but when they do, they suffer from it double the amount of a cis woman in their condition. They also know how to weaponise femininity and show that it's just as strong as masculinity while so many cis women are afraid of being feminine, or they associate strength with being like men. I know because I did, my cis female friends did. All in all, TERFs can fuck right off with their bullshit arguments. Even homophobia is rooted in sexism, NO ONE is safe from sexism let alone trans women."
"I just wanted to say thank you again.  I am transgender and I work at a gas station.  I deal with people from all social classes, religions, and political parties.  I have really pro-Trump people call me Ma’am.  I do get misgendered sometimes but it is usually followed with I’m sorry."
"Theryn saying luxuriance? That's the tea!"
"Speaking from the privilege of a millenial cis woman lol, i must say i never really understand the plight of the terf. it insults me that they even call themselves 'radical feminists' because i personally feel it muddies the feminist name, which there are already huge misconceptions about. i can sorta, kinda get the theory of this fear of 'men invading womens spaces', but mainly not as it is evidently clear that is not really any issue at hand. the fear of men invading spaces that aren't meant for them in order to keep women safe is not gonna be resolved by banning all trans women? that doesnt even make sense? a person who is set to invade a space for negative reasons will surely feel free to do that regardless of their gender identity, sort of seems to come with the word 'invade'? if feminism is about freeing oppression, which i believe it is, for things that people cannot control (such as their gender), i absolutely do not understand why these women would want to kick other women out of it and try to deny their existence. i dont understand how a movement that has strived for so long to be seen as more than just a vagina and a womb would start othering other women because of their lack of one. for me radical feminism is about abolishing all semblance of gender's suffocating role in society, however, as you said, that is an entirely utopian idea that we aren't even close to seeing as a reality yet. so in lieu of that, feminism has to be a sisterhood of protection for the people who are vulnerable and need it. i personally believe it is the role of more privileged women to provide that safe and welcoming place for those who aren't as safe in a world that struggles to accept them. the semantics of 'what makes a woman' shouldnt really come into it."

"You've changed so much in since a year. Noticed it when you were playing as transcendent being. Happy for it!"
"Another great video.  The one issue that is concerning to TERFs that I was hoping you'd address is those people who transition and are able to take advantage of institutions - I'm thinking of the trans women who seem to have an unfair advantage at sports (Fallon Fox comes to mind).   And yes, I am absolutely coming at this from a place of ignorance and just want you to tell me how to think ;)"
"No 2 people will ever understand each other completely, but I understand what it’s like to loathe my body, to be scared and panicky walking home until I’m home safely, and even there being afraid that someone is there or that a man will break in. I understand what it’s like to be told what to wear when you don’t want to be controlled, to be pressured to know things, act a certain way, and wear clothes a certain way. That’s enough reason to have solidarity for me."
"'Excuse my beauty.'   I laughed and cried at the same time. This is fucking powerful."
"14:59 I laughed pretty hard at this. Mostly because sometimes I actually drink my tea like that. Yes, straight from the tea can. LOL Don't judge. My tea is just that damn good."
"This is an odd and side-tracked point but: as a cis woman, using the terms pregnant people or people who menstruate is actually preferred, at least by me. It separates the age old idea that being a woman is tied to reproduction or menstruation, and I feel like it's a step forward towards a more equal future. I don't want to birth a child and to have such a life altering experience be tied to who I am and how I view myself makes me feel less like myself and more life I'm a broken person; someone that can't fit in in their own identity."
"15:00 for the ICONIC 'drinking from the teapot' bit."
"Got immediately banned from r/gendercritical for simply restating your points lol. Apparently there's a subreddit for THIS SPECIFIC DEBATE, and r/gendercritical is just a space where people can crystallize their anti-trans talking points.  Because of that I have some important questions for you Contra: at what point should we NOT allow safe spaces? How much should we consider someone's intentions vs the net effect of what their saying? Should this question even be asked when a majority of safe spaces are used for good? Or should a minority of bad actors using a safe space to allow transphobia (they'll die on the hill that it's not transphobic tho) REQUIRE us to call out their safe space for what it really is?"

"Germaine Greer sucked at math because in the real world, where negative numbers only exist in the abstract, there is no such thing as less than nothing. That’s literally impossible."
"You are not a woman."
"20:41 So regarding reproductive rights, aS a NoNbInArY pErSoN,  I feel pretty left out and ignored when discussing these issues. They are so centered around women that while some of our experiences are similar, they still don't bring up issues that I may face. I'm not sure, there is this sense of dysphoria and alienation when I enter these spaces because they are really female dominated and focused. It's like it reminds me of the gender that I was assigned at birth that I don't connect with at all. When reproductive issues are only centered around women, I am not sure if people in that space are educated and tolerant of nonbinary people, let alone trans people.   After hearing horror stories of trans people and medical spaces, and even experiencing some myself, I have to be extremely careful if the medical professionals that I'm dealing with are not prejudiced. It is agreed upon that women need services like contraception and abortion, but it's also accurate that trans men and nonbinary people need these services as well. It makes me feel safe and included that places like planned parenthood are using neutral language to refer to usual gendered services. That shows at least one sign that maybe I can trust the medical professionals in that organization to really tell them what is going on. Or else, I may have to make up a story to 'seem' cis in case the person I am dealing with might have biases."
"Wow. Thats the first subreddit I was banned from"
"It's kind of funny. I stumbled down the alt-right rabbit hole a couple of years ago but when I started watching Contra's videos I realized that the left is not quite as 'ridiculous' as the alt-right folks make them out to be. I think it's always important to hear both sides. It's the only way that leads to true enlightenment."
"you did it again, what a brilliant video!"
"Thanks mom!"
"Full of strawmans and misrepresentations of arguments"
"Ugh, I hate to be critical, since this is the first video I have a major problem with. I think it's such a shame to have so carefully unpacked TERF arguments and concerns, to then at 28:25 reduce the argument to 'it's all transphobia, which exists in every culture, because we're born with an innate sense of disgust for trans people that anatomically exists in our limbic system' (to paraphrase). I think there's more to it ; there's internalized misogyny (cis women treat each other terribly too), there's a concern about which ideas should get more of a public platform (I mean, we've been fighting for abortion rights and contraception for well over 60 years, and it's still an urgent issue), and most cis women will never know what dysphoria and misgendering feels like (which is why I identify as a cis - rather than trans - non-binary queer and I love it when old people with poor eyesight call me 'sir'). I'm not trying to minimize transphobia or refute any of the claims about how transphobia affects trans people. But there have been many societies where transphobia wasn't a thing. Take the example of Hijras, who before the British rule, were considered valuable members of their communities in many Indian cultures.  I don't know where I'm going with this. To wrap it up, what really bothered me was comparing the disgust for the LGBT community to the instinct of disgust for feces and disease."
"Amazing video Natalie, I really loved it! The first bit about people who used to identify as TERFs really resonated with me. I used to be a really hateful and agressive person thinly veiled under a reactionary opposition to ''PC feminism'', and often used transphobic slurs and took the piss out of queer people.  The irony is I've known I was transgender (a trans man) since I was 10 years old. I spent so much of my life trying not to be transgender and spouting the same bullshit as a lot of '''gender critical''' feminists because I was ashamed. Now I'm out and on Testosterone and have never been a better more informed feminist (and socialist!), and your videos have been massively instrumental in that. So thankyou so much, your work makes such a tangible difference to your viewers, and not just their intellectual understanding but our emotional welfare and sense of self, transgender or otherwise. Bless you, and best of luck!"
"You are insanely gorgeous, even without makeup 😭💜"
"Anyone know if Natalie's discussed issues arising from transwomen participating in women's sport?"
"The production value!"

"I’m just so excited by the world. The human experience is becoming so much more complicated and so wonderfully diverse. The future will be so different, and that’s simply fantastic"
"My kink is genderless monotone."
"Thank you Mom"
"The mention of the Jewish question kinda caught me off guard"
"Contra, I like the video and wanted to hear more from them, so I went to their subreddit. Honestly, it’s everything you described, but I heard people thanking you for directing traffic to them."
"yas queen slay"
"I'm always happy when Contra uploads a new video. Well, I'm a man and I'm staying LOL"
"There has finally been a (one single solitary) debate at a university in Canada between a radical feminist and a transgender woman covering each party's concerns. I find your videos entertaining, I like that you called the turd JP daddy.  I do admit that I stand with the gender critical people overall. Free to be,you and me from the 1970s is more or less where I stand concerning how humans should comport themselves. Please look up Derrick Jensen speaking in Eugene Oregon, how he was treated by trans activists. Is your side of this argument really looking to win, or is the agenda merely to strike out at those who will very likely destroy your shallow vain and fragile artificially constructed sense of self?"
"I'm very glad you're showing how there are different types of trans people and how gender transitioning isn't always done for one reason; because you have felt like the opposite gender from birth.  In reality people can have very different reason for transitioning, and may have felt okay with their assigned birth gender for quite some time.  Also, being referred to as 'it' is something that can happen to cis women, namely those who aren't deemed attractive to men.  They effectively deny your gender, forcing you to be something in the middle.  During school I considered if I was trans because of this very thing.  So when you said we should all unify against that kind of thing, rather than trying to quantify how accurate that kind of oppression is, I literally fist bumped the screen."
"ContraPoints has a camera person!!! This is disingenuous, over produced garage! I remember before Nat was a sell out with a person holding her camera."
"Wow.. just Wow! thank you"
"It seems to me like a decent chunk of the issues and confusion around trans folk is... laungage. Words. Meaning.  Since trans folk are such an extreme minority, and “non-binary” are a minority of that minority, they seem to dive in to a kind of emotionalist view of language that demands it be as bespoke to their extremely niche “gender identity”.   I’ll try and explain. I think it could be said that *there are as many genders as there are people.* But that the words “man” and “woman” satisfy the extreme majority of humans conception of their own identity. So, when it comes to the niche marginal groups, gendered language and these concepts buck against their identity. The fact that much of what we accept about our own identity is how others perceive us, and that the “binary” laungage pushes people outside of the gender firmament seems to be a pretty big issue.  As far as I can tell, I am a man, what a phillistine from the jungles of borneo would recognize as man, and that recognition IS what makes me a man. Ultimately, I can never truly be a woman, setting aside the biology of sex differences, but I can only become a woman to the extent that I can essentially game the perceptions of others into seeing me as a woman.   I guess I mean “passing”. If you aren’t passing then you won’t be perceived as a woman, therefore you are not a woman?  Woman, as in half of the two massive chunks of aggregated unique genders from all humanity lumped in to these signifying words. Man. Woman.   To go beyond the language of “are trans-women women?” Seems to ask of the English language something it wasn’t really made to say. Go make some new cool words for yourselves, you 0.06% or whatever the hell trans/non-binary folk are, lol long as you don’t get the government to force me to call you your cool words, I couldn’t care less."
"What about barren XX or otherwise infertile, no period, had to get their uterus removed at birth etc. Everything applies to them too, don't need to get trans involved at all"
"Your 👏 utopian 👏 pipedream 👏 is 👏 valid 👏!"
"So I like you and I want to be open minded here, but it sounds an awful lot like the problems been face, like dying in war aren't even worth your time and just 'troll questions' to you. Care to clarify?"
"On the subject of inclusive language, we do have to recognize it's a delicate balance. I have seen transmen state categorically that the statement that 'reproductive freedom is a women's issue' or discussing 'A woman's right to choose' is inherently transphobic, because some men experience pregnancy too. And it's true that some men menstruate and get pregnant, but it also seems that telling women that they are immediately transphobic if they refer to 'women' when discussing pregnancy in an activist, not medical, context, feels an awful lot like men (transmen in this case) dictating to women what vocabulary they can and cannot use to discuss issues that affect overwhelmingly more women than men."
"Red looks absolutely amazing on you Natalie :)"
"There's no hope anyone will see this but I need to try - I love you Contra, you're brilliant, but you lump people into groups too much :/  you didn't once cover the fringe cases that cause so much of the emotion behind terf arguments, like the male rapist who decided he was suddenly female and was put into a women's prison where he immediately assaulted several women, which happened due to the strict antidiscrimination laws in the uk. I don't think people who have a problem with that should be lumped into the 'terfs who just hate trans people'  category.   I've been trying to bring this up as an issue that trans people should be fighting as it damages you so much in the public eye and can be weaponised against you so easily. I wish we could give it a name - I've settled on 'psychotic trans impersonation' but I don't care what we call it ultimately I just want to protect good people from the unintended consequences of inclusion when it's written into law and so vehemently enforced that it genuinely does harm women.   Terfs are often the very women who have suffered the worst at the hands of men and are disgusted and freaked out by trans people because of a very real trauma in their past, and while I don't agree with man-hating any more than I agree with transphobia I don't think it's ok to write off their strongest arguments, especially when those arguments damage trans people too."
"Everything I've heard about Greer suggests she is an absolutely toxic individual, both in terms of her writing and on a person-to-person level."
"Hell yes to non-conforming cis women allying with trans women!    Really, the whole point is that we have been made to feel invalid our whole lives, so why support someone else getting the same treatment? Insecurity in our bodies, hair in the 'wrong' places, body parts being the 'wrong' size, 'failing' in our attempts at fitting in, demanding experiences we don't have, it's all the same shit anyway. Only difference is that trans women have it far worse."
"I feel like addressing these questions at face value as you have is such a wonderful thing, not just to educate cis people, but also to help trans people who, like me, have had difficulty putting into clear terms why those arguments are wrong. While “trans women are women” is a nice sentiment, it doesn’t help trans women who are struggling to understand the validity of their own existence. I think a lot of us have the same questions about our validity and existence as cis people do and that can be a very scary thing to admit if you don’t even have the answers yourself. It’s something I’ve struggled with even up until watching this video (and I’m 5 years into hormones and all that). So while I respect and appreciate what this does to help educate uninformed cis people, I also appreciate what this might do for trans girls like me who have always had those same questions and concerns that put us at odds with our own identities and feelings of self-worth. For that and so much more, I thank you."
"Don't mean to objectify or anything, with my wretched, disgusting, male gaze, but looking pretty damn empowered Natalie.. if you know what I mean"
"This is probably one of my favorite of your videos! I feel like normally tranamisogyny is a really emotionally draining topic, but this was a fun watch and I hope it at least affects a few people :o)"
"You'll probably never see this comment, but I wanted to thank you so much for this video.   I'm a cis-female and I do struggle with discussing different experiences of womanhood with trans women. I never, ever want to be hurtful or offensive, I've been reduced to tears because I've tried so hard to listen & understand everything they are kind enough to share, but still got accused of being transphobic because I feel there are differences between a person growing up female as opposed to someone growing up feeling they are female.  I'm not saying 'You're not a real woman' and I'm also not saying 'I'm *more* of a woman than you' either, none of that. We're equals. I just feel we have different experiences of womanhood and what's wrong with talking about our respective experiences?  Your dialogue about this really helps so much, and I can't wait to share it and hopefully promote conversation with folks I know.   I don't want a trans person to hate me, I don't fear or hate trans people. I feel love & empathy, and always want to help. How can I help if I'm called a bitch for merely suggesting our experiences of womanhood are different? Just different, not better or worse, or more or less. Just different/diverse/varied.   I keep endeavoring to hone my own dialogue because I respect the fact the trans community is so attacked by cis-folks that defensiveness is wholly understandable. I'm not angry, I just want to get better at communicating.   Work like yours helps me do that, and I'm so friggin' grateful you exist and chose to do what you do. Thank you, thank you, thank fuck for you (if you start selling 'Thank Fuck For Natalie Wynn' shirts, I will be buying)."
"'Man....I feel like shit'. OK, that got me. You always manage to pull laughter out of the darkness Natalie :)"
"Aww shit. 💀 LOL. Wait, you were trans this entire time? Yoooo. Excellent job, uh, zhe. You're um kinda hot no homo/no offense. I mean you make for a good lady...like... I'm not one of those type dudes. Although I won't lie in a lot of hentai the chick will magically grow a dick and fuck the other chick. Uh, so before I wig out cause I totally straight up thought you were a lady and I'm gonna eat shit for this I have a couple questions.        1. Are/were you ironically well hung? 2. Is it actually less gay to watch transgender on girl? Cause by my logic that's like half less dude in the mix at least top up. And at the very least I just wondered if you could clear up that debate.  Alright well...God bless. Tough situation.  💯 Ugh...you seem like a cool person.       3. Can I call you Bon Clay? Don't look it up it's not a slur."

"You could also go with a trans-inclusive Marxist feminist response that boiling down womanhood to a singular aspect that not even all cis women go through is an issue for the following reasons:   The predominant feminism appropriating reactionary transphobe’s view on womanhood boils it down to bleeding and childbirth, which cis women born without a uterus, that have severe PCOS, or simply don’t want children, either don’t experience or don’t experience in the same way. There’s also the addition that the predominant view on biological sex is one inherited from the west, and isn’t reflected in indigenous cultures across the world, therefore applying a cultural idea about womanhood is racist and western chauvinist, in that it assumes that the conservative western idea of womanhood is the only correct one, and colonialist, in that it applies this to everyone irrespective of culture. There’s also economic class differences, in that a rich white woman is not going to experience womanhood and femininity the same way as a poor black or native woman, and to argue otherwise is either ignorant or just plan intellectually lazy.   As far as abolishing gender, my perspective on it is that it’s less make everyone genderless monks on a cloud like some weird cross of the fifth element and bill and Ted in heaven, and more about abolishing gender and heterosexuality as a political construct, and eliminate its influence on social life. This wouldn’t harm us trans, but would rather free us up from having ever been considered men or otherwise in the first place. This is what women’s liberation truly is: to abolish class distinctions between men and women as a class. In a patriarchal society, men are the ruling class and women are united only in the experience of being oppressed by men. When you abolish gender, you abolish the class distinctions between men and women, and the social expectations of both. You can say it’s utopian, but just as a socialist society is capable of abolishing economic class distinctions, it is also theoretically possible to abolish class distinctions between men and women as well."

"This Video is very disturbing. The language and concepts used by TERFs is identical to the language and concepts used by INCELS, White Nationalists, Islamists ect...  Except in a way it is more dangerous and more insidious because their hate is cloaked in an aura of intellectualism and respectability. That is scary.   Also: This is very similar to a podcast I listened to on CBC radio regarding the spread of anti-semitism and that it has spread to both alt right and progressivist circles."

"Thank you. I never understood until now how you could deradicalize people, now I do. I mean, I wasn't terf.

By speaking about those questions and the suffering they came from something calmed down within me and I know terf rethoric wont shake me anymore."

"Thank you for this. Being friends with trans people and learning more through the internet really has made me think a lot about gender. I've thought about some of these questions before myself, and I really appreciate your answers.  Though, interestingly, most of the time the questions in my head are directed towards myself. Being a cis woman, I've asked myself many times, what makes me a woman? To me I've just been thinking that I've got the organs I've been born with and I don't mind them, therefore I'm cis. I had never really thought about what gender and womanhood beyond that means to me. And honestly, I'm still not sure.   Or, well, I guess I know what being a woman in this society means, but my utopistic brain just thinks what it _should_ mean. Because I don't want to be defined by my vagina by anyone in any way, I don't want it to matter. But I recognize that it does, and it's probably not going to change, and that all people experience these things and life very differently. Shit's damn complex, all I gotta say. Anyway, thanks for this video, as always."
"This is Frances Smith using her brother's registration - this is only the second comment I have made on You Tube, but I think my brother might renew his offer of setting up an account for me (especially if I say something untoward).  Firstly, thank you for your output. I was ignorant of transgender issues and love your humorous and thoughtful contributions to the debate.  Many of the anti-trans arguments you outline I have made in the past (e.g. they are perpetuating gender stereotypes; why can't people play with gender and start to dissolve the differences; in some cases - white male privilege taking over more and more spaces; you can't feel what it is like to be female because you haven't experienced it from childhood; and so on).  When I was in my teens and twenties I was often criticised for not being feminine (mostly by men) and it would infuriate me.  I never wanted to be feminine (as defined and expected by society), but I didn't want to be thought of as having masculine traits either. I have read several of Germaine Greer's books and have found her ideas to be thought provoking. Of course, Germaine has been a hate figure for many feminists over the years (her book Sex and Destiny was particularly reviled), so she cannot be regarded as representative of all feminists (academic or otherwise). I agree with you that disgust plays a large part in the hatred of trans-people (as it does in many prejudices).  I am black, female, working class, English, and vegan. Only one of these categories has been self-identified (vegan), all the others have been conferred upon me by the society in which I live. (The English tag is problematic for some UK residents, who feel to be English is to be white despite there being a black presence in Britain for hundreds of years.)  I don't mind being called any of these things, but haven't thus far felt that I want to be a cheerleader for any one so-called attribute.  I do, however, feel angry when people use these labels to make assumptions about me and my beliefs.  Additionally, I have experienced someone else's disgust with all these categories over the years - the current most prevalent and least contested one being the hatred and disgust of the working class as expressed by the smugocracy that dominates the mediated public spaces in the UK.  Oh - I have had a proper gabfest, and don't expect many people will have the patience to read through it all. Anyway, thank you for being and sharing. I shall continue to watch your shows and to learn from them.  Much love, Frances."
"It's extremely hypocritical for TERFs to call a transperson 'it' while railing against the oppression and dehumanisation of women, considering that by doing so, they are engaging in oppression and dehumanisation. It is not acceptable to try to equalise power by stealing it from others through dehumanisation. And frankly, the descriptions that TERFs use as they talk about transwomen are rather telling. They include the exact same kind of rhetoric used by most bigots: the overt descriptions of 'subpar' physical features, so-called characteristic features that all people of the same group supposedly exhibit, the general scorn and belittling. And the fear of people who are different. These all reveal much more about the speaker than they do about the subject."
"Another thing Germaine Greer doesn't even seem to consider is that some cis women also have beards and 'manly features'. It's so strange, for a faction that claims they're trying to fight against gender essentialism, they completely overlook the existence of their fellow sisters who don't conform to what they perceive is biologically feminine.  Between *2 to 20% of women* have some form of polycystic ovary syndrome, which can also result in physiological changes that are generally considered masculine, including growing a beard. And that's just one condition. Certain thyroid conditions can also result in larger statures, etc. etc. and it is possible that the woman Germaine Greer so triumphantly mocks for her hairy knuckles and poorly concealed stubble is a cis woman - and I know multiple cis women (I know multiple cis women you guys), who reading that, would definitely relate to the woman in question. How is this in any way feminist?"

As a cis-woman, I am aware that trans people face a lot of struggles I don't face, because I am in an easier, privileged situation at that point.  So all I can do is to do my best to listen, understand and be an supportive ally.   Thank you for making this video, which will help me a lot during some arguments!"

"Alright, I looked it up. Slur is etymologically related and in some cases synonymous with smear. When you slur your words you smear them together. When you make a slur against someone, that's a smear. And when you mix things together, smear them together in a liquidy form, that's a slurry. The old etymology is for smear related to mud which is a slurry of water and dirt. Also, swirl. The etymologies I found trace both slur and swirl no further back that 15th century Norwegian in which they are different words but they sounded about as similar then as they do now. I bet if you go further back they're related."

It was just a good moment of connection where a problem I experience in one way was approached by someone else who experiences it or its fallout in another way. If someone who actually /doesn't/ feel connected to one gender or another struggles to 'abolish gender' in their clothes, presentation, speech, and mannerisms why should trans women be expected to do it?"

"Great stuff as always 💃 You know, I genuinely did have some of the questions you addressed at the beginning so I’m really grateful for your answers. I see they can be (and sadly have been) weaponised. Also, I’m really sorry for the horrible, mean things being said in these forums - they are hateful and wrong :(  As an aside: great set design and costumes 🥰  It’s true that to people that define their identity by their suffering the idea that people would choose to express their womanhood rather than to continue passing as privileged men seems to undermine their point. Personally though, suffering is not the basis for my womanhood and fetishising my ‘suffering’ trying to outsuffer others isn’t my jam (I don’t even think it’s good for the people that do do this). So if the bravery of trans women undermines that narrative, that’s a good thing. Ultimately, I hope for a world where human dignity is given the proper respect and people are loved entirely and without judgment.  So yeah, sorry for the long comment and for not being more educated on these issues but the main point I’m trying to make is that I’m grateful for your content 🥰❤️"

"Abolishing gender doesn't mean abolishing individuality or now gendered stuff, on the contraty - it's about celebrating it without restricting it because someone's got a ding-dong or a coochie. Hair is just stuff that grows on your head, makeup is just powders and goo, dresses and pants are just fabric sewn together. That's what this 'utopian' idea is all about. In such a world there would be no need for transitioning. Whether you like it or not, present society is slowly coming to this. Maybe not in this form exactly, but eventually it'll be something along the lines.   Feminine visual representation is not the cause of oppression like trans activists ensue, but a symbol of it. So when a woman chooses to present femininely and wear a dress, it's brave, she takes pride in being a woman even though it's dangerous. But when a man does it, it's appropriation of the suffering of an oppressed group of people - basically like blackface. It's pretty reasonable to be offended when people who killed, raped, enslaved and abused you for millenias decide to suddenly dress like you and modify their bodies surgically to pretend they're one of your kind riiight when women started getting some freedom and safety, right when we finnaly can think of ourselves as humans. Coincidence? I don't believe it. You guys didn't want to be a woman in the age of domestic slavery, so you don't get to be one now.   Next, male privilege. Sure, now that you 'live as a woman' you're experiencing the same things as women, no shit Sherlock, welcome to the club I guess. But being born and raised male gives you an advantage in these situations that women don't have: the ability to stand up for yourself, to know your boundaries and defend them, to feel confident and strong enough to push back, to know that you have a right to speak up and use it, the inner confidence, the lack of deep paralyzing primal fear. So even though the same things are happening to you, you're not experiencing them the same way. And kinda going into the next point - you never will. Childhood years are indeed formative, they're a foundation of who we are. It takes decades of therapy to work through childhood traumas no matter how severe, and the result of therapy is not that people are cured of their trauma, but instead just learn how to live and function with it and it's aftermath. No matter how long you live as a woman, the foundation of your personality, the core of your being is male, and there's no amound of being interrupted and enduring catcalls to change that. Also, doesn't being bullied for being a feminine guy enforce the idea of female inferiority in your brain? Just a thought.  Wanna talk about language? Sure. The word menstruator, just like terf, sounds waaayy too much like a slur. First we were called meatholes, then cocksleeves, now menstruators and birthers, fucking fantastic. Only a man would think that that''s okay and there's nothing wrong with that. Now, the word terf is a tautology: there's no such thing as trans inclusionary radical feminist, those two words were forcefully put in front of the term to alienate those who might be curious about radfem. No radfem calls herself a terf unironically.   Here's another thing: radfem is not about bringing people down, mocking or hurting anyone or anything like that. If those are the feelings that this ideology evokes in you doesn't mean that it is it's goal. It's about looking at the root of the problem and looking for a solution to make people's lives better. The words TIMS and TIFs were made up not to mock you, but to better describe our ideology: it'd be weird if we denied that there's even a possibility for a man to become a woman and vice-versa, but still call you trans-WOMEN and trans-MEN. That's all there is to it, those words were not ment to offend anyone, trust me.  Now, about mutilation. What else would you call a destruction of organs and their function? If I say 'I identify as an insect, please remove my kidneys', noone would do that, because I need those for something, and no matter how much I believe in my identity, I shouldn't just be allowed to mutilate myself because of it. I can't ask for my tonsils or appendix to be removed when there's nothing wrong with them either. Don't get me wrong, I could care less about cosmetic things such as voice change operations, boobjobs etc, but HRT and 'sex-confirmation' surgeries seem fucky to me because I also see unfairness in it because if I, a woman with no kids under the age of 30, go to a doctor right now and ask to tie my tubes, I would get a fuck no. But if I do the same and say 'I think I'm male' - piece of cake. That's unfair and plain weird, if you want to completely obliterate some kind of your body function it should be equally difficult or easy for everyone.   Well, maybe radfems aren't the most polite people in the world and they do get their frustrations out in their private spaces sometimes - tough titties, but how about bringing public comments of trans activists about how 'all terfs must be killed and brutalised', how 'trans women are more women than cis', how 'vaginas and periods are fucking gross', how 'lesbians are just vagina fetishists', etc. You're just picking out the worst comments for the sake of your narrative, anyone could do that, that's not a valid arguement. Not accepting trans ideology is not 'transphobia' or animosity, it's just a CONTRAPOINT to the trans activism, an opposing ideology. When I only started getting into radfem, there were no bitter women in the movement who were mocking trans people - all i saw was a critique that transitioning is not the right way to go about things, that the reasons behind such desire is gender stereotypes and oppression, and that there are alternatives. But after years of death, rape and other violence threats and other disgusting things we get for our views, of course there're now women in the movement who say transphobic things, I can't blame them. You have to understand that it's reactional, transphobia is by no means in the core of the movement like you're trying to prove.  Sorry for my english, but noone will read this so whatever."

"Listening to the last part I couldn't see parallels to the idea that a lot of our convictions are subconscious and not rational (the elephant and its raider, see e.g. D. Kahneman Thinking fast and slow) and is basically based on the DISGUST. These TERFs do not find transpeople aesthetically pleasing, or even disgusting, and make up rational (or 'rational') justifications for their disgust.   Also, it seems to be linked with the morality of chastity (see Righteous mind by J. Haidt) - for these women femininity and its 'pureness' are perceived as sanctity and in their eyes transwomen commit close to sacrilege by putting their (previously) male selves into their pure female space. This may also explain the temperature of many of these reactions. This is not a rational, scientific, critical issue. This is a direct attack on their moral convictions."

In humans these are: Turner syndrome, a friend of mine has this (X) X0/XY mosaicism XX gonadal dysgenesis XY gonadal dysgenesis (swyer syndrome) XX male syndrome (De la Chapelle syndrome) XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) XYY (normal phenotype) XXX (Trisomy X or Triple X syndrome) XX/XY Tetrasomy X (XXXX ) XXXY XXYY Pentasomy X (XXXXX) XXXXY    all these people who would fall into the female equivalence of chromosomes are, by your logic, not women either"

"that outfit at 4:12 got me FLUSHED. you always have the TOITEST sense of style and I live for your outfits omg"
"The costumes, performance, setting, humor and overall production are outstanding once again, no doubt about that.  I still downvoted the video because in my humble opinion  the argumentative structure is insufficient and to be honest quite embarrassing for someone who was on the path to becoming a professor of philosophy (if I remember correctly).  At the end it becomes clear why your reasoning is as it is: you dismiss all the arguments you have pretended to address for the last 20+ minutes by calling them transphobic and so you dont care if you actually do engage with them. Apart from that, you want to be accepted as a woman and you dont give a shit whether any cis woman is offended by that. Of course it is perfectly fine that you hold and state that opinion, but you then just might say this instead of pretending to engage with the arguments you dismiss as transphobic and dont give a shit about anyway – but doing so would have not given you the room for creating a masterpice of a video in the artistic/entertainment sense, I understand that.    I want to give you some examples of what I mean by not really addressing the concerns:  Point 1 ('Gender Metaphysics' or the question whether gender has an essential biological component (that trans people miss regarding the gender they identify with) - thats what it really is about in my opinion)  Your opinion is basically “Fuck off, I disagree with you, thats all nonsense“- technically speaking that is addressing the argument but not really intellectually gratifying.   Point 2-3 (displaying gender stereotypes does not make you a woman and transwomen enforce this very stereotypes by displaying them which they should not do)  You are basically saying “I cannot overthrow gender stereotypes on my own, so I will use them to establish my womanhood in society as it is and you cannot ask more from me than from a cis woman  while a lot of them also display (and thus reinforce) these stereotypes“. The problem with this is, when it comes to a cis-woman, no one doubts that they are a woman. Even if they dont display female gender stereotypes, they will at worst be mocked and called names, but it will not seriously be doubted that they are a woman. Thus, if they display gender stereotypes, it does not imply that these gender stereotypes are what make them a woman. However, the only things that distinguishes a man from a transwoman are the transwoman´s identification with the female gender (which is invisible) and the display of  female gender stereotypes. So, the only thing VISIBLE TO OTHER PEOPLE that distinguishes a man from a transwoman is the transwoman´s display of female gender stereoptypes and that might give an observer the idea that what makes you a woman is displaying female gender stereotypes. And thus one could argue a transwoman displaying female gender stereotypes does more harm in this respect than a cis woman doing that.    Point 4-6 (a male born person doesnt understand the struggles of a female born person)  Well you set your experiences of discrimination as a transwoman next to the experiences of discrimination as cis-women and then say there should be no competition who is suffering the most – it was not until you made it that. Surely, being a woman is not mainly defined by suffering but it is about really knowing what you are talking about when it comes to being a woman, in post-modernist terms the “experience“ of being a woman. This is not the only factor defining a woman but it is one of them, that – as you acknowlwdge – trans women are at least partially lacking.   Point 8 (“TERF“ as a slur)  I agree that “TERF“ is not slur, but for other reasons. To me, “TERF“ is just an acronym for Trans Exclusive Radical Feminist and I think this is a fairly accurate or at least acceptable description of this position. However, I disagree with your approach that they deserve to be called a derogative name because their entire position boils down to transphobia. I agree that there is one central point behind all of this, but I would not call it Transphobia. The point is “drumroll pelase“ , does a male born person who identifies as female psychologically and displays outer characteristics of a female/“femal gender stereotypes“ have the right to call themselves a women and demands others to address and accept them as a woman while they lack almost any other factor that one might consider the essential factors for making woman a woman (e.g. being biologically female, being socialized as a woman, having a female reproductive anatomy with all the strains and demands that come with it, from society as well as individual males etc). I think if you say everyone who hesitates to confirm this fully without hesitation is a transphobic bigot you are making it quite easy for yourself.   I would like to help you to get some empathy for the „TERFs“. From their perspective, being a woman is stronly determined by the discrimination women face and society´s as well as individual males´ pressure to conform to female gender stereotypes regarding beauty, motherhood, being sexually available for men, but noch too much (slut) and other shit. Displaying female gender stereotypes is the last thing they want to accept as a main identifying factor for being female. Then along comes a male born person that identitifies as a female and uses female gender stereotypes to be accepted as a female by patriarchal society, but lacks almost all characteristics that make a woman a woman from the “TERF“ perspective. For them, this is like Rachel Dolzal identifying as black, its like a fully abled person identifying as disabled and using a wheelchair because they think this will make society accept them as disabled. From a “Terf´s“ perspective, it is a cruel joke and one of the kind that is definitely not funny. If you want to call that transphobic, then this is an opinion you are entitled to have."
"fucking lovely and informative as always, Natalie... I adore you and your content, you raise such interesting debates in a very well-thought out way. I love this so much, I hope nobody ever dares to silence you with transphobic bullshit"

"Thank you for the content!"
"One Question I always ask me: Where does Trans start. If you identifie as a woman, but not going around as a woman, are you a woman? If you live as a woman, but not identifie as a woman,  are you a woman?"
"It's okay if you feel disgust. What's not okay is citing that disgust as a reason for people not to have rights and freedoms. Just as nurses learn to suck up blood etc. You can can learn to suck up Trans people."

"As a cisgendered white woman I still struggle with trans females and I am thankful to you for doing this. I want to support all women, and you helped me get closer to that today"
"I started to make quite a long comment because i was not convinced by your point on gender abolition. I started viewing again the content of the section. Nothing to say, I just missed part of the sense at first view.  Great video as always, best islamo-leftism society destroyer channel on yt"

"Female only space, eh? Alrighty, I can respect that.   Ker-leave."
"Is Anita Bryant even dead? / Scholars seem divided."
"I'm uncomfortable with trans people, but mostly because I don't know how to act around them. I don't want a lawsuit to happen, I want to be friendly and kind, but given the current political climate I don't believe I act like I normally would around a trans person out of fear of upsetting them. Great video! Subbed!"

"Why my not feminine pp hard"
"Thank you for explaining the 'abolish gender' view. I realised that as a cis woman, I usually tend to be on the femme side, and I have NEVER been questioned for it. You can't really chant 'abolish gender' without letting people present themselves however the fuck they want. And people using this language to turn it against the most vulnerable? shitty AF. This bitch is LEARNING shit today."

"Not a TERF here but my mom has said some pretty TERFy things to me and I think I understand where some of it is coming from. Her concerns about trans people is wanting to set a threshold where someone is 'trans enough' to have a right to that genders spaces. I think that comes from wanting to protect those spaces from trolls who say shit like 'I identify as an attack helicopter' and would sneak into womens spaces for the lols. She also pushes pretty hard for the idea that gender roles have nothing to do with sex but uses that to invalidate me as a nonbinary person because I should just be happy and use my 'women-ness' to do and wear anything because nothing is stopping me from doing so. I dont even really know where to start with these. I think the first one is just plain ignorant and if she saw how that gate keeping hurts trans people she'd knock it off but I dont know how to tell her that womanhood is confining and its especially confining when almost every aspect of it is not who you are. I stopped shaving my legs a year ago and get shit for it FROM her literally every time I wear shorts. I want to start binding but when she saw it up on my computer she nagged me about why I'd ever want to hind my beautiful body."
"i dont even know what to say, other than i love you and your videos so much!!!! you equip me and thousands of others with such a well thought-out vocabulary to express what we are thinking- i constantly catch myself trying to remember basically every sentence from your videos so i know what to say when i encounter bigoted or maybe just uninformed people (sadly thats pretty hard to do lmao), but nonetheless i feel smarter and like a slightly better and kinder version of myself everytime i watch one of your videos. thank you so much!!!!!"

"Menstruator makes sense because it refers to people who menstruate. Not all women can do that, but it doesn't make them less of a woman. I hate the way it sounds though, but it makes sense why they'd use such a word."
"This T-girl is down with burly wood-chopping. TERFs begone!"
"You know some ideology is facing opposition when they start identifying as 'thing-critical'.  'Oh, whaat this is just one of those fancy burning drinks you can have in bars, but in a bottle. No way mister officer, I would never join such movements! Im merely authority-critical, that's all'"
"I still don't get it. I have no problem with trans people, I love Natalie, I think her content is awesome. Buuuuut I still don't get it. I'm not trans, I don't know anyone trans, and I live in a reddish state (that is to say we don't have to most trans positive opinions around) What is a 'woman'? Is it just a sector of society that is generally treated in one way as opposed to the way 'men' are treated? That's basically all I could really suss out here. I'm not a Terf, or rad-fem, or feminist at all really so a lot of these points aren't quite pointed at me, but some of them seem like they could be applied to more 'conservative' or 'antifem' or whatever positions more generally."
"Fresh-faced Natalie in a gender-neutral robe with her hair down is what I imagine the leftist afterlife is like, and she's basically St. Peter"
"*woman perceived to be cis removes facial hair so they won't be harassed* TERFs: yeah, fuck sexist beauty norms but it's not your fault that you don't want to be mocked  *woman perceived to be trans removes facial hair so they won't be harassed* TERFs: YOU'RE ENFORCING SEXIST BEAUTY STANDARDS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS PERFORMATIVE"
"lol"
"butch cis woman/femme trans woman solidarity baby!!!!"
"Oh God I love you so much Natalie. I'm trans and I used to scroll through TERF blogs on tumblr as a form of digital self-harm and I've come across many so called 'gender critical' arguments that have since stayed at the back of my head so I really appreciate you engaging with them and debunking them.    It also means a lot that you denounced transmedicalists, some of my friends don't like you because they think you were a transmed so I'm really glad that now I have proof that you aren't."

"I don't really have the mental energy to express my thoughts as accurately as I can, but... as much as I feel this video was needed, framing the point on gender abolitionism by equating genderlessness with being robotic and inhuman... It did feel a bit dehumanizing to me as an agender person. I may not fit into the whole gender system, even nonbinary genders aren't a perfect fit, but I would still hope that I can be myself, genderless and with a neutral gender expression, and still be just as human as everyone else...  I guess I'd just like to see some more nonbinary perspectives in your work, especially when TERFs and transmeds have some uhm... 'thoughts' on us too, and it'd be neat to be more included in the discussion. I understand the focus on your perspective as a trans woman, but more mentions of trans men and nonbinary people would be appreciated."
"Don't call them TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminist) it's only 50% correct. Call them what they are Feminism Appropriating  Reactionary Transphobes (FART)"
"Interesting you included the 'lizard brain' reference when researchers can determine a conservative by looking only at brain scans with  95% accuracy. They do this by looking at the 'lizard brain amygdala which in conservatives is larger and is activated more than others. All you have to do to control a conservative is scare or disgust them."

"I feel like I’m really on the opposite side of the gender critical feminists, even though I’m very “gender critical” myself, but in a way similar to you when you said “non-orthodox trans person”. I’m kinda like a trans inclusionary Skeptic™. I don’t believe gender ‘exists’, i.e. that it is a mechanism that explains how reality works (you know scientifically speaking). I believe gender is an epi-phenomenon. It’s like the quote you cited: “Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, *is going around being a woman*, (…) is a woman.” You know on the one hand it’s kinda tautological. Someone who *isn’t* a woman can’t go around *being* a woman, grammatically speaking. You said, you are going to trust “every social interaction I’ve had for months” and this is exactly what you and everybody else should do. This is really what gender means, I believe. And this is my problem with non-binary et al. folks. I mean they are not invalid as persons, but I think their believes about themselves are erroneous. It’s like religious people. Probably gender non-conforming is really the best way to put it. From there on I could go on endlessly about how ‘they’ won’t and can’t be a genderless pronoun but I’m not gonna annoy y’all with that.  And in fact etymologically speaking every woman necessairily has a uterus. A woman is literally a womb-man (with man as in hu-man, but this is just a coincidence so forget that… And it really doesn’t matter anyway.)"

"I work in a petrol station and one of our regulars is a transgender women,  she sadly transitioned late and does not pass at all.  The general consensus in the station is that it's wierd and they frankly think she's a bit crazy.  But no one would ever dream of misgendering her or insulting her.  We have respect for the individual and their choices."

"Next episode: why English is a Patriarchal language :)"
"Real, possibly offensive, question. Are you able to flick in and out of voices? I'm thinking along a bilingual's ability to dip in and out."
"Totally off topic — do you believe that cultural appropriation (white Rastafarian’s for example) are at all a similar thing to trans women “appropriating” cis women without going through what they have? In your cultural appropriation video you said more or less that white Rastafarian’s are along for the ride on what black people died and suffered through."
"Honestly, it is so discouraging to see the hate trans women get, especially when it is about being too feminine or too masculine. It is a struggle that I cannot understand as a cis woman, but I can still empathize. I've always been told to wear makeup and so on, people have tried to make me fit their mold of femininity. That, however, isn't a reason for me to dislike women - trans or otherwise - who embrace the more feminine traits of womanhood. Who am I to judge or take away another woman's expression of womanhood? I find that trans women, rather than conforming to what girls are groomed into thinking of as womanly, as feminine, as womanhood, have their own expression of womanhood - and it is especially evident in how they are being flagged for being too much or too little. Society is still trying to control another woman's body, looks and way of life. Do I still have moments of 'why are they so feminine'? Yes, I do, but then I take a hot second and just... think that they are allowed to express their womanhood, their femininity, just as they want. (Granted, I have the same reaction to feminine women like the Kardashians like you mentioned in your video). But no two women experience their gender the same way, and that is fine. I am also learning to reclaim my femininity, and expressing my own identity not in spite of what I was told I was supposed to be, but because I want. We should all stand together in solidarity. Trans or cis, masc or fem, a woman is still a woman."
"I LOVE your outfits! You are rocking all of them and I bet it takes a lot of effort to create them. I personally don't get all this gatekeeping crap.

"Where do you get your definition of 'slur' from? I've heard this definition argument time and time again but I'm yet to find a definition that limits it to any particular group of people.  Admittedly, it often used the way you describe but that doesn't not mean it is limited to that."
"i'm a butch nonbinary lesbian & i agree with your video here. i can't speak for all butches, but we get very jaded sometimes and i think that may influence the side-eye you get from cis butch women. we're frequently also pushed out of 'women's spaces' many of us are familiar with security being called on us when we go to the women's bathroom, and in trans spaces many feminine presenting people who do not identify as a woman whatsoever often get put before us when it comes around to asking about the experiences of women in the group.   honestly i know other trans and nonbinary butches (2 the rest of the audience, yes there are butch trans women and they are equally valid women) who even within trans spaces, make people uncomfortable with our vehement rejection of femininity yet assertive claim to lesbianism. In modern lesbian spaces, butches are rare and it's actually very hard to find someone who genuinely wants to date you as a butch - most spaces these days are femme4femme and when i'm on tinder, i always end up matching with other butches where we lament how we barely get anybody willing to talk to us. trans or cis, even within lesbian communities we get treated as 'failed women', and i feel like some butches then go on to internalize that resentment and direct it at trans women for being, in their eyes, let in only for their feminine presentation.   ultimately while the woman=feminine view of many spaces (even feminist/trans ones) are frustrating - i've never personally felt the need to direct this resentment at feminine trans women. we're all fighting our own battles here & society doesn't like trans women existing as much as it doesn't like butch lesbians existing. it's not y'all performing femininity which is the problem, you're just doing your best to survive in a system which treats non-feminine women as gender failures."

Honesty over own insecurities, honesty that some TERF questions can't just be auto-dismissed with an easily memorized chant and, also, most importantly, honesty that the bigots, despite their pretenses, come from a place of disgust and how harmful that is. The good thing is that the bigots cling to their pretenses of having logical arguments or legitimate concerns exactly because they know simply feeling disgust isn't all that legitimate of an argument and certainly not a convincing one."

"Holas from the world of perverts. 33:23 you probably triggered more than a few feminists with titties. Not your actual breasts but the word :). I am sure it is yet another thing they would ascribe to some difference in experience, the use of language and word choice based on being born one gender or the other. Having been raised in a trailer park I love the word, and am more than familiar with hearing working class women use it, but having dated a couple of feminists at college, I learned that the word is hurtful and that only uneducated trash use it. Which, of course, I am sure you know how much class plays in this, though you did not dwell there. That Germaine Greer quote...  couldn't many of those attributes she lists be used to by a woman of one class to describe a woman that was tacky, cheap... someone /poor? My only guess is maybe you felt the video was long enough, or maybe you saw this inclination too and pitied them... after all, who would willingly take on all that debt, or immerse themselves in all that work to get a degree in the humanities when they hate humanity? I'd be bitter too. You can use that line if you like it. Thanks :P"

You keep outdoing yourself, holy shit. And I just wanted you to know I appreciate that. I swear I listen to everything you have to say.

"I want to thank you for making this video. As a not-always-gender-conforming cis woman (a.k.a. I don't like dresses, make-up and fingernails, but I have long hair and don't try to be particularly masculine either), I had exactly some of these concerns, but was struggling to put them into words because I already understood at least enough to know it could hurt people and didn't want to ask questions that make me sound like a troll.  Since watching your videos, even before you did this one, I have started to understand that trans women's existence doesn't erase issues like menstruation, pregnancy or fgm as female issues and it took me a while to wrap my head around it, but there was still a lingering doubt, because it still all seemed so contradictory to  -which it really doesn't feel like anymore, but still was a thing.  Before this video, to me it was always there, kind of implied already, by all the subtext when you talk about other topics. Now I have it black on white. Thanks for that.  (I was introduced to the online trans discussion two years ago in a very unfortunate turn of events by Magdalen Berns, a terf and Blaire White which wasn't helpful to actually understand trans people)  I still think outward gender performance is a lot of masquerading and I don't like playing in that game of looking the right way which is obviously exactly why terfs are wrong, because they play that game.  Even if I feel like I'm totally above dressing up, I'm still obsessed with my weight, obsessed with chocolate and binging tv shows. And I still demand a say in deciding what's ridiculous. Am I bigoted enough yet?  Lastly, I'm fascinated by your costumes and I see how much work goes into it, so don't take this as a criticism but rather an expression of my personal taste: I watch your videos despite their aesthetics, not because of them, cuz I'm like one of those gamers who always runs around in shapeless, comfy clothing. Watching people wear costumes that certainly don't allow for a relaxed posture alone makes me feel uncomfortable, because I wouldn't want to wear that myself.  I also believe underdressed people aren't represented well enough in most of that damn fashionable media industry :P"

"Actually abolishing gender would involve abolishing the categories of gender, not abolishing all the stuff that currently falls into those categories (like Natalie's costumes).

"Love your stuff lady!  Started watching these a few months back when a family member came out as trans. You're funny, smart, and self-deprecating, all of my favorite things in a comedian.

I mean for god sake, I can tolerate (but not like) her saying things like 'trans-women are men', fine, whatever, you're entitled to your beliefs, but when you start calling human beings, particularly ones who are respectful and demonstrate compassion and gratitude towards you as 'it' and dissecting 'it's' appearance, expressing disgust, dehumanizing them and insulting them, then as far as I'm concerned, you've just gone from having a very different and controversial belief to being a wicked, haggard, evil witch.

Trans activism just doesn't compliment homosexuality and same sex attraction (LGB). I support people with body dysphoria changing their bodies in ways that make their lives more comfortable, but I am wildly against erasing the meaning of female and replacing it with completely identity based definitions, particularly while females continue to be oppressed on that axis. I also don't agree with the perceptions some trans activists have on homosexuality. Sorry, but the LGBT just isn't working out atm."

Can’t tell you how many hours and hours of tiring, exhausting arguments she has saved me because I could just simply link one of her videos to an acquaintance. Thanks, Natalie, you dainty Goddess with your women-mocking, perfect tiddies and on-fleek make-up. Love ya."
"How can you be a trans feminist??? You can be a male feminist!!! Anyone can care about women getting equal rights... it's such a silly question."
"Sorry, gotta go. :("
"👏👏 bravo"
"I wasn't able to hear much of the last few minutes of the video over my clapping and cheering."
"But how do you get into collecting ceramics ? Asking for a friend"
"Omg Theryn is back!"
"And then I spent half the video trying to figure out why Natalie's shadow is noisy, while no other shadow in the frame is, even though they're actually darker... Greenscreen? Some weird property of CCD  sensors I never heard of? Every inanimate object in the scene is a vampire, with Natalie painting fake shadows around them? I'm concerned..."
"I almost cry in the end. ;("
"About the popular use of 'assigned at birth'. Most of us are recognized as or observed to be at birth.  The idea that humans with well formed and clearly recognizable genitals are arbitrarily assigned a sex in a whimsical way is an absurd denial of reality."
"people just try to help in the way they see possible but being hurt/upset about a use of word is not optimal, only thing I see thats the true problem, dont point the finger to another just optimize interactions with the world, and plz dont alter your body as this WILL have mental consequences.. live life and think about the earth"

"You're so fucking brilliant. Thank you."
"You're not really a woman. Your chromosones are xy, and nothing will change that."
"This video gave me peace of mind because it answered so many of my questions ...  I'm a young queer woman and I just want to be educated in the trans experience  I'd love to ask the same questions to a trans man and see if theyd provide  different answers based on their experience"
"gender is a fuck n it should b *abolished* ✊ but we can't pretend like it doesn't exist n isn't real in this point in time"
"Stephanie Yellowhair is amazing ❤❤❤❤ Pls tell me shes still out there being beautiful!  Shes okay, right?  Someone pls tell me shes okay. Damn to be indigenous is hard enough but to be trans as well?  Poor girl... I have an extreme need to know shes okay. To still be a bad ass whilst facing so much is inspiring.  No, shes passed. 😢😢😢😢 https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kj5bw/the-death-of-stephanie-yellowhair-and-the-resilience-of-the-queer-spirit-excuse-my-beauty   https://m.facebook.com/shugar31/"

"'Man. I feel like shit.' DOO-DOO DOO-DOO-DOO DOO-DOO"

"I can't recognise TERFism as a coherent intellectual framework.  I can totally recognise it as a neurosis."
"that 'PISCH OGH' was powerful"

"21:59 - Choo choo! Here comes the copyright enforcement train!"
"Glad."
"Sorry for the long comment.   Honest attempt at a real question here. You mentioned that the 'lizard brain' is responsible for the natural intuition of disgust and rejection of homosexuality and trans behavior in general. However, even though it was not explicit, you hinted at this behavior as being wrong, meaning that it should change if you want to become a better person. It is important to mention that I do agree that these impulses can be put in check by conscious effort in order to reduce effective harm I.e. adherence to a certain code of conduct as to minimize externalities caused by social interaction. On the other hand, even with the intended construction of this 'structure' to prevent wrong doing, the internal intuition will, most likely, still be present.    Given that I never seen you talk about moral frameworks, then my questions are:    Why is the man with the 'lizard' intuition wrong? Is he only evil if he acts on it? Is there such a thing as 'good' at all?   It seems to me that we can at least rule out a couple theories like moral intuitionism (or most forms of non-cognitivism). Some Theistic systems at least try to argue that some human intuitions are evil and should be controlled by something greater, but still falls short as a possible moral framework for you because of obvious reasons. I do not know how one can classify others as acting rightly or wrongly (good or evil, etc.) without having a proper consistent system to represent moral matters. Also, are you assuming or presupposing freewill and volition when suggesting we should act differently than our initial intuitions? Is that assumption in conflict with other things you argue for?   Thanks for the attention if you had the patience to read the full thing!"
"Thank you so much for making this video.  The painful, often unheard truth is that there ís a significant subset of radical feminism that on some level just doesn't like men, or even hates us. For all the reactionary whinging about misandry and demonization of boys, there are *some* spheres where you'll (read: I have) run into genuine gut-level distrust from feminist activists. I think it's understandable to hate a group of people that has demonstrably wronged you, but I don't think it ultimately makes things better. I try to be mindful of the reasons why someone might distrust me 'just' for being a man, but it gets difficult to keep my cool because I'm not made out of stone either and that shit hurts me. Indirectly having this issue acknowledged feels like a relief.  PS: I got wrapped up in my own thoughts and forgot to comment on the video in general! It's yet another banger! I keep learning more about trans issues from you, and the way you engage in polemics is inspiring as a testament to the power of self-aware projected confidence with impeccable presentation. Keep fucking the gender nazis up."
"'I wanna be fair, and I wanna be balanced'  Taking points from Cody's Showdy, I see. Very nice"

"Proud game-lover and LGBT-friend checking in, just to say that I exist. Great video."
"the green rim light behind the rad fem persona at 4:16 is giving me a real janusz kaminski vibe, i love it"
"How about this?  Some people just want to be treated and perceived in a certain way. They also want the right to behave in a certain way.  This shit obviously matters a lot to them, since, despite being ostracized, tortured and even killed over it, they refuse to give it up.  Indulging and tolerating these desires costs us nothing, and apparently makes these people's lives a lot better. So why be a dick and not do them this small favour?  Who cares why exactly all of this is true?!"
"Also, love your horn ear.....rings? No, horn rings... hornies? No, horn tassels? 😣 what term makes your horns non suppressed?  😄lol"
"I liked the more provocative style of this video, but I don't think it's a good look in the long run. Maybe I'm biased on the issue. I know some radical feminist people and shitload of race realists, so I guess it's easier for me to understand the 'outrage' than on the usual issues you talk about.   Nice video otherwise, you are the best!"
"Hey, so I'd love if in future you had captions as an option. The auto generated ones in English arent ideal. I'd love to be able to better follow your videos as I struggle sometimes due to hearing issues x"
"I really appreciate how concise your arguments are and how easy they are to understand. Your videos have helped me (trans masc) put words to my own experiences with transphobia and homophobia. Thanks Natalie!"
"Holy shit I knew Germaine was a TERF but I didn't realise she was a fucking inhuman monster"
"Thanks for making a video that acknowledges transmen exist in more than a passing three word sentence."
"natalie's abolishing gender look is a harris reed homage and i will die on this hill"
"Great video, as always!"
"Honestly TERFs are fucking Nazi and they should be called out for it and spat on!!! Yeah, I'm not as nice as you. I'm straight cis woman, but still pissed at these people and their hate!"
"I recently had a conversation with a trans friend of mine. I was trying to understand the process of transitioning, but was met with exactly this 'I was always a man. Nothing's changing.' rhetoric. And it's not like he owes me an explanation. It's not like I think of him as a woman. Still, I've known him for 10 years, and... I lack the language to conceptualize what's been happening for the last 2-3 years. And while it doesn't really change my experience of him, I think the lack of vocabulary, and a deeper understanding of... eh, 'the process'? I don't even know how I'm supposed to talk about it. Anyways I feel that the lack of that vocabulary and understanding, it also makes conversations with transphobes more difficult.  Like every attempt at describing my bystander experience was refuted, so I'm now speaking in such abstract terms that it's completely disconnected from anything that happens in reality. I hesitate to even describe what I'm struggling to comprehend. I'm relatively privileged myself, so I can have these conversations with people whereas my trans friends can't, but I don't feel sufficiently armed with the necessary vocabulary :/  Also, just to be clear, my inability to understand what is happening doesn't mean that someone's experience isn't real, and I accept that. I'm simply trying to figure out if I could have a better understanding."
"I had kids but thats doesn't make me a woman. A lot of cis women are infertile and will never have kids and theyre just as much a woman as I am, as Natalie is. End of story. Having a functioning uterus doesn't make a woman. If that was true a large majority of women would cease to be women at 45-55... Is it really that hard for ppl to understand? It blows my mind how ppl cant just accept ppl are different than them and move the fuck on...  If a woman has a problem with trans women its because they're upset a person born as a 'male' is more attractive than them lol seriously, they feel inferior..."
"You can take my Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS, but other'n that, we coo. Praise be the Dark Mother, And Death to the Feminist Appropriating Transphobes!"

"Natalie, this is intellectually dishonest. Strawman much? Why don't you debate a prominent gender critical feminist?"
"As a trans girl whose egg started cracking shortly after H.Bomberguy's DK64 stream, I'm so grateful for you and your videos. You're doing the Lord's work (and by that I of course mean our unholy Lord Baphomet, praise be unto their magnificent horns)"
"Cis women simply can't compete with trans women when it comes to being beautiful and grabbing your attention. Trans women (that pass) enjoy all the beauty and privilege of femininity without any of the ugly consequences of having a female body."
"terf is not a slur, terf means lesbian. I mean I don't actually believe that's true, but you've never adressed it, not even in your traps are gay video. It's a major radfem argument and you didn't even mention it. The video is pretty good. However, you don't represent the trans community, and many traswomen express disgust at free-bleeding or vagina art, for example, so really that's why radfem are so mad."
"everyone of these looks is sickening. I'm in love."
"There is something to be said about trans women who are a bit 'aggressive' in their pursuit of femininity.  Early in my transition I visited a mixed trans support group. The women there were all at least 15 to 20 years or more older than me, the guys were all about my age. Things that were said to me there: - 'women don't curse, you should watch your language' - 'give it a year or so on hormones, you'll love dresses, makeup, heels, nails' - 'girls don't play video games' and some other bullshit. I don't go that group anymore. My mom, who needed some time to really accept my transitioning (props to her for doing most of that work on her own), was more supportive. Not to mention my cis friends."
"Ergh, that Germaine Greer gets everywhere"
"One thing about 'but you've never experienced the struggle' - I think it's kind of sad when someone has internalized struggle as part of their identity. I don't have the words to express myself properly, but it is damaging to a person's mind. Especially when it is used to put blame on someone that how dare you be the same thing as me, and not have to suffer. Generally, I completely oppose this romantization of suffering. Many people whose lives have been garbage, me included, tend to treat their own suffering as somehow noble and dignified and it's really, really sad."

"My aunts were born twin boys, adopted out to different families, one in WA state and one in Texas and never knew the other existed. They're both trans and didnt meet each other until their 40s... soooo imo its more nature than nurture. They had 2 totally different child hoods... regardless, they're more of a woman than ill ever be haha I might have to bleed to near death every month but that doesnt add up to a lifetime or having to fight for the gender they truly are.... i hope that makes sense."

"To me, the most important point is gender criticism and abolishing gender. It seems like a very 'woke' thing to say and the way that it undermines trans people isn't immediately apparent if you don't know what you're saying and you're just trying to sound progressive..."
"nat ngl you look so fucking gorgeous in this video hhh i literally love your videos and the thing is that while i align more with the transmed mentality i 100% respect and enjoy listening to your outlook because you frame it so brilliantly and respectfully"

"30:04 i have heard that disgust is about only emotion unique to humans, i haven't though much about its implications, but that would be your part of the claim."
"I haven't even figured out if Trans woman means biological male or biological female yet. This is way over my head, lol."
"dont we all know that trans men dont actually exist? really now.   the 'take a fucking sip babes' part had me honestly cackling, thank you for making my morning, and thank you for this video. there is always a lot to think about critically after i watch your content, and i am grateful for that. theres also always something to have a laugh about and i think thats important too. i always look forward to whatever you upload. keep on rocking on ♥"
"That point at the end is essential and one I hear very rarely. People often act like homophobia or transphobia come from some kind of religious source pushed upon the masses, but they're pretty much equally present across all, or almost all, cultures worldwide.   People don't learn to hate gay people because they read the Bible and it said it was a sin. They have a gutteral disgust reaction to it and then use the Bible as a sort of justification for it. It gives them a flimsy crutch to cling to those beliefs, but it didn't make them up. Same with transphobia. All other stuff about biological sex and bathrooms stems from a basic 'yucky' response to the idea of being trans."
"Needed to sleep. Saw on Facebook new video was out. Watched video instead of sleeping. Dreamed about being attacked by angry TERFs"
"I'm a cis woman who lives in a country that still criminalises homosexuality and cross dressing. I have so much respect for trans women here, who risk dehumanisation, imprisonment, social ostracism, and even death, just for being themselves. The part about 'being clocked' particularly hit me because I've realized that I have an awful habit of unconsciously staring...I'm admiring their bravery and wondering how life must be like. But then, approaching them and randomly saying how brave they are seems potentially ableist. Like, girl can't even buy groceries without some awkward cis people patronizing them for walking in public. I'm so sorry, I'll stay at home forever now."

"I have a strong preference that instead of TERF (Trans Exclusive Radical Feminist), the term FART (Feminism Appropriating Reactionary Transphobe) be used instead. It signifies that such a hateful ideology is unwelcome amongst feminists."
"When I encountered the term 'gender critical' for the first time and didn't know yet that it was a euphemism for 'TERF', I actually liked it a lot and thought 'this sounds like it describes my stance on gender'. (I pretty much think that gender is a social construct that will pretty much lose its importance at some point and we'll stop seeing people as their gender and treating them in a way that's gender specific, and biological sex will only be relevant in medical context and it won't influence society's treatment of a person at all. This may be a utopian fantasy, since i'm not totally sure this is gonna happen, but i sure hope it will. But that's my perspective as a person who finds gender restrictive to me personally and who doesn't identify as any gender at all. And I don't think attacking trans people for conforming to gender stereotypes too much is the way to 'abolish gender', I think using gender-neutral language when talking about many people at once (like 'pregnant people' instead of 'pregnant women', as mentioned in the video) is a lot more effective and less harmful in that regard.)  Anyway, I find it pretty sad that the term 'gender critical' has been claimed by TERFs as a euphemism for their transphobic ideology when it could be used to describe a discussion on the nature of gender that explores the concept in many different ways, instead of just saying 'gender was invented by PC cultural marxist soyboy cucks, and chromosomes are the only thing that determines in which one of the rigid boxes that I've constructed someone fits'."
"Why u so cute when you laugh? Laugh more"
"It’s seems so silly now, but hearing her talk about how her trans narrative doesn’t fit into the “since I was a child” trope of transness opened my eyes to the fact that there are different ways to be trans. I know that sounds dumb, but as an uninformed cis woman I really had assumed all trans people always felt like the other gender since birth or whatever. I feel so dumb for not having realized this before. Lol Oh well. This video was top notch. I learned so much."
"#yesallgamers ? ...you know what...can't even argue, i started playing lolipop chainsaw last night and i love it"
"fuck why is there no LOVE button for this video"
"I used to find Germaine Greer incredibly enlightening. I still do to the extent of of criticisms on political issues -and she's a superb Shakespearean scholar. But I know trans women and -apart from the cruelty inherent in giving people who already have it tough- I certainly consider them women. Not to mention there has been a very ancient history of transgender persons in some of the most venerable cultures."
"“Excuse my beauty...terf” gave me the chills lol"
"26:38 I never knew Hello Internet fans were all trans women."
"Thank you so much for this video! As someone who entertained some terf-lite ideas for a while, it's nice to see these questions given an honest rebuttal, even if they're usually asked in bad faith as a dismissive tactic. Your videos in general have been hugely instrumental in changing me from a 'gender-critical' fence-sitter, to a trans-ally, and I cannot thank you enough.    Also, I have no idea why people on Twitter give you such a hard time. Everyone's experience with identity is unique, probably doubly so for people navigating the minefield that is gender (I'm questioning mine at the moment, and boy is it a trip). Not to mention the idea that any one trans person should be 'representing the whole community' is silly to me. I mean, I'm bisexual and I'm also polyamorous. And it took me a long time to accept that my multiple partners was not 'reflecting badly on the community' or 'perpetuating stereotypes about bisexuals' and I hate seeing this divisive 'but you make us look bad!!!' argument cropping up in other places too. Respectability politics are garbage, no matter where they strike, and I'm also glad that you don't seem to care about them in the slightest.   tl;dr: You're awesome! Keep up the great work!"
"Again, great video - congratulations! It would be great if you could, for each of these videos, make a smaller one summarizing the main ideas and points - although they are always insightful and witty, their length can, at times, discourage from watching them people who have only a passing interest in these topics. In any case, keep up the good work!"
"10:43 really suits you"
"Glad I found this channel. It's always interesting to learn about new things and ideas I'd otherwise be oblivious to. Thanks for the videos!"
"Natalie, you are truly the light on my doorstep to show me that I'm home."
"On the topic of passing, personally your voice would give it away so it's hard for me to accept no one in would notice in six months. Obviously, YMMV. x)"
"'It's not the same, but pretty different from CIS men'.   You said it. What is the problem with having a viewpoint like that?"
"thanks for existing"
"I'm definitely not there anymore, but I grew a little sympathetic toward TERFS after the women's march when excited middle aged women were shit on for wearing pussy hats. I thought it was so bizarre that I was suddenly expected to erase my own pussy for the sake of making a minority of a minority of people feel included. I'm never going to do that. But I absolutely accept trans women as women in the exact same way I'd accept a woman without a vagina as a woman. Still, this view is contentious in some spheres, and would be enough for plenty of people to call me a TERF."
"Most of my internalized transphobia, I've come to learn, never really felt like a hatred at all. I never hated my friends who are trans, never wanted to 'you mean HIM??' someone online, anything like that. But I always had unanswered questions. TERFy questions that were mostly covered in this video, but they were questions that I desperately did not have good answers to. And how am I supposed to be on the same side as trans people if I can't even defend my POV to an anti-trans person?   But everytime another swirling question gets answered, the separation that I feel between myself and people in the trans comm. shrinks just the tiniest bit. The guilt in my heart shrinks just a little bit, when I come  to terms that I'm not truly a hateful person, but I am just as susceptible to hateful ideas, if I don't put in the effort to counter them with better and more nuanced ones.  Thank you so so so much, Contra. So glad I dove down YOUR rabbit hole. (If ya know what I mean 😉😉)"
"Trans women: *wear nail polish, make-up, and have long hair* TERFs: 'Why are you reducing femininity to _that_? That's a man's idea of a woman, clearly you're a man' Other trans women: *don't wear polish, make up, and have short hair* TERFs: 'Look you don't even present feminine, clearly you're a man'"
"your videos are fresh as FUCK!!!!!!!"
"American's next top victim. That's my favorite show!"
"hanukkahtastrophe lmao"
"Love your work and thanks for showing me a side I'm not at all familiar with. However I'm going to continue believing in the genderless utopia but instead of making people genderless I'd like to remove gender from all gendersignaling items and mannerisms. Just like pants was a gender signal for men in the past, pants are now genderless. Let's just continue doing that with skirts, long hair, makeup and everything else. Even biological sex. In the utopia I visualise everyone can be as they want and gender just isn't a factor."

"Wow Natalie post a video on my birthday? Why thank you!"
"Not to miss the (Contra)point, but I would love to know more about your lighting setup."
"Hi Natalie, I really love your videos (btw you are absolutely gorgeous <3), and agreed with most of the things you said in this one, except for one little thing. As a transmedicalist and a trans guy, your comment about transmedicalism really stuck out to me. Most transmedicalists don't believe that you have to hate yourself to be trans. Dysphoria is just feeling a disconnection from your birth sex and the discomfort that it causes. That's it. You don't have to suffer immensely every day to have dysphoria. For some people, dysphoria is just knowing that they are not the gender they were assigned at birth, and being frustrated when people treat them as their biological sex. There are nonbinary transmeds, gnc transmeds and transmeds who feel very minor dysphoria. I myself am pretty lucky, and only feel mild to moderate dysphoria most of the time (although I do have days when it's really bad). I believe nonbinary transpeople, gnc trans people and trans people with mild dysphoria are valid, and so do many other transmeds. Granted, there are transmedicalists who are the way you view us, but they are definitely not the majority, and many members of our community actually speak out against them. Btw this isn't to hate you or anything, as I said, I enjoy your videos and respect you as a person! I just wanted to make some things clear. <3 Love you x"

"“Fair and balanced” is already triple copyrighted, Natalie!"
"You are a beautiful treasure."
"I am reasonable, therefore I can not be wrong. Now let's calmly sit down and examine the facts to show you how I'm always right."
"Another great video however,I can't get behind the way you let the woman who has had bad experiences with men off the hook for eqating trans women with men and hopping on the terf band wagon.  That would be like getting mugged by a black guy and in response organizing a campaign to get the government to refuse to recognize a Native American tribe because....minorities?  Although I do admit to playing it fast a lose with my numbers and power dynamics the point of this example was that I don't see how your man phobic woman could have arrived at her conclusion in an emotional way without one or two fairly bigoted base assumptions that caused her to conflate men with trans women.  Additionally I think you might might have accidentaly drawn a false moral equivalency between the kind of mostly unintentional microaggressiony avoidance behaviors directed at men (a group that is generally too powerful politically and prevalent numerically to feel the gaze of undisierablity from our 'gender sceptic' friend) with deliberate political activism aimed at stripping trans people (I don't think it's an accident that trans men get caught in the crossfire) of the precious few rights they have."

"Goddammit, I could just say this is a great video and agree with pretty much all of it, but even though I know it's a joke, a gratuitous troll, I just can't let that #YesAllGamers slide. It itches, it burns, the urge to respond to a troll. Gahhhh...  Y'know, this video touched on the subject of growing up as a woman, or a man, or something else. How about growing up as a nerd?

It also reminded me of this great TED talk of a trans woman talking about the differences of how she was treated before and after transition.  I'm sure it's difficult to talk about that because it might feel really invalidating to the identity trans people already have to defend all their lives, so I'm really thankful for everyone who does it."
"God damn! I sure enjoy your videos."
"As a trans man, I appreciate you mentioning the transmasculine perspective on this. I would also add that detransitioned women who fall into TERF ideology often use their experiences to claim that trans men are wrong in transitioning. I kind of understand why you didn’t talk about detransitioned people, but I feel like some TERFS will watch this video and point to detransitioners, saying “this is what the dogmatic transgender movement doesn’t want you to know about.”  I also would love to hear a more in-depth critique of transmedicalism, because I think a lot of young trans people, trans guys in particular, are leaning towards that belief, including myself. I haven’t really heard any good arguments against the belief that you need to be uncomfortable with your assigned sex (have dysphoria) to be trans. I think that transmedicalist beliefs have been used by some as an excuse to make fun of trans people who are gender nonconforming or who don’t pass."

Maybe focus on that before you go calling anyone else disgusting."
"'You'll never learn what it means to be ashamed of your periods' I got my first periods at 9 and I was never ashamed, what do you mean? I literally got my cis straight father to ask openly about my periods because I had to go to swimming training, does that mean I was never a real woman because I never experienced most of the oppression?  Whew, my non-binary ass is really glad that I was never a woman, thanks gender critics!"
"around 11 minutes there's the whole 'abolishing gender' thing - it doesn't mean you erase gender signifiers and everybody expresses themselves the same. I have never met any radfems who want that. What they mean is abolishing the whole system of labelling things as being gendered. A world where skirts are just a piece of clothing you wear if you find them comfy and like the look, with no connection to women or concepts like 'femininity'. In a way I think that sounds like a great world to live in, one where nobody is pressured to conform to anything. I don't think that's a bad world to want, the problem is that radfems don't have a clear plan for getting to that utopia. We are so deeply embedded in cultural ideas about gender that it's hard to imagine how we'd break those conceptual connections. In fact, it's probably gender non-conforming people who are doing more to break that connection, if only through getting people used to being around people whose signifiers don't connect to their sex and/or gender like they're 'supposed to'. So it's hypocritical for radfems to attack trans people for conforming to gender expressions.. they have no way of knowing what expressions are authentic or not and no process for making society more free in that regard. And as she points out in the video - why are they so focused on attacking trans people for their conformity? Why not attack the people with power who promote and punish others according to how much they conform? How about the men who assault people for not conforming? Punch up not down."
"Jeebus T.F. Christ, that Germaine Greer quote is fucking vile as shit.

One thing that seems pretty clear to me is that the gender traditionalists and trans-people (as well as the latter's loving supporters) agree on the following principle: gender abolitionists are wrong. Gender is a real, abiding, and desirable category among human beings, and the effort to eliminate it is misguided and harmful. Your thoughts?"

I have watched you live through your transition, and as a trans man, being able to see another transgender person put themselves out there and thrive like you do gives me hope that I'll be able to live like that someday too. The fact that you touched on this community (a community I almost got trapped in when I was still figuring out my identity) really means a lot to me, and I'm sure it means a lot to plenty of other people too. Please never change Natalie."
"You probably won't even get to read this, but from one fellow tran to another, thank you for being the only public-figure trans woman I know of out there who is honest, strong and brave enough to talk about what you used to believe, who you used to be and everything you've had to unpack during your transition instead of just blocking it behind the brick wall of the 'I was never male' discourse. Nuance is so important, because the more dogmatic and irrational our side becomes, the easier the terfs have it to shoot us down. Thank you again for the amazing work you're doing with these videos. I don't feel so alone anymore now."

"I'M HOWLING I'm super guilty of the genderless wishful thinking, but I'm thinking more of a world where you can wear fake nails without the 'you-are-female' implication -because that's a social construct, right? I would love to live in a society where you can dress and present based on what you like, without worrying about fitting into a binary/non-binary stereotype (I've noticed that even some non-binary people are gatekeeping eachother nowadays... Isn't it pointless then?)  Anyway, I would never use the argument to put down a trans person, it makes no sense. Saying that you want a gender-free world and then criticizing someone for the way they dress (too masculine/too feminine?!) kinda debunks the whole argument. If self-expression is gender-free, then clothes have no gender, make-up has no gender, GENDER HAS NO GENDER, gender isn't real😵 but that doesn't invalidate trans people... No more than it invalidates cis people. Idk, maybe it's a stupid idea.   I LOVE your videos, oh my god (and your looks are the coolest🙏)"

"Is it just Trans women that TERFS have a problem with? I just wonder if they have problems with other types of women. Which is a wired question, 'types of women'. Maybe what I am trying to say is: How do TERFS relate to say, women with disabilities. Are these women acknowledge or even seen by TERFS? Are their experiences acknowledged by TERFS? Or should I say, Radical Feminists who are Trans Exclusionary also have problems with Women who have disabilities? That might make better sense. So DERFS???"
"Speak to a regular white cisgengered male and talk about his experience growing up. Ask him about the inter-gendered conflict he deals with on a daily basis from grade school throughout highschool.  Ask him about the judgement he deals with from cisgendered women on a daily basis from grade school onward. Ask him about the dominance struggle he deals with on daily basis with other men that directly contributes to his attractiveness to other women who see him as good or bad based on how he deals with those conflicts.   Or how about we don't reduce people down to their skin colour or gender and instead judge them on their actions. I know it's tough, but I think that might be a little more accurate."

"The thing about the whole TERF thing is that it does follow from some basic feminist ideas. Feminists have vigorously denied any sexual dimorphism in the brain's morphology. Men and women act, dress, relate to one another and each other, etc. because of conditioning/expectation, not because of any innate differences per the Damore memo thing. Well, if you think that, then if you are born with a cock and balls, raised/socialized as a boy, in what sense can being a guy be 'wrong for you'? To understand that, we have to resort to the sexed brain to understand why that identity is dissonant with your inner self. But of course that makes us 'gender essentialists', in other words not feminists."
"I pretty much hate terfs. My sister is a trans woman, I hate how her kind is being treated online by those assholes. I don’t think I’ll ever be okay with terfs.

I'm putting myself into debt to pursue a career in counselling, when I could've had the life I wanted with the job I already had. You mentioned that 90% of feminism (and everything else) is basically trash, pop culture bandwagon BS, I hope you'll treat MRA arguments the same. Some people weaponise them to shut down the idea that women have any legitimate issues, that is not where I'm coming from"

"5:47 Trans people don't like engaging those questions because they expose the flaws with trans ideology. Why not answer the question... why CAN'T you just be a feminine man? Why does your appreciation of things that fall within female stereotypes mean you should be counted as a woman? Why are you defining womanhood by stereotypes?  This stuff is offensive to women. It's the equivalent of 'I like basketball and rap and fried chicken, therefore I am black.' Can you even imagine a black person being accused of hate speech for saying 'uh no Mr. White Person, fitting into black stereotypes doesn't make you black'? It's ridiculous... but it's exactly what happens when women say that dresses and long hair and makeup don't turn a man into a woman.  In response to other points... you seem to be misunderstanding some other GC viewpoints.  Gender critical people believe the following: 1) anyone should be able to dress however the hell they want to 2) anyone should be able to modify their appearance surgically or however else they want to 3) being female is not about how you were socialized, it's about your biology.  GC feminists aren't criticizing your choice to wear makeup and dresses, we're criticizing the idea that wanting to wear those things means you must be a woman. GC people want men to be able to break stereotypes and live their lives however they want to... just stop saying that breaking the stereotypes makes you female, and stop demanding access to sex-segregated places like women's locker rooms and women's sports leagues and women's prison. They are segregated by biological sex for a reason, they are not segregated by personality stereotypes.  GC feminists want lesbians  to be free to date only females, without being shamed if they don't want to date someone who has a 'lady dick'.  GC feminists are often accused of 'gatekeeping'. Technically this might be true, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. Many people were 'gatekeeping' when they told Rachel Dolezal she isn't black. People will rightfully 'gatekeep' an adult who claims to be a child and wants to attend elementary school. There is nothing wrong with refusing to agree with someone's claim about their identity that is physically demonstrably a false claim."
"Natalie is much more feminine than me and I know for a fact that she is comfortable with how she expresses herself, yet she will be considered an it or he. I wear men’s clothing and my behavior is in the middle of man and woman. That’s how I express myself. I fully identify as a woman and I’m cis, yet I am considered a real woman when someone who is a trans woman is apparently not a real woman. I find that really illogical."

"my biggest problem with TERFs (from the point of view of someone who doesn't have to deal with their bullshit in the first person, and except for seeing that bullshit from the sidelines) is their complaints that the term 'cis' somehow diminishes their womanhood. Trans and cis are both subsections of a gender and are there to better describe whoever you are describing. There's no need to clarify cis in a situation where you don't feel like there would be any need to clarify trans."
"most gorgeous highlight award !!!"
"I use your arguments in real life debates. Thank you for formulting them so well. You are really doing important work."
"It really undermines your claim to authority when u use discredited terms. 'TERF' is a canard & a term of abuse. It is used as a stick to beat down anyone sayin anything even remotely divergent from whatever the current favoured trans theory of the day happens to be. WPUK get called 'TERF' even tho real live transpeople go to their meetings and support their message. And even 'extreme' feminists like Greer are inclusive of transmen in women's spaces. So they are not 'trans exclusionary'. At best you could call some of those people 'PERFS'. I think you know what the 'P' stands for.  You know, just cos you say a thing whilst making a squinty face, doesn't make it invalid. 'gender critical' just means you don't place 'gender' as the central and most vital aspect of human identity and existence. It means you don't believe in immutable gender expression. That's actually totally progressive. They do believe in physical reality tho, which is why they dont think males should be allowed to compete against females in sports for example. The 7ft 'female' basketball player being an obvious example of why.   You say don't want to parody 'terfs' and then go ahead and parody 'terfs'... I r confuse.  Theres reasons theres a huuuge disparity between the number of transwomen and transmen. Its a psychosocial ting yo   You don't 'live as a woman', you live as a man who likes to try and look like a woman. Your mental gymnastics on that point lead nowhere.  The gender critical women you are so repulsed by do not want to curtail your rights or ability to present or feel as you wish, they just want to preserve the concept of facts. So when things like all-women short lists are implemented to redress an imbalance between male and females in a particular arena, then its fair and logical for those shortlists to be compiled of women, not anyone who says they are since last Tuesday.  Its no coincidence that 'trans' has exploded exponentially of late. Gender stereotypes have become entrenched. Back in the 70s & 80s it was more fluid, men had flowing locks and wore makeup, women had shaved heads and wore dungarees.. In a society that is more open to free expression there seems to be less incentive for the gender disenfranchised to seek a more severe solution to their frame of mind. Ya think?"
"Sad to see the freak is still alive..."
"I'm not gonna lie, usually I lean into gender criticism, but in the 'stronger gender-nonconformism' sence. I've always felt gender-based norms, expectations, limitations and 'appropriately feminine behavior' stifling and unfair to cis women. And trans people being a part of this discussion didn't really crossed my mind. It's the first time I've seen 'gender critical' linked with or used instead of 'terf'.  But this video goes straight to favourites."

I have to assume she’s aware of that, since she said she researched gender critical subreddits, and just chose not to address it. Also in a previous ep she said she’s a descriptivist, ie acknowledges how we use terms defines what they mean. TERF is used against homosexual women because of their homosexuality; therefore TERF is, in part, a homophobic slur."

"Just thought I'd drag my degenerate post-dimorphic-sex post-human simultaneous-hermaphrodite cyborg furry tyranny in on my feet with me and shit things up a bit with entirely speculative cartoon science-fiction fantasy removed 'totally' from reality... totally.  *whistle of faux innocence*  Say--what if--tweak a few chromosomes with nanites and make some new tissues and organs in vivo--and *bam it iddn't a woman no more.* (oh did I invoke biology thar)  One problem is, as with most issues of value, that we as humans find ourselves falling into a trap of determinism vs. free will, and nature vs. artifice, when debating topics of identity.  Like, am I 'choosing' right now to represent myself as a neon-furred space-alien, that flirts with purple headcrabs, or is that simply a product of nature/nurture? Is it 'healthy' for such a seemingly extreme deviation from the human norm to exist, or is it something that should be treated like an illness and corrected for the sake of some form of ethical humane treatment?  The way I see it, I am a mutation of the human species, that could succeed or fail all on its own, but I would prefer to succeed, for the sake of novelty, and for the sake of my own prosperity. I find the current human norm boring, albeit practical (product of aeons of evolution, yada yada), but find myself attracted to imagining the strange and different. I'd prefer to 'become' just about anything if I could somehow have the experience of that, with the assurance of a complete refund (impractical as that wishful thinking may be), but simultaneously accept that physical bodies have limitations and health concerns, and that to just up and Franken-Fran myself into whatever I desire through a combination of gene editing, nanobiology, and cosmetic surgery, is not a presently tenable solution to my existential curiosity and yearning to show off a weird pastiche of androgynous interspecies beauty with intact reproductive function and the power to filthily self myself like a horny pea plant.  Ultimately, I think the matter of 'trans' comes down to weighing the compromise of what is physically and psychologically healthy and consistent for the individual, against what they would ultimately desire as a goal of self-actualization, and creating a model for that self-actualization that interferes minimally with the existing social orders of the human species. As our technology improves, and our medical ethics evolve, these will be questions that are altogether redefined, as the range of options available to humans to redefine their identity expands and becomes more readily available to the layman.  A couple decades ago, you didn't have things like video games, 'avatars', and the internet, allowing people to experiment so freely with their sense of identity and capability to affect a world.  Something to consider. Just a tiny slice of what a couple decades of progress with computers have offered us--virtual identity redefinition--a child sandbox's taste of the construction projects to come... bleh, sandy. (what am I even saying, fuck this shit, back to muggle land)"
"Amazing video, as always! I'm afraid I don't have anything deeper to say that 'Great work!', but I'll say it anyway, in the hopes that it helps out with Youtube's most arcane of algorithms. \*tongue pops out of existence*"
"'-rather we're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.'   I think you meant to say that you use a cultural language of feminine signifiers to help *yourself* in deterring from the idea that you could be perceived as masculine. The great unfair irony here being that so much effort/resources are required of you just in maintaining a visual perception when that poor undergrad armed with only a hair-tie, an old hoodie, and some flip-flops makes it seem like she's cheating in terms of no one disputing her 'presentation'.   'i'm tempted to strike back to say you don't know what it's like...- [blah blah blah?]'   i think the 'forest through the trees' point to be made here is that the real juicy bits and the actual injustice part of oppression is that most of us don't spend hundreds of dollars to gain it.    My quip here (assuming anyone cares) is the dismissal of 'I want to be a woman' for 'I am a woman'. It brings to mind the 'Any man who must say, 'I am the King', is no true king.' line. The whole point of commonly being established as genuine is that it does little to inspire doubt and even less to call for convincing. It's effortless in its presentation because it simply is. The root of respecting others identities, how we treat them, and how we address them is where most of the ills lie.  But since I'm already this far into the textbox I'm going to whip out a very broad brush. One I'm ashamed enough to mention beforehand but not so ashamed as to refrain from using it; Looking at this from a distance, genuine dysphoria aside, it's just another remix of that old ass song where a white dude does everything in his power to get what he wants. Only this time what he wants is to not be a white dude."

"Yet again you've made me reassess everything and think critically. I thought TERFS were just bigoted (and they are) but now I really hope they just need time to understand. EDIT: Also I'm unreasonably attracted to TERF you"
"I have so much respect for trans people. Having the bravery to live your life the way you feel you should, even though you risk being ridiculed by anyone and everyone you know, that’s something I really admire. You’re all braver than I ever could be. I want you to know that, regardless of differences in politics/religion/whatever, I love every single one of you."
"I dont have the energy for this..."
"I feel as though a lot of the 'you haven't experienced my oppression, you can't be a woman' doctrine is extremely US-centric, too. As someone who grew up as a pretty average looking girl in Europe I can't say I was ever hassled or catcalled, nor have I ever talked to anyone that has been. Now, I'm sure catcalling is still a thing here but I don't feel as though it's as prominent to the 'female experience' or whatever as terfs make it out to be. I'm not cis but if I was I think terfs would find it hard to argue that I am because how could I be, no one cares about my reproductive rights and I've never been talked at by a random man.  Anyway, as always, great and nuanced video - I fucking adore all of them 💕"

"mommy"
"I read a thing once, where a woman talked about how they had told their mother that they felt bad that they’d had a knee jerk sexist reaction towards another woman, and that their mother told them that the knee jerk reaction isn’t what matters, because that’s just what society tells us to think. The thing that really mattered was the thought afterwards, the acknowledgment that she was wrong. And that really stuck with me. A big thing about bigotry is that it’s based on the knee jerk reaction of disgust, and it then goes unexamined. When I first realized I was a part of the lgbt+ community, I had to examine a lot of my knee jerk reactions to other members, and that was difficult. Sometimes I still find myself uncomfortable around the topic of trans people, because it’s foreign to me, and the majority of my knowledge comes from a primarily cis media. But the trick is catching your knee jerk reactions, and working towards educating yourself on the topic. I’m still in that process, and I probably always will be. But I’m never going to let that reaction control me, because I know it’s wrong, and it is fallible, and taking a moment to sit with it and then work to better myself is infinitely better than pushing my own issues onto someone else just because I’m uncomfortable. And my life has gotten infinitely better since I started living that way, and ContraPoints has been a huge part of that learning process."

I have to admit I've always found the concept of gender identity to be a bit foreign, something I can sort of understand intellectually but not actually relate to. I'm agender, so I don't really know what it feels like to identify as a particular gender. I would love to hear from some people who have experience with these feelings, as I'm always trying learn more.   What exactly does it mean to feel like a 'woman in a man's body' or a 'man in a woman's body'? For that matter, what exactly does it mean to feel like a man or woman in the first place?"

"I don't understand excluding people because they 'haven't suffered'. Isn't the point of feminism to end suffering?"
"Awesome video! The term 'gender critical' really bothers me because it implies that trans people and those who support us aren't critical of gender. It's silly when you consider that someone like Judith Butler who's spend their entire career criticising gender but is the complete antithesis to what TERFs believe."

They feel like a she, want equality with him and yearn for a happy ending for everyone DON'T BE A DICK."

"MEN are afraid that Women might Laugh at them, Women are afraid that Men might KILL THEM!"
"I kind of feel like people who have had traumatising experiences as girls (being catcalled as a kid, ect.) and grow up to be TERFs are only TERFs because their traumas never addressed in a healthy way and the adults in their lives failed to make them feel safe. So now those traumas are being projected outwards at people who haven't/can't/they don't think experienced the things that traumatised them.    But these are the 3:30am philosophical ramblings of a masc genderqueer heathen, so what do I know."
"Oh and here's 1 more thing! - MEN are afraid that Women might laugh at them, Women are afraid that men might KILL THEM!  yes KUDOS to you Natalie Wynn, you are spot on LADY MISS WOMAN!  You are spot on in the reason it it necessary to have people fall into either male or female identities! Without knowing who is a woman and who is a man, they are what? just they? or more typical is the case that you so perfectly showed us in this video 'they' are just a robot! Besides, won't that be really confusing since there are not public bathroom or locker rooms for robots to use since Duh! robots don't use bathrooms or locker rooms! (and robots dont even go to the gym or the pool or anywhere else for that matter!) Only human people go to school, the gym, the mall, the library, the grocery store, only humans not robots do that stuff!  Yes I have seen maybe 1 or 2 public bathrooms that were labeled as UNISEX but they were only at a doctors office, one was upstairs and the other was downstairs, and besides it didn't say non-gendered on the sign on the door. And how many places will actually install a woman's room, a men's room and a Unisex room? (obviously it is more expensive to have 3 bathrooms than 2!)  So the next time you are out & about of the house, take notice of the bathrooms at the place, any place that you go to. What bathrooms do you see? It's not that complicated! Giving people the options of being a human man or a human woman has some very very useful & necessary & practical reasons. The bathrooms & locker rooms are just one small one (also add the fitting rooms in any stores that sell human clothing too!)   😎🐱‍👤💗🐾🦔💖🌵"

"Very good video. However, you have a tendency to make ad hominem and strawman fallacies to any group you're not currently addressing, which is a shame, since it takes away from the credibility and quality of the video.  I suggest you address Transmedicalist one say since your strawmanning of their position is probably the worst of the bunch."

"Awestruck by the aesthetics,  steamrolled by the argument. a hitting the fash like a train and leaving rainbow glitter in her tracks"
"So, don't tell TERFs about fa'afafine , or their heads might explode...or do, because their heads might explode."
"Your remark about “gender critical” being similar to “race realist” in that it seeks to ameliorate perceptions of prejudiced beliefs is brilliantly incisive.  Something I find curious about a lot of TERFs is that their bigotry isn’t usually a signifier of their wider beliefs. You can expect a typical MRA to be pro-life, pro-gun and xenophobic. But TERFs tend to have a lot of liberal bona fides (here in the UK, some of the most prominent TERFs write for left leaning newspapers). So they seem to find it hard to recognise their transphobia as an act of bigotry.  I once had an argument with a columnist for the New Statesman who was supporting the bathroom bills in America on the basis that allowing trans women into female spaces would be to invite potential abusers into them. I pointed out that this was almost identical to the logic of racists who claim that allowing Muslim refugees into European countries will lead to an increase of sex crimes.  She was so insulted that I’d compared her to racists that she blocked me, which I found quite instructive - she thought of herself as a morally good person and couldn’t accept the parallel between her behaviour and something as repugnant as racism."

"This was ABSOLUTELY EXHILARATING"
"YOU LOOK SO PRETTY!!! Such an informative video!"
"Hi! Ex “gender critical” person here (aka ex-stupid terf). You wanna know why I thought that way? Simple, I was told from an early age certain of my attributes were man like, so I had this irrational fear that I wasn’t enough of a woman and I projected those insecurities on transgender people. So whenever you see a TERF pity them, cause from my experience they are a bundle of insecurities that lash down on others to feel better about themselves, do not validate them it’s a stance entirely based on emotions and nothing else, no smart dialogue will ever come from it. (Having said that I never bully people on the internet because even as a teenager I had the critical skills necessary to understand that was wrong, so don’t pity them that much I guess)"
"From Ohio, Cincinnati is not real and Skyline Chili is a money laundering scheme."
"Omg the way you say Terf in the end is so amazing.  As a woman studies major I fell pray to these radial feminist platitudes and even tho I would always defend trans women in those circles- the only argument I could give is that I have to believe in the lives and stories of the trans women who speak about their own experience.  Thanks for giving me a theoretical leg to kick ass with from now on."

"I was really happy to see that you uploaded a video, as I recently found out about your channel and have been binge watching everything. It's very educational and entertaining, as so many other people comment. But then at 4:56 I see the president. I'm not upset to see Trump. I'm talking about the Latin American Trump version that my fellow Brazilians chose to vote for.  Once a great Brazilian writer said that us Brazilians have a stray dog syndrome. We feel as if we are unworthy as if compared to other countries economics and politics (the serious stuff), and yet feel very proud of the rest (football and caipirinhas, I guess?). I don't know if it makes sense for other people but it suits this moment very well for me. I do have to say that seeing even a slight mention of my country on my new favorite channel feels like I'm not being picked last at gym class, yay! But for all the wrong reasons.  Thank you very much for the content, as always it's great to hear your opinion."
"Great video as always and especially liked that last minute MAJOR shade thrown ... Noncomplete did a great video series recently 'PewDiePipeline' which he basically says (paraphrasing) 'to know your enemy and treat them as such' those of us on 'the left' have somehow been kowtowed by the right into being the polite ones...even in the face of true unbridled and unchangeable hate that cannot be rationed with... we need to recognise that ... treat them as they treat us  talk to them as the talk to us use their tactics against them at every possible moment swear, deride and mock at every chance Chapo call it 'the dirtbag left' and we need that now...because simply rationalising is gone...  I have always did this with MRA's/MGTOW's... drag the conversation to laws and then point out men where the ones that wrote them they will ALWAYS blame woman for not changing them or trying to change them ..ALWAYS and that's your queue: 'You want woman to fight men's battles for them? Are you a feminist bc you sound like one? Your truly ARE emasculated you cucked fuck'  they love to claim they are emasculated but DAMN they hate it when they are called that bc they aren't really...and will more often than not scream how they are not - which ofc destroys their own entire narrative...  debunking videos of fine and good BUT ones that debunk while completely mocking and laughing at their ideas ALWAYS get video replies and angry demands for 'debates' etc they claim to be the meme/internet generation but remember idiots SO ARE WE ..."
"I'm 26 now.. It's so strange that in such a short amount of time.. Not long ago society was so different.. I remember seeing gay guys in school and having that 'this is weird why are they like that' feeling and seeing girl on girl or guy on guy kissing grossed me out.. Now over time and with society changing, so have I.. I don't bat an eye at it, I think all HUMANS  are beautiful the way they are and get angry when bigoted family members utter their disgust or judgmental words (I'm from California with most of my family being in Texas)  I only hope society continues to progress and perphaps not in my lifetime.. But someday these things won't even be an issue.. They'll be looked at as ridiculous like slavery now is. It's a shame it's already taking so long"

"BTW the reason that the vast majority of battle/war fatalities & POVs are male, men, biological guys, is simply cuz the entire military is systemically clearly MORE Accepting of human beings of the MALE gender/sex. Look at the entire recruitment process, when you see a recruitment camp set up outside of the local super save a lot store (or walmart).  1. Notice how many women/females are part of the group trying to get everyday discount seeking American people coming in & out of the store typically they have a small group of uniform clad, Men about 2-4  and 2. they will approach 1.other men and 2.couples, when they speak to a couple that consists of a man & a woman, they typically ask the man about this thoughts or ideas of enlisting in the service. So in conclusion - when you have a system that typically favors recruitment of one group of people over another group of people, that system will recruit the vast majority of the favord group. Look at the data! Do a simple internet search to see how many people were recruited or enlisted into the American military (every branch) and see what gender/sex they are of. It's very obvious."
"Not that it matters but it took me a few days to realize you were trans.  When I found out it opened my mind further about the subject.  I absolutely love you and your videos.              You're the best.  😻😻😻😻😻"

"Okay if the name of your movement starts with the word “radical” you should already be putting together you are doing something wrong"
"I agree with a lot of radical feminist theory especially the way it refuses to just accept the sex/porn industry and refuses to sugar coat it and ignore the human rights abuses that are integral to a sex industry even existing... I just wish there wasn't a hateful 'trans-exclusionary' element that came with it. And I have been able to find quite a few radical feminists who wouldn't even consider being transphobic but it just really sucks because the rest of radical feminist theory can be pretty well .... rad. (I had to and I'm not sorry) Plus many intersex people never find out sooo YOU COULD HAVE A Y CHROMOSOME YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE SHARON!!"
"'Public arena of free speech open communication dialogue conversation debate idea marketplace expression discourse'    I will subscribe to you forever..."
"Thank you for this. Years ago I was  a giant TERF & I've made a lot of progress since then but I still had a lot of these thoughts running in the back of my mind. I just decided to stop acting so hateful and respect everyone, but I never managed to figure out the answers to a lot of the questions that TERFs pose.  I'm a very gender non-conforming lesbian & have been through so much at the hands of men. My life experiences made it so easy to be terrified of everyone with a Y chromosome. It felt like the only thing that could keep me safe, because I made so many mistakes and trusted so many men I shouldn't have. It's only this year I let a straight man in my car since I was a teenager. And that's only because I had a knife. Anyone that could possibly have a d*ck was a threat and it would be my fault if something happened to me if I trusted them.   I've also never cared for gender, and get sird often enough it's a pattern, so it was very hard for me to understand why pronouns mattered so much to people. The only part of womanhood I identify with is my body and the way I was victimized at a young age, so I was easy prey to TERF reasoning that the only part of womanhood that mattered was chromosomes & upbringing.   I know it's silly to spill my guts in a YouTube comment, but just in case you see this I wanted you to know you really changed one butch's point of view by explaining all the nuance, and there's plenty of people in bigoted spaces that you can still reach. Thank you for all your hard work, sister."
"Loved this video Natalie, and I agree, the term 'menstruator' just makes me cringe."
"That “the who” riff was awesome."
"I'm gonna need that last moment gif'd, uploaded and ready to be used liberally on Twitter"
"A Terf gave me a crazy lecture once with all those points. I thought she was a bit of a disturbed person , never realising that it’s an actual thing. She cornered me because I am a biological woman who often is asked if I am Trans  I knew the only reason for their  argument is transphobia Glad to have such a beautiful come back as Miss Yellowhair  Have some manners TERFS"
"Listen, sweaty"
"It's not really taken for granted that trans men's experiences as women before we transitioned are valid and that we know what it's like to be women. Yeah, it is sometimes, but I've seen it go both ways. Most people (online) don't treat me any different than a cis guy that doesn't know what he's talking about (irl, I don't pass so idk how that would go), especially in leftist spaces that aren't exclusively for trans people (think leftbook groups and stuff). Some people seem outright hostile even. It really depends on what type of LGBT space you're in. I'm glad that's been your experience with it but it really hasn't been mine. But I definitely agree that whether trans guys are treated this way on the whole or not, that trans women's experiences before they transitioned are often discounted or expected to be a certain way. I really enjoyed this video overall Natalie, just thought I'd share my own experience!"

Make them somehow understand that trans people tend to 'perform' their gender A) because doctors make us perform to earn the right to surgery and medical transition and B) because we were denied the opportunity all throughout childhood and adolescence and C) because if we DON'T dress the part, cis people will use it as an excuse to misgender and invalidate us.

Those events were shocking or something, I don't know how to feel about them now. But I remember them as if they were formative. I can't imagine having that happen to me all the time. Even in the mirror."
"With regards to the point on having a uterus and or menstruating: I think the TERF approach to this also seems to imply the experiences of biologically female women without uteruses are invalid. My girlfriend experiences terrible emotional distress because of this. She's a woman and was born female but had to have her uterus removed, she also never had functioning ovaries. Even the two X chromosome thing doesn't fully apply. She has Turner Syndrome. She doesn't feel like a woman because she feels like she can't have what other women have. TERF rethoric excludes women like her as well."

I was getting sucked into the less thoughtful people's content which is generally kind of dumbed down and doesn't go as deep. I'm so happy I found you through June, your thoughts and knowledge behind these videos is refreshing and I've learned a lot about gender and feminism just by listening to you. As part of my literature degree, I studied gender studies as well, but it was only one semester and it just scratched the surface of issues. It's very easy to dismiss all gender related concerns with a shrug and some flashy language, the way some youtubers do. I'm glad I found you so I can actually broaden my horizons."

And if non binary people don't claim they're non binary only because of the way they dress and present themselves   why do they? And if that's the case don't you find it problematic?   I'm actually asking questions and not trying to be smart. The gender debate is one of the few political debates I don't actually take a side on and I'm still pretty confused by it. I find transmeds arguments more appealing but that could easily change. And I don't think the argument is good because gender dysphoria is 'painful'. I just don't get why anyone without gender dysphoria want to ID as trans at all and also should we just accept anyone who IDs as trans? Don't you think self ID can be harmful sometimes?  What are some reasons people might consider themselves trans without having gender dysphoria?"

I support trans people and trans rights, but I do have a lot of questions about definitions and experiences, etc. What can I say: I'm a cis dude who ultimately doesn't know shit about experiences outside of mine. However, ever since I found your videos I have become better, little by little, at understanding trans issues and concerns. I love your commentary and coverage, and I can't wait for the next one!  Two more things:  1. Your transition is coming along beautifully. 2. Who does your set design? Seriously, the production on your videos is magnificent.

"((4K comments, probably not gonna get answered, but who knows))  This isn't a gotcha moment, but it's something that's getting press.  Why haven't you commented on trans women in born women sports events (I'm saying born women as a way to seperate the two for this particular comment, not a way to erase trans at the moment as it would get confusing if I tried saying Women are taking Womens jobs or something).  Because there have been a significant number of Trans Women who have gotten into womens sports and won with significant gaps between them and born women counterparts.  That males tend to on average, have better physiques for various physical activities on a statistics standpoint (not commenting on outliers).  Thus, if someone transitioned late, or not even had full transitioning surgery, would still have various physical masculine aspects that would help in sports (like to be on average taller).    Is it fair for a born woman to lose their competition to at best, a woman with a mans body, or even worse, a bad actor taking advantage of the times and claiming to be a woman?    Because that isn't as clear cut, because we are dealing with biology that cant be retroactively changed, and in several cases, hasn't even been attempted to be changed.   I'm fairly interested on your thoughts on this, and is also something I hear a lot squawked about by Twitter TERFs"

"IMO, if we're taking the direction of accepting new pronouns and gender identities that go beyond the spectrum of masculine-feminine (I'm talking xim/xer/bunself and cloudgender here - if you're not on board with that nonsense then this may not apply) then attempting to abolish gender as a social construct is a better idea and more realistic to accomplish. Either we can build a bunch of new boxes to be upset about being forced into, or we can tear those boxes down. And you know what? All my life I've been watching those boxes slowly crumble - realistically speaking, we'll probably never get away from gendered signifiers and such but I think it's perfectly possible to, maybe in the next 100 years, reach a point where people well and truly have no concern about the appearance and mannerisms of other people and which side of the seesaw those lean on, and maybe then we can just HAVE BATHROOMS and stop worrying about whether it's more likely for someone to break laws in them if they're in the same room with the wrong people. And maybe we can just DATE PEOPLE WE FIND ATTRACTIVE and find some way to navigate genital preference like adults.   That said, the 'gender critical' are out of their minds if they think their desire for the abolition of gender is reason enough to deny trans people their identities now. What a great way to prove they actually don't believe the words that are coming out of their own mouths. When I say I don't think gender is important, I back that up by being a lifelong cis male who doesn't bat an eye when he's misgendered. Like sure, you're wrong, and I might correct you so things don't get awkward, but I'm not going to pretend the whole damn world already plays by my rules. I try to be an example and I make dumb internet comments basically just barking at a wall, but my goal is to shift perceptions and open people to new ideas, not use my own ideals as a whip to abuse others.   in my mind gender is not an identity; it's just a tool. It's not your totality, it's just one of nearly infinitely many ways to describe who and what you are. It's a very generalized tool with a huge spread that hits a lot of people, but our pattern-seeking brains find such taxonomic classifications useful in grouping together individuals of broad similarities. That, to me, is why it seems absurd when people go down the 'bunself' rabbit hole. Because of course your identity is bunny-like. Don't even PRETEND like I don't know how that feels. But my gender is not 'stupid purple raccoon' - that's my identity. I get to define my own name to mean that. My body, my soul, my very essence IS stupid purple raccoon, and nobody but me gets to change that. My pronoun can continue being the broad, only-vaguely-useful-in-a-categorization-sense he/she/they. Because it never has been, and never should be, anything more than that.   But also, that's why it's so stupid to deny someone's identity. Contra is a woman. Look at her. There's no denying that the only way in which she can be considered anything else are her chromosomes/sex organs. And we have a word for that already; it's called sex. If you want to tell me that someone who looks, dresses, acts like, and for all intents and purposes IS a woman, is in fact not a woman, at that point you're twisting the concept of gender into something it is definitively not, all because of your own personal distaste. I don't buy their line of reasoning there."

"Your problem isn't with gender critical feminists, your problem is with a class society that has organized people by sex and assigned particular roles and feelings to those sexes. Gender critical feminists don't choose to be defined within the category of 'woman', it's been forced upon them, as it has for all women. You have a major misunderstanding with the way sex functions and how it is deeply connected to a class system that organizes and oppresses people by having female bodies.  We live in a world where people are defined by their bodies. The definitions of people and the organization of power assigned to identities by society comes from the top down. Those are the rules made by men (and whites). The dominant society, globally, for thousands of years, determines womanhood according to being born female with a female genitalia. Again, these are the definitions made by those in power. When you're referring to sex, you're not simply talking about mental and physical female characteristics, you're also talking about a specific class of people that have a specific identity with a specific lived experience. To say that being born in a female body, by the standard definition, isn't a specific and distinct difference from being born male, is to completely misunderstand how sex-ism actually functions in a sex-based society. To be subject to an oppression, the dominant class has to define you as a member of the oppressed group. For example, if I'm 15% black, but my socialization is white, my birth certificate and all following documents say I'm white, and people regard me as white...then I'm white, according to the social and political definitions of race. The same applies to sex.  So again, the definitions aren't being set by gender critical feminists, it's already been predetermined by the dominant class. They're simply pointing it out to you that your identity and experience is different from their identity and experience. To have a problem with that runs counter to your own logic. Biological women acknowledging and defining the terms of their OWN specific identity is not something you have any rightful say in, and to believe otherwise is misogyny."

Then when they almost give up and give in the same damned voice also reminds them that they never knew what it was to be their originally assigned gender either. You'd think it was only about chromosomes but even Klinefelter syndrome trans women have exactly the same doubts and discouragements. It's all a bit discouraging, it helps a lot to have a good sense of humor and perhaps a dash of masochism."

"-EDIT-  To be more clear, this was a shocked reaction to what I saw in pockets of the trans community on tumblr hours after I saw this video. Their concerns on Nat’s vids are valid and definitely have roots in reality, but will absolutely refuse to get out of utopian ideology and will not engage in analysis/using practical solutions in the general real-world.   Welp. Just saw the beginning of the tumblr shitstorm.They’re already taking huge chunks of this out of context, basically projecting out and acting like you are talking about their individual lived history, and saying you’re racist and ableist. And that you are not framing TERFs as actually spiteful and more “confused”.  Oh and that you are setting trans people back DECADES with this video bc.......I suppose going through and explaining nuance/exploring complicated things like gender in society and how it is messy is really anti-trans lmao.  Anyway this video is amazing. I think it really points out the flaws in the TERF ideology and dismantles all of their flimsy arguments. Good luck against hyper-reactive trolls -EDIT- (trolls are not people who merely disagree. come on. don’t use the argument below. it’s boring)"

"I am in love with you ContraPoints."
"I don't really like the way this video deals with the argument of gender abolition. You opened the video saying you would engage in these arguments, and instead refused to engage with gender abolitionism because it's used often as a weapon. It's fine to choose not to engage with it, but it feels wrong considering you lead me to believe you were going to actually address its concern.   I see gender as a vehicle that is by definition oppressive. Gender is, at its core, a collection of stereotypes. Now I agree that's no reason to attack trans people, but I'd argue it's not outside the reach of society to move past gender entirely. It's one of those things where it's not something you should throw in people's faces, but it's something you should get people thinking about. If you just say over and over it's utopian and will never happen, then you'll be no better than those who say the same things about socialism. Those aren't good faith arguments.   So in closing, I think gender abolition is a legitimate goal to work toward, and I think gender defined by identity is a step forward towards that goal."

"I don't think I was ever intensely TERFy, but I certainly had a lot of those questions which I think everyone wonders at some point. The answer is that gender identity is really complex and it can take years of researching and listening to trans folk to understand. Like when I was 18 I was like, sure, trans women are women. But I also had never met a trans woman so the statement didn't mean much to me.  Also, how is it feminist to drag people's appearances down???? smh its probably the same girls in high school who bullied the cis girls who had short hair and were intensely boyish."

Women and men just made fun of me for not being feminine enough, often calling me a woMAN (haha get it?? Because MAN??? Emphasis on MAN?? it's funny because it has the word MAN). All the while having to deal with the fact that I hit puberty way earlier than anyone else in my class so having to deal with catcalls in elementary school was fun (and even being dresscoded?? Mulitple times?? Like hello?? At least wait until I'm twelve asshole??)   In middle school I chose to wear basketball shorts and t-shirts for most of my time there. Fashion was hard for me. I didn't always know what I wanted to wear but I knew I wanted to stay away from the more 'feminine' things. This was, of course, my 'im not like other girls' phase to which I'm sure most of you are familiar with. I was uncomfortable with showing off any of my body, and the fatphobia radiating off of everyone around me didn't help with it either.   When I hit freshman year of highschool tho, that was when my feminist ass took off. I wore short shorts and shirts that hung low enough to show off all seven boobs. (That's a joke btw) I embraced my curves. I got dresscoded every week!! I thought I had finally pushed all the taunting and hatred of my childhood behind me. Of course, that itself was just a phase too. I was still silently convinced I looked more 'man-ish' no matter how hard I tried to push the thought down. I wanted to try and experiment with gender expression but my mother was apprehensive at the time. She didn't want me being targeted and ridiculed at school. (Jokes on her tho because I was already targeted lmao 😛).  Even now I struggle to identify myself. I've been content just calling myself non-binary and/or afab. It's kind of difficult for me to even say that I was born this way because I don't really know. Far be it from me to tell anyone their own experience, but I can't help but have part of me think that I was, for lack of a better term, forced to identify this way. Force is obviously the wrong word; nobody *made* me choose to id as nb. But I do feel as if I wasn't allowed to be anything for so long that my relationship with 'womanhood' is strained if anything at all.  Apologies if this seems scrambled, but it is one in the morning, and I had no idea that I would be writing a novel in the YouTube comments about my childhood traumas."
"The set. The lighting. The makeup. The costumes. GLORIOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
"As an AFAB person with an Adam's Apple, being exposed to TERF rhetoric and the way they talk about trans women as little more than a set of typically-masculine secondary sexual characteristics can also irrevocably damage cis women's relationships with their bodies. I grew up as a woman, was socialized as a woman, and otherwise presented 100% feminine but I'd still get 'clocked' as a man by strangers on the internet. Even now as an Agender person who feels comfortable embracing things that used to make me feel shame, I still hate my neck. I can't imagine how it must feel to be a woman with prominent facial hair or less than delicate features to read the bile they spew. TERFs are poison to all women."
"its nice to see a person confront these types of people in a way they can relate to, but then still recognize that they are hateful gatekeepers that will never accept trans people as long as they keep giving into their primal disgust. also, your outfits costumes are always amazing, please never stop."
"Responses: http://archive.is/ZZawe"
"Some of what terfs say confuses me. For instance, growing up with a fairly progressive mother and three sisters, I've never been embarrassed by my period. I haven't experienced cat calling. I live in a fairly progressive social context, and a lot of the sexist shit women go through, I just haven't had to deal with. Does that make me not a woman? Just because your childhood wasn't the experience most people of in x demographic doesn't mean you don't belong to that demographic."

"Happy Trans Day of Visibility Natalie!"
"another amazing video, natalie! <3   i never saw myself as a TERF but i kno that i definitely feel into a lot of transphobic rhetoric when i was younger-- even just a few years ago. i was definitely that feminist that posted a lot of support for women supporting each other but used slogans like 'uteruses before dude-eruses' and the like. i have always tried to be welcoming to transwomen in feminist spaces, but often forgot about them when impassioned-- and transmen?! i felt they had absolutely no place in feminist spaces as they had, in essence 'given up their woman card'.  it was,,,, not a good look for me. it was a conscious effort for me to start looking into transwomen's lives through documentaries all over the internet. it took me dating a transwoman, watching a good friend move from a woman, to gender-neutral to eventually coming out as a transman. my best fucking friend in the world is a transguy and he still, humbly, calls me out on my bullshit.  should it take that? do i need a trans community babysitter? no, but i appreciate it and i try to support all of my trans brothers and sisters, individually and en mass. i love you all and i will always defend your right to be in the LGBT+ community!"
"From one trans Natalie to another, thank you for making these fun videos that actually provide reasonable arguements against the constant barrage of bias and 7th grade biology quoters trans women have to go through just to exist"
"Wow, the way you ridicule the project of abolishing gender was pretty awful and I don't believe that you don't understand the argument behind it. Those who want to abolish gender just want to get rid of gender based societal expectations. Which in no way contradicts the idea of trangendered people. It just means that those who don't wish to be forced to perform as either of two genders don't have to battle any stigma. The project of abolishing gender is in no way in opposition to transexuality however you have shown that you have some personal shit against people who don't want to be forced to be either man or woman and it really came across ugly(ly). Non-binary people are also vulnerable."

"Natalie it makes me so sad (angry) to hear and see how people treat trans women/men the way so many do.  You are so powerful and i just want you to know I have recommended your videos to so many people and everyone is bldown away by your openness, honesty and intellectual vigour....oh yah and your beauty too💞. Another grounbreaking video."

If biological men with male socialization starts invading female spaces then where precisely do you think actual women with problems exclusively to actual women should go to?"

I bring all these points to make clear that the majority of Brazilians are not pieces of !@#$."

"TERFs need to stop punching down and realize who their true oppressors are. In the exact same way, lesbians and gays need to stop punching down at trans folk and trans folk need to stop punching down at genderfluid and gender non-conforming folk.  The real oppressors of ALL of us are the world's malicious elite oligarchy that uses capitalism as a tool to oppress the worlds masses, keep us at each others' throats, and keep us all from attaining the heights of achievement that humanity is capable of, in order to simply satisfy their uncontrollable greed and their psychotic desire to be 'better' than everyone else.  We can choose to allow them to retain their ill-gotten and undeserved authority over us OR we can topple them and their devious socio-political-economic system and move forward to a more just, equal, peaceful, and pleasant future for ALL of us."

"Thank you so much for helping me evolve as a person! You aren't throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall and it hurt to hear you say it. You are beautiful and undeniably feminine and HOLY SHIT your style! I have been a woman my whole life and have not achieved that kind of precision and attention to detail ... one of the captivating woman-arts! My husband and I are grateful for your perspective and have a couple questions. (1) Do you consider sex stable and gender fluid? (2) Do you really hate all gamers? My husband was sad. (3) You do this every video, but would you consider sharing more about the unique contributions that trans women make to sisterhood? You must understand a lot about worlds that are foreign to me, and to a lot of us!"
"Contrapoints: 'Excuse my beauty, TERF.' Me: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BITCH WORRRRKKKK!!!"

"I’m so glad you brought up socialisation, but I’m very tired rn, so I will just post this rant I texted to a friend about half a year ago  “It's so uncomfortable when cis women start talking to you thinking you're one of them My mother constantly talks shit about 'what do you expect, he's a dude' 'guys are so inattentive/insensitive/stupid about (thing)' Like, a) why are you bashing men in front of me, a man And b) gender is so much more complicated than you seem to think so write that down And the frustrating thing is, I've heard the exact same experience from trans women whose fathers bashed 'chicks' around them That's why I get so mad when transphobes say that 'trans men/women are socialised as women/men' NO NO WE ARE NOT We are socialised as trans men/women And know painfully well that we are hated by women for being men and hated by men for being women And it's scary and frustrating and so so uncomfortable”"
"I don't get the hands as a big signal for clocking trans women. Out of my mom, sister, and I. I have the smallest hands... Anyways they spend so much time attacking the trans community while I spend maybe like 4 minutes in a year thinking about them. Makes me feel like a selfish bitch but what ever. It's also funny that they mock trans women trying to catch up yet bitch about us not growing up female. Believe me when I say I wanted to have an emo girl phase in high school or a scene girl phase soo bad. I would trade periods for awkward boners at super inappropriate times if that's all it took to be a women."
"Contrapoints you are fabulous. Thanks for another great video.👍👍Cis women Trans women collaborate and unite!!"
"i would've just cried trying to talk through the stuff near the end. Talking that honestly about how you saw yourself at the moment takes a lot of f* ....something, i guess. I feel like I've been waiting for this video for a looong time. Honestly i've often asked myself these questions. I mean i never felt they where that important to me, because i just...never really felt like they needed an answer for me to just let people live their goddamn lives, but i would still ask myself some of this stuff from time to time, thanks for always putting in the time for building empathy from the ground up :)"
"1:18 do us gender traitors count?"
"I loved the video, but I think there's one point you could've added to concern 6: there are many trans women I've spoken to (I'm not personally one of them, I love that I can't get pregnant) who actively feel dysphoria about not having a womb, getting periods, being able to get pregnant, so it's not even as simple as 'you don't experience these particular struggles': in reality, not experiencing them can be for many trans women incredibly invalidating. Seriously though, great video"

Couldn't be happier having someone like you representing people like me! Especially grateful for the way you challenge dominant trans narratives in favour of more nuanced and diverse understandings of what it is to be trans."

"No mention of sports?"
"Hi hi! Always love your videos. Sounds a bit like rationally trying to justify emotions; I am disgusted and therefor it must be bad. Like, the emotion causes them to say, If I feel sad, something must have caused my sadness, therefore this must be something sad. Never the, I interpreted this as sad, but that doesn’t mean it exists as sad.  It seems the same with disgust from TERFs? If I feel disgusted, it must be true of the thing itself, not of my emotion.  So then the entire conversation will always be about THEIR emotions on a subject. So the conversation will never be about content, just emotional reaction."

"By sheer coincidence, I've spent the last couple days going through TERF posts on twitter/tumblr in order to block as many as I can find and, in the process, being exposed to so much of their hateful garbage (enough that I made a couple posts specifically about how to spot TERF dogwhistles). It's been a heavy experience that has taken a toll on my emotional wellbeing the last few days, but watching you break down the exact bigoted bullshit I've been suffocating under is comforting. I'm reassured by the knowledge that there are people taking the time to actually understand these ideas and where they come from in order to unravel them. It's important (difficult) work. Thank you for doing it."
"can I get a HHEELLLLLL YEAHHHHHHH!!!!"
"Wow, this spoke to me so deeply. I'm a non-binary person with a uterus and struggle so much with feeling like i'm causing harm by asking for more inclusivity and shit. Like the internalized transphobic things I am still working through are tough. When you were talking at the end so honestly and with such vulnerability about how internalized transphobia impacted you as well, like damn. That's so real.   So on the one hand, fuck TERFs and their poor attempts to mask their transphobia, but on the other, we do need nuanced discussions because this shit is very complicated with such varied experiences too.  Thank you!"

"there's a turf at my college;  i was eating with a friend of mine (happens to be trans male to female, currently on T but not quite at the 'passing' faze yet') and a TERF just decided to ruin our lunch. She claimed tht my friend disgusting for 'dressing up' and 'acting' like a girl. I described mt friend is trans, and she wears light makeup and a feminin cardigan just to help herself feel better until she fully passes. her words, she isnt comfortable in full female get up yet.  she hated this and was calling her any transphobic and homophobic slur you could think of. Because my trans freind is attracted to males... but in this TERF's mind 'he's a boy and being attracted to men is wrong'"

English is not my mother tongue, be gentle."

"I've enjoyed watching you mature in your content throughout your vids up until your Magnus Opus: The Darkness, but with this latest video you lost that maturity and acuity with these mistakes:  From 14:20 to 15:05 comes off as petty bragging about being passable, 30:15 to 30:50 tries to generalize transphobia to some 'lizard brain' disgust toward non-cispassing features, which is nonsense as this isn't the root of the transmisogyny you were discussing (people harbor transphobia even against cis-passing trans people) and isn't even something that's regarded similarly when people think about trans women versus trans men. (Not to mention it's going to alienate and make any non-cis passing viewers feel like trash.)    Also, it couldn't of hurt to overqualify that you having seen yourself as a man who became a woman 8:20 to 8:32 is just your own particular experience, as of course, some transgender individuals have from as long as they can remember considered themselves as the gender they identify with, and generally, the phrasing 'so you're a man that became a woman?' is something cis people should realize it's not okay to approach trans women with."
"Thanos glove TERFs."
"I am very glad that you adressed jewish question. It is a serious issue, one that should not be ignored!  Awesome vid as always, but I really miss Fritz😢"
"I admit I still don't fully understand, though I want to..... I understand fully why TERFs arguments are wrong and that there is no one experience of womanhood, all our experiences living as women are equally female. But what do all us women have in common that makes us specifically identify as women? Regardless of presentation, what allows a trans woman to know she is a woman, since there is technically no set way to exist as a woman? is it even possible to answer that question? It's very confusing, I am a cis woman and I support trans women, but I'll admit I wish I could understand the experience of it more. I think it would help me understand myself better too, as I wonder if I am non-binary but I am not sure how to tell, or how to know I am a woman for sure. Anyway, those were my thoughts, love you Natalie and thank you for the excellent videos!"

"TERFs are disgusting. I am a Cis woman who embraces my trans sisters.  I admire anyone who peers within themselves, at any age, to know themselves. I say I'm cis, but I am actually a bit fluid but not fully. I'm not 'butch' but I have been accused of not being 'feminine enough' a lot. I hate the TERF equation of a woman being defined by her internal plumbing because I have had to have it all removed because it was defective. I am not a menstruator. Defining women by their internal bits lays undue stress on those who are fully female but with malfunctioning bits or partial bits from birth. They, the TERFs are also disgusting because they erase the diversity of what it is to be a woman. Every single one of the disgusting traits noted in the opening quote could be attributed to a cis woman, too. Do all women need to pass a gender test to be declared a woman? Anyone not meeting their narrow-minded perception of woman is deemed not?"

"From an interview with Judith Butler:  'I agree completely that nothing is more important for transgender people than to have access to excellent health care in trans-affirmative environments, to have the legal and institutional freedom to pursue their own lives as they wish, and to have their freedom and desire affirmed by the rest of the world. This will happen only when transphobia is overcome at the level of individual attitudes and prejudices and in larger institutions of education, law, health care, and kinship.'   Furthermore:   'My sense is that we may not need the language of innateness or genetics to understand that we are all ethically bound to recognize another person’s declared or enacted sense of sex and/or gender. We do not have to agree upon the “origins” of that sense of self to agree that it is ethically obligatory to support and recognize sexed and gendered modes of being that are crucial to a person’s well-being.'  Article also touches on Gloria Steinem's current opinion (useful to our purposes here):  'So now I want to be unequivocal in my words: I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned. Their health care decisions should be theirs and theirs alone to make. And what I wrote decades ago does not reflect what we know today as we move away from only the binary boxes of “masculine” or “feminine” and begin to live along the full human continuum of identity and expression.'  https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/2009-judith-butler-on-gender-and-the-trans-experience-one-should-be-free-to-determine-the-course-of-one-s-gendered-life  Then, I'd like to add Andrea Dworkin's statements in 1974, from 'Woman Hating:'  'There is no doubt that in the culture of male-female"
"discreteness, transsexuality is a disaster for the individual transsexual. Every transsexual, white, black, man, woman, rich, poor, is in a state of primary emergency as a transsexual. There are 3 crucial points here. One, every transsexual has the right to survival on his/her own terms. That means that every transsexual is entitled to a sex-change operation, and it should be provided by the community as one of its functions. This is an emergency measure for an emergency condition. Two, by changing our premises about men and women, role-playing, and polarity, the social situation of transsexuals will be transformed, and transsexuals will be integrated into community, no longer persecuted and despised. Three, community built on androgynous identity will mean the end of transsexuality as we know it. Either the transsexual will be able to expand his/her sexuality into a fluid androgyny, or, as roles disappear, the phenomenon of transsexuality will disappear and that energy will be transformed into new modes of sexual identity and behavior.'"

"I don't think I will ever forgive you for how horrendously you misinterpreted Jordan Peterson; But videos like this remind me why I love you anyway.  As a Transwoman, I can not yet support Feminism for the very reason that Feminism and Inclusivity demands my silence as an individual. I apparently should be for all fights and for all movements just because I identify as a transwoman, no thanks. Some of these allies are really enemies waiting to happen, they just need us on their side right now.  Well scary shadow feminists in wait for the world to turn over and show its belly, unfortunately for you, i'm not at all convinced that there are no monsters under my bed."

"Soooo can I be a scintillating dark sorceress if I let my inner TERF possess me? Because I kinda might finally surrender for the cleavage alone.   If actual TERFs are any clue though I guess I'd just end up as a sneering Talk To Your Manager upper middle-class straight white woman with a Guardian column?"
"Thank you so much for making this video. I consider myself 'politically agender' because I had my dreams of a genderless society. I felt if there's no gender, then there's no need to be transgender. I also had all the questions presented in this video and no place to ask them. Being genuinely curious, asking any of the questions in the video got me pegged as a TERF. So glad you did, and you did it well and seriously. The section about socialization and that it never ends never entered my mind before.  I don't know if you feel comfortable doing so, but if you could team up with a black trans woman and do a video on trans-racialism I'd appreciate it. As a black woman, it's one thing I still struggle with. I feel like if we accept one, we have to accept the other. But the notion seems to make people really angry and I just keep being told it's different. I'm not trans in any respect, so I don't really see why."
"Your costume game and production values are absurdly amazing..."
"I think that this might be a little metaphysical for you😅, but the first videos from your channel I watched were the most recent ones and thus, for me, you've always been Natalie. Now, when I watch one of your old videos (I know that you'd prefer if we don't😉), I still see you as Natalie. I know that it could be argued that my perspective is already 'biased', but that's how I see you. So, I guess this is my poor attempt to compliment you ❤️"
"This dude is right. Men are not beautiful."
"As a trans dude I like menstruater because it has the word men in it and thus confirms my gender identity. we MENstrate, boys. (but no it's too much of a weird term pls find something better, like 'jaws victims' or something)"
"I'm a man, and I've used some of the same arguments you posed as TERF arguments. Namely 'Why not just allow yourselves to be feminine men?' This was when I had my first real discussion with a trans person. And to a point, I still hold the idea. Ideally, we can work together to make stereotypes enforced upon us go away. I do feel stifled, and often mocked for my love of musicals, pastels, and baking.  You did a great job of pointing out the absurdity of the position, and why wanting to express femininity is not in any way a 'pretense' for transitioning. I believe I had it all backwards, and I appreciate your videos as always."
"Ok you are not going to read this, but I miss tabby. Don´t you want to smash any more? did she got lost when she lost on that video.  I know this transphobia  is an important an neglected issue but is the third in a row, and I see spree facist killers, Colombia peace treaty just got brocked after 60 years of war, we had more than 300 human right activist murdured, it is at least 1 by the week sense 2016, and abrhams is right here and between Bolsonaro and Uribe is like the perfect storm. Just tell me you are never going to class transition."
"Dude your decor is amazing!"
"The end of this video was particularly poignant - I could feel the anguish.  I think that there is hope though - transphobia within individuals can be overcome.  Was I transphobic 20 years ago?  Probably a bit yeah.  But people can get better, can get educated by others and by self reflection.  Brilliant video, well done, and don't lose hope - the intolerant of today can be the allies of tomorrow - well, of next decade.  It takes time :/"

"Critique is forbidden..."
"i think the most fucked up thing about terfy nonsense is that their toxic gatekeeping mindset is about 100% of the reason why i'm no longer comfortable identifying as femme or a lesbian. like i will never forget the visceral horror i felt seeing lesbian ''''positivity''''''' posts on twitter DURING PRIDE MONTH and clicking through the source to see a person proudly identifying as gender critical and intermingling their 'positive' posts with horrible transphobic bullshit. like if that's what womanhood is about i want no part of it, thank you very much."
"I see you, graduating to genderless-ness in your graduation gown. Is that a graduation gown? _I_ think that's a graduation gown.   How fun. Congratulations."
"👏👏👏👏👏"
"These TERFs seem to want to abandon the concept of gender while also trying to claim this and that as feminine or masculine. Very 'contra'dictory. Also, why destroy the rigid gender binary when you can add to it, thus making it nonbinary? You get the same result without the need for radical change or exclusionism."

"When I was a christian I was against people who are trans because it was against god who created us all perfectly in his image.

"You did a good job as usual helping people see your PoV and understand the harassment trans women suffer at the hands of TERFs, but I think your dismissal of the goal of overcoming the notion of gender was too flippant.  I reject the idea that it's just an excuse for transphobia, as that case wasn't really well made, and especially since I personally genuinely believe it might be an important strategy to consider when it comes to establishing an egalitarian future as relates to gender.  I agree completely when you say that _if_ someone merely uses this as a means to invalidate trans people, they're not honest actors; but I don't do that, and so while that may mean it makes my view less relevant to what you want to discuss in this video, it also means you might be missing an opportunity to discuss my view - which just might turn out to be relevant.  At the very least, you could have convinced me to shift away from it if you think it feeds into TERF propaganda."

I've heard a lot about how I was denied am essentially female experience, as though I didn't carry those babies, didn't feel them move and kick, didn't fear every bite I took, etc. It's obnoxious. & You don't even want to KNOW how they treat my friend who had to have her uterus removed. Ugh!"
"this video opens up alot of insight on the lonliness of trans women and men too, its very sad to get a picture of, where its hard to find someone who doesn't hide their feelings and lie about them, I can't imagine how that makes you feel, sending love to all the trans ppl out there!! <3 I haven't been able to court one yet but im still tryin! wish me luck :D"

I watched this video immediately after watching a Sargon of Akkad video, and I can't decide if I am being misogynistic or transphobic for constantly thinking that Natalie is super hot, while watching these videos.  I am beginning to doubt my own sexuality, I figured I was gay because I like big arms, toned abs and a chiseled jaw line, but I keep falling for brilliant women, some of whom now have the advantage of not being fictional."

"'Take a fucking sip babes' I SCREAMED"
"Reading the comments I'm reminded to criticize your handling of transmedicalists. Yes, some truscum fit those criteria but the assertion that one is only trans if they experience CrIpPlInG aGoNiZiNg DySpHoRiA isn't true. All trans people experience dysphoria, hell even cispeople experience dysphoria over the appearance and functioning of their cis bodies (ever seen a woman have her boobs done? Ever seen a commercial for penile enhancement?) Seeing dysphoria as requisite to being trans isn't about self hatred, othering, transphobia, or any of that, it's about having a legitimate basis for transitioning. I don't know how many cis people have said 'I'd be fine if I woke up tomorrow in the body of a member of the opposite sex just like I'm perfectly fine with the body I have now' it's just a sign of not actually giving any consideration to what that would actually entail. They don't know that and they're probably completely wrong. Transitioning without dysphoria amounts to what? Transitioning for shits and giggles? It's okay to experience dysphoria, it doesn't make you crazy and it doesn't have to be a debilitating or terminal condition. It's more transphobic to hate people because they have gender dysphoria than it is say you need dysphoria to be trans. Also dysphoria comes in more than one flavor so you can have social dysphoria where you're uncomfortable being treated like a member of the sex assigned at birth or body dysphoria where you're uncomfortable being in a body that doesn't match how you envision yourself, just examples I'm sure there are many other ways to experience dysphoria that are all validly dysphoric. I understand that not everyone understands what dysphoria actually is and they think it means 'give me hormones and surgery or I rope' and don't want to associate with that depiction or else they are dissociated from their dysphoria and don't want to dissect or face it and just want to transition without analyzing why (why wouldn't one want to analyze and criticize everything about themself? Can't relate!) but they can still be identified as being dysphoric without having to say they are in those terms and are still trans.   Not going to discuss some of the more toxic attitudes that truscum can sometimes display because that's just internalized transphobia and likely a phase they can mature out of for most of them. Transmedicalists are also concerned with non trans people who detransition after making an oopsy and sociopaths who identify as trans and do terrible things that make trans people look bad, yeah that can get out of hand and they can start picking a girl apart for having some stray eyebrow hairs or a guy apart for showing some cleavage, but it's because they're concerned with the image society has of them because of everyone who identifies as trans, and if trans people don't have the right to be concerned about how trans people are received by society then who does? Should we just not be concerned with how trans people are received by society? Is there no correlation between how trans people are received and how they are treated? Where is my girl Natalie declaring 'Optics'? Oh well. The imaginary Natalie who lives in my mind agrees with me on everything, so she'll just have to do."
"My god Natalie, your outfits really are spectacular.  Also I think Deleuze and Guattari has a pretty great insight on some of this. In their view nobody really IS male or Female, rather, were in a perpetual process of Becoming-male or Becoming-female. Theres no destination, just a process."

"Cis female here. That bit about not understanding female struggle is horse shit. Our experiences are all mostly unique. Some suffer more than others. Some suffer in completely different ways. In fact, with social media as prevalent today as it is, trans people suffer a lot more than a lot of women I know bc they've never had to deal with being bullied just for wanting to behave in the way that makes you feel normal. This isn't the freaking misery Olympics. 'You must suffer this much to ride this ride' - bitch please."
"I really appreciate being allowed some insight through your videos into a way of living I don't usually get to encounter."
"18:20  Ahhaha  you 2 are cute together"
"I love your videos... But dont destroy our videogames... They help with the Darkness!!!"
"I have so much I want to say, but a comment simply isn't enough. I usually find your videos very thorough but I felt like you scratched the surface here. I have seen TERF almost entirely used towards lesbians, very rarely towards straight women (even though most gender critical people are straight). I also think there's a huge incorrectness with who 'TERFS' actually are, as defined by this video. I don't really think most of them are feminists at all (faux ones maybe) but a lot of die-hard gender critical people are fairly conservative (as there is usually some homophobia splashed into their transphobia). I wish I had the 'clout' to be able to discuss this further, as someone who has been occasionally labeled as a TERF, despite the fact that I have always largely agreed with what you said in the video. The polarization of ideas and inability to have meaningful discussions is real."
"I'm nonbinary and I look up to you a lot. You're so smart and I love seeing other trans people succeed. I'm glad you're representing the trans community (at least a little) on YouTube. It makes me feel less alone."
"Ugh Natalie what can I say other than congrats? Week after week you bring critical thinking to subjects where people are doing the least amount of thinking possible. The best!"
"23:10 i like my shitty chili leave me alone :'("
"First I would like to say that your videos are done very well. They are entertaining.  I agree with most of what you said. My biggest disappointment is Male privilege. It does not exist.  If you are ever willing to have an interview with me on my channel, I would love to have you."
"Street harassers embarrassed about not having shown due respect to a Y chromosome in a  trans woman were priceless xd It shows a bit that the process of making this video (from going through hundreds of emails that I'm sure were not always pleasant to read) must have been painful at times. I'm truly sorry if the questions I'd sent added to that in any way. I hope they didn't. Solidarity all the way."
"You are amazing. Thank you."
"I've seen TERFs attack butch trans women, so I don't really believe them when they say that they're 'concerned' with hyperfeminine trans women reinforcing gender stereotypes. Trans women should be allowed and encouraged to adopt a presentation that speaks to their taste and style as cis women do, and so-called feminists shouldn't be the ones discouraging them from doing so (and yes, I know cis women experience shit over the way they dress. I've experienced that my whole life. Those experiences have encouraged me to support women, cis or trans, no matter how they choose to dress, and I would hope that other feminists would do the same.)"

"I wish you could do it in Spanish... Your awesome!"

"I love it when society freaks out about the lgbtq community when they have all existed throughout all of human history they were just completely ignored or stamped out by society. The point I'm trying to make is this community is not going to harm the majority of society cause that is what we are THE MAJORITY! I say we give them the rights and respect they deserve as human beings and if for some reason you don't like this group of people and their lifestyle then don't be around them and just leave them alone. Treat others the way you want to be treated. ;) Btw just started watching your channel with this video and I have to say I'm impressed by your ability to unpack a complicated topic with both perspectives to illustrate to the audience that this is a conversation about a complicated topic not a rant or a I'm right video and here is the reason why."
"I think any kind of 'weirdness' illicits a disgust response in humans, because our brains are programmed to view things and people that deviate from the norm as potentially threatening.  But the more attention and awareness non-harmful 'deviations' receive, the less 'weird' they become, and the less people feel that primal disgust.  Only a couple decades ago, the average person in our culture felt this way about homosexuality.  But homosexuality simply doesn't bother most people anymore.  No more disgust response.  This will happen with transexuality as well.   Contra - that judgment you have felt for yourself and for other trans women is not a reflection of anything *inherently* wrong with transness.  It's just a natural human reaction to something one perceives as outside the realm of our comfortable social norms.  Once we've normalized transexuality, people won't feel that way anymore, and hopefully, neither will you."
"Thank you Goddess of wisdom ❤👸"
"I adore the nuance, but most all terfs and transphobes I encounter who have made similar sentiments as you said didn't not come to make them by using logic. They used their lizardy 'brains' to feel their way into saying something so ignorant and blase.  Discourse isn't long lived and usually ends with some sort of screeching about chromosomes or how they just don't like dicks, man. *sigh* These tips might be useful for people on the fence as you said. People who are still in terftown on the other hand..... got a longggggg ways to go before these conversations get to a productive and meaningful place-- Anecdotally of course."

"This is why I love your videos. You take the argument we hear ALL the time and that get posted 20 times a day on /r/ gendercritical(an uncomfortably large hate sub by the way, fuck /u/spez.) and respond to it in a rational way that anybody with some amount of empathy can actually sympathize. Absolutely perfect, and your inner feminist look is probably the best yet!"

"Yes, I do stan a biological female icon"
"Ghh could have done without the sh joke!! Did u warn in the beginning?"
"As a genuinely sympathetic-to-thee-cause guy who grew up with a lot of sisters and consequently a lot of ffffffffffuuuucked up stories of predatory behaviour towards my nearest and dearest at all sorts of ages (hard emphasis on 'all'), it was great to hear a frank and respectful tackling of the socialisation in child/girlhood issue. It was probably my last stumbling block to full blooded trans 'acceptance', rationally it shouldn't have been but emotionally it bothered me and in my experience most people avoid addressing it head on precisely because its on of the more difficult/scary talking points. Thanks."
"thanks for this. as a comfortable cis girl who presents how she pleases, ive had a lot of these questions but was afraid to ask them for fear of being offensive or getting attacked. i appreciate your videos and your view on the world. thanks again."

"This was simply amazing"
"I can't believe you really just dragged Skyline Chili like that. I'm genuinely offended."
"Oh it was you that made the second Wolfenstein game"
"That strength that trans women have to develop to thrive  is so similar to the strength cis women have to develop. That could be because we are all humans struggling side by side. Too bad we can't just honor that and help each other."
"I love the way you are so intellectually frank about trans/queer politics and just say what you believe without worry if it's 'the right thing.' And you are a brilliant comedian."
"IMO, the need to exclude transwomen from woman status by terfs is more about making their gender exclusive and is essentialist snobbery rather than just inherent disgust."

"'Get out!' Aww shucks. 'Unless-' Yay!"
"Thank you for teaching me stuff!"
"I'm really feeling the Theryn / Natalie sisterhood."
"You've brought up the issue of guys not admitting to being with trans women several times. Have you considered a video with a series of guys talking about dating trans women or being attracted to trans women? Having guys talk publicly about it might help normalize it. Or if you got enough volunteers, you could make brief recordings of each where they just say 'I'm [insert name] and I'm attracted to trans women., and put two at the end of each video as an ongoing reminder that guys do date trans women."
"Ngl, I do feel annoyed when I hear some people /have/ to say trans in front. They say 'women and transwomen' when I just want to say 'so basically women???' At the end of the day, trans or not is to call them a woman or a man. I didn't think turfs were a real thing and thought 'no one is this stupid think this' but I was totally wrong. Some people who want to play the game on who has it worse is just awful... I am really happy to watch your videos again, Contra."
"Is it too hopeful to hope that one day trans technology will advance enough for reproduction to be possible after transition?"
"Yeah I sympathize with women and feel more in line with them ..I also feel almost bad if I do not refer to myself as one as if sexism has rubbed off on me. I call myself cis with some dysphoria over secondary sex characteristics for now ...and present femme ..so yeah I go by female but I am sloooowwwllyyy feeling okay with nonbinary. Sorry just have to share somewhere. Know this is not all about me 👍."

"But seriously, you're amazing. I love you so much. Keep being amazing and doing the incredible and difficult work that you do."
"I particularly prefer calling TERFs Feminine-Appropriating Reactionary Transphobes - FARTs. If you ever can, please record yourself saying the last line but nstead of TERF saying FART, it'd be glorious.  Love your videos, love how you break stuff down to try and explain to the opposite sides how things work, and if I gotta echo everyone who considers you appearance more important now - you're gorgeous and have been since day 0. Thank you!"
"TAKE A FUCKING SIP BABES I'm DEAD Natalie oh my god"
"Not to detract from your argument, but you have the most beautiful smile ^_^"
"No I haven't heard of terfs, I'm getting to it I'm getting to it, I only have so much time to binge your vids since I just discovered you amazing queen."
"Something about socialization that I wish people would talk about more is like. You are socialized as ur assigned gender, sure, but what that means is entirely context dependent! For some people that barely impacts them in terms of how they view themselves at all! For some it impacts them until death! But you also are socialized to understand what the “””””opposite””””” gender “should” be. There are plenty of trans ppl who never really internalized their assigned gender socialization but always picked up on how the other half lives, so to speak. ALSO and i appreciate u mentioning this!! Womanhood and “female socialization” are not universal ideas, and what one might call a problematic trans woman’s “male privilege” is far more likely to be the white or affluent privilege they have maintained thru their life. These systems are so complicated and terfs reducing everything to “wa my Wombynhood makes me INCORRUPTABLE and i hate trans people” is so sad"

"13:09 something I never understood is that this should be good! Identities aren't only compromised of the struggles facing them and while it is important to acknowledge the problems facing many of the people who identify as so, it should be good to have someone not go through those issues."
"You disgusting tranny thing"
"Stop talking to your cameraman"
"You mentioned something in passing and I wants to comment on that, I do appreciate the video's content, excellent work as usual.   I will admit to commenting on your appearance more since you transitioned. I try to limit my comments to, 'You look nice'. I do this because I do not want to be the sort of creep I see who fixates on the appearance of women on youtube, but at the same time wishing to show support to you in you efforts to transition. If at any point I have come across as rude, or if this behavior is rude, then I apologize. I lack the faculties to understand how to best be supportive without being pushy or creepy. I do not consider myself socialized to any great degree on this subject matter."
"TERF bitch please - if cismen knew what women were cosmetically compensating for they'd never see us as objects of sexual desire again."
"I really love this. I consider myself to be a trans ally and I've learned a lot about trans issues from your content. I realise that I'm really ignorant about a lot of things and trying to learn more and be more respectful to people. If you don't mind my asking, I hope this is not a rude question and that it doesn't come off as transphobic. It's just something I've been curious about. I understand the social transition aspect of dressing a certain way but I've also heard both binary and non-binary trans individuals referring to how they dress making them feel more like their identity and that's something I've never really understood. If someone doesn't mind explaining it I would really appreciate learning more about what trans people experience."
"I never understood the people that say trans women haven’t experienced what it’s like to be a “real” women. If you present yourself as a women then you are going to experience the same sexist discrimination that a biologically born women would face. I can’t take any of their arguments seriously since they don’t ever address that counter argument.  Can someone maybe explain to me why that is??? No one who is a “terf” ever talks about how a trans women isn’t magically excluded from the gender pay gap, disrespectful comments, cat calling, just overall sexist behavior that ALL women face every day. Doesn’t matter what your assigned gender at birth was."

"This is the crippling reality of intersectionality.   Every. Single. Person’s. Life. Experience. Is. Unique.

"You are my fave trans icon <3"
"Oh mama Natalie a solid 4 out of 5 fishy realness on this one.    For real. Thank you for speaking with honest about the pressure of having some origin story about what it was like growing up trans. Sometimes I'd try and talk about trying to wear dresses. It happened once, and with impossibly conservative parents that thought corporal punishment would equal manliness. Fast forward through football in high school, a marriage lasting less then a year and six years of military service. I never 'found' my masculinity. My disphoria never went away, and just got worse. Till it was either take the proverbial cyanide capsule or give this trans thing a try. So most of my years growing up was living in fear of being discovered and trying to impress these false displays of  what I thought was manliness, which really just made me an asshole. No friends and no relationships, and just fear, frustration and anxiety  Every-time I hear about or listen to these awful arguments from not just 'Gender Criticals,' but others who find it convenient to kick down at us. It's so refreshing to have a coherent perspective. My greatest fear is that I'd be forced to reverse or go back to hiding. It hurts just think about it. All the joy I have now, validation, firm sense of identity. That fear rises up each time I hear about anti-trans law, or discussions. It makes it difficult for me to be a part of the discussion.  For example. I've been in womens power lifting for roughly 2 1/2 years. I don't ever compete even though I'm not even close to other women in my weight class with more experience can lift. I'm terrified of being outed if I, goddess-forbid do well. Suddenly I become a target for all sides. I'm not looking to be the next face to show up on talk-cast or news about 'trans-women' cheating to beat women out of their own sports. Rather than discuss or enter dialogue I disqualify myself from discussion and play neutral ground. Even when my cis-female coach came out loud/proud pro-trans power lifters when the USAPL banned us from competing.   It's a lot, and a ramble but your video helped me work through some long held sticking points in my mind. Love what your doing."
"hell yeah white matter microstructure"
"i am really interested in your thoughts on the transmedicalist debate! just a video idea love 💕"
"in short, suffering doesn’t automatically make you a hero?"
"You're hat is stupid."
"I can always count on Natalie to educate the fuck out of me and make me laugh"
"First of all, very well done video. Second, you are so beautiful, I am jealous."
"Thanks you so much for making this video! I had all this question truly and I was too scared to ask"
"Wait I’m a trans man, can I stay?"
"Unsubbing. Cincinnati Chili is delicious. But we are not people, spot on."
"I adore you! Your ability to inform and enlighten with your sharp wit and intellectual prowess makes me starry-eyed! I am a hetero female who enjoys ALL types of people and you are helping me to truly understand what trans people go through. Thank you!"
"Bitch! That ending! Natalie snapped!  I am living!"
"So many terf talking points are so blatantly anti-intersex as well!"
"MacKinnon might not be a terf but she is a swerf!"
"Natalie, I love how you're experimenting with new aesthetic in your videos and such. It really makes your videos pop.  Also, your ability to see why people stick to their dislikeable views then empathize with them is what I like about you the most."
"Amazing video as always!♥️"
"TERFs = destroyed. There is no coming back from this for them."
"the shania twain reference made me like instantly"
"'Trans women bleed, but only when we cut ourselves' lmao"
"I still think we should abolish gender, but that doesn't mean abolishing dresses or nails or ties. I love all those things and think people of all genders should be able to play with all of it! I also think people are more accepting or at least tolerant than online behavior would suggest. It's not uncommon to see straight cis men getting their nails done and it strikes me as pretty classist to assume nail techs and gas station attendants wouldn't accept your gender identity if they did clock you. And fuck sylvia plath. Being AFAB never stopped me from talking to everyone, sleeping where  I want and walking around at night.  People need to stop worrying about what other people think and start living their best lives."
"Your videos are always great contra"
"L i s t e n s w e a t y"
"The use of tr**** stings, but I thought it was a good video. Thanks for the content."
"Haha haha the genderless thing hahhahhahaha. Lol I died"
"Thank you for another brilliant video, Natalie. Concern 2 was probably one of the biggest sticking points for me before watching your other videos. In forming a personal feminist ideology from the feminist writing that is out in the world, I think it's easy to fall into this line of thinking. In the middle ground between Germaine Greer and queer/trans feminists, I think a lot of the language and ideology espoused by mainstream cis feminists still leads you down this path if they aren't careful in defining things in particularly inclusive terms. From personal experience, I would say that my own internalized misogyny made me the most hostile towards both transwomen and ciswomen who seemed to be playing to patriarchal norms and expectations. Societal conditioning still makes it easier to feel that sense of competition and resentment towards other women than the powers that be.    Concern 5 was another major issue. Thank you for taking it seriously and being so open about your own experiences.   Anyway, thank you for having the patience for those of us who are still learning and trying to do better. I never fell in with the disgust or hatefulness of the TERFs you quote but I don't think that excuses me from resisting a more inclusive way of thinking out of ignorance, laziness, and internalized misogyny. I was threatened by a theory of gender that felt like it might dismantle the core of my feminist ideology but honestly, it was mainly just easier to accept a more casual and simplistic version of feminism that didn't require as much work. It's uncomfortable to be forced to reckon with your privilege. Your knowledge of and support for the issues relevant to straight women inspires me to put in more effort to understand the issues relevant to queer women and transwomen. I will be doing my own research but if anyone wants to reply with some good theorists or essayists to add to my reading list, I would appreciate it. :)"

"I'm not Trans but as a teenager I often dreamed of binding my breasts and passing for a guy so I could go on adventures and freely travel without getting harassed. I love that quote by Plath I find it so relatable.   After I grew up I got the chance to be a solo traveler without having to disguise myself. I wish Plath lived a few decades later. She might have had a chance at having some adventures."
"Great video! Honestly this is one I definitely needed to see. As a straight cis male, I feel like I've always been weak on trans issues (which is somewhat ironic since other LGBT issues such as gay marriage are what got me into politics in the first place) and like I'd never truly be able to understand trans people's struggles in a meaningful way. I've never been openly bigoted against trans people and I've never identified as being 'gender critical' or formalized myself with the dogma of it, but I definitely had some of these sentiments buried deep down inside me and as an otherwise strong leftie I've at times just felt like the dance of gender (particularly when it comes to non-binary people) is a sort of hollow endeavor; the upholding of empty labels which mean little to me personally beyond the convenience of categorization. But what you said at 9:20 really hit the nail on its head and recontextualized it in a way that should've been obvious to me from the start. I've always viewed labels as tools to serve the necessary evil of utility, but it never occurred to me for some reason that most trans/non-binary people are no different, that perhaps the reason why they feel so passionately about their pronouns is not because of some attachment to the trapping itself but rather one to the sentiment contained within.   Fantastic work as always Natalie. Death to all gamers."

"a lot of people use your videos as their only source for learning about these topics and i would love if you didn’t slander the transmedicalist ideology when you’re only passingly familiar with what it is."
"Why does every far leftist discussion end up blaming men at any given point? lol. Or as you like to put it this mystical ''patriarchy''. It's like a battle for victim points. I suppose Smolle has been a massive point of evidence in this new phenomena of 'victimhood privilege' and 'desired 'victimhood'. The good thing is that at least here in the UK we now see feminists and trans activists tear each other up, finally realising that their ideologies are fundamentally incompatible. It's a great time to be a straight, white male."
"U still look really pretty in the white robe without makeup"
"I'm glad you finally made a video on this. I have always been confused by the gender criticals because they seemed to push valid points, like gender is a social construct, in addition to their crass bigotry, so I have had trouble finding coherent arguments made by them on the subject that aren't reactionary. Growing up I was a tomboy and was always punished for it and punished for not being feminine enough so I used to feel bothered when I saw a very feminine transwoman, because they made me feel like I have to live up to that standard or else become a transman, however I could never identify as a man, so therefore transpeople have a role in reinforcing gender stereotypes. But its not transpeople who are perpetuating this,  it's our society that doesn't allow for a lot of inbetween. I understand now that transwomen often present as very feminine because they are under even stronger pressure than I am  as a cishet woman to conform to gender stereotypes.  I have stayed away from gender criticals for the most part though because of their outright bigotry like you say."
"We love you, Natalie. And we’re totally your allies for life!  Or until Trump puts us all in a camp.  But 5 out of your last 6 videos have been about gender issues.  No fair.  The rest of us need you too! 😭  But then several people here have also commented about the Transgender Athletics debate and it *would* be super neat to hear your take on that.  I’m so conflicted!  I’m going to drink scotch out of a tea cup and think about it."
"I just gotta say- you lookin like a SNACC in this video girl! you've got this gay quaking in her birkenstocks lmao"
"You're doing good work."
"The only thing that I would argue against in this video is the take on transmeds. True there are radicals, just like there is in every belief, but for the most part the belief is that you need dysphoria to be trans. That’s it. Wether that be low, fluctuating, or high, all you need is dysphoria. It’s really as simple as that. Tbh my big issue is that the louder minority believes you can only have severe dysphoria and that simply isn’t true."
"I had a friend who once id’d as transmasc/nonbinary and detransitioned. She still felt dissatisfied w her body (as many of us do, cis or trans or whatever). And slowly i saw her move from being a dissatisfied detrans-ed woman who understandably felt uncomfortable w her previous community and her complicated feelings about her own dysphoria to a truly awful gender critical jerk sharing posts about how afab trans people’s bodies are “disgusting”, the “trans cult” is “forcing” people to ID as trans, and eventually just out and out transmisogyny (it always comes back to transmisogyny w radfems...). And like. I, A Trans (nb) was still on speaking terms w her as this was happening (we had met thru being trans! And she’d helped me and my partner move furniture, etcetc). She hid her slide into terf communities at first, only liking posts but not reblogging them. How unsafe can u make ur friends feel like...?!  I think the wider terf community loves to act like they are being Silenced by the tyrannical genderists and she fell right into that trap... its sad. Anyway Im going to finish watching the video now sorry for the Personal Youtube Comment lol"
"Is this the best video on youtube? it certainly might be"
"How did you change your voice? Your voice is really convincing.."
"If terfs attack my host they risk getting eaten by me -___- I'm a literal monster."
"2. Terfs insulting trans women on their feminine mannerisms by essentially calling them feminine men reinforces harmful stereotypes that hurt cis men and harms gender equality discussions as a whole. Take it far enough, and it can even be homophobic. 'Destroy gender!' 'Ok, let's let cis men wear skirts and paint their nails.' 'NO NOT LIKE THAT'."
"Who else thought 'damn Natalie has some really nice tiddies'"
"that’s not what transmedicalism is, that’s a very radical part of it. that’s like when people say “i don’t like feminists because they hate men.” not all feminists hate men, and in fact, very few do. not all transmedicalists think you have to “despise your body” to be valid. the core belief is that you need to be diagnosed with dysphoria by a gender specialist before you can be provided with treatment. the same goes for depression, anxiety, bpd, etc. and i don’t know why it’s so hard for people to wrap their heads around."
"3:00 that sounds exactly like when you talk to people who used to be members of racist organizations and they describe how they got bullied by a black kid one time and felt safe in white only places and had to learn how to judge people as individuals instead of being afraid of everybody with a tan."
"great video"
"Yay! I’ve been waiting for an upload from you for a while now!! I’ve really only been checking YouTube to see if you uploaded. What a good night.  Was just about to go to sleep, but gotta watch my Queen first. ❤️"
"We stan Kim Petras <3"
"'Nobody knows what it's like... to be a sad tran.. to be a trash can.. :/' That was so cute I'ma die"
"One thing I love about these videos is that I always hear Natalie bring up some interesting point or concept, and I need to pause the video to just think for a bit or try to see if I’ve encountered this stuff in my own life. It’s like the video is so much more than just what’s literally in it."
"'I could go on, but this 'America's Next Top Victim' contest does nothing but to provoke infighting between trans women and cis women at a time when we should be marching side by side to destroy video games forever. Hashtag 'YesAllGamers'.'   *looks up from Candy Crush Saga* Wait, what?"
"your aesthetic & fashion is starting to rub off on me   I call it 'flamboyant gothic', after the architectural style"
"15:00 CONTENT"
"1. Terfs who get upset at including everyone who menstrautes in a gender neutral way are unknowingly getting pissy at cis women with reproductive disorders. Not all cis women bleed, and not all cis women can get pregnant. There are also hormonal medications, like birth control, that limit or completely stop normal menstruation, and living your life long enough without your period is going to separate you from the discussion of menstruation and how it affects your life."
"Wow you look amazing girl!"
"I was shocked when I travelled to Latin America last year. An INSANE amount of Latina feminists are TERF, SWERF, and opposed to gender neutral pronouns (particularly the latinx movement). Hadn't even heard radical feminism in casual conversation until I went to Argentina. I know a LOT of Latina feminists who don't think that men can even identify as feminist allies. It's a whole other conversation there, and it's in the middle of one of the most misogynistic cultures in the world.    Speaking of, would love to hear a hot-take on sex work, but in an international context!"
"that tea pot scene killed me"
"Wonderful, as always!"
"Such a great video! I'd be curious if anyone had thoughts/reading recs on if mainstream media's reporting choices around trans people exacerbate the gender stereotype backlash. I don't have any examples, but I feel like when I was younger and watching something like 20/20 or reading interviews, that mentions of wearing high heels or liking pink and dresses as a child were common features of the stories for trans women. But maybe a lot of that was lazy reporting? Because sure, it gives you something quite concrete and simple to describe that anyone in your audience could picture...but I don't feel like it is a narrative I've seen as much when reading/watching un-editorialised work from trans women, but that could also just be a function of time... I've only heard people's stories directly in more recent years."
"Wow.......production values looking pretty great, Natalie. Better all the time."
"Are TERFs just the inverse of a typical incel?"
"Loved it. A S   A   T R A N S   W O M A N, i do wish you wouldn't use words like 'tranny' in your videos, but if i could afford to influence that choice, i'd have paid for like, 18 people'ss surgeries by now. Keep up the good work, and *if* you are ever thinking 'hey maybe i shouldnt add this in the next script,' i'll welcome the change."
"Damn, some deep cuts in this one."

"The most hilarious thing to me is how often people will 'clock' a trans woman, when what they've actually seen is like... a tall, cis woman with body hair, or a nonbinary person who took testosterone. Way to free us from rigid gender stereotypes guys. And I'm sure you're movement is also super welcoming to cis women who don't have periods or can't get pregnant."
"Bless you, Natalie.  Continuing to do the lord's work triggering TERFs and #YesAllGamers."
"Therynnnn 💟"
"Just the greatest of all time."
"actually, i see being trans, and being nonbinary, and embracing those things, as a much more surefire way to abolish gender, than um. just sticking to the whole penises and vaginas thing. if a minority of people say that the gender doesnt matter, but still stick to their genders, thats quite easy to ignore, you dont have to respect that at all, being trans however, completely disrupts the status quo. if we accept that people are trans, that people are nonbinary, we too accept that gender means nothing. i think if being trans was normalized gender would begin to matter less and less, and just like santa claus it would stop existing. this is the end goal of my, and a lot of other trans people i know’s activism with regards to gender. i wish more people felt this way"

"'It's almost like when they say abolish gender, they really mean abolish trans people'  The narcissism jumped out."

"The costumes and set design are on point, even more than usual"
"These videos continue to leave me in stitches! Each one is better than the last.    Thank you, Natalie! #YesAllGamers"
"And here I got the idea from somewhere that one of the basic tenets of feminism (or any ideology looking to break past restrictive and oppressive roles) was that no one could or should tell anyone what they can be or do.  Maybe I misunderstood....    Good video."
"yes we DO stan Kim Petras 🌈💫❤️"
"As a young trans man, I'm really grateful for your videos. They're informative and funny (not to mention your outfits and backdrops are astounding) and I've learned a lot from you. Thank you for being the trans icon and teacher I've been looking for for so long. Keep slayin' queen!"
"You know I love videogames but given how much of a cesspool driven by gatekeeping, elitism, thinly veiled bigotry and a disdain to everyone that isn't a 'gamer' the community around it has become and how the vast majority of games are money vacuums driven by greedy and corrupt 1% socialites who can wipe their asses with 100 bucks while routinely giving mass layoffs the green light and systematically turn games into a job where you lose money I sincerely don't care about what happens to it anymore, all the games I play are old games regardless and the only recent game I bought and played is God of War."
"Oh natalie. Why do you make me rethink my homosexuality with your everything? I absolutely loved everything!"
"I know who Anita Byrant is, I'm from Florida where she did her wicked work. She's an evil woman, a servant of the devil, because of what she did oh so maliciously to LGBT people (I'm not exaggerating, what she did was genuinely evil in nature). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Bryant"
"My God I’d been hoping you’d cover this HELL YEA"
"Fucking hell. Literally a minute into this video and I'm already disgusted. It boggles my mind to think that I ever paid any attention to Germaine Greer."
"I feel like dealing with trans issues should be separate from dealing with women's issues because both sets of problems are unique to each demographic although they do intersect on certain issues like sexism."
"I loved the point about 'male/female socialisation' because I feel this so hard. I see this 'concern'/argument crop up a lot and it's pretty infuriating that any tiny concession that is made is deemed as a victory in the terf side but the way you were raised and the socialisation that comes with it is not even close to the whole picture."
"I just wanted to say that you are such an inspiration to me, I love you and what you do so much 💕 Can’t wait to see you destroy some TERFs"
"Wowowow. U blow me away with every video!"
"the quality of this video is top notch"
"All TERFs found dead"
"Natalie is fucking queen!!! I think I’m a well informed person on these issues, but I always learn something when I watch her videos. More over, when talking about these types of topics (with both those genuinely seeking answers and discussion and those who only want to derail, troll, and mock you) Natalie’s videos have given me language to respond with. It’s hard to debate these things because sometimes you’re so angry or passionate, or perhaps simply not great at words, yet I find using these videos as a spring board for your side of the conversation to really help. It has helped me through the agony of trying desperately to defend an argument that you KNOW is right, more well informed, more ethical, but you struggle to put it together is a concise, persuasive way. Thank you for this education, Natalie!!!"
"Holy crap, you’re good Contra. Bravo."
"Holy shit this comment section is scary. Agender people are not synonymous with 'gender critical' TERFs. OMG. That's as awful as saying that asexual people are synonymous with homophobes. Just because I don't experience sexual attraction or feel like I have a gender doesn't mean I hate everyone who does! (Also that would make me cishet phobic too which admittedly is slightly more understandable than being trans or homophobic, but I digress) what it actually means (in my case) is that I'm an autistic transhumanist who has no environmental awareness including the physical awareness of being a human trapped inside a human body. I am only comfortable being identified as thoughts, often translated into words, displayed on screens made of tiny light bulbs. All pronouns are fine so long as I can parse them, he/she/him/her preferred because I get a kick out of being taken for hxmxn."
"I may not always agree but damn this video was cathartic. I always enjoy your videos"
"I cant stop repeating the Limp Bizkit song trans version. As a man, that makes me get into the topic and touched me deeply"
"Whomst... j-just whomst"
"The clean look is beautiful."
"Contrapoints INCINERATES Terfs with FACTS and LOGIC!"
"As a cis man who likes MtFs(meaning I am gynosexual) and who has a FtM brother, I salute this woman's efforts. Keep going my lady.  Also, I use to love watching those Maury episodes."
"When I saw you stirring the tea, it reminded me of Get Out, because I recently watched it for the first time. And then you said 'Get out' to the men watching this video. Was that intentional? If so, it's very clever. This is also an excellent video."
"OK, this is epic. Rise up gaymers."
"Natalie has the most contagious laughter, goddamn. There was no way I was making it through those outtakes with a deadpan face. And the teapot- pffffff- even with serious topics like this one I can't help but be in a better mood after listening to one of these videos.  Love videos like these; help me through a lot of rough days. :D"
"Ugh how can you be a woman if you're a woman!?"
"'Excuse my beauty.'   Rest in peace, Queen."
"I love your necklace :3"
"Keep coming back to watch the teapot bit at 15:03"
"Natalie!! your costuming and set design are wonderful, heckkkk"
"gonna have to disagree with you here. you ARE valid. dunno about the being real part though"
"*luxerrrnnrnn*"
"I mean she isn't 'clockable' until she opens her mouth"
"great video as usual"
"YES BEST DAY EVER"
"I'm sort of embarrassed to admit this, but I didn't realize TERFs were still a thing. I thought they were a mostly dying breed, and I'm not super happy to hear that they're still tormenting people. I already have to deal with White Supremacists claiming to act on 'my behalf,' I don't need TERFs claiming to represent me either."
"There's nothing more disturbing to me than feminist bigots who hate on trans women and advocate warmongers like Clinton because she has a vagina. I thought we were about equality, inclusion and were just plain smarter than this. Not too dissimilar from black people who are extremely right winged. Totally contradictory, definitely misguided and toxic. Opposite of what they think they are or want to be."
"To me, a cis gay man, your most feminine attribute is your smile. Keep living keep fighting! Xx"
"4 minutes through the video and I'm amazed at the work that you put into your costumes. Again. Seriously, Hollywood, give this girl a consulting job for costume work or SOMETHING. Yall need it."
"DESOGNED"
"I fucking loved the bit about the genderless person. That's just good comedy."
"Bravo!"
"is it cultural appropriation when a biological man becomes a woman?"
"I just discovered your channel and I love you!!! Amazing work, really on all fronts. There is something you're missing though on this topic though IMO. Terfs aside, radical feminists define gender completely differently than liberal/individualist feminists. And I think that's why there's so much confusion. I'm not sympathizing with straight up assholes, but not all rad fems are bad people. If within feminism we are working with 2 different definitions of gender then we can't even have a conversation because we're not even speaking the same language. Rad fems define gender as a class system so abolishing this violent oppressive system of power (gender) makes sense in that view. Liberal feminists define gender in a more individualist way. So its more about personal choice and expression and the right to be you. I know I'm grossly simplifying it for the sake of a youtube comment, but I just wanted to suggest this topic for a possible future video <3"
"I’m a man should I stay or leave."

"Humans don't change sex, kids    This video spent over 30 minutes on a fabulous set in a brilliant production telling radfems/GCs that they don't know what it's like to be a transfeminine man ('transwoman') as a fallacious rebuttal to the female experience.  Despite how he identifies or self-labels, Natalie is a man."
"OHMYGOD YOU ARE SO GORGEOUSSSS"
"There is nothing radical or feminist about being trans-exclusionary. We shouldn't call transphobic fucks radical feminists. They aren't. You're amazing Nat, making our world a better place everyday."
"That was an odd dig at Cincinnatians. We stand by our chili."
"As someone whose feminist ideas have always been 'radical' leaning, but has also never had trouble reconciling that with being, like, a decent person to trans people lol, I really appreciated and absolutely loved this video! Especially when you talked about the 'ur perpetuating misogynistic stereotypes by presenting feminine' argument terfs always use, and how they use gnc women as some sort of gotcha, because as a gnc woman I sure as hell sympathize more with trans women. And I love that u went through everything point by point because, even though you are right in your assessment at the end that those points are all just used by terfs to veil blatant transphobia, I think that a lot of girls who are more critical of liberal feminism (like me) hear those talking points and naturally question them too, because they have to do with interesting Big questions about gender and how it's experienced and what it even is and where we should direct our feminism, etc. But they'll never find satisfying or thorough answers in most radfem circles! Bc instead they just get the ideological extremes and feel like they have to choose between dogmatically repeating 'trans women are women' and effectively putting an end to any further discussion, or joining an echo chamber of bigots who view trans women as caricatures and won't have nuanced opinions either! So thank you so so much for making this video !! You don't even know how long I've waited for you to really get into this topic because I knew you'd do it amazing! (I do wish you'd gotten into the 'cotton ceiling' though, because I obviously don't believe most trans women want to force lesbians into having sex with them, but I've also never heard an argument that doesn't demonize either trans women or lesbians... and I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that we totally don't have to pit those groups against each other lol)"
"😍"
"I'm liking the behind-the-scenes asides and outtakes! I can tell you and Lindsay Ellis are copying notes from each other <3"
"Natalie, I love you! You're incredible."
"I remember an infographic that went around twitter where it was basically  'a TERF's guide to how transwomen should interact with cis women' and my god it was the most gaslighty rediculous thinly-veiled hate manual I have ever seen,  'you will only get acceptance on OUR terms if you know your place and with pure self hatred and submission (except you won't really)'  its the exact rhetoric used against woman and other marginalized people to silence them under the guise of an olive branch...there is absolutely NOTHING feminist about that"

"I kind of see abolishing gender as having an unapologetic mix of male and female traits. I have some ftm friends who dress like that, but I know it's not practical or safe for everybody. That bit was really funny, though. xD"
"Oh my god, Natalie. I love you so much. Your videos are the best. Thank you for gracing us with your presence here on YouTube. ❤️"
"“Nobody knows what it’s like to be a sad tran 🎶”  I know too, Natalie. 😢"
"Natalie can you make a video on transmedicalists and nonbinary people? I want to challenge my beliefs because I'm slipping and I need someone to slap me."
"Thank you so much for this video! I've had all these questions in the back of my mind for a while even while loving your channel"
"'nobody knows what its like to be a sad tran' lmaoooo my depression has been relapsing and that was so fucking on the nose im dying"
"So, I fully support the points made in this video, but I'd really appreciate that we stop with this idea that 'male privilege' is a 'cis male' thing, not a predominately 'heterosexual male' thing. Apart from the misgendering that trans-persons face, gay men are broadly seen as 'it' or 'fag' by both men and women, both white and non-white people. It's becoming a bigger issue in the discussion of women's equality because it's dismissive of widespread abuse toward gay men based purely on their genitalia. I can agree with most of the concerns raised by feminists, but I can't agree with feminists who indiscriminately point a finger at me as well for 'patriarchy', especially knowing that women have had nearly a century of equal voting rights and overwhelmingly supported candidates and legislation that displaced me legally and socially for all but the most recent 10 years."
"My gender philosophy professor suggested you you me. I'm a Marine vet trying to expand my mind. I appreciate everything you have helped me understand. You are hilarious, and I believe you make learning this stuff not feel like a personal attack. As a white male, much of the stuff written by people like Butler feels like an attack. I'm still learning, but thank you for helping me grow."
"ur actually breathtaking"
"i wanna see a video on ur thoughts on whether drag queens are harmful to the trans community because they’re a caricature of trans women and coopt trans vocabulary!!! i’ve been seeing a lot of ppl talking about it and wanna know ur thoughts"
"I love your videos and am super happy this one applied to a group I closely interact with. As a cis lesbian I find terfs around friends of friends often and having this arsenal of knowledge and sound well thought out arguments from you I think will be helpful in further discussion with them. Thanks and you really looked like Manila Luzon this vid lol."
"Nat: It's PC run a Mac, haha :)) Me: It is called 'Hackintosh' ^_^"
"As a ceramist, not a bad collection."
"I agree with you 100% on everything you addressed.  I wish you could have addressed the problem of psychopaths opportunistically identifying as women for nefarious purposes.  Examples: rapist transitions to be put in female population of prison continues to rape women, pedophile transitions and starts inserting tampons into 10 year old girls' vaginas, awful person transitions to escape debt and criminal past successfully runs for political office, horrible person assaults a woman and demands the victim refers to them as 'she' rather than 'they' when giving testimony of the assault, Mexican politicians start identifying as women en masse so they can fill seats constitutionally required to be filled by women, anyone identifying as a trans person only to troll and trump others' opinions without actually internalizing those identities at all, people who don't transition in any way and continue to receive all their previous privilege while demanding kudos for their average misogynist rants against women, I mean, you get the picture.  Rachel McKinnon doesn't address these things and says bringing them up isn't in good faith. Personally, I think the opportunistic sociopaths do more harm to trans people than they do to ciswomen and they need to be addressed in some way other than KiLl ThE tErF wHoMsT bRiNgS uP sUcH tHiNgs. My personal take on it is that sociopaths are lacking in any identity besides the one they affect to attain their opportunistic targets and that these people shouldn't be validated or accepted under the trans umbrella. I can see how this could become a slippery slope where one needs to earn the privilege of being trans and TERFs would simply say that no one earns that privilege because <insert excuse> but at some point as a society we are going to come to accept trans people and when we do there are still going to be misogynist edgelords and sociopaths appropriating the label for nefarious reasons rather than genuine and innocent or morally neutral reasons. Thank you for coming to this TED Talk."

"'TERF is a slur' is just their version of 'anti-racist is code for anti-white.'  I forgot who came up with this, but I love it."

"15:00 Best meme ever XD Who in the camp of calling people who prostate . protstrators XD  FYI people who bleed also has prostate but its on the Vegenal area and not internal Finger guns"
"WTF is this video about?"
"My psychology professor used the term 'mouthfeel' when referring to the perception of food, and I may have temporarily chocked on air and spluttered a little; all daintily and femininely of course.   Thank you for creating a context that made that mundane moment memorable and hilarious, Contra."
"Oh oh oh oh no, b****! Now it's on! Gold Star Chili 4 life!    Keep going, Nat. Watching you is my personal version of calculus homework. It's a workout sometimes, but I really want to learn calculus.   And keep your **** **** mouth shut abut Cincinnati Chili. 😉"

"ok. you didn't have to bring my chili into the matter :-/"
"I love that contra starts by saying she doesn’t want to parody terfs in this video, then the character is literally a witch."
"u know that description of a trans woman in the intro is esp. terrible b/c everything Germaine Greer describes in an attempt to disgust you and make you think 'this isn't a woman!' are things that could 100% apply to a cis woman :/ cis women can have facial hair, or excess body hair, or large hands, but still want to be feminine by wearing a wig and eyelashes. And Greer herself would agree that women that have any combination of these traits are not any less of women, considering her book The Whole Woman is arguing that in order for one to be female a woman doesn't have to be traditionally feminine. but ig according to her having a penis invalidates all that and suddenly all these 'unfeminine' traits are what makes you a man hmmmm"
"Natalie, you are a national treasure, as always."
"I'm always baffled when TERFs say that terms like 'menstruator' or 'pregnant people' reduce women to their body parts. They do the opposite!   'Menstruator,' (though it may sound like a menacing and bloody killer robot) has no connotations beyond itself. It doesn't mean 'woman,' and therefore it doesn't reduce women to anything. If anything, it *liberates* womanhood from being merely a signifier for a small collection of body parts. By separating gender and body parts, gender can stand for more than body parts; it becomes less reductive, not more.  These terms don't reduce women to body parts, they reduce body parts to body parts."
"Luxuriance lmao"

"Just wanted to say that your whole thing of taking troll questions and memes- see 'Are Traps Gay?' and then actually devoting serious time and costume design to answer them fully is awesome. I find your videos like these really educational as well as entertaining, and they're a good way to change minds or open a dialogue with people who would otherwise shut you down. Keep up the good work! <3"
"I once posted in gender critical for asking what a TIM was. Holy shit I was not ready for the anti male hate shit storm.  It was like I invaded the wrong bathroom holding a Nikon."
"You know, when you took off all the make-up and everything, I kinda went whoa. Your face shape has totally changed, like it's all rounded out. You don't need any make-up to look like a woman anymore. You look totally different from when you first started Youtubing. Estrogen magic."

"As someone who has somehow in the past both been a terf and an anti-feminist at various points, natalie's channel is really really appreciated"
"So, I had never seen the 'Gender Critical' subreddit before and took it upon myself to look through a few posts. I noticed your video had been posted and so decided to read the comments in the thread. They were gross to say the least, but I was curious about what they were saying and why and so I began to engage with them. Fun fact, don't do that! I posted a total of two posts and was immediately banned for not being a hateful transphobe who was only there to trash your video and misgender you. It's honestly sad how insulated these communities make themselves, allowing them to eternally amplify each other's fears and hate without any chance for enough of a voice of reason to debate with them about their views and challenge them. It's amazing to me how much time and effort is being put into calling trans women men. Well, less amazing, more sad."
"Penis and vagina are NOT distinct anatomical structures. Ambiguous genitalia exists BTW. Penis tip and clitoris are the same structure. Ovary and testicle are the same structure. Ovotestis is an in between. Grok?"
"A lot of these same bio women who attack hyper feminine presenting trans women for reinforcing gender stereotypes also attack other bio women who presenting hyper feminine for misogyny (eg, 'She wouldn't have gotten raped if she hadn't been wearing that. If she didnt act like a slut, we wouldn't be attacked.').  Which completely blames the victim for getting attacked and basically absolves men of their poor behavior because 'boys will be boys.' Sadly, I once believed these same excuses. But I agree with Natalie that all women should be supporting each other they way all minorities should support each other. Attacking each other, helps keep us all oppressed. And helping someone attack someone else to get the heat off of you is bullshit because when that first victim is gone, you'll be next.  Also, Dan Savage always says that women get abused by men partially because they see the same thing in women that they do in gay men (femininity) and they've been indoctrinated to hate that.  So if you're dating a homophobe, it's not a big leap to assume he's also a misogynist. Don't support that shit."
"Dear humanity, REALITY is important AND your ass is not the only ass that understands it."
"You killed it as usual. You never cease to amaze with your articulation of things that are known but have evaded being put into words."
"I saw the post that Natalie put out asking people for their input if they formerly thought like TERFS, and I was going to write in. I never got around to it. After watching this I've realized I never was a TERF. I may have not understood a lot about trans people, but I still respect other humans and their right to exist however they choose. It seems like TERFs are just out to dehumanize, and use feminism as an excuse to be hateful."
"Before we abolish gender we have to stop cutting a baby's pp peel."

"Natalie is my queen"
"Someone very close to me recently came out as trans.  You've answered many questions I didn't even know I had.  Thank you."
"The end about internalized hate is sadly so real for oppressed minorities. We're trained by society to think this way about people who are oppressed, even when we ourselves are part of said oppressed groups. It's so important for us to help each other climb out of those ways of thinking, to stop hating ourselves for who we are. This includes transgender people being able to love themselves, and NOT despite being transgender."

"damn Abigail Cockbane had a glow up"
"terf could neverrrrrrrrr love this and thanks for always give that knowledge juice yellow hair is life"
"You know, actually the first 3 questions I had essentially word for word. Kind of ended up determining that it's really up to the individual to decide whether they want to participate in collective identification or not. Saying people aren't allowed to do that is almost as creepy and authoritarian as saying people have to."
"So elegant wtf"
"'...the trannie 1%'...'"
"Waking up in the middle of the night (I assumed for no reason), then checking my phone for the time, and seeing this video upload... Have I been blessed with some kind of temporal connection to Contrapoints?"
"What these TERFs need to understand is that gender is like money and race in how it only exists because we MAKE it exist, and by continuing to invalidate the identity of trans people they’re just making society’s view of their own identity more critical and rigid.   All this blabbering about “transgender dogma” is just adding more fuel to their own funeral pyre."
"I'm concerned I'm in love with you, Natalie."
"Why is 99% of female identity portrayed as being brutalized by men and society? Can we give women a shred of assumed agency sometimes... just once in a while? PLEASE?"
"Thank you so much for this video! It answered so many questions that I had about transgender women as a cis woman. It really helped me understand some things that I just honestly didn't know because obviously, I've never experienced some of the things you have. And there are obviously so many things that I won't get, but I just feel like I really have a much better handle on this whole thing now. I guess I just felt guilty for having some of the questions I had because I was terrified of offending anyone, and I'm so grateful that this answered them and provided me with what I need to get these things more and treat people with more respect. TL,DR: thanks! Deep political conversations about gender politics are the tea, it's so hot, it's just running all over me and I'm living for it."
"Fuck Off Anita Bryant."
"Abolishing gender doesnt mean abolishing gendered traits and behaviors, it would mean seperating gender from our traits and behaviours so that people can present and behave in whatever way makes them most comfortable without necessarily having to acknowledge a gendered social system. The idea is to liberate from a gendered culture, not quarantine anything in shades of pink or blue. Just kinda felt like that part of the video was more mocking and reductionist than i would have expected to find here."
"This feels like a response to your 'cancellation' on Tumblr because 'contrapoints (Natalie whomst??) Thinks that trans women all have male privilege'.   I hope that, for some people, this video clears that up....but I know that it probably won't."
"I can't even believe how well you slayed this topic! You truly have a gift for tackling topics that are tough to navigate and rife with complications and people refusing to put a glimmer of empathy into their perspective.   How this video relates to me in particular is the abolish gender part. That is what I would like to see happen but I think I take more of a pragmatic point of view, which still not everyone is okay with, and I understand why. I consider myself agender. What that entails, in my case, is an asymmetric approach to gender. People can gender me however they like, I however don't use gender back. I've made an active effort to excise gendered language from my speech unless it's a direct quotation. The reason is, I either don't understand what the gendered terms mean because gender largely makes no sense to me, or I don't know why I'm bringing it up in the first place even if I do understand it. And I consider it important to only use language I understand. And I still haven't got it all figured out yet. I don't have a gender neutral 'mr/ms' or other various terms. But I'm working on navigating that part.   This stuff. Is. Complicated. Most people don't examine gender to the extent that non-binary and trans people often do. Abolishing gender requires conversations that are a headache to go through because you have to pick apart so many definitions to stay on the same page and the approach that's necessary is so wildly different from person to person that there almost is no consolidated way of doing it. No one should have to accept being an open invitation to these discussions just for trying to exist in a space that doesn't understand it. Trans men, trans women, and non-binary people are just trying to navigate the world. And it's pretty absurd to put these conversations exclusively on their backs to solve a problem that the bulk of society is putting on to everyone too."
"As an ally of Trans Rights, I do have a question. A lot of the time I’ll have a lot of TERFs or false allies try to confer in me doubts about transgenderism. If I don’t have the availability of resources at the time, what’s the best thing I can do to help educate them?  Edit: Add on, this also goes for when you can’t formulate all of the.. nuanced responses you wish to."
"Love ya girl . Just an older Redneck thinks what you do is great for people this nation and the world . Your very brave and I admire that . We could have used your insight 30 years ago if not more ."
"Yo, as a trans inclusive liberal progressive liberal male who has literally no business in your comments, I just want to say I've been watching your videos for like a year now, and your writing is getting funnier and funnier. Like I used to just watch this for the insights, which are still great and thx for the free ed, but now I'm laughing out loud roughly every 3 minutes. #yesallgamers"

"MOM EVEN BLESSED US WITH A BLOOPER REEL   THANK YOU MAMA~ <3   Also I'm digging the bluescale Rita Repulsa/Hexadecimal-from-Reboot cosplay, you looked like you had a lot of fun with your sudden D-cups lol. I can't blame you. Even when one doesn't want tiddies they're still pretty fun to fidget with. ^o^;"
"you and Jason Momoa are literally the last 2 people on earth that I am remotely attracted to. Just thought I scream my last sane thought into the void......"
"I love your videos Natalie and this one is the best! I think my mom is a terf and I was outed by my older sister and ignores the fact that I'm trans and honestly there is no point in me arguing with her at all. When I tried to come out to her again, she just goes on about how she's a medical coder and uses Caitlyn Jenner (deadnames her too) and how I want to cut my p*nis off which I tried to explain to her. I know once I move out and let her know and remind her of the situation, maybe then she will learn or hide behind her little walls of religion and medical coding.   Again please keep making more of these videos! <3"
"hey dont diss our chilli 😤"
"Excuse my beauty. TERF."
"Hmm. Your genderless self has good skin. Pretty!"
"Dan Natalie Your Bobbie s"
"Natalie, I must say I’m very disappointed in your continued ignorance of psychological and neurological understanding of trans people in favour of strict constructionism. Gender identity as a psychological phenomenon is well validated, and the neurological evidence points to highly dimorphic sub-regions of the brain being responsible, not overall brain structure. In light of this, only considering gender a social phenomenon is a very limited view on the phenomenon, and one that I think seriously undermines trans legitimacy."
"I'm really glad to know about this new term for terfs because it'll help me avoid them. I had never heard of it before. When I first saw the term 'race realist' on someone's blog header, I immediately thought they were someone who understood the realities of racism since that's what the term makes it sound like. Then I actually looked at their blog and realized 'Oh...it's just a new term for racist...the complete opposite of what I thought the term meant.' Bigoted, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, ableist groups keep coming up with new names for themselves in order to find easier cloaks for them to hide under. We always have to stay on our feet and look out for the terms they invent for better press. They especially love to try to hijack what's considered progressive at any given moment and modify said progressive values until they fit snugly as a cover for their hate. It just makes progress towards equality even more difficult when they do that."
"as a ceramicist, this is a lot of pots lol"
"Something I actually hate with a burning passion is when people say that being very stereotypically female is 'wrong' because you're perpetuating the patriarchy's oppression 'cause...I don't see how that's the case if it's something you're doing for yourself and your happiness. Yeah, it's bad if it's not what you want and it makes you miserable but society is forcing it upon you, but if it's your choice I see it more as reclaiming those things and empowering yourself by taking away the monopoly of the male gaze and the idea that those are things women do only for men, and finding happiness and comfort in fully expressing yourself how you wish to. Let's get into a personal example: I'm a cis female and I used to be fucking terrified of wanting to try makeup or wear a skirt because I was always the tomboy, one of the guys, 'not like other girls' (said in a toxic way, implying that I was better than other girls for not being traditionally feminine). All my life I walked the line between being perceived as better than other girls for not being like they were but also criticized for not being girly, being 'boyish', stepping out of my place and daring to try and be 'like a man'. And that mentality is toxic as fuck, it was really bad for me. Now I've managed to get the fuck over my stupid prejudice and even tho it's once in a blue moon, now makeup is a sort of power move to me. Look at me now, doing the thing I feared would compromise my identity free from all that and feeling happy and empowered. I wear makeup if I want to, and if not, I don't. I won't let myself be trapped by any one mentality (girls have to wear makeup vs being afraid of doing so because of how I usually express myself and my gender in a very non-conforming, more 'masculine' way) and I let myself live and be happy, not thinking that there are certain things that I can't do because of how I choose to present myself and express my version of femininity. 'Cause, honestly? I think that's how they win: when they convince us to oppress ourselves."
"Natalie, I just wanted to take the time to share how you have shaped my views as I have grown over the past couple of years. I have always been on the left of the political spectrum, I grew up in a house that by Southern American standards probably looked like the USSR. I wrote a reddit post about a year ago that I feel so ashamed now when I think about it, basically on this issue. As someone who has identified as a feminist for most of his life, I fell into many of the traps you have described, especially the idea of 'eliminating gender.' A few years ago I fell into the traps of Jordan Peterson,  Gamergate and the like. Thanks to you, I'm not the 'Liberal' hack I used to be, and I am so much better for it.    I just wanted to let you know how great it is to have a trans woman who people can learn from and be informed by, please keep doing what you're doing girl, love you and i'll watch your videos always :)"

"Even though it was very brief, I’m glad you talked about transmedicalists and how they’re oppressive. Hopefully you make a video about them because, boy are they bad, I keep getting their videos recommended to me and I feel like it’s a bad message to send to enby and questioning trans kids who are gonna end up just hating themselves"
"“Listen sweaty” I can’t even explain how often I use that phrase. I’m glad someone else finds it as funny as me to say."
"hi mom"
"Goddamn, Natalie, you have such a gift for articulating your experiences. Thank you for investing so much time and energy into answering questions I never knew I had."
"As a middle aged cis woman, I have no idea what the 'essence of womanhood' is.  Natalie, I adore you.  You are doing more for feminism than any gatekeeping TERFs."
"26:51 this should be a segment on it's own. The pompous narration is absolutely lovely with a hint of cynicism perfumed with a ironical undertone. The decor was stunning as was your clothing choice. I really enjoy your content. Even if the term 'cis-gender' is created to alienate everyone from the construct man woman. I understand the ressentiment throughout the self alienation by the term men or women. But I don't think that the term cis has any added value."

"The constant mentions of 'gender identity' by your inner radfem are particularly amusing for those, like me, who live in countries where it's a right-wing scare word brandished against any kind of pro-LGBT initiative whatsoever."
"As always, you're far, far too kind.  Take the 'TERF = slur' thing. No, it's not just that it's not a slur because it's not referring to people. It's not a slur because it's they fucking want to exclude trans people. They are trans exclusionary radical feminists. It is, to a word, accurate. They're mad that other people aren't using their preferred obfuscation and spin. (You know, like how they refuse to call 'pro-lifers' that, precisely because it's spin). Just like 'pro-life' is a term that ignores that most pro-lifers actually have a pretty low opinion of most human lives aside from the unborn, 'gender critical' ignores the fact a) plenty of people are critical of gender without being transphobic or wanting to exclude trans women and b) that's not the actual debate at hand. They're not just idly critical. They want to exclude trans people.  Yes, if we said 'transphobic radical feminists', that would be a pejorative. But that's not what people do. It's no more poisoning the well than calling people who oppose abortion 'anti-abortion'."

"Also I love the compassion in your voice when talking about 'female socialisation'. You're saying, 'here's a thing I didn't experience so I cannot understand it FULLY'. That's very kind. If only TERFs and other bigots extended the same courtesy to you. <3"

"I just want to clarify that there are radical feminists who are not TERFs. Feminists might adopt the modifier 'radical' for any number of reasons unrelated to TERF beliefs. I'm actually a bit annoyed that TERFs have corrupted the term 'radical feminists.'"
"hey, off topic, but does anyone recognize/know where one might buy the red top/dress natalie is wearing??  i neeeeeeeed iiiiit"
"I'm very annoyed terf-s got to keep being called gender critical in a sense that it's compared to race realism. I'm probably rare one out there (I sent mail too, but also - late) I totally support trans rights and I engage in online activism (as much as I can, read :my mental health allows)   _and_ I'd say I'm a gender critical.   my rationale: as gender is a social construct we need to be critical of it. critical about science on gender so far (re-evaluation of research done, mostly by biased men) and doing more research.  This is not about trans issues even, it's about 'debate' about innate vs nurtured, which is false dichotomy, actually, as we know it's both, but so many what/how/why questions are yet to be answered.  Gender critical seems so appropriate, literally. It sounds like proper skepticism, while race realism sounds like denialism. I'm hoping we stop giving them the term, just like I never call anti-abortionist 'pro-life'   Anyway, as I'm not trans, and I couldn't find the origin of the term- anybody knows if it was coined by a terf.  and what else could I use? (as a shortcut to my pov)  ... any suggestion is welcome."

"I'm always impressed by your artistic skills. 100% awesome"

"As a trans-woman myself, it really bothers me when other trans-women say they're women. No, we're not. We're trans-women. Nothing wrong with that and there's no point in saying that we're full blown biological women. It's rude to try to expand man and woman to include trans. We are trans. No need to hide it. No need to take cover under another label."
"PC run a Mac: aka hackintosh."
"Queen I ADORE you"
"Under the present system, and the system since the dawn of time, oppression of women has been based around the physical reality and implications of possessing a vagina, uterus, etc. Women have been universally and historically vulnerable by innate physical attributes (and yes this obviously includes women who can't/don't bear children). I dare anyone to go tell a child bride that they aren't being inclusive enough in their definitions of gender, and that they shouldn't just consider their 'cis-ters' as among their sisters. Tell one of millions of women who have gone through FGM. Tell victims of war rape. Tell the 1 in 3 women on the planet who have been beaten, assaulted, raped, or otherwise abused. Girlhood, womanhood, these are held up as such important concepts not because women want to cling to stereotypes or norms. They are held up, remembered, understood because half of the planet is decided to be a second class citizen the day they are born. This is not something a person can wipe off at the end of the day. This is not something that anyone who is biologically female can opt out of. Ever. In their entire life. Regardless of identity. From infancy. Fuck you for mocking suffering. Fuck you for mocking women's experiences which are devastating to them as people, reading Sylvia Plath like she was some wacky lady who just wanted to hang out with 'tHe BoyZ'. Get out of your privileged, whiney, western mindset and actually think critically for once. Get some fucking empathy. If your largest concern gender-wise is being made fun of or rejected sexually you are an extremely lucky person. Maybe 'TERFs' aren't as narcissistic as you and actually take a nuanced look at sex, gender, and how these things brutally impact 3.7 billion human beings, and don't take kindly to someone like you spitting in the face of the very real and present implications of womanhood."
"I'd never seen that cop video before... almost teared up at 'Excuse my beauty'... You GO Tiffany! Amazing as always Mademoiselle Points!"
"I saw Contra pop up in another video I was half watching, & thought  'I should check to see if she's posted anything new.' And blam! New video. Stoked!"
"Wonderful video, thanks again. I actually had such a strong bout of wanderlust listening to that Sylvia Plath quote -- but it was interesting how much I related to your commentary as well, being a homebody most of my life (the little experience I have had with bars bored me to tears). It was a strong choice of quotation but I feel like from my experience (cis woman) -- it got at a poignant lack of freedom that Plath had that I felt like your immediate response after the fact didn't quite jibe with. The idea of a freedom you admit to having and then said 'but I didn't want that!' -- it's different from Plath, who never had the option.    That said, there was a lot of subtlety in what you expressed after the fact, so I think it was more the framing that I was like 'oh this missed me'. About the complexity of trying to find a space for yourself to fit, when all those male narratives weren't really doing shit for you. I think a lot about the guiding hand of narrative with respect to gender and how that's changing. In that respect, your experience might not be entirely the same as Plath's, a kind of deeply wistful wanderlust, but you drew the parallel elegantly enough: both of you wanted a narrative that society told you 'wasn't yours'. And being told that wasn't yours to have; well, no one wants that.    In any case, n u a n c e abound as always, thank you for your work. I hope people considering gross 'gender critical' ideas see this TERF bullshit for what it is, after you've laid it out so elegantly and clearly as always."

"I feel so attacked... I love the word menstruator."
"I dunno if this empowers TERfs or weakens them, but when you did the bit with no make-up, and even no hair, my brain was still all 'that's a girl right there'."
"I am always delighted when i see you have a new video. You are perfection!"
"I'm very excited for this because I am about as far from TERF as I feel it is humanly possible to be but the problem with being non-binary, in my case, is that some of those questions *do* cross my mind. Now, the difference between me and a TERF is that gender is a big fake lie but biological sex is too and I just refer to people how they want me to refer to them with no disparagement because I'm not a trash can on wheels and I just don't give a shit what arbitrary words people use as self descriptors."
"A trans woman can successfully steal their man basically ;)"
"I love the lil spontaneous laughs"

"Well done, you have done nothing to challenge gender critical beliefs."
"I dont really care if you have a dick,used to have a dick,or like to dress on dresses in private nor do i understand why people take a interest in youe personal sex life.  I will say i like makeing fun of trannies,well everyone including myself deserves to be pointed at and laughed at.  I guess my point is..who cares lol."
"Did you get a new camera? The quality looks so good!"
"Natalie,   I like who you are as a person.  Thanks for including the outtakes in today episode.  It makes me happy to see you laughing and having fun while cover such a disheartening subject."

"Lmfao even feminists hate Germaine Greer."
"I think you may be underestimating the amount of people that just aren't assholes. If I see that you are identifying as a woman I'll call you a woman whether you pass or not. It doesn't effect me and I can respect your decision so that's that. At least I hope I'm not in the minority..."

"Absolutely love your humor. So deadly spot on. Keep it up."
"i literally did not see her headdress i was so distracted by her boobs"
"This is a nice video, and you make many excellent points.  However, I would like to make one correction.  You see I am a transmedicalist.  What this means is that I believe that one needs gender dysphoria (the distress/discomfort caused by a mismatch between brain sex (gender) and the sex one is born as) in order to be transgender.  This is not me saying 'you do not feel my pain so you do not count' this is just me saying that medical conditions have symptoms.  The medical condition of having a mismatch between brain sex and sex has the symptom of gender dysphoria.  Yes, there are transmedicalists that take it to the extreme, but most of us in the transmed community see them for what they are: assholes.  It is fine if you disagree with me, everyone is entitled to their views, but to say 'all transmeds believe that one needs to experience extreme pain in order to be trans' is just wrong.  Again, I really enjoyed your video.  Thank you, and have a nice day."
"another great video, would love to see you talk more about transmeds as it’s something I still don’t quite understand and would like to hear your take on it"
"15:07 gave me life"
"You can really see and feel Natalie's emotion come through in that final monologue about disgust. I got chills!"
"Just came here to say keep doing what you're doing. You're a natural educator."
"This was an amazing video! I'm really glad that you discussed these 'questions' this way (and not just for the fantastic costumes). For the people that are genuinely curious, but too afraid to ask they got the answers they needed, and for everyone else they got some great responses to use if a TERF ever tries to pull these. And this was an incredibly quotable episode  'Under the circumstances it just seems a little gauche, and I don't like things that are gauche ' Grabs boobs while in a headress that would give a peacock insecurity  'But wouldn't you rather just... eat a bowl of thumbtacks?' 'It's a Chanuka-tastrafie!'  'Your Utopian pipe dream is valid!' Sooo good Though I must say I reeeeaaalllyyyy want TERF bitches necklace"
"God, I would like to make love to you while listening to this!"
"I’m so drunk"
"When TERFs say “trans women aren’t women because they haven’t experienced a lifetime of womanly oppression”, what they’re really saying is “womanhood is completely defined by the oppression of men”. It’s one of those arguments that only sounds reasonable until you consider what it implies."
"So...Terfs are female Incels?"
"The 'Male Priviledge' argument sounds like the 'Hipster/Nerd' complex.  Where 'nerdiness' has sort of become a recent fashion trend (e.g. 'hipsters' and 'Big Bang Theory') and otherwise attractive and socially well-adjusted people get bashed by for being 'wanna-bes' and Johnny-come-lately trend-followers not 'true geeks/nerds' who were 'Star Wars' and anime fans as kids (and made fun of because of) and grew up as bespectabled, weak, nerds and who were socially awkward and bullied -- sometimes by the very same people who now regale themselves in 'nerd' culture."

"Video amazing as always but gosh THAT LIP COLOUR ON YOU"
"I'm a simple girl, I see a new Contrapoints video, I click"
"Damn right, Natalie!  Saying TERF is a slur is like saying calling someone racist is as bad as calling someone the N-word.  If it describes a person then it could be a slur but if it describes an ideology or opinion then it's just a totally valid label describing that ideology.  Are we gonna start saying that Nazi or Commie is a slur now?  People that believe that are basically saying that they're born with this ideology and this ideology defines them.  That almost sounds like they're part of a cult or something.     Also the phrase 'Terf is a slur' sounds really funny to say out loud.   It has a nice MOUTH FEEL... which is what we should be talking about."
"None of this is simple, but I've tried to approach these questions in a straightforward, respectful way.  1) I only experience my life, not anyone else's. I can't know how they feel, or all their history. Therefore, I'm less qualified to say who they are than they are. 2) I have no reason to assume they are lying. I can't imagine someone who would lie about this and put themselves on the corner between Shitstorm Street and Turdflinger Avenue.  3) Therefore, if you tell me who you are, I'll believe you. Why shouldn't I? What would it benefit me to contradict you, or act like a self-righteous cocknuckle?  I'm still trying to learn to treat people who are more or less like me (white, cis, male) with the dignity they deserve, and how to be helpful rather than hurtful. So it's to be expected that in my attempts to be supportive to people with very different life experiences I'll be clumsy and clueless most of the time. Fortunately, I have very patient friends. But I'm learning."
"'I despise the West' -Natalie"
"I want to see more videos like this. I prefer it when Natalie is the main character and the other characters are more secondary."
"Man I really want to know what thoughts are running through the minds of the people who run whatever costume company Natalie gets her threads from. Do they freak out and run around the office screaming 'Goldenonefan69 just dropped another $500' every time they see a new order. Do they think she is REALLY into roleplay or is trying to perform the Moonchild ritual? Is this the sort of thing that keeps them up at night in between counting all that sweet cash?"

When I got home, there were tons of people on Tumblr complaining that there had been signs depicting the female reproductive system bc it was supposed to be a WOMENS march and not all women had uteruses. That was one of the only occasions where I felt the siren call of radfem ideology. Women’s services like Planned Parenthood were under attack! How dare they try to keep us from acknowledging viable threats to bits and parts that most of us had? But for every tiny sliver of a slice of valid criticism that radfems have, there’s aways a whole extra pie of hatred. They might spout a few 3/4th truths now and again, but it never justifies the truly nasty shit they say about all sorts of women, cis or not."
"Sex doesnt make you a man or a woman, sex is fluid and gender simply does not exist outside of social context and i think we should relieve it of its power, that being said i still love you and think your great and i have abslutly no problem with your desire to express your self in a feminin manner wich you do quite well even in your gender neutural presentation from this video (stunning BTW) simple is beautufll for me. Basicly fuck all sex based segregation and all forms of gendering. We can do better that is my posision and what i mean by abolishing gender."
"It's a pity I can like this only once. You made me cry towards the end"

"So if they look like men you call them pervs dressed as women but it they look like women you say they are enforcing gender stereotypes. Hmmm... seems like a bit of a catch22"
"Natalie, can we talk about the pottery? You okay? That's a lot of semi-useless urns."
"Natalie i was confused are you trying to bring trans and this « terf » groups together or at the end it feels like u gave them a kick in the arse and the middle finger 🖕 so i got confused 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"YAAA FUCK Cincinnati"
"I sincerely wanted to follow the argumentation carefully, but the whole time I was distracted by how flippin' gorgeous you look here! <3"
"I love that your videos always add something new to build on your style, and it's always something hilarious or impressive. Never stop, natalie. 💞"
"At around 1:50 you imply that there are only men and women"
"My favorite band just released a new banger!"
"Honestly, my favorite Natalie looks so far: subtle and classy as shit vs all out extra demonic terf monster, I’m dying!"
"What do you think about how push back against trans rights are helping intersex people get recognized legally?"
"truly fell in love with this video especially at the fact that it firmly maintained the point of why TERF pov is just scholar-wrapped stupid bigotry while having the common sense to point out the obvious difference between afab/amab life expectancies and experiences, in which some part of the trans activist community tends to ignore... as a nonbinary person i thank you. subscribed!"
"TAKE A SIP LOOOOL"
"Hey, im a white dude, you didnt fight for my rights. Nobody did."
"thank you for posting natalie i love you"
"🖤Just a lesbian lesbianing.✌👅"
"So often I feel like transmen get looked over in these conversations (shitty TERF ideology ropes transmen into shit they dont want as much as it excludes trans women) so 1:50 in and I was so psyched to even get a little nod to us."
"Natalie pwns the tubes."
"Damn each new vid is better than the last! Thank you for explaining all this in such a badass way"
"This whole problem is caused because of misunderstanding of some of the most basic epistemological idea of what percepts and concepts are for and how they are used. You say 'she' to someone because of how they look to you. That's because you have identified female humans and their behavior in a certain way and that in turn turned into what one sees as a woman and thus the pronoun. It's about how YOU experience the world, not how the person you are talking to wants the world to be. It's a pure act of subjectivism to think otherwise. I will not call you 'he' if you ask me to when you look like a woman to me. That will destroy the entire point of that word. Concepts and percepts are used consistently in order to live and survive. There is no point in trying to change the reality of things. If you look and act like a woman, I will call you she. If you look and act like a man, I will call you he. If you are somewhere in the twilight zone or some weird mix, I'll simply have to settle for one of the two - it doesn't matter which and this kind of situation is not an indicator of the method being false; it's a lifeboat situation.  I also wanted to point out that this video was really hard to watch at times. The amount of cuts was way overboard. Really nice costumes as always though."
"Oh I would love love LOVE a video on transmeds. I am begging for that shit."
"'Excuse my beauty,' I'm seriously going to start using that."
"11:25: NPC Confirmed"

"The videos where she really digs into things like TERFS or Incels are absolutely perfect. Thorough, informative, funny, and somehow Natalie looks more fabulous with every new vid. Bravo. I learn tons of shit from these and I look forward to more"
"Jesus, that intro. That author really went out of her way to be cruel to transwomen."

"Well;when a 'man' put a wig on his head and starts living as woman;he becomes a she,coz if she wasn't a woman she wouldn't be a woman,think of it,being a woman is like playing a game called life with all odds against u,who will do it for the fun of it ?  Speaking of games,#yesallgamers"
"Sorry dude. Intellectually dishonest bullshit."
"Natalie: if you're a man... get out! Me: I'm sorry mom... *turns to go"
"I know this is beside the point, but all I could think with the opening quotation is, 'So... how could you tell that wasn't just a 'real woman' with PCOS?'"
"Do TERFs really believe that Adam's apple nonsense? Like, women have Adam's apples. It's created by thyroid cartilage and literally everyone has one. People will gender the most arbitrary things, I swear."
"WAIT WHY DID YOUTUBE UNSUBSCRIBE ME...... FROM... THIS CHANNEL........ Hm"
"Natalie, thank you for this fantastic video.  I'm a straight, cis white guy that's been watching your videos for over a year, and I'd like to think that I'm much more enlightened about these issues because of your amazing content.  Thank you for the education,  I hope that through your vids people can be educated about trans issues.  Please keep it up, you are a pro at this, and are creating a major benefit to society by normalizing the specific needs of the trans community.  And on top of that, you're hilarious. Please keep at it, I check my subs every day, hoping to see if you posted a new video.  Also, the mouthfeel on this vid is pretty good."
"I'm just going to say it dude looks like a lady"
"i know you aren't nonbinary, but maybe you could do a video transmedicalism, trucutes, truscum, gatekeeping, etc? im nonbinary and want to understand this stuff better, and your videos are helping me educate myself so much."
"'this video is a female only space' me, nonbinary: *sweats* 'if there are any men here, get out'  my nonbinary ass: ohohohohoo you'll never catch meeee"
"My sister, with a Bachelor's in psychology, is a radical feminist terf, and she even admits that she's never even met a trans person (man or woman) in real life. I love her, but it makes me see red. I've had so many trans friends and every single one of them have wanted or attempted to kill themselves because of people like her. But what am I supposed to say to someone like that who refuses to actually want to listen and learn?"
"If only I could be *so fucking based*"
"'jagged thorn tangle' very nice"
"First and foremost, fuck you ContraPoints. ' Why ? '. Because I'm Brazilian, and in a escapist attempt at learning about women, womanhood, transgenderhood(Is this a word ? I think it might be a neologism), I turn to you and I can bring myself to forget a little about Bolsonaro but right at the beginning (4:58), you make me relive what I was escaping from.    I'm kidding, of course, and I feel bad for even joking about insulting you, you are my personal diva. I'd like to draw attention at something you said in this video, at around 19:50 to 20:09:   ' (...) It reminds me of what, in the Trans community, are called 'Transmedicalists', people who insist the only real trans people are those who experience agonizing dysphoria. In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing that confirms your identity is pain. What it is to be trans is to despise your body. What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men. '   There it is again, ' Masochistic Epistemology"
"'. God, I think it was a term invented by you, ContraPoints, because I can't find it anywhere else, but it's a fucking awesome term. I know you despise the academia, and I know, that, in the end, most of academia is a bunch of elitist people arguing over elitist shit, but, I think you have a Master's Degree in Philosophy, right ? You could try a PhD with that amazing term. Also, I am Brazilian, as I noted before, so I didn't know about Stephanie Yellowhair ... That video you showed, fuck, I think something in me just died. And I thought I had run out of things inside of me to die when Bolsonaro became a president."
"Thank you! I’ve been talking to stupid people lately and sometimes I actually start to think nuance doesn’t exist."
"Only thanks to the scene at 15:03 I can forgive you for raping Tchaikovsky like this."
"You do you girl."
"In conclusion: we stan harder than ever now"
"Beautiful! Bravo! 🙏👏👏👏"
"Could you please continue replacing Chopin with Tschaikovsky? Thanks <3"
"ik it wasn't your main focus, but i'm glad you briefly acknowledged the roots of transmedicalist beliefs. idk if it's something you'd be willing to do given how (from what i've seen at least) the loudest members of the trans community on youtube are transmeds, but i'd love to see a video of you discussing more on transmedicalism in the future! :•)"
"Thanks for the education, love you."
"PC, A MAC. ><"
"Damn, DAMN! DAMN!!! I was getting shivers down my spine all throughout this video- stellar work as usual Natalie. I really needed to see this video."
"I think it also helps to notice that 'feminism' has had to substantially rely on sexual dymorphism because especially in what is generally considered the 'first wave' of western feminism was literally a time of quack science. Racism was starting to get a thoroughly scientific sheen applied to it and it was simply *in vogue* to pull from biological science to justify both the old and the new dogmas.   The second wave was dominated by white middle class women looking to have the sexual, economic, and educational oppression they faced recognized. The vocabulary was then developed to protected that status quo, but yet again give it a sheen of theory that used biological dymorphism to be the *in vogue*  means of exploring these oppression(s).  In my experience, as a recovering terf and baby trans, this rhetoric that overwhelmingly saw biology as the main reason I, as a person, was subjected to sexual violence and therefore anyone who challenged that notion, was challenging the narrative I constructed around my trauma.  To describe the visceral response of that as 'lizard brained' is only right to an extent--what would go on for me is absolute full fight or flight--to be triggered.  I imagine that is true for a lot of [low level] terfs.    So however you describe your feminism, if it isn't open to traumatized individuals--or it in fact preys on traumatized individuals like terfs do--it isn't effective feminism, and is even more at risk for dogma and hierarchy."
"The satire, the Chinese ceramics, the appealingly tacky wallpaper, the bafoonery - its all perfect."

"i need  more bloopers...more!"
"I love me some hating on Germaine Greer, so I just wanna drop that she constantly pulls the 'Of course the tr*nnies have male privilege! I can always tell when they're trans. I've never seen one I couldn't tell was trans!'  The sheer logical problem with this line of thinking is something called 'the Toupee Fallacy.' A guy says, 'All toupees look fake. I've never seen one I couldn't tell was fake.' The problem, of course, is that if you gather your data that way, any hypothetical real-looking toupees have slipped under your radar. I like to imagine that after seeing that deep-voiced trans woman in a wig, Greer shook hands with like 12 other trans women in line who were short and had managed to grow long hair on their own, and Greer was completely oblivious.  Btw, the Toupee Fallacy only applies to the method, not the items. Trans women, unlike toupees, are real."
"Great video as usual Nat, but can I just point out transmedicalists don’t believe you need to be in excruciating mental pain to be transgender, transmeds don’t believe you have to been in any kind of anguish whatsoever to be valid. It’s just the belief that being trans is not something you choose and is instead set from the forming in the womb, and that you need gender dysphoria to be trans, and this is where I feel the whole misunderstanding begins. The definition of (general) dysphoria includes depression, anxiety, discontent etc, whereas gender dysphoria, despite having dysphoria in the name, only means that you must feel somewhat of a discontentment with being perceived as your birth sex, and in addition to this a sense of contentment when being perceived as your actual gender or transitioning in anyway. Transmedicalism is very much misunderstood, and I feel like a lot of tucutes have almost identical opinions as us, it’s just that they think we believe trans people must hate themselves in order to be ‘valid’, which is entirely not the case. If anybody’s gotten to the end of this long ass comment thank you for your time, whatever side of the debate you’re on."
"So treat me like a female because I'm weak like females. 👌👌🤘🤙🧛 👌😎"
"As much as I like this channel and you, as a person, I have a hard time taking transgenderism with any seriousness. You don’t have female chromosomes, no vagina, you don’t get periods, you’re not gonna experience pregnancy, you’ve apparently already lived/born as a man, etc... All you’ve done is dress and look a like a woman. You say you ‘feel’ like a woman, but anyone can genuinely ‘feel’ like anything and that doesn’t mean they actually are it. What makes me a man, for example, isn’t just that I look like a man or get treated like a man or even feel like a man. What makes me a man is that I know I have the empirical, biological, reality to back up what I say (science)? What do you have?"

"idk about y'all but 'clock a tran' is the most hilarious shit i ever heard. love you natalie!"
"Share success please thank you."
"What some cis feminist women misunderstand, I think, is that their experience does not define womanhood. You are not a woman because you were cat-called, abused, or fearful, you are a woman despite that. Trans women experience a whole barrage of sexist abuse, the same as us, and then some more. It is different, but so much is the same."
"If you get shit on by a pigeon and you do that whole 'going to a grimey public bathroom to try and wash it off' thing, and you then watch someone get shit on twice by a pigeon and you laugh, you're a dick. Help that person! Show them where the bathroom is, give them tips on getting the bird shit out. Getting shat on is a shared experience, share it?

Me, and my girlfriend, and all of my (very accepting with a few coming out as queer themselves sooner or later) would want to learn more about the LGBTQ+ community, would have questions and concerns similar to the ones that your TERF caricature had (as well as other questions that were posed), though we didn't really consider ourselves feminists. We just wanted to know more. I feel like this video encapsulates why I love your channel so much. You satisfy that curiosity that high school me had, put things into words I can understand, and equip me to defend a world view that high school me felt was right but never knew how to express."

"so articulate i might cry"
"Loved this video. I remember stumbling onto 'gender critical' blogs on tumblr and finding them interesting to a point - namely, those points you agree have an element of truth. But what kept me from buying their ideas was that their description of the universal female experience that trans women haven't had included a fair number of things *I* had never experienced as a cis woman. My family, my race, my class, my religion, and maybe even my temperament (I've been told I give off 'don't f*** with me' vibes) have kept me pretty sheltered from the worst misogyny Western society has to offer. Even things like menstruation - let's just say that's a very different experience when you have severe endometriosis! Every woman's experience is different because we're all unique. I don't see why we have to exclude trans women just because they likewise each unique."
"3:41 ...Madame Points, your inner TERF demon torments me"
"That's why I love your videos so much, you always like to take an empathetic approach to bigotry, instead of portraying it as just blatant caricature. It makes your content so much more acceptable and interesting to all kinds of people"
"just a straight white guy here checking in. Looking to gain information on all cultures and experiences. Thanks for the input, i'd love to have a conversation but I feel like the youtube comments aren't really the place for that. So i'll just say thanks for the videos.

Thanks for doing what is deserved and doing it in an entertaining way."

"Germaine Greer isn't a fanatic. Trans-women are the most vocal & visible, monopolising the discourse, making 'transgender' synonymous with 'trans-woman'. If you're talking about trans-women, then say 'trans-women', not 'trans-people'. Is it really that hard for you trans-women to not erase non-binary people & trans-men? Radical feminists classify 'trans-men' the same as AFAB non-binary people, & gender nonconforming cis-women – they don't conform to femininity. On what basis do you reject this classification in favour of grouping trans-men & trans-women together? Even trans-women are transphobic: they wouldn't date another trans-woman, they want to be mistaken for a cis-woman & those who get bottom surgery want to become cis-women. They even have an androcentric view of the vagina (as an entrance, instead of an exit). Men aren't 97% of combat fatalities though (90% are civilian deaths), so that's a false equivalence. The brain correlation is actually between brains with the same sexual orientation. Trans-women attracted to women have the same brains that straight men do. You said womanhood & femininity are separate & that you saturate yourself in feminising gender indicators just so that you can hear the word: ma'am? But ma'am is also just femininity – a construct. So the means & the ends could just as well have been exchanged. So what *is* this elusive womanhood you seek? Every time you conform to patriarchal standards of womanhood you are crossing a picket line. Scabs are part of the problem. The gender utopia is far away, & vocal trans-women drive us all further from it. You falsely accused radical feminists of not criticising femininity when performed by cis-women. They do. A LOT. You strawmanned the privilege argument: just because it's hard for you, doesn't mean it's not still easier for you than every other demographic. E.g. obscenity laws against male-interest, pornographic-material was hard to fight against, but not nearly as hard as the female equivalent would have been. So check your privilege. TERF *is* a silencing-tactic gendered-slur, just like 'man-hater'. 'Bottom surgery' *is* undeniably mutilation. It's a primitive procedure that compromises the function of healthy tissue. Only 30% of trans-women are crazy enough to pay a butcher an exorbitant fee to cut off their penis & shove it up their arse. Just because mutilation is the best butchers can manage today doesn't mean it's magically not mutilation. Radical feminists never said that trans-women not being masculine is bad & equivalent to them being feminine. Trans-women minimally feminise their name, hair & clothes – all constructs. Most women can't see how stupid they look, but the sight of Don Quixote-esque pathetic mimicry will always be met with ridicule. You think you'd be safe from a radical feminist's scrutiny if you were a cis-man?? You're not being singled out for being trans, but for being male. How can radical feminists be transphobic, when their criticism is levied at men, all men, whether trans or not? You admitted to feeling disgust towards trans-women, which makes you a TERF. People are disgusted by femininity. Can't compare homosexuality to transgenderism, the majority of homosexuals don't desist before adulthood!"

"The idea of stolen valor, that 'The essential thing that confirms your identity is pain' is very intriguing, and ubiquitous. I've seen it in every circle, but I've never heard its name, or noticed it as a general trend before. Its funny, because a big way I see myself and my differences with 'the general population' is that my circumstances are more fucked up than most. Hell, I've even thought 'The only way that people turn into good people (which I guess to me really meant develop empathy) is through pain.' This video is making me reconsider those positions"

"As cis guy, the whole concept of abolishing gender irks me the wrong way. I can see why some people would want to go through with it for themselves, but I personally I am perfectly fine with my own masculinity (as far as that goes) I wouldn't want to take away from that. I suppose it's a pretty selfish reason for not going through with it but it's just my view on it."
"I have several thoughts about this that would be too long to write out at the moment, and I feel like a lot of it wouldn't come across how I want it to, but if there's one thing I could say, is that @31:19, this crossed my mind: you can be your best self even in the worst of circumstances.  Here's the thing: I've been persuaded out of a lot of viewpoints in my life, including homophobia, transphobia, etc. It wasn't done by people shouting at how my opinions are wrong, or insults, or physical violence/threats.  It was by somebody listening, understanding, or cracking a joke even though they had every right not to do so. If there's anything we all need right now, it's a little bit of grace towards others. Let them be an asshole if they are one, just don't stoop to their level. Be the better person. Everyone will be better off for it, whether it's you, them, or people like you they'll come across later in their life that don't deserve mistreatment either.  It's not fair, but people often hold viewpoints on people of a certain type based on one person of this type (race, gender, sexuality, etc.). Keep that in mind the next time you feel like blowing up at somebody.  Otherwise, thanks for your humor, wit, and intelligence Contra! I don't always agree with you, but I'm glad you're here doing your thing!"
"You can HEAR the mic drop at the end and I love it."
"You couldn't tackle any of the real and defined conceptions of womanhood, so you had to turn this into a victimization circlejerk and a vilification of TERFs. Are TERFs bigoted? Many of them are. Are they wrong? Nope. The essence of gender is biological."
"i feel like your videos are massively important, because its incredibly valuable to have nuanced conversations about the trans experience. and it really highlights how badly terfs have degraded our ability to talk about our experiences and answer common questions, because our experiences are so often attacked and those questions are so often asked in bad faith. terfs have made it so that to outside eyes, we must present as a unified front, we must have full confidence in everything about our transness, because otherwise any weakness is maliciously exploited as an in to attack us. the reason i think your videos are so important is that youre not just a trans person talking about your own experience, youre doing it in a space you more or less control, something a lot of us as trans people dont have. and, in my opinion, youre doing an excellent job of taking questions that ARE asked in good faith in the heads of cis people (the ones that arent full-on terfs, but still have the same transphobia instilled in all of us who have grown up in this hell world), and addressing them with the nuance and perspective they need. i feel we REALLY need to have more visibility on trans people who approach topics in this way, because if all we ever say are the oft-repeated catch-phrases -- which are oft-repeated BECAUSE we need them to protect ourselves from bad actors -- then those bad actors will be the ones controlling the conversations. theyll be the ones 'answering' those questions with their transphobic bullshit. we NEED visible trans people like you who will address these topics. im really grateful for the work you do, natalie. thank you. 💖💜💙"

"TERFS (and SWERFS but that's a different topic) give Feminism a bad name and should be called out. It's not only Transphobic, but also misandrist.  There are Feminist men. Trans men, gay men, and yes cis het men. All of us bring different experiences but we all fight for the cause - equality and the tearing down of unjust systems and patriarchal society-think. When one excludes trans women because of percieved masculinity, you also tacitly exclude all true male-ness from the groups I mentioned earlier. And that's just being a bigot."
"I knew I was a trans woman for ten years before coming out but I was so disgusted by myself that I knew I couldn't come out,, I took up a very transphobic worldview because if I couldnt see myself as valid, then I'd never be able to see anyone else as such. i either felt that they were all female imposters (which is how I felt about myself), and a lot of jealousy lmao. In the years coming up to my transition I had a lot of internalized transphobia to unpack before I became confident and certain in the fact that:  Trans women are women 🎷🐕  that segment on disgust REALLY hit me deep. I echoed yr sentiments very closely"
"We truly don't deserve you."
"i fucking lsot it when contra drank from the pot"
"You make a lot of good points and I want to rewatch this closely as its a lot to digest. However, as someone who may be considered atleast a bit on the 'terfs' side if you will (I'm a cis-straight-ish male), I want to talk more about the practical complaints that terfs have against having trans-women within their spaces. I mean like showers, bathrooms and so forth. There, in my humble opinion, is a very real concern for men posing as trans-women if we suddenly break all the former rules for separating biological male and females. Sure... in a lot of places it might be okay like San Francisco, but what about the slums of Brazil or any given inner-city ghetto in the US? They have segregated bathrooms for a good reason and there isn't any real way to know if someone truly identifies as a woman. All the philosophyical stuff goes out of the window in these cases and I think its something that isn't touched on enough. What about prison too? Should we throw a person in prison based on what they identify with? If that's the case, I will argue I'm a female to a judge because I'd MUCH rather go into a female prison than a males prison (no dissrespect to the hardcore motherfuckers in the female prisons, but the males are fucking nuts). EDIT - and anyone that believe men won't take advantage of this is completely ignorant. I've been to prison. I know how deviase male sexual predators can be. You give some of these guys an inch and they damn sure will take a mile and another mile to top it off. I will honestly say that its a very real possibility that a male will rape a female by taking advantage of new laws that allow people to use whatever facilities they want based on their gender. Is that something I could live with even though I technically agree with the heart of your argument? Am I transphobic for saying this? I don't think so."
"Ok but it kind confuses me when they say that the word “menstruator”  reduces women to their ability to bleed or sumn but then they tell trans women that they’re not women because they can’t experience menstruation. Honestly, they (TERFs) on some bullshit."
"My Queen, you art wise, and beautiful."

Always love your content, thanks for putting in so much effort into your videos!"
"Wouldn't it be fair to say that transgender has fragmented the idea of feminity (also masculinity) into many parts and this is causing an understandable dissonance? Now we have the reproductive female, the gender stereotypical behavioured female, the biologically born female, and the physical attributed female. You could be one, many or all of these and for each who is, may or may not want to be identified as female. Yet people are predispositioned to the concept of a female as being an all or none. A large portion of their existence has been modelled on this assumption and they don't really know how to function without it..."

"I wish my aesthetic and lingual eloquence was on point as hers."
"There is a trick to overcome transphobia or any kind of 'ugliness aversion' : none of our archetypes of 'beauty'  are biologically predefined, they are more like a variable in a program's code. This 'variable' is defined by observation and interpretation of others, a normal mean of features and attitudes is created under the hood of you brain, it defines what is ugliness and what is beauty. This is mainly developed during your early life, but it can be completely altered at any. Proof: it is what addvertising does to sell you their crap, to make you belive their crap is beautiful, but is just a piece of stuff.     It is rationally prior to feel good with yourself, you don't have to adulate yourself like with all of your forces like a narcisist, but to feel happy. We shall brainwash ourselves insisting on our latent beauty, we shall encircle ourselves with people that sympathise and empathise to create a new meaning of beauty that excludes none. Embrace ugliness with love, because behing the ugliness of flesh and bones lives a person just like you. Do it and you'll be rewarded with completeness, the comprehension of endless beauty, do it with everybody, do it with yourself."

It's overwhelming to put in the work and effort to debate people like that and keep your shit together and so I don't engage very often. But seeing that hateful shit day after day chips away at me.

"Can we be TERFERFS? (Trans-Exclusionary-Radical-Feminist)-Exclusionary Radical Feminists."
"TERF's are basing their world view in a pseudo-materialist (scientistic) philosophy. A superstitious world view, I believe it's the Dawkins/Hitchens model of feminism.  I would recommend reading Markus Gabriel's 'Why the World Does Not Exist' for his ontology of Fields of Sense; and though Markus never says anything about gender, I think his ontology is very useful for understanding our current cultural/social developments with regards to sex and gender.   The gist of it: there are various fields of sense, and anything that exists, exists in so far as it appears in a field of sense. Thus, a woman can appear in biology, anthropology, culture, in a social practice, in fashion, in a hallucination, in fiction, in movies, etc. Each field irreducible to each other with the possibility of overlapping. This is what let's us simultaneously offer an explanation for why a woman presents a hormonal profile different from that of men, and explain why Cinderella or Wonder Woman are women (even if they have no genitals or hormones), as we can explain why in the 21st century it is feminine to use high heels which were initially used by men in past centuries and considered masculine, so establishing commonalities without reducing. So transgender women are women because they appear in various fields of sense generally associated with being a woman. Therefore, biology (and evolutionary psychology) would be one of those fields capable of explaining what we associate with women, and doesn't exhaust the gender at all. The confusion lies in the obtuse equivalence of being a woman and being part of the female sex; the very designation let's us know that there is a difference between being a female (in the species) and being a woman (in every other field). It's as simple as that. But it would also be highly erroneous to wipe out the field of biology, psychology, or other (natural) scientific fields which are highly capable (and they do) of establishing commonalities and the causes of sex and gender; it doesn't mean they have the final word, not even slightly."

"I'm always so happy whenever there's a new Contra video, it always makes my day."
"I don't know if it is merely my perception based on my own experiences, but it seems like acceptance of trans rights has slipped backwards significantly over the past ten years. Because I get the impression that there is much more controversy than there was a decade ago. It almost seems that because the right pretty much lost the same sex marriage issue--that they focused on for so many years--they've now turned their hate goggles towards the trans community.   Now this is coming from a cis male point of view that is going to be limited by lack of first hand experience. So I'm wondering what any trans men or women out there think regarding whether there has been progress over the past decade, or whether you feel like things have gone backwards? I know this isn't really the same topic of the video, but it is something that has been on my mind for awhile.   Great video as always though!"

I struggled with the cognitive dissonance for years, and what ultimately made everything click for me and woke me up was the fact that gay men had been far kinder and more loving to me than any Jehovah's Witness ever had. Since then, I've worked to unlearn all of the conditioning from that religion. I love your videos because you are straightforward, but compassionate and sincere. It makes it so much easier than most activists make it to understand these things as someone who honestly wants to know, but isn't even aware of blind spots or which questions to ask. I love your work, keep it up. Thank you!"
"You description of your transition experience is so valuable and validating. I don't suffer from crippling dysphoria. That makes me terrified that I'm just putting on the pageantry of a queer person so I can be one of the cool kids.  But hearing you tell your story helps me realize that historical and present experience don't have to erase one another. I can be a transitioning pansexual non-binary person who was once a happily straight cis-boy and I don't have to be suffering to go from one to the other. It means a lot to know I'm not alone."

I'm also more than a bit annoyed at how these jerks call GRS 'mutilation' but actively laugh at the prospect of both FGM(as long as it happens outside of first world countries) and IGM(which happens even in first world countries)- as someone subjected to the latter, it's going to take something resembling GRS to help me not be in enormous physical pain. The lack of self awareness is palpable."

"Thanks for this! As a cis woman, I feel like this video made me a even better feminist! I unfortunately had these 'terfy' questions because our experiences are different...but difference doesn't mean that you can treat other people like terfs do (which I never did because I always believe that trans people were valid...and tbh I don't really care about policing people's right to be a man, a woman, a non-binary person, a agender person, etc. If I can help create a world where most people can be safe from harm and comfortable with themselves (whichever form that takes), that's to me, the feminist ideal. )"

"I grew up with a really conservative extended family and like. Whenever I hear terfs going on with their complaints about trans women, I can't help but be reminded of how my uncles talked about immigrants, how my grandpa talked about Democrats, how my aunts talked about gays. Same templates, same tone of voice, same tendency to dehumanize and pathologize. When racists, homophobes, and alt righters are the company you keep, you see some patterns which I think are probably rooted somewhere deep in the human psyche and attached firmly to our ability to hate."
"I think that trans people are important to feminism because they have had experiences as being treated as both men and women. As such, they have a broader view of gender than cis people. I think terfs are blind to that important way to gender equality. I think it's great that people like Natalie are reminding them of that."

"Before I found Contra I used to associate myself with TERFs. I was terrified of men for deeply rooted traumatic instances and Id seen trans women as sort of 'ridiculous,' due to their 'colorful sexualities.' I was ridiculous and Im ashamed for not even trying to talk to trans women and listening to what my older peers would talk about trans women.    Finding Contra, opening up my discourse to actual trans women and learning to understand them was the reason I ended all relations and ties to TERFs and radfems and decided to face my own trauma through therapy and not angry Twitter posts.   I didnt realize that I too had become something id shamed. A transphobe. I didnt see trans women as women but as people with deeply rooted mental issues that just wanted to invade my spaces. I saw trans women as  men, everything they are not.   Im glad to be away from that and Im glad you make this content Natalie, its helped me open myself up and gain one of the bestest friends Ive ever had (my friend Waverly is a massive fan she says hi) and well it deserved to be said. I still have a long way to go but Im glad you're out making this content."

"Stop using 'tranny.' It's fine for trans women to use that term for themselves but you have an audience of 530,000 and counting and, especially these days, the vast majority are cis. Not only that but being a public video you obviously can't be sure that everyone watching is okay with the term and doesn't have triggers from it.   Also; you talk about how trans women who don't pass talk like you don't understand a lot of aspects of our lives. You reject that notion. You then go on to say you haven't been misgendered in SIX MONTHS. I've been out for four years and I still get correctly gendered about once a month if I'm lucky. Given that you keep saying hurtful things about non-passing trans women (I will legitimately never stop quoting you saying 'There is nothing homosexual about a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years' and giving people an out about 'how feminine' or how medicalized someone has to be before them fucking a guy isn't gay) it's pretty clear that you do indeed not understand a lot of aspects of our lives.   Also; you absolutely did not handle the male privilege thing well at all. I actually agree with you that some trans women experience something akin to male privilege, with Caitlyn Jenner being an excellent example. But you barely glossed over the fact that most trans women internalize their womanhood long before coming out. You barely glossed over how much misogyny gets internalized and damages us, how it piles up - without any of the relief that is offered from female friendship cliques - and then comes tumbling down when we do eventually transition. You barely gloss over how being in the closet is statistically, factually a colossally damaging thing and how internalizing trans misogyny keeps us there for longer and longer as we tell ourselves for years that we can't be women, how much the self-loathing from cis and trans misogyny damages us. I also don't have some 'came out at 5' narrative, but I do have diary entries, and despite not transitioning until 26 I have entries from as young as 14 saying 'I know I wish I was a girl.' I wouldn't remember these if they weren't written down, and I truly believe all trans people have these thoughts but often forget about them, or maybe even they never consciously let them bubble up. If it's true that even the 'late bloomers' have always internalized their womanhood whether they realize it or not that explains how us having male privilege is impossible.   You barely touch on all this stuff, despite the ABSOLUTE FUCKING DANGER of telling TERFs that we have male privilege with almost no disclaimer or explanation. That's obnoxiously reckless.   Oh, and did you REALLY need to give a time and place for the trans woman you saw who made your internalized transphobia kick into high gear with? Didn't cross your mind that anyone who matches that description is going to be devastated?   To your credit the rest of the video was pretty good."
"UGH YES NUANCE. Thank you for taking the time to make this video. Although I try my best to be fully supportive of my trans friends, there are some times when I do have a genuine question but I don’t want to have to put them through the pain of explaining it and questioning my motives."
"So, I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of nuance. Now to get blackout, tweet #YesAllGamers, and laugh maniacally for hours.  #YESALLGAMERS"
"Thank you Natalie, that was beautiful and devastating on so many levels. I'm a cis straight woman and I will always stand by my trans sisters and brothers, along with all LGBTQ people. I never understood people who fought hard for the rights of one particular group but denied another's right to even exist and not only did not help them, actively tried to hurt and harm and erase them. Have TERFs forgotten why they fought against the patriarchy? It does seem to be a pattern though. Maybe kinda like the abused-abuser cycle? Or maybe they're just lizard-brained bigots.  I can never truly understand how it feels to have TERFs or homophobes question my right to exist but sometimes I think that not-knowing, or the fear of getting it wrong, holds cis straight people back.   If I'm honest, that's definitely been a weakness of mine - even writing this message has me worrying I'll be misconstrued or not use the right language, but, I mean.. at the risk of going a bit dark, when my partner died many people avoided me and didn't offer support out of a fear of not understanding or doing the wrong thing. While I totally get it, I don't want to be one of those people. Anyway, I understand much better now thanks to your amazing videos! 💝"
"Does anyone know where Natalie gets her jewelry? Especially the earrings. I'm insanely jealous that I don't have them in my wardrobe."
"Terf are why trans need to be independents, cause both sides are very mean to trans. It’s tragic but I’ll be honest trans people are treated better by the left but now people are coming out of the wood work on the left to show their true colors. It’s like how the right was with black people, anyways to step away from my political agenda lol, But I’ll be honest trans people have been through way to much it sad. I’ll fight for trans rights forever by shutting down people who say crazy ass shit about you guys, then again I’m gay so."

"You might personally have no problem with feminists talking about female anatomy but other people claiming to be advocating for trans advocacy have attacked me and gotten all in my anons and ganged up on me on social media for doing so in that context. Saying 'Natalie Nunn doesn't do it so it's a paranoid imagining people are doing it' pretends this thing isn't happening because you personally aren't doing it. You also completely missed the teeeny tiny concern about changing all language from sex to gender getting rid of things like it being a violation of a woman's civil rights to fire her for being pregnant. How could you justify that if sex were not a consideration and having a uterus had nothing to do with you being a woman? How can women in schools and the workplace be protected if aggressions against them based on their reproductive sex effectively didn't exist?"

"Gamercide now!!!"
"The way you phrase an argument is absolute magic! Seriously. Thank you for speaking on such important topics in such a witty and wonderful way! Much love, girl!"
"While transphobia certainly has a role in TERFs' objections, I think you overlook the fundamental root cause: an obsessive hatred of men. Trans women are hated on that basis...every insult you read from TERFs in your video is about making fun of the physical characteristics of MEN, while chauvinistically elevating women. The corollary to that is that trans men are seen in a much less harsh light...traitors to their sex, yes, but ultimately 'wayward lesbians' who simply don't know any better, having been brainwashed into 'internalizing the misogyny'. I'd love to see you do a video with a fair discussion of feminism and criticisms of it."

Instead we just break the associations (by continuously breaking norms), so that everyone can wear/look/do/think whatever they want without it being used to pidgeonhole."
"Has ContraPointers covered transgender women participating in female sporting catagories?"
"Gets me that British TV still has no problem with inviting Germaine Greer onto numerous shows despite her hate against trans people.

But for some reason in the UK we have this really weird blind spot when it comes to transphobia."

"I'm no expert, but TERF views strike me as very childlike. Kids see things as black and white, and as they grow up and learn to reason (if given the chance), a lot of things become grayer. So, seeing things either this or that with no gray between means they weren't exposed to anything that made them peel apart ideas (or reason). And some folks hang onto their opinions with tooth and claw rather than explore the gray area."
"Love your channel so much! I am an old, cisgender feminist and I happily welcome anyone to the fight. Be you, be beautiful (OMG, you are gorgeous...not that it matters because it isnt about how we look. 😘) and know lots of us have your back. Fuck 'rules' and support each other."
"I honestly started crying. Your beauty is so legendary. Thank you for your voice."
"20:00 I'd also note that the way TERFs root their identity in pain is often paired with their tendency to universalize personal experiences and erase those of others.   You see this a lot in the way some will argue that dealing with sexual advances is a defining feature of girlhood, because that's what they dealt with growing up.  Not only is that not true for all cis women, but some trans women(like myself) know exactly what that's like and are survivors of CSA.     It's just another symptom of their incredibly binary worldview, that doesn't deal with messy realities of life very well."

"Really sad how TERF's define womanhood entirely by oppression. It's like they have some kind of Stockholm Syndrome."
"Yup. You've summed up a lot of the concerns even us allies have, but don't really want to ask because we know it's confronting, rude and/or upsetting. For me I dislike it when a minority of non-binary people (typically afab) listen to me talk about my childhood and diagnose, for lack of a better term, certain aspects of it as trans or nb experiences, suggesting that I might be non-binary or claiming such experiences solely for non-cis people. Which is annoying as hell because *no* I'm not non-binary and I'm annoyed when you try and label me as such based on superficial views of my experiences, just because I was a 'tomboy' or didn't appreciate being forced into super femme roles doesn't make me not female.   So in that way the notion of abolishing the gender binary is a little concerning to me, even if I think it's ultimately for the best. But then I only strongly identify as female because feminity is devalued and being a woman is shitty sometimes.  If we lived in a society where sexism didn't exist *then* I think we can abolish the binary, but not before. Because often the binary is strongly tied to our self-worth. 'No wrong way to be a woman' 'womens work is valuable work' ect. And I think trans women have similar concerns in that often the only way to signal their identity is by conforming rigidly to binary views of womanhood and without a binary they would have no anchor.  But ultimately everyone's experiences with their own gender is different and I really don't see how being initially raised as the opposite gender can really be 'too different.' My socialisation was female yes, but it was also very equitable and free compared to many others. Does that make me 'less female'? Of course not. It's concerning to me that so many cis women consider their gender identity to be painful, not positive. That's awful."

"went and watched the video of stephanie. I do not really know what to say. to be honest, the officers may have been in the wrong. just seems like inexperience, but even if they were, I am not to sure they would have handled it much different. ofcourse in my opinion, I deal with situations like this quite a bit. it was not really much about the specfic person or about trans. it was just that she was being difficult.   I am not saying anyone was right or wrong. I just saw the edited version. I understand how you and others will see the officers doing an attack on her as a person, on being trans, especially with the previous commentary. but I have seen these types of officers make the same comments with cis men and women who are being difficult. if her legal name was stephanie, I am sure that's what they would have addressed her by.   again, I understand that stephanie has had a lot to deal with as I am live in the same city is this city is very unique.   I guess I am just rambling. not really sure why I am still writing this and if I post it. yeah he could have used the name she wants to be addressed by, he didnt need to make comments about her looks and eyebrows. he could have let her shield  her eyes from the sun. he was a dick. it is weird. I agree with all that and would also be a person to call all thos out with the officer. but the way stephanie was is a type of attitude that gets to me.  it makes me think of once I was doing security, this woman came up to me asking for help from another woman wanting to beat her up. I said on, the other person talked with me calmly and I said I as a person can not let her do anything in my presence. once she acknowledged my position, she said ok, then the one asking for help started talking back to the one who was chasing her. I got so aggravated, that I said I would let the her be dragged off property and be beat if she didnt stop talking mess. it shut her up and everything got figured out after that. I dont know how this compares and I am sure it is not related. I am sure  i am writing an unfocused arguement. I think it is something to do with attitude or personality or something. oh well.    I still love the videos. great commentary. everything is still spot on."

"Oh... Is bad if I say the way you said 'terf' at the end was sexy?"
"this video filled my heart. The dissing of transmeds/truscum, the systematic takedown of every terf argument, standing absolutely solidly against the claim that 'terf is a slur'. I am a cis woman, but I tend to spend a lot of time in lgbt communities and arguing for more contemporary lgbt platforms, and your content always helps guide me in the right direction for helpful instead of harmful support. You deserve to go down as one of the great minds of this decade, and if you continue with the same quality content I'm sure that will be the case. My only criticism was the somewhat glossed-over dismissal of the abatement of gender, something i personally support. I don't support literally getting rid of gender, I support gender desegregation and erasing the notion that gender holds any power genetically over your personality/brain chemistry, and only determines things about physical presentation and hormone levels. Essentially, getting rid of 'gendered' items and spaces that have nothing to do with the medical side of gender, and opening those items and spaces up to whoever wants to be involved. But I do digress this is a lofty aspiration, and overall is not a luxury most trans people get to consider/support, because gender presentation is so important for safety and comfort. Anyway, I'm a ginormous fan, and I greatly appreciate your content"
"as always, i love all your insight and nuance, especially here because terf rhetoric is where nuance goes to die. i'm a cis woman who's had short hair for most of my life, and i used to get misgendered or asked 'are you a boy or a girl' by little kids when i was younger. when i was like ten, i remember seeing p!nk on tv and i was like 'she has short hair and she's a straight* girl, so i can have short hair and be a straight* girl!' (surprise...turns out we're both bisexual lol). the point here being, i was read as queer and 'not woman enough' by society from a young age, and the fact that i'm visibly physically disabled complicated the whole 'not woman enough' thing. so as i got older i felt this sort of kinship with trans and gender nonconforming women for being on the outliers of 'acceptable' womanhood, but i was always really frustrated with the dominant mainstream narrative of, 'i knew i was a girl because i liked pink and playing with dolls as a kid.' it wasn't until a genderqueer friend of mine explained to me that, regardless of someone's actual experience, many trans woman *have to* present these types of hyperfeminine narratives to be taken seriously as women, and even to receive proper medical care in some circumstances. it really put the issue into perspective for me and helped me understand how the gender binary and rigid obligatory gender roles harm everyone in different and varying ways. also, fuck terfs."

"As a trans man it's just so exhausting to sit through person after person who just doesnt believe you (and you can spot it instantly even if theyre well mannered) and the feeling that every typical person I meet wont really see me as a man, but a deluded woman, is crushing. I spend so much time and mental energy arguing and arguing with my inner 'Dr. Gender Critic' over and over again that I'm truly a man, because MRI brain scans, because childhood behaviour, because dysphoria, but I hadn't realised how utterly pointless and draining the whole thing was until Contra mentioned it here. Most transphobes simply aren't interested in having genuine debates about what gender truly means or where it comes from, and moreover how eerily deep internalised transphobia buries its ugly roots into your psyche that you dont even realise how much you hate yourself specifically for being trans, and I think that's exactly where transmedicalists formulate the belief that being trans and not utterly dispising yourself are inherently mutually exclusive. You made a wonderful job of both arguing against transphobic rhetoric while avoiding the trap of reenforcing the circular reasonsing of transphobia, internal and external, and I really feel on a big level like I've come away from this starting to let go of that constant anxiety of proving my own manhood to myself. Thank you so much for ALL you do for us, I already can't wait for the next one!!!!"

I really love the way clothes, make up and hair can express our inner self, and it saddens me that there are people that think that as bad depending of a person gender or circumstances. I am cisgender and a feminist and I love my dresses and make up.  I still am not done watching all your other videos Natalie, so I don't know if you touched this subject, but why there are some trans that dislike drag? Like with India Willoughby that said to Courtney Act that she has a phobia of drag queens.  I love your work, you are such an inspiration."
"I really loved this one!"
"Mate, this is ace! Dinner tonight?"
"What if I'm a trans gamer ?"
"I object to the use of the term 'assigned' to describe someone's birth gender because it carries the implication that the gender put on the birth certificate was intentional, as oppose to being a response to observable phenomena. Now, this does occur sometimes, in the case of people who are born intersex and have their male genetalia removed to conform to a single-gender norm, but unless you were born intersex it isn't appropriate to use the term 'assigned' to describe your birth certificate gender, you were born that gender, accept it. But I also don't like the transgender movement in general because I perceive it as going against my own goals, which are to destroy the divider between what males and females are allowed to do/like, by forcing people who don't conform to their birth gender's norms into the other gender's camp, for example forcing tomboyish girls to transition to being boys or girlish boys to transition into being girls. While I recognize that this doesn't generally describe trans people there is enough anecdotal evidence that it happens to be concerning.   I'm also amused by the difference between how race and gender are treated, if I as a white woman decided to wear Asian style clothing, or heaven forbid dress in blackface because I have more in common with Asian or black culture than with white culture I would get yelled at for appropriating someone else's culture or trying to wear another race as a costume. On the other hand if I as a white woman decided to dress in men's clothes and call myself a man I would be celebrated as an emblem of diversity rather than told that men (or women) are not a costume that can just be taken off or put on (actually the right would tell me that). Seems contradictory and I think it's a bear worth wrestling with."

"As a cis-man who is really comfortable with his gender and wants to make the best of it, I always appreciate your content. It opens the mind, and that is always good as far as I am concerned.  Edit: BTW, I learned from female friends that a lot of cis-hetero women also get quite some hostility from radfems for being 'too feminine'. Of course that is different than a Trans experience, but maybe it helps to know that you are not alone in being targeted for your choice of gender expression."
"concern  No ads!!"
"I will never for the life of me comprehend that 'YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED LIKE I HAVE!' nonsense. I don't want anyone to suffer, be they cis, trans, or however they identify. So strange that that is what their idea of 'womanhood' boils down to."

"I was talking to a friend once on how familiar most TERFs arguments are, for example saying that trans women on women's bathroom is 'dangerous', I seem to recall another period in history when black people were considered 'dangerous' and forbidden to use the same bathrooms as white people.

"The issue with Terf is a lot of people use it without knowing the individual's politics. So instead of these same types yelling at you that you are a man-hater, lesbian, feminist, or dyke, they call you a terf. It's just another derogatory name for a woman."

"This addresses part of my worldview, but not well. I understand trans people presenting a more stereotypically gendered aesthetic in order to avoid being misgendered, but I personally dislike stereotypical gender presentations. I 'identify' as male only because I don't care enough about my personal gender aesthetic to work on altering it. I work with what I've got. Sometimes I wear makeup and more 'feminine' clothes depending on how I feel that day, but my body is too muscular, facial hair too dark and thick, and voice too deep to even consider presenting as female. Even if I did present as female, I would change nothing about my outward aesthetic, and prefer to be more on the neutral end, combining 'masculine' and 'feminine' style that I enjoy. I don't think abolishing gender roles means becoming human mayonnaise, the way you present it. I think it means that a man can wear dresses and makeup, a woman can wear flannel and grow out their chops, and they may continue to identify primarily as their sex from birth, no gender roles required. I support trans rights, but I'm conflicted because in some ways, extreme gender expression is diametrically opposed to my preference of abolishing roles and stereotypes historically associated with one's sex organs."

"another amazing video that hit on a lot of issues that essentially kept me from falling into trans-exclusionary radical feminism and keeps me out of it today, especially the ways TERFs talk about supposedly masculine physical qualities. like. i'm a cis woman. i have big 'manly' hands, i have hairy arms, i get hairs growing between my brows and under my chin and over my top lip. the way TERFs talk about the very same qualities in trans women tells me all i need to know about how shallow the 'radical' parts of their feminism really are. any radical feminism that excludes trans people, but especially trans women, is a scam."

"1. You are exceptional at breaking down issues in ways I find comprehensible and useful. 2. As an Australian I feel the need apologise for Germaine Greer (while knowing that's not my job ;-). She is an extraordinarily perplexing individual who is clearly brilliant and yet says staggeringly dumb and nasty stuff (sometimes while trying to make an interesting point) that is often explained away as 'lacking context' or 'overstepping the mark for rhetorical effect'...when she knows better and is actually just being a c**t for reasons I cannot comprehend. 3. Nice outfit. Especially the hat."
"I love you, Natalie. I’m a shallow post-boomer, old as the Flintstones, so much of this gender fluidity is news to me. I desperately want to understand, to advocate, and be utterly converted. You have made great strides toward this—in my own stupid heart. God you’re beautiful. Keep me thinking. Keep me questioning what I was raised with. I learned and believe in gender equality, and in this 21st century, so should we all. Keep talking, Natalie. Keep converting me. PS your costuming is amazing. And so are you. Thank you for posting. I’ve been looking for something from you for weeks. Stay gorgeous as you are."

"The gender critical argument for abolishing gender doesn't apply to all trans people, just those who call themselves feminist while presenting as a gender stereotype. Regardless, it has nothing to do with the validity of gender identity. Gender identity is precisely what it is. Identity has no bearing over whether you are a man or a woman. That is decided by your biology whether you like it or not. If you want to 'live as a woman' (whatever that means) then go ahead, but you don't really live as a woman unless you are a woman, because our lives revolve around our biology literally 100%  of the time"

"Man, I love Natalie's content, it's so dang engaging. Absolutely in love with her art direction as well"
"Natalie, can you devote an episode - or perhaps a series of them - to class and economics? There is a disturbing number of self-professed liberals who are enlightened on matters of race, gender, and sexuality, but who still harbor a profoundly reactionary view of those who aren't upwardly mobile.  You've done a remarkable job of getting people to reevaluate their views on sex, and I feel you could do the same for those who've succumbed to decades of neoliberal economic indoctrination."
"If this video came out half a year ago I would have had even better arguments at a discussion with a person who called herself a 'radical feminist'. But then again even if I did bring up pefect arguments it 'doesn't count because you are not a woman!'. And I was like 'Yeah that's the point. Standing up for trans people as a straight cis male is important. It's called 'solidarity'. Or in other words: not being an arse.'. And what the hell are 'man hands' supposed to be? Like I am quite confident in who I am but I wouldn't say that these are the cliché 'man hands'. And I don't think I know a single person with such hands. Makes me question why these people have such a focus on hands."
"That Plath quote is very good"
"Okay so. I never understood why other non-binary folks were so hesitant about you, Natalie, because you make a lot of great videos, but I kinda get it now. >.> Some of this was... Distasteful. Though I do think it was a great video aside from that."
"Thank you for sharing. I am deeply grateful for you. Amazing video, as always. <3 sending my love to you"
"Makes me wish there were a Trans-Parallel Feminism to discuss issues of sex and gender from the outsider-to-insider perspective that can really shine a light on things. TERF blowback strikes me as a reaction to trans women exploring feminine spaces, where a lot of female pain is explored/worked through/griped about free from a male presence. They're in a place where they need that space to be as wrong as possible. Some will grow out of it. Others won't. Some are happy when they hear about a Vagina Monologues production coming to town, and get pissed when it's shut down because some well-meaning idiot decided 'not all women have vaginas' was a good excuse to deprive cis women a show. It's that insistence on having new-to-womanhood talking points superseding long-held conversations about feminine pain that's causing such a shitstorm. Which, sadly, does happen and is absolute bullshit when it does. There ought to be a place for every woman in feminism. Save the zeal for misogyny, not each other."

"Fun fact about teapots. The original teapot was was supposed to drunken out of directly from the spout. While tea, as well as spouted vessels in general have been in use for thousands of years, tea was commonly prepared either directly in the vessel that would be used to consume the tea, or in vessel non specific to tea preparation. The Yixing pots are the first spouted pots intended for brewing tea, but the act pouring came later. For a time they let the tea drinker remove themselves from structures and ceromies surrounding tea consumption, because it was portable. It took a while for the teapot pour to find its way into Chinese styles of tea drinking, and the tea pour really took off because everyone thought it looked cool"
"MOMMY"
"I love Germaine Greer, but it was so disappointing to hear her call a trans-woman an 'it'. You lost me though at the Plath quote. I think she is merely stating that she isn't free; that for men she is always a woman first; I think that is a valid complaint on her part; by the way you joked about it, you make it seem like it's just about choices, which it is not."

"Your identity is based on subconsciously believing that some part of your personality is feminine and therefore makes you a 'woman.' You people are like sex realists. Radical feminists are not biological essentialists for believing there is a difference in the BODIES, CHROMOSOMES, AND REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS of men and women. Saying that there are male and female brains, claiming that men and women have different personalities, etc. is establishing a 'natural hierarchy', it's just like race realism because both have to do with BRAINS."
"I think it's important to acknowledge that that Sylvia Plath quote has some other layers to it. What she's describing as the ideal experience for her, the one all men supposedly have access to, is not accessible in the same way for men of color. Of course some women of color may feel very similar with her! I'm just saying that a black guy is not going to feel that he can 'travel west' uninhibited, and be anonymous in all bar rooms the same way. That's just... Not gonna be his experience when he's around non-black people. I think there's a problem we have in a lot of progressive spaces where we claim one type of response to oppression as a response only one group (or 'our' group, more often) ever have, when there's a lot more overlap than expected."

"I will never understand Terfs. My experiences as a cis woman if anything, just make me more empathic towards trans people. I know what it's like to be underestimated because you are 'other', since in patriarchal societies women are always 'other.' I also know what it's like to be forced to conform to sexist gender stereotypes and brainwashed into hating myself when I couldn't fit those boxes. You are my sister, you are beautiful, and you don't owe anyone an apology for being yourself. Great video once again. ❤️❤️❤️"
"Thanks for the video. Love the hat."
"I'm a straight cis woman, and I'm a feminist because I believe in equal opportunity and humane, respectful treatment for all. It's weird to me that some women are using feminism to shut people out; it's such a contradiction. I thought feminism was about knocking down walls, not building them."

"I will openly admit that I find myself aligned more with gender critical feminists. That being said, I think it is extremely important to listen to the view points of trans women, especially when those views directly oppose my own. As always, this was an excellent, informative, and engaging video."

"i'm sorry i missed your twitter post!   i guess i come to this from a completely different angle - less from the radfem side and more from fundamentally not understanding what gender is.   I suspect there are a lot of folks out there persuaded by gender critical because their entire experience of gender, as far as they can tell is what is externally imposed. I still don't understand what it could possibly mean to 'be' or 'feel like' any gender, and so the terf idea that actually, there is no gender, its just expectations and experiences in the world resonates way more than 'what if you woke up in a male body' as if that will somehow awaken my sense of gender, a concept i still don't understand.    I've always been off put by any generalizations of any gender anything, and found as little comfort in rad fem 'all males are violent, all women are safe' as 'i just know im a woman/man'. I don't know what it means to 'be a woman' and so the idea that maybe gender as a concept actually makes no sense, is appealing.   I think the best thing for me, personally, would be a further acknowledgement of that issue, and maybe that means more non-binary, or specifically agender/no gender whatever representation, i don't know. I can't imagine im that unique of a case.  What's helped me is just thinking of gender as a thing i don't have but other people do. No idea what it is, but I also don't understand why people want to have pet snakes, and yet, there are plenty of people who do.  But honestly, I feel like i can't even say if i do have a gender because i still don't know what that even means.  That said, I found terf spaces to be just as bad. Partially because I have no hatred for trans women and find that vitriol gross, and partially because gender stereotypes of all kinds make me deeply viserally uncomfortable. I have been told this could be a kind of non-binary dysphoria but i have no idea how i'd know. RadFems for all their critiques of the idea of female essence, it feels a lot like they have their own version of that that feels just as unwelcoming. They'll claim not to check your female scorecard if you have the right parts or chromosomes and then say things like 'all women know what its like to _____'"

"This video is a female-only space, but like any good little gay boy, I'm barging in exactly where I don't belong to voice an opinion nobody asked for and saying naughty words while I do so.  I'm convinced Natalie could peel the skin off a raw egg and keep it intact. This is because of the last three minutes of this video; she perfectly cracked the calcitic layers that mask bigotry and exposed its ugly fleshy core and giggled it in the camera for all to see (not unlike those TERF titties, damn). And the rest of the video was the regular cavort of her making high theatre where a lesser woman would make a rambling vlog with the viewer retention of drying paint, and it's fucking phenomenal.  I know you (claim to) hate representing the trans community, but I love your content. Because of it, I went from a #YesAllGamers level of apathy for trans rights to aggressively ass slapping and tongue clicking in support, so please dark mommy! Don't ween us off the teet just yet. <context: not overly serious>"
"TERF is not a slur, it's a *euphemism*. 'a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing.' TERF is a euphemism for 'intolerable cunt'... er, I mean 'Transphobe'."
"They didn't vote with their actions and voices?"
"I'm pretty sure cis people can understand the metaphor 'trapped in wrong body' if they try. Most of the teenagers experienced some form of dysphoria and though it's hard to actually equate trans experiences to cis one's feeling that you should be different and you don't belong the way you are isn't that foreign. I do understand that it's a stretch and cis kids mostly grow out of or able to cope, not to mention that unlike BDD, gender dysphoria isn't a mental illness, while trans people can struggle through their entire life, trying to match their inner self with their body's. But when I was a teen I had severe depression die to extreme BDD. I hated myself, even my voice and the way I walk. Not as I suppose to be. Not myself. Did pretty much everything, self harm, drugs, suicide attempts - even meds weren't as helpful as my parents thought. I still don't know how I finished high school, since most of my 16 to 18 is more of blur. And though my case's probably a bit extreme, most of my friends and people I know experienced something like that, one way or another. So it makes me believe that cis people just don't want to dig that deep and think to much about it. It's easier to say - boys are this way and no other, girls are this everything other is - perversion and sickness."
"Help me! I'm learning! And  it's not even a school topic!"
"Honestly, whenever TERFS say 'TERF IS A SLURRRRR!' I just reply with, 'you're right. The proper term is transmisogist.' Bc think abt it. They're hating on women for either being 'ugly' by patriarchal standards, or being/trying to be 'pretty' by patriarchal standards. Thereby placing transwomen into the same exact dichotomy cis women experience. But instead of men enforcing the patriarchy, it's women."
"Wow I highkey want excuse my beauty on a T-shirt"

"UGH YOUR MIND! it’s so powerful! no less than 10 minutes ago was i reading my new lesbian poetry and story story collection book, Dispatches From Lesbian America, and discovering an unfortunate amount of “gender critical” nonsense in it. and i sat there reading the bullshit thinking, “wow i wish contrapoints had a more updated and in-depth video slash critique on the “gender critical” ideology so my brain could absorb what the fuck is going on in these women’s heads.” literally 5 minutes later i got this notification... tl;dr i think God is real and her name is Natalie"
"You kick ass. Thanks."
"'Excuse my beauty, terf' oh we stan"
"I have to leave a comment I guess"
"I effing detest Germaine Greer, both because I disagree with her stance but also because of her general ignorance.  One of her comments in an interview along the lines of, transwomen can't be 'true' women because they've played their sports and done their engineering degree, shows her ignorance of what a women is to a tea.  According to her, I apparently fail as a women as I'm an engineer that plays sport...and apparently any woman who is unable to have periods, get pregnant or never had an abortion also fails."
"Damn, when you read about ppl referring to trans women as “it” made me tear up. It’s so fucked up."

"Happy Trans Visibility day!  Also on behalf of Australia, sorry for Germaine Greer."
"what gets me? Every single one of a TEF rational boils down to women are only valid for their reproductive organs and the last time I looked that was the patriarchal byline.  I was gat called for the first time at 9 being small with very curly hair.  I was beaten and spit on for being fem. I internalized the message woman did because I have never thought male even though I tried, god did I try. I laid awake at night and wanted god to either make me a woman or for me to just not wake up. If I was with people who knew me I was treated as a sissy, and away from those people I was the tomboy told to grow up get a dress, etc. I didn't learn to fake a male voice until I was 16, have never grown an Adams apple.   You want to know trans? It is a boy or girl who was raised as the opposite gender who was punished any time they didn't conform to that gender. Therefore those social norms you TERFs think you want to destroy? You're propping them up. I have no time for you, you're just another bigot and misogynist. You can't use the language rational and discourse and tactics of the Patriarchy and pretend you're not part of it."
"You are a nut. No one is separating males and females, they literally have different bodies, chromosomes, and reproductive systems. That's the point of words, of exclusivity, of explanations, etc. My god."

"Natalie is really getting into these hats ey"
"These 'Radfems' sound really hypocritical! They say 'femininity is a patriarchal construct women should look/act however they want!' But then they turn to trans women and say 'biology determines gender!'. When men told you your biology marked your behavior, you screamed sexist. But then you turn around with the same 'biology is your gender' nonsense! It's so hypocritical"
"Thank you for this. I am a cis woman and a feminist and I never understood or agreed with the radical feminist thought except for the two things you talked about - male socialisation and privilege. I think I only agreed with some radical feminists when they talked about the experience of reproductive oppression as integral to being a woman because I did experience that since I was a child. That and the constant threat of male violence that is signified to us in a million ways every day. These early formative experiences and my own socialisation as a woman, as what a 'woman' should be, has shaped me into who I am. Self effacing, unsure of my own voice, and someone who has to minimise herself to provide space for the men around her. So I think when I was reading radical feminist thought which wasn't rooted in transphobic lizard brain disgust (which is just the pits and I'm sorry you experience that everywhere) but talked about these aspects of affective experiences of violence that some transwomen didn't necessarily go through, throughout their lives. After watching this, I understand that better - I think cis women feel resentful because female spaces have been so hard to claim and hard won that to include experiences of womanhood that they don't relate to, especially when they see someone who experienced male socialisation while growing up. I think to make such spaces wider and include a type of gender oppression they themselves didn't experience,  requires a type of empathy and understanding which can be hard but still necessary. It boils down to this question right? Is womanhood all about an experience of pain? Like I've been experiencing misogyny since before I was born (they kill girl children in India through sex selective abortion + overwhelming son preference) and I could say, well, a transwoman has only begun to experience it since their transition. This is not to deny or dismiss their experiences of violence and dysphoria and all the things a transperson went through as a child. I think trans exclusionary radical feminism stems from that - I've been fucked over all my life and I made a space and now, why are you claiming it too? I could never resolve this for myself. I thought transphobia was fkn shit, but I also thought the radical feminists had a point. How do I hold these two viewpoints when agreeing with radical feminists (theoretically even), contributes to the active dehumanisation of transwomen? I didn't have an answer. Until I did, I opted to support transinclusive feminism but I didn't completely diss all radical feminists either because I felt I had to address these reservations I had. Which I now see is the stolen valour thread of things. (Listening to your experiences with terfs turns my stomach and it doesn't feel remotely feminist to engage in that kind of bullying and hate towards transpeople, I'm truly sorry)  Watching your video helped me answer that for myself. The experience of womanhood that is truly common to ciswomen and transwomen is the misogyny of the patriarchal​ world we inhabit. It might manifest differently, we might experience it differently but it comes from the same place. It's like well, we both have shitty lives coz we're women, maybe my experience of it began earlier than yours, so 'I'm the bigger victim here.' It's silly and childish but I can understand it. Now that I do, I feel like I can move past it too.   Being a ciswoman doesn't mean my individual experiences of misogyny or collective experiences of misogyny alone should define what what womanhood means. There is more to being a woman than the experience of violence I think. Comparing the degree and nature of violence that ciswomen and transwomen go through in some kind of victim Olympics serves no one especially not us. It serves the fucking patriarchy that brutalises the rest of us and upholds a toxic cis male masculinity at the apex of the pyramid of gender oppression. To be unable to pitch feminist tents bigger and not be able acknowledge the experience of transmisogyny as misogyny - I think I'm better than that. Thank you. God. I love your work and everything you do. So much love and power to you."

They'd definitely notice the stubble BURGEONING through pancake makeup and the hairy, sweaty, Neanderthal body revealing my pathetic attempt to appropriate wombynhood. Would they spew the same vitriol about 'fetishism' and 'entitlement' as they do at women like Natalie? Or would they sniff out the unique aroma of XX chromosomes and welcome me to the cisterhood?    ...scholars remain divided."
"Natalie during the years I spent as a teenager waiting to come of age and start hormones, gender critical philosophy was something I obsessed and agonized over. It fueled my excessive self doubt which was all I could think about to occupy my mind while living with this horrible dysphoria that I was powerless to treat medically. I started feeling angry that trans activists always wrote those ideas off, didn't engage with them, and didn't give them the consideration I thought they deserved. I felt left behind, left there to stew in a gruel of self doubt. I'm on hormones now and I've moved on from that phase of my life, but it's really healing to see a trans person speak to those deep anxieties I internalized.

I can at least comprehend where most bigotry comes from to some extent, but this specific type is so alien to me that I have struggled to do that. So this video is as always very educational."
"I want to thank you contra. I am not really someone who would fit in here due to my own personal philosophy about the world. That being said, my significant other of 2 years has come out to me as non-binary recently and i have been struggling to understand what was needed of me for support or what was entailed of this. I dont personally care about anyone as long as they dont infringe on any individual (i am an individualist). However, your perspectives on things, your rational and well explained points of view, and your overall willingness to engage with people in a respectful, kind manner (with some crude jokes) has helped me see into the world of what trans-people and women face. Its helped me try to understand my significant other better and helped me be there when i was needed as i dont know the lived experience of anything but of a bi-sexual mixed race male. Keep up the good work and keep speaking your opinion, its helpful to those of are not involved or are on the other side of this debate."

"was that theryn meyer reading the germaine greer bit?, I miss her, no matter her politics."
"I like the story of Stephanie Yellowhair. She passed away but her resilience and spirit live on. Stephanie reminds me of when I was growing up being savagely bullied. One day I wrote story to read aloud in class that all the boys were pursuing me wanting to kiss me. It was my Stephanie Yellowhair 'excuse my beauty' moment. Can you answer me question: What do you think about the defunding of the Vancouver rape relief woman center?"
"I literally just had a meltdown today over accidentally stumbling onto a TERF reddit and spent the whole evening getting myself out of that toxic mindspace (What if they're right? What if I really am just a dude with a creepy fetish? What if I'm just deluding myself into thinking I'd be happier as a woman?). And then along comes Natalie with a new video to cheer me up. Thank you for your service. <3"
"i got kicked out of a labour party facebook page and was branded a misogynist for disagreeing with a terf (or should i say pointing out where she was wrong and being a hypocrite). Look out because a lot of terfs have control of the progressive spaces.  I would say that misogynist has become a slur...the pejorative is one that is aimed at men in conversations with the hopes to silent that person based on their sex, not what they say."
"Wow, this really sounds like incels in some regards."
"Heck ye, another great video by Contra. Nice!"
"Wtf there's nothing wrong with video games uwu"
"Not gonna lie, thought you where a cis chick when I first saw you. Seems like your transition is taking very well and naturally. Glad for you we are all behind you CP!"
"I'm cis, and reading terf rhetoric never made me doubt trans people, but it DID make me doubt whether or not I was a woman bc whenever they wrote about their version of womanhood, I was like 'wtf is that' even tho I like...have a great and strong relationship with my own womanhood."
"Always loving your content!!!"
"Maybe, not all trans women knows how the oppression cis women suffered as growing up is like, but that doesn't make them less of a woman if now they do live as women. Cis women also don't know how trans women suffered, so, whatever, from now on  let's all suffer together, girls! (,:"
"So many things to love in this video. Great job explaining the ideological turf war 😉 going on between certain feminists and trans-women, but I suspect you’re probably correct about it all coming down to the phobic, amygdala-driven “ick factor” at the end of the day, which is really quite a sad thing."

"Admit it, the Golden One's comment about you being a slaneeshi demon inspired this new character.  And I love it <3"
"The only objection I have to the term 'TERF' is that it includes 'feminist.' They're not feminists. They're the worst kind of misogynist."
"You are so elegant and lovely and this video was so we'll executed and powerful. Wonderful job discussing this topic."
"Thank you so much for this video. I was torturing myself by scrolling through r/gendercritical because, well, when you feel like shit, you want to feel shittier. This felt like I was punching back, even if it was vicariously through you."
"‘this is a female only video’ me, a trans man: God dammit"
"I’ll say “as a traaaaans maaaaan” that it’s “accepted” that trans man understood growing up as a woman but I (who didn’t realize I was trans until a few years ago so it’s not like I knew along) didn’t experience childhood as a woman. I experienced childhood as an it. Because I was raised as a girl but it never fit. Now I’m also in a position where I was never catcalled as a young person and god knows I don’t identify with cis men’s experiences of childhood but I personally experienced  that weird purgatory. Idk again pour out the nuance liquor because we have to understand every single trans person processes their identity through childhood in a very different way"

"150 Cincinnatians watched this video."
"So 15 years ago, my university's nascent FemSoc had a discussion on whether or not to allow male members... wait, no, not like that *sigh*  Now, I really value a man-free space, because a couple of men have been majorly shitty  to me and many men have been minorly shitty to me. However, I didn't feel I could argue in favour of excluding men because I didn't want to exclude non-binary people or start gate-keeping transitioning people. Also, it wasn't intended specifically as a space for survivors of male violence, and individual men might add value to FemSoc and, like, be better people for joining. And we did welcome the dudes, and it was good.  It was a loss, in some ways, to not have a nice relaxing, female-only space, but I told myself 'well, trans women have it worse than cis women, so take the hit.' (NB trans women are women, I never doubted it or implied otherwise, but the practicalities of excluding men *would* cause problems for non-passing trans women.)  Maybe this comment reads like I want a cookie for my wokeness, and maybe I do want a cookie, but, y'know, mostly what I want is to yell I'VE GOT FUCLING PTSD FROM WHAT SHITTY MEN DID TO ME AND I MANAGED NOT TO BE A TOTAL SHITGIBBON, SO WHAT'S EVERYONE ELSE'S PROBLEM, HUH? But maybe that's not helpful. Fuck it, idk.   It's hard to be eloquent and reasonable and meet people where they are, isn't it? I'm glad we've got Dark Mother making it look easy."

"Transpeople are more oppressed than TERFS, who's privileged now? #terfsowned  Another classic ContraPoints video. Nice."
"Thank you for this video. This really has addressed the issues I had a youngin (before I heard of the term gender critical) a decade ago.  People need to watch this."
"All I know is that if your arguments start sounding similar to the alt-right and MRA assholes there's something wrong with your argument.   Just let people be who they are, that's my motto."
"The thing that gets me about TERF's is that because there is that guise of feminism to some which may make these ideas more attractive to some. I'm glad that I've mostly found ways to mass block them on some platforms I'm on to avoid the comments and mass reporting."
"you are amazing!"
"I was gonna make a smart comment about how we need more solidarity between gnc cis woman and trans women and recognize that gnc trans women exist but all I can say is WE 👏 DO 👏 STAN 👏 KIM 👏"
"I kinda have to ask here, but how do we move forward. How do move towards a more socially just, equitable society? or like are we all doomed?"
"Yasss amazing episode queen 😍"
"I think for a lot of feminist who at least entertain Terf ideas is just a lack of understanding. This is how I felt most of my life and still at least partly feel. When I was about 12 I first heard about Trans people and in my mind gender was always something that just did not exist. So since brain sex doesn't exist how can anybody be born in the wrong body? This is something you also pointed out but your answer was sadly still dissatisfing to me. What probably separates me from Terfs is that I think it's a plain lack of understanding. A mistake on my side. I would also never misgender or invalidate the identity of any Trans person. I just can't bring my feminist believes into cohesion with the existance of Trans people. But Trans people do exist I see it right in front of me. It's very clear to me that I'm wrong but I still don't fully get it. I think part of it is because cis woman and trans woman while experiencing similar oppression in some aspects have vastly different experiences in others (as you pointed out as well). I for example always deeply hated the reproductive aspect of my body (not my female body as a whole though) while many trans woman want a female body and rightfully so to match their gender identity"
"27:19 this made me tear up. Literally just a 50 year old woman enjoying her life, and this terf is mocking her with such malice. Absolutely disgusting."

"transmeds don't think that you need extreme dysphoria or to hate your body, nor do they hate nonbinary people. they just think that you need some form of dysphoria, whether it's social or body, major or minor, since some people seem to think that being gender nonconforming is being trans, especially on tumblr, and it's quite annoying."

"I was thinking, just this morning, that it would be nice to have a new Contra Points video to listen to at work. And as soon as I get home, I find something new to throw up on the TV and enjoy."
"Gawd I love those hats, and the brain they decorate. Thank-you for more amazing insights and translations."
"Awesome video girl. You're amazing. I do have a confession to make... I was once a 'terf'. Well not when the term got popular, but I was incredibly bigoted to transgender. Hell I was a reactionary. But its because of you that I've critically assessed my beliefs and view points, and left my anti sjw reactionary ways. Thank you."
"xxtra biological today, absolutely riveting.  also when terfs call trans men lost lesbians despite a lot of us being mlm in some shape or form?? Im personally gay, so...  One more thing, i would absolutely love to see you touch the topic of truscums/transmedicalists again one day if you ever feel like it can be something you'd like to visit more in depth. I'm something they would call 'a valid tran' and yet theres constant gross transphobia and misgendering thrown at me simply because I have empathy for my trans nb, trans gnc, and trans siblings that just straight up dont have the same experience as I do, or don't have the same concept of gender and dysphoria as me. And oh gender-non-specific child, do they hate that!"
"i love this video so much  the only concern that i have is labeling transphobia as 'something from the lizard brain' cuz i think it's socialized, not an inherently biological thing, i hope i'm not misunderstanding your points but that's what it read like to me"
"❤❤❤"
"I didn't want to say anything at first because it might distract from the actual point, but that boob contour is fucking amazing."
"See this is how you excel.  You try to talk with your inner gender critical feminist, wheras after one second of talking with my...... Uh i guess just inner transphobic cis man, i would have plunged my hand into my chest, ripped him out, and died laughing.  Then again I am also a aforementioned cis (?) man, so it's not like I would be risking much by not talking, except metaphorically dying..... wait."
"Blue & white ceramics FTW!"
"Kim Petras is such a good singer and icon. Ultimate respect."
"'lizard brain response' I guess is works for racism & class too"
"I'm restraining myself to call this your Grand opus, but I actually think it might be. It's so goddamn good, both thoroughly funny and insightful."

"The cinematography is great in here.  It's a big steep up, in my opinion."
"The FF music"
"On the idea of 'pregnant people' and 'menstruaters' also invalidates people who can't do just that. I mean, I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, quite common in a lot of people w/ vaginas) which makes it harder for me to have a period or get pregnant. I mean, I know gender wise I'm not a woman, but because I still look feminine enough that I still face a lot of issues women face. But also, the term is pretty dehumanising to just about anyone. I mean 'menstruaters' I get where they're coming from, but like come on."
"Me, shopping in the market place of ideas: Pardon, m'am, may I have 2 loaves???"

"Why do you feel your day is ruined if people misinterpret you for a male? I liked how you gave no fucks about how others define you when you started transitioning.  I know it’s easier said than done, but try not to get upset about it. Be the undefined and unique human being that you are, unapologetically 😉"
"I can't remember how I ended up on this channel, but I have throughly enjoyed each and every one of the videos I've watched. I subscribed and clicked the bell to be notified. I'm a cis gender man, and though I'm not the 'target audience', these videos are great to inform myself of a different perspective that before I had not even considered. And Natalie being a great storyteller only helps even more."

"Outstanding video, and wonderful breakdown of the most popular arguments."
"I can't believe you are Skyline Critical, Canceled Contra, CANCELED"
"To be fair, I think there is an extra problem in Concern 4 in relatively good parts of the UK.  Passing versus politeness. I've got a friend (who I'm more distant from nowadays) who was rather anti-trans, and who I've been trying to debate for a while. They worked in a garden centre and said that there were multiple trans women who didn't pass but who they had to be polite to. In addition my community has a seemingly above average number of eccentric people who are just accepted and so it's hard to judge whether responses received are due to actual passing or accepting/being polite to the difference. However this kinda makes us a haven for Enbies...  Basically look up a map of areas that didn't vote for Brexit and are in the countryside. They are generally the places that are nice to live :)"
"Bless you"
"Ogod eskeetamine has claimed another victim  15:06  I wonder if the effectiveness of this regal posture over the binary small mindedness that logic cant touch means logic itself is dying to the aesthetic empowered by the quantum age and is it ironic or paradoxical to wonder this 🤔"

"I don't disagree with everything in this video, and I am not going to comment on your experience of being a trans-woman, but I wanted to point out something I think would be helpful."
"I've met people who insist that I am not a woman because of I 'never experienced girlhood' and thus I couldn't possibly know what its like to be repressed like girls are."
""
"That is true, I have not experienced what it's like to grow up as a girl, but I have a pretty powerful retort."
""
"See, the thing about me and how I was raised was as follows."
""
"1: I was raised to be a ultra conservative Jehovah's witness. I don't think anyone would argue that the the Jehovah's witnesses are not repressive."
"2: I hated being a boy, and this is an experience that I think a lot of trans-women have experienced. I was repressed when I wanted to wear girls clothes and was utterly humiliated when I asked at a very young age."
""
"Some just write these off, but its kinda hard to write off number 3 which is a major bomb shell."
""
"3: I was a sex slave as a child. Brutalized when I tried to fight it, demeaned verbally before, during, and after my being raped. I wasn't allowed to so much as defend myself from harm or I would be hurt more."
""
"Later in life when I first talking about being transgender this was played against me, I actually had someone say 'Oh look this dude's cousin had such a big dick it made him want to be a girl'"
""
"So in my mind, no, transwomen were not raised as girls and can't possibly be understand what it was like to be treated like young girls are, but cis women can't know what its like to be a transwoman, and most of them don't know what its like to be demeaned in the way that I was."
""
"So they can fuck right off as far as I'm concerned."
""
"I don't believe that there is significant differences in the brains of boys and girls (there are some and trans people tend to have structural differences more akin to the gender they identify with), but I do believe that transwomen were programmed to be women, and transmen the opposite, and this was likely a natural process that went nuts."

"Also - Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. That’s why it’s pretty much useless to debate with these transphobic scumbaggy TERF’s.   O ContraPoints, you are getting more beautiful and lovable with every video. #YesAllGamers"
"your titties though the inner terf monologue rattled my chromosomes... the hormones be workin ;)"
"!!STRAIGHT WHITE MAN ALERT!!!   Thank you for making your videos. All of them. One of the issues that frustrate me is that I want to accept and want to understand the trans / non-binary community as a whole, but if I don't immediately understand a few terms, or need clarification on something without denying it exists, I am ridiculed and considered someone who hates them. I mean I do, but I hate everyone. Is this true equality? These are all fairly new topics and even in the time I tried to learn this culture, or identity, or insert correct term that shows a genuine effort to understand something I have no base of knowledge in, you introduced like 5 new terms I hadn't even heard of. Thank you for that.   Regardless, I don't want you to think that you have an echo chamber and it's the same people watching your videos and praising you on your high quality videos. You've helped me see a new side I wasn't getting exposed to. It takes a certain level of awareness and analytics to see both view points and see the merits of both without either getting deeply offended and raging or dismissing it outright. Us centrist assholes really appreciate it. I'd donate or help in some way, but being this centrist filth you describe me as is great for my bank account. Hooray for monetary independence. I'm going to go back to drinking and thinking I'm funny. Thank you for trying to explain this shit to a normie like me.  I know the few trans and non binary people I know appreciate it.    PS: I know you said you haven't gotten any surgery. but your tits look damn good for a stick thin trans girl. Well done."

"This man's delusion is something serious."
"this is really helpful. I dont want to be rude to my trans friends by asking questions, and videos like this clear up a lot of smaller questions. Growing up in the midwest being exposed to this feels like basic education I never got."

"YOUR MIND IS SO POWERFUL !!!"
"10:30 I think I can relate to an extent. I'm still trying to figure out if I am Cis or NB but as someone who has presented as a cis woman, while i once shunned the trappings of femininity, I have begun to cling to them after experiencing a great deal of unacceptance as I was. I wasnt boy or butch enough to be seen as legitimately queer with my curves but I wasnt refined,polite or....hairless and polished enough to be seen as a good woman. It led me to think 'fuck gender,' until I learned that I should embrace myself whatever my gender or whatever I am as a woman. I only am trying to fit the conventional idea of ideal woman for the sake of avoiding derision and loss of opportunities. I feel ashamed but some of the rituals are a bit cathartic."
"I really cannot even express just how freaking awful it feels to just see nazi-ass Bolsonaro in this video, knowing what he is and represents, and knowing just how similar his speech is to the speech of TERFs. I can't speak for the american experience, but for me, it's just so clear that 'Gender Critical Feminism' is just a way to use a mask of feminism in order to condone to literal murder. This video was necessary, because, and speaking from experience, micro-aggressions and exclusionary ideologies are just another step towards hate crimes, and my god, we do need to know who our racists and transphobes are, now more than ever."

Posture is improving and bought myself clothes in a physical store instead of online for the first time recently, despite having already been on hormones for almost a year(and finally getting on those after 6 years of debating...). It's rough, but continuing to work on it. Great video as always, you've been an inspiration in my own transition."
"Theryn did a good TERF impersonation,  but the in-video comradery made me feel a new form of jealousy. (Contra flexing that she has friends irl.)  I hope, 'the athletic sports question' is going to be in one for the coming videos,  (good luck.)"

"In the early 1990s, this feminist framework was termed 'biological essentialism' and was, at the time, considered was a form of radical feminism theory that had inverted itself and become patriarchal. At the time, the proponents were actually trying to attack the 'theft' of femininity promised by ... technology (the advancing reproductive science that seemed to be on the threshold of exo-wombs, embracing surrogacy, etc) and ... gay men (who were seen as, among a lot of other things, invading public consciousness space/dollars/political attention with their advocacy for civil and human rights, including the right to have families, adopt children, etc).  Third wave academic, activist, and intersectional feminists were exceptionally critical of this, seeing the recycling of language that had been used in the 80s to try and throw Black feminisms, Marxist and class-based feminisms, lesbianism and other expressions of feminism under the bus to preserve the limited advances that 'acceptable' feminism in Reagan-era white suburban USA had achieved. It was no coincidence at the time that the same women who had, only five years before had stood arm-in-arm with Republican televangelists in a crusade against sex-workers and pornography, or who had derided lesbian seperatist collectives as 'useless' (due to their 'rejection' of their biological purpose - i.e. squeezing out white babies for Jesus and America) were now rebranding themselves in the tropes of sacred womanhood."

"The “concern” I see most often has to do with community members who are sexual predators that the community won’t disavow out of solidarity for the community.  Thank you so much for taking the time to make this, i love all of your videos and i was wondering if you’d ever address terfs on a real level. I’m agender so I teeter around the “abolish gender” idea a lot but I do agree that it is utopian. I’ve always been for breaking down gender barriers and letting people express themselves however they liked."

"I love your videos. Here's a serious question: Is there any way that a lifelong 'chaser' (who is aware of the fact that the objects of his desire are generally far less privileged than he) can continue to feel that desire, and continue to do what he most longs to do in the world, without being considered morally deformed?"

"SLAY. Keep slaying."
"That is one of the biggest issues I have with feminism. Coming from a conservative, narrow-minded background I really WANTED feminism to be the answer to everything, a breath of fresh air. Alas, there is always a dark side to every moon. I will never agree to this way of thinking about transgender people. Fun fact- last year after a super long flight and having a raging fever and a flu I got into a super verbally-aggressive debate with a co-worker who had the audacity to call a transgender woman who we met during that trip 'a monster'. Aparently my typical non-confrontational nature went out of the window and I gave a passionate speech even though I was so out of it due to fever I barely remember it."

"As a cis-gendered feminine gay guy who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, let me just say that even cis-guys aren't always socialized as men! I spent most of my childhood around girls and adopting feminine mannerisms all because I couldn't handle being around other boys and they couldn't handle being around me!  I had no choice, but to hang out with the girls because at least my mannerisms didn't get me beat up, though that doesn't mean that I was completely accepted by the girls, either, and it doesn't mean that I wasn't still pressured to act more like a guy my entire life. Even to this day, I identify as a cis-gendered male, but, I don't feel comfortable with the social role of manhood. If you asked if I felt like a boy or a male, then yes, but a man, absolutely not!"

"'Many trans women were feminine and queer before they transitioned, and have always experienced a kind of fem-phobia that is rooted in misogyny.'  God yes. This is why I didn't figure out my gender until I was an adult, instead of right when I hit puberty when the symptoms of dysphoria first started. Displaying any femininity at all, even unintentionally, would get me shit on by my entire peer group, so I just didn't explore my feminine side. I couldn't realize how good it felt to be feminine, because I was never allowed to try it out. This kept me in my egg for at least 5 extra years. I already had a lot of resentment towards my grade school experience and classmates, but this makes it so much more intense. I'd redo my life from 5th grade in a heartbeat if I got the chance. I could have started blockers and avoided the worst of male puberty if I had crushed all those toxicly-masculine shitheads instead of letting them walk all over me."
"33 minutes on Gender and not one mention of Judith Butler Boo!"
"Wonderful work.  While I thought that the 'metaphysics' question was brushed aside too quickly, what came next was key: the moment when you talked about using the language of 'femininity' in order to be heard, to be seen -- but also, as you put it, in order to avoid having a shitty day.  Why not trade in ''''stereotypes'''' for personal and emotional reasons?  The world is hard enough, without having to deal with the things that don't matter.  Of course, trading in ''''''steroeotypes'''''' is what most people do, and we don't always find it so appealing.  The ethics of GUY-ville demands a lot of masculine conformity, and I bet for many boys, it's just easier to give it, in order to be seen.  But are the troubles of enforced (or toxic, ugh) masculinity exchangeable for comfort, no matter how deserved?   I suspect your answer came in a previous video -- raising issue not just of performance, but of masquerade.  In other words, is the price of using the language of femininity for security, visibility, comfort offset my putting lots of scare quotes around each word?"
"I appreciate the jab at Cincinnati chili. I've been living in this godforsaken city for five years now and Skyline chili might be the most nauseating thing ever invented since the taint.  How to make Cincinnati chili: start with a can of Hormel chili, add half a cup of water, four cloves, two allspice berries, and a stick of cinnamon.  Pulse on high until combined.  Slap some spaghetti in a hot dog bun, spoon over chili, and top with a mound of shitty grated cheddar chese.  Bone ape tit, you guys!"

"Hey Natalie! First of all I have to say that I write this as someone who would be considered/has been called a TERF. I mildly engage in radfem tumblr, I read Sheila Jeffreys, and I mostly agree with a lot of concerns around trans issues that radfems have. Please don't block me yet, I am trying to engage in a #conversation. I love your videos, I am subscribed to your channel and while I don't agree with a lot of the points you make (particularly in videos like this or the other one about TERFs) I sympathize with them and understand where you're coming from. As someone who's been in the community, me and the radfems I am close with agree that most women who identify as such right now are just viciously transphobic, and too uncomfortable with the blurring of male and female identities for people who claim to be for 'abolishing gender'. Maybe these are the women who are the most vocal, or who interact with trans women the most, because they are moved by hate and not love. But I personally, like many others, understand the struggle of trans people (there are trans men and detransitoned people in the radfem community too) and I wish for there to be full rights and acceptance for them.  But I just don't understand why it should be at the expense of the women's rights movement.  I guess you personally are not against the celebration of the female body (the menstruator body?), but you can't deny that so many trans people and allies are. We've reached a point where vaguely politicized (cis) women are telling you that political demonstrations and art centering vulvas, uteri or menstruation are inherently transphobic and should be shut down. I really can't wrap my head around US being called the bigots in a situation where women's bodies are being erased.  Another issue that concerns me is the blatant lesbophobia and erasing of lesbian's desires. I can't tell you how many awful rapey comments I've read about this issue, how since dicks and maleness are entirely unrelated lesbians are transphobic for not wanting to be around them. Yeah, you can claim that that is not true and trans women *actually* mean blah blah blah, but there's so so many trans activists who genuinely think like that, and it has driven lesbian friends to deep depression, trauma about interacting with their much needed queer communities and self-hatred.  But my biggest concern is with the erasing of the very stuff that makes the patriarchy. Throughout history, and now specially in the third world, being born female is a death sentence. They don't ask you how you identify before mutilating (actually mutilating) your body in various ways, or marrying you to a man four times your age when you are a child, or before you suffer domestic violence in hands of the men in your family. These are thing that have been happening since the beginnings of society, and are still happening right now. Each second, in each country, there's a girl or a woman suffering because she was born female. I am extremely concerned with patriarchy's definition being changed to 'people who identify as men oppressing people who identify as women', or any other erasure of what this system of terrorism against female-bodied people is.  We are not a hate group, but we cannot trust trans activism if we have to ignore all of this. I don't think either of us is going to change our minds, but I wanted you to read about these issues that maybe are not voiced as loudly as the blatant transphobia some women call feminism. And I wish you would empathize with the things we are worried about, because it seems like nobody really cares about women, particularly lesbians, and what we have to say about our own oppression. As I said, I really admire you and your work, and I wish you a good life. I don't expect or want a response, but I didn't want these things to be left unsaid. Thank you if you read all the way.  PD.: Compulsory 'English is not my first language, sorry if I made any mistakes and please know that I probably didn't fully express myself as well as I wanted to' clarification."

"A couple years ago I fell hook, line and sinker for the TERF discourse. I was in a very dangerous position, mostly because I went through a process of accepting new ideas uncritically when it came to feminism (the more radical, the better). It was mostly harmless until the TERFs came along. And while I dropped their line of thinking in about two seconds I always think about how lucky I am to have found my way out. I don't know how far I'd have sunk and how that would affect who I am today.  Your work is vital, Natalie. And I know you can change the minds of those who got lost in this hate speech, like I almost did."

"I actually discovered the thing that unites both cis and transwomen. It's the shits. Cis women get the shits during their period due to muscle cramps being in the same general area as their colon. Transwomen will sometimes experience phantom cramps due to the hormones they take, and thus, the shits. Therefore, we are all united in womanhood due to the period shits. Hallelujah everybody."

"Ex libfem here. Natalie, I really respect you and the work you do but I can’t support trans ideology anymore. In the last six months or so I really started engaging with gender critical feminism. I felt so guilty at first because I had been taught that by reading radfem material I was a traitorous hateful bigot. But the more I read the more it made sense to me. I wholeheartedly support gender non-conforming people but I just can’t bring myself to pretend any more that my experience is something people can identify into. To me, womanhood is a set of biological and social realities (of which childhood socialization is a a major component). Saying otherwise reduces it to just an abstract feeling and I’m not okay with that."
"This video is amazing. Always so funny and smart, and just great information. This is so real and I appreciate you taking the effort."
"I know it's oddly specific but since it's a topic often brought up by -conservatives- pretty much anyone: what do you think about trans-women competing against (and out-performing) cis-women in sports?"

"MY MUM NEEDS TO SEE THIS"
"I think what you do here is important. Thanks for it. Hopefully not too out of context to mention, but you said in one video that you're after converts and reading your comments section always makes me feel detached from your audience as somewhere in between 'yass queen mother' and ...[ the rest ]... Watching your work is challenging because the middle of the road has been so comfortable for so long. I won't ask you to join my podcast and hopefully that makes up for any cringe, but I love your channel and the level of work and heart you put into it.  That's it, I guess. Have a good night!"

"I love your channel so much because every video is so well made, you’re genuinely funny, you’re logical and you make sense, and especially because I don’t always agree with you. I really enjoy people that I don’t agree with and don’t yell at me. Alternate perspectives with good reasoning are very good to listen to, not as a means to agree with a new opinion, but to tweak my own."
"Can I just say, as a biological woman who could be identified as an anti feminist, I absolutely adore your videos. As eloquent as always, I love watching even when I disagree."
"WHAT!!! How DARE you bad-mouth Cincinnati Chili!"
"TERFs, aside from being transphobes, also reduce the experience of womanhood to reproductive issues and genitalia, which excludes so many cis women and just seems like...really bad feminism"
"You look like the shemales that do pornography"
"“Why can’t I just call myself a woman?!” “You can.” That, that right there.  You can. If you are secure enough in who you are you can and if someone else wants to call themselves a woman it shouldn’t really destroy the very fabric of your being. I’m talking about Cis ppl with this. It’s hard to articulate in a comment but I often feel like that when seeing other cis ppl like myself talk about the change in language or having to adjust and “well I can’t call myself that anymore if it includes THEM!” and to me it’s just if you are so sure in your identity as a woman or whatever you identify as then it shouldn’t bother you. Especially when it doesn’t erase you. You are a people right? You can get pregnant? Then you are a person who can get pregnant.  I hope this comes through like I said it’s hard to articulate this in a comment but that point right there I loved."

"If this is the way that society thinks then we deserve extinction. Imagine having no problems and such a privileged life that you literally have to make up a pretend world with make believe rules where you have to imagine that you belong to a protected class because you're special. To be perfectly honest I really don't care but the whole way of thinking, 'do as thou wilt', is literally demonic and only leads to misery and despair."
"This is easily your most ignorant video. Masculinity and Femininity are not patriarchal constructs. They exist because of biology and the science is clear on this. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species and there are parallels between masculinity and femininity in every culture on Earth. Also, womanhood isn’t oppressive. There is nothing wrong with womanhood and dressing girly and wearing makeup and having nails. This feminist idea that womanhood = bad and we should all be more like men is sexist and toxic to girls everywhere. Lastly, if you turly want people to be free then that’s only going to INCREASE biological differences between men and women not make them go away. The more egalitarian a country is the more different the men and women in that country become."

"I found the section about the TERF version of 'Abolish Gender' super interesting. AS AN AGENDER ENBY, I often find myself chanting the same slogan when feeling slighted and inarticulate and weary. The difference being that I actually do mean it in good faith, and not to eliminate trans people.  Like, I'm disappointed they've weaponized an enby critique of institutional and legal gender's ramifications on gender variance by claiming it's about shaming trans people's even slightly gendered presentations.   Get your own darkness, TERFs!"
"As a non-binary person, I am deeply saddened by your take on gender abolishment, and the stream of comments (that I've mostly avoided) it has sparked complaining about people who with to live outside the construct of gender. There are some truly transphobic comments on this video that believe themselves validated by your opinion. You said yourself that there is no blue brain and pink brain. So why then, must our genitals be gendered? Why do  we signal to others what our genitals are and go around assuming the junk of others? Is it too much to ask for more people to be conscious of their assumptions and avoid them?  Gender is a construct of society, a lens that covers everything we see and do. Everything we study. We force the roles of female and male on plants, on insects, and asexual organisms. We force it on other people, and on ourselves. This construct of gender permeates every aspect  of human life and some people are sick of it. Of course you can't abolish gender in the complete sense. But we can start looking at things without the tint of gender on the lens. We can start looking at ourselves that way. And there is freedom in that. I expect this post to get all kinda of arguments and comments and I'm telling y'all right now I'm not reading them. I just hope Contra is able to open her mind on this a bit. This video breaks my heart and I know its going to hurt a lot of others too."
"We have been gifted with yet another masterpiece"
"aS a CiS wOmAn, i'd add not all childhood experiences of ~womanhood related oppression are universal either... i was never catcalled as a child. in fact, i don't get catcalled at all. i don't know why, but my mother never gets catcalled either. so we avoided having to run that particular gauntlet, but no one would accuse us of not being real women. not to mention there are cis women who don't menstruate, can't get pregnant, etc... trying to demarcate womanhood in this way is an exercise in futility. there are as many experiences of womanhood as there are women   anyway, great work as always. my 58 year old mom was asking me what a terf is recently and she loves your videos so i sent this one right along. she's never been transphobic per se, but she was pretty out of the loop re: gender and sexuality issues for a long time and your videos are a great resource for her (and me!)"

"Your majesty, I must say, you are popping in this vid. I swear, you get more ravishing every day, my queen.  That said, it's hard for me to give TERFs the benefit of a doubt. I tried to argue with a TERF in good faith and she took that as an opportunity to stomp on me. Calling me a closeted gay just because I said I had no problem with dating trans women. She also accused me of trying to erase her lesbianism by 'demanding' she be open to dating trans women (which I didn't, to be clear)."

"As someone who is a trans man, I still identify with a lot of the social problems that trans woman face. Which is this notion of not being manly enough, that my manhood is questioned because I am an unorthodox trans man. In which that because if my height and stature, I am not going to go out and achieve the impossible which is the hulking tall muscular man  [all though he exist just like the rad fem in my head space] - instead of being defeminized as these Terfs try to defeminize trans woman, I am often emasculated because I am not a man's view of manhood all though ironically a lot of these insecure men who question my manhood aren't the stereotypical ideal of manhood either. I have heard men question my manhood have more feminine cadence than I do. Self hating trans or gay men, I wonder. And it's infuriating as a trans man because I don't get the perks of male privileged because  I am emasculated out of it. And I don't get the privileges of womanhood either. A lot of us trans man, even when we are passing often feel like that Monster Gender Identity because get no solidarity from either gender. So that's how I identify with this video."

"I love you, you helped escape the antisjw sphere that I called my political home on youtube. You and many others really helped see the light."
"Abolishing gender doesn't mean that we all should be R2D2. You can still be masculine, feminine or whatever is your aesthetic it  just wouldn't be determined by your genitals.  And to call it a utopian project is not fair. Not that long ago people thought that convincing society to accept that men can be women is utopian project.  Imagine if you used all your influence and charisma to say 'fuck gender roles, i can dress and act however i want' With time and more exposure to gender non-conforming people society will understand that being born with a penis doesn't mean that you're aggressive and with no fashion sense and will stop believing in this restrictive roles. But we need you to stop claiming that because you're feminine - you're a woman. You low key admitted that you're throwing everyone under the bus, because abolishing gender is too hard, so you might as well make yourself comfortable even at the price of reinforsing those restrictive roles."

In that moment, face-to-face with someone who was so engaging and kind, how the hell could one not treat them with respect and understanding? By the end of the conversation, there was no question that I had met a fellow woman, even if they were “clockable” as male-to-female at that time. I wonder how many TERFS would double down on their bigotry in a moment like that, and how many would buckle to the reality that - lo and behold!!! - Trans people are people too!!! and change their own mind and demeanor. At the end of the day, it takes a lot more mental energy to dehumanize people you don’t know than to just stay in your goddamn lane, sweaty. Then again, maybe I’m assuming cis women are all sensitive, caring people deep-down with the inability to be hateful cunts and now I’M problematic."
"What I find so interesting is that these 'gender critical people' are constantly screaming 'abolish gender!' but then make a big deal out of their womanhood. I was actually talking to a terf the other day because I was just so curious what one of them would actually say to me, and she constantly claimed to 'protect women' and said she 'loved her radfem sisters'. Why, if she wants to 'abolish gender' does she feel such a need to protect women, and refers to the people around her as sisters? She's favoring them on terms of a concept she doesnt even want to exist!   Also loved the bit that proved that abolishing gender is impossible lmao! I told this girl that this would be impossible and she legit said 'I wanna fight for it even if it's impossible right now!!' my friend and I had an awesome time laughing at that one for sure"

"We Cincinnatians are people too"
"As a cis lesbian, one thing I’ve always thought was strange about the TERF argument is the idea that there’s one unifying experience that makes you a woman. Womanhood is a vast, diverse set of experiences that can’t really be boiled down to “women are oppressed for having two X chromosomes”, even among cis women. What being a woman means varies by race, class, sexuality, culture, disability, and a whole host of other things. OF COURSE trans women are going to experience misogyny differently from the way cis women experience it, because there isn’t a solid “female experience” to begin with.   As a lesbian, my experiences with misogyny are going to be different from a straight woman’s experiences with misogyny. But I don’t hear TERFs trying to claim that I’m not a “real woman” because I don’t have to deal with IPV from men."

"I always explain this to people that have questions about transgenderism: it's not that I necessarily despise all femenine clothing, but no one will ever believe me if I say I indentify as a man if I'm wearing girly clothing and furthermore they'll invalidate me, there's a lot of clothes I love but I don't use because I'm desperate for being seen as a man for others and I know the best way to do that is using the less feminine looking clothing I can possibly accomplish, because as you said, if someone(in my case) calls me 'miss', they are going to ruin my day (this is all in my personal experience ofc)"

It's a lot easier to be criticized by your enemies--fuck 'em--than to be criticized by the people who are supporting you, and I've done myself a lot of damage silencing anything that doesn't fit the current political messaging."

"Love this. Do wanna point out though that radfems aren't all terfs. I'm a radical feminist and I've  been a terf in the past but you can be in that movement without engaging in bigotry. I do wanna raise another concern that I have- although Natalie personally disagrees with this, it IS only women being targeted with gender neutrality. Women's bathrooms become the gender neutral bathrooms, women's words get replaced, women get their spaces removed. It honestly needs to stop, why shouldn't men's spaces and terminology become gender neutral too?"
"'Excuse my beauty' is iconic. Ugh. RIP Stephanie Yellowhair, your spirit is not forgotten. Your acknowledgement of her was so poignant and made me tear up a bit. Great video."
"Very insightful, VERY interesting thanks for today's lesson, Ms. Points!"
"yeah im on the incongruity side of the argument...i isolate variables of gender and sexuality then put each variable on a scale between masculine and feminine. for instance the biological variables are Neurological, Biochemical, Anatomical, and Genetics, and for the sociological: cultural, Expression, internal view, External view, ect...Sociology is muddy. if their is a radical incongruity in the biological aspects you might be an Intersex, if there is an incongruity between the sociological and biological you might be trans....and now for me to say my radical positions  transsexuality is intersexuality, it is neurological incongruity because our sociological  aspects of self are a product of our neurology   don't @me 'biological realist'...because i is biologist"
"The idea of an argument put forth with reason which actually comes from a place of bigotry and hatred is a very powerful one.  It could be argued that this approach is ubiquitous across the alt-right, even the middle right in their criticism of civil rights and social welfare.  Another notch on the cap for the age of aesthetics.    Thank you once again Natalie for revealing another piece of today's beguiling sociopolitical puzzle, brilliant as usual."
"'Excuse my beauty, TERF' made me a little turned on Natalie ngl"

I think it could really help our students, and our administration is blessedly open on the topic."

"youre great Natalie. I just dont understand all of this. I was born and raised in the deep south by a very homophobic family. But I was a rather small boy and enjoyed being very feminine and crossdressing. I favored women. That invited much bullying growing up so I studied boxing and martial arts. The bullying quickly ended. I was a feminine boy who could quickly hand most of the jocks their ars back to them. It was very strange As an adult and trans topics cropped up on the scene. I did an amazing thing, totally earth shattering I educated myself on the topic. What is transexuality, what are they and how do they live. I read a few books on it, I read some indebth papers on the conditions and their experiences.  Why is this so difficult, anyone can do it. I even went to a few good youtube sites on it. One of my favorites was Zinnia Jones. She was very good at explaining the subject. And using that info to hand the bigots their arses back to them.  I learned it isnt their fault. One of the most ironic thing about Zianna was in her earlier videos where she just dressed femininely, she maintained that she is male. That changed later on, But she was a very young teen back then. Just discovering things. I wonder what ever happened to her.  I educated myself and learned everything I could. So I am freids with many of them and I do what I can to protect them here.  I just dont understand all of this hostility toward them. Just a few people trying to live their lives as best they can. Their condition isnt their fault. But what happened to them makes live almost unlivable in the condition they are in. So they must change why does that threaten so many other people"

"Some of this rang very true to me. When I'd first understood that I was bisexual, I had already lived 17 years as a functioning and passing straight boy. Sure, I didn't pass all the time, often people would ask if I was gay and it felt invalidating on a level that was inexplicable to me.  Coming out I noticed that a lot of interest from women waned. Suddenly, friends who I had before discussed things civilly with would drunk dial me and ask personal and kind of insulting questions like 'Who is the girl?' whereas before I was treated like any other straight man.  Just because our socialization starts late, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  And the worst was always that those insults, the attacks on my masculinity, the homophobic jabs, they hurt more because I knew they could be real. Being called a faggot wasn't just being called shitty, it was that I was attracted to men and that word meant me and my entire identity didn't mean shit if I admitted it to this person.  I knew gayer, more femme boys growing up and I've never disputed that they've had it hard, much harder than I did at the time. But in a lot of ways, coming out as bi will make it so you have it harder than being femme and straight or just being gay. Your prospects don't double, they half. Even the girls you're with will get paranoid about you having AIDS, and most of your partners question your faithfulness at some point.  And you will lose friends because, yeah, you tend to move politically left when you understand how little interest centrists and right wingers have in your well being. My old centrist friends will literally protest harder for someone else's right to call me a fag than for me to be allowed to donate blood.  Any way, TERFs can fucking leave, because duplicitous dipshits shouldn't get to share a space with the people they can and want to hurt the most."

"I think the most interesting thing about this video is the fact that not all trans experience is the same on the foundational level of egg state. Almost everyone I talk to speaks about how they always felt a certain way and that feeling made them emulate the gender they identified with. They'd then be 'corrected' which just made them feel more out of place. For them, they never were really the gender they were assigned at birth, but instead only 'played' at that gender to appease authority figures in their lives. For specifically my MtF peers it was more like woman playing man ala Much Ado About Nothing, only for the entirety of their pre-transition lives and with the extra limiter of being shamed for *not* wanting to 'act like a man' as opposed to *being* a woman."

I have massive hands ( I prefer to say piano fingers) I'm very tall (like a freaking Amazon) flat chested and I have naturally short hair... maybe i  should just LDAR....Or just laugh it off as the ridiculous opinions of small minded people. I'll toss a coin and let you know."
"9:50 Oddly in my experience, I've felt way more empathy and connection to & from butch cis women despite being pretty femme in my own self expression. We've both been ostracized by society at large for our self presentation. Hell, I've even been told stories of them being yelled at for entering the womens' restroom due to their masculine appearance, despite being AFAB.  Femme cis women may share more commonalities in terms of aesthetic interests, but I haven't found the same level of solidarity in terms of experiences in oppression."

"That ending holy shit. Powerful stuff"

"My God, do I love ContraPoints! Great video!   As an aside, TERFs are indeed generally hypocritical assholes -- they want sex and gender to work whichever way (traditionalist vs modernist, immutable vs assigned) is convenient at that particular time for their argument.

"Its always rooted in disgust. Well I think trans and gay love is fucking beautiful."
"I absolutely adore you Natalie - I've really learned so much watching you."
"When an ex-partner came out to me as trans-feminine I kind of had some of the the same “concerns”. Like, not being grossed out by her “man hands” or anything like that. More some of the stuff you mentioned about oppression experiences, what it means to be feminine, reproductive rights, etc. But I asked her questions, and watched YouTube videos by trans people, and read books about gender- and I changed my viewpoint. I was coming from a place of love and wanting to understand, so it wasn’t really a problem."
"And here's to Stephanie Yellow Hair!!"
"Ugh, the clip with Stephanie Yellowhair would be from Albuquerque New Mexico. Fuck this place so much, I hate that it was part of the mic drop for this video. My hometown owed her better :/"
"Anita Bryant is still alive, for those who are curious."
"mom! i missed you!"
"Hmm this was really interesting. I've always been of the 'destroy gender boundaries' mindset, but you bring up a really great point here... that it's just not practical to say that (esp. to trans people) when we live in a society... bound by gender boundaries. I also really like how when you introduced this topic you mentioned that this particular type of radicalization occurs when you have someone that has been introduced to feminism, but not trans-inclusive feminism. That is so incredibly true; for me, at least.   I had the experience of being raised progressively, going to a women's college, and coming to consider myself a feminist. I have been awed by the strength of the few trans-women and men I met in my life, without ever really *completely* believing that their 'state' was valid. It's a weird thing to admire but still completely fail to understand (or even really 100% believe) someone. I wasn't actively berating or even misgendering, but I admit there was always some irreconcilable hesitation in the back of my mind. I just couldn't reconcile 'gender as construct' and transgender ideology. All I ever really felt I could do was just throw up my hands and say, 'let them be as they wish,' it's their right. And I wonder how much hope there is for other people when even given all of my progressive bias, I couldn't get completely on side. I hope that reluctant acceptance will give way to a more complete and total acceptance in time, both within myself and within our society...   But in the meantime you've given me, and I'm sure many others, a lot to think on. So thanks for challenging us and for giving us more tools with which to challenge ourselves. And, as always, the execution was phenomenal."

"That blooper reel slayed me!!!"
"It's fascinating to me when terfs insist that all female children are degraded and traumatized horribly from birth for being female because... I transitioned at 14, when I was 13 I looked like a boy already, but 12 and under I looked like, acted like, and for all intents and purposes was a girl, and... that is not a good description of my experience of my childhood.  Like, I started getting a chest at 9 and I have never in my life been catcalled?  It's just not something that happened to me.  Which is not of course to say that it doesn't happen to other people--but it didn't happen to me, which contradicts the radfem/terf position.      //  Also I too tend to conceptualize myself as 'used-to-be-other-gender' rather than 'have-always-been-current-gender' and it's... I dunno, nice, I guess, to see someone actually acknowledge that side of things?"
"Beautiful video"
"natalie i'm so in love with you and i want to give you all my money while i'm still in this hazy half-conscious state of ascending that i enter whenever i look into your eyes through the screen. i want to make horrible financial decisions only for your approval, however slight. i would ruin my life if it meant you would even glance in my direction, in any one of the millions of alternate realities. am i real? am i really real? i don't think so. i feel at peace."
"Literally a fucking work of art"
"Hey! Great video, but one of the comparisons I think could've used more research- most transmeds (such as myself) do not believe you need debilitating or constant dysphoria, only gender dysphoria in some measure! We generally also loathe TERFS, and though I don't want to get preachy or aggressive, personally I think the quote-unquote 'tucute' arguments have a lot more in common with TERF ideology. No hate, you are entitled to your opinion, just please display our beliefs accurately rather than caricaturising and, yes, strawmanning our beliefs. Thank you so much!"
"Ok no offence to anyone, I'm just gonna say my opinion on genders. I think that there are only 2 genders, I don't really understand the point of making new genders that fit with personality, but, I don't think people should be attacked for having different opinions and beliefs. If someone wants to transition, support them. If someone wants you to say their pronouns then say them, because I don't see how it would hurt you. Personally, I've never met anyone who is gender-fluid or trans, but I doubt I would treat them any different than I do with everyone else I know.   And I also want to say that contra points voice is really soothing, her videos are really well edited, and obviously a lot of effort are put in to it. It's kinda like watching nerdcity, the video is well informed and overall interesting. Can't wait for next video!"
"Lowkey though, I'm actually getting on the gender abolitionism choo-choo.  Short term trans rights are something I support, but long term I'm actually thinking getting rid of the concept of gender roles is probably a good thing.    (Also Vaushvidya says you're great.)"
"But how did you boob? I must know!"
"1:25... Fuck! Off I go then... Almost made it."

"Thank you queen. As someone who has a uterus and xx chromosomes, future TERFs in their teens called me an 'it' and beat the shit out of me because I didn't read girly enough. This is and always has been their aim, to narrow the definition of female until they can have a girls party where only the girls they like get to come. I identify as intergender now, but only because I remain unfeminine and know that I will forever. TERFs are bullies. TERFs are the girls who cornered me in the locker room and kicked me in between the legs over and over because they said I must be a boy. TERFs are the most internally misogynistic assholes on the planet.   Period."
"No wonder terfs don't like being called terfs, they are diametrically opposed to calling things by their proper names!"
"Many have concerns about the gender critical movement..."
"That immigrant-trans comparison though. SO 👏🏼 FUCKING 👏🏼 TRUE 👏🏼"

"I love how people get so mad about peoples choices that have no effect on them personally. Fuck who you want, dress how you want, do what you want. As long as your not hurting anyone else why the fuck does it matter to you, and if its hurting you, then you have an obligation to yourself personally to stop that behavior. I know that this point is overly simplified almost to a point that its cliché, but I try to live my life by it. I'm not perfect and I can get irrationally angry at certain things. So if something upsets me, I try to figure out if it is harming anyone else, if it isnt, then I should just go on my way."

"You can’t claim to want to erase gender while also stereotyping all men as violent rapists. Terfs aren’t as radical as they claim. They make feminism look bad."
"Great video! Though I feel that many feminists would argue that sometimes 'she' is equivalent to 'it'.  You shouldn't have to 'earn' female identity, surely it would be a welcome idea, a unifying concept that highlights the problem with society's perception of gender and its strict boundaries. If a person who was born with a penis and subsequently transitions is judged for not being a proper woman by men, critical feminists surely can't agree with him else they indulge the notion of a male defining their gender, right? (Sorry in advance if I have misunderstood just trying to figure this out)"

"I don't really agree that true womanhood is having to deal with the different types of oppression women tend to face.  I have never feared walking alone at night, have never been catcalled, belittled by men for giving my opinion,  or anything like that. Its probably because I'm a bit overweight or the fact I look like a child even though I am 20 years old.  If that's the definition of womanhood, I have never been a woman and most trans women are more 'womanly' than me."

"i really don't comment much, but on the slim chance you see this, i wanna say a few things.    i saw this in a moment when my dysphoria was peaking. wonderful timing to watch a video about gender, eh? anyway. i don't know exactly how to describe it, but watching your videos on gender tends to soothe my dysphoria. i don't experience much in general, (transmeds smite me now) and most of it is social and due to my feminine presentation, so hearing you talk about the difference between expression and identity is always soothing. it's also nice because these arguments aren't coming from a cis ally, but a someone who has experience living as a trans person, (as a trans woman in particular, which also offers a perspective i don't have as a transmasc person) and because of that it feels more down to earth, even through the lovely costumes and lighting. it feels honest. it's not a person saying the right things to appeal to a certain group.    ive been watching you since you first started talking about your own gender in a time where i was questioning my own, and seeing you evolve in thought, experience, and composure is stunning. you're stunning. and also a massive source of inspiration, not because of your transition necessarily (though- holy crap) but through your well-reasoned, well-articulated arguments in the face of the projectile vomit that is transphobia.  all of this is to say- thanks. dunno if you'll read this, but thanks. for this video and all of them."

"Wait, so the meaning of gender critical changed from people who are suspicious and critical of the concept of gender in general to, well, TERFs? It strikes me that they are the exact opposite of being critical of gender.  When did this happen, or did it always mean that? I seem to recall the literature being considered 'gender critical' if it was critical of the idea of prescribed gender roles and the expectation that to be considered a specific gender, you had to conform as closely as possible to masculinities or femininities. Ok, cool, I'm with it, so what label should we use for people who are critical of gender roles in general w/ an appreciation of androgyny? I mean, if TERFs coopted the term gender critical to mean something other than people who are critical of gender... Language is confusing sometimes. (Typo: Changed 'germ' to 'term')"
"I loooovee that dress!!!"
"I often struggle when trans people talk about presenting or practicing womanhood or manhood. I'm genderqueer so the best ideal I have to look up to is ash hardell, and I like that they're getting recognition. But I don't relate to it, how can I 'practice and present my gender' when it's essentially a fluid version of masc and femme nonbinary needs. Not even a lot of trans men or women understand what being outside the binary is and for fucks sake neither do I, I have no role models, no history, no ideal to aspire to. It doesn't feel as much an exploration of the frontier as facing a post apacolyptic desert where everyone's claim is already staked and I'm left with nothing."
"I'll be honest in the hopes this gets buried and never upvoted, but I'm intersex, and while I never had any issue with trans people, I did and in some ways do find myself skeptical of the central premise. If someone came up to me and said they identified as intersex and wanted to change their physiology to match that, the very idea gets me furious, because I never saw 'intersex' as just an identity you can wear, it's a whole childhood and lifetime of specific experiences, almost none of them positive, that you simply can't understand if you're not born that way. I'm all for non-binary gender expression, but that is markedly different. I guess the trouble is there's no distinction in the English language between 'woman' as a gender identity and 'woman' as a creature you are born as and treated accordingly from birth. Being born intersex also forces you to think deeply about these things from an early age and from a non-trans perspective, as my genitals were not a man or a woman's but were cut up like a woman's and then I had to take hormones to make me look like a girl even if I wasn't sure if that's what I wanted but was considered what was best for me because I already had the vagina which was not really a vagina but there's nothing else to call it. But hey at least I'm not a menstruator and will never be a pregnant person, and that makes me both simultaneously not a woman and not trans but really I kinda am but not really."

"I've been saying 'abolish gender' for a while, as a tongue-in-cheek way of saying I think gender is an arbitrary and harmful social construct that we'd be better off without. Never at trans people - usually at pink tax ads, or toxic masculinity, or transphobes who can't handle nonbinary or non-passing trans people.  I didn't realize TERFs were using it. Fuck. I hope I didn't ever use it around a trans person and make them feel unwelcome.  Can we get trans-positive gender abolition thing going please? Gender is garbage, so let everyone express how they want because that's the best way to break down those barriers?"

"So the UK has a bunch of TERFs kicking around print media and pop culture, and it does seem to mostly be a 'yuck'. But there are two points of contention they bring up when it comes to integrating trans identities into pre-existing social structures: prisons and Sports.  The argument is essentially 'something something Innate Biological differences something something physiclly bigger/smaller etc'. Frankly, since I'm not a warden, prison guard or an athlete I don't have a lot of stakes in answering these objections, but I'd be interested in thoughts/rebuttals/etc"
"That Abolish Borders comparison is genius! Immigration has been the ABSOLUTE BANE of my existence (as a migrant child of migrants) and I am #1 Team Pro Abolish Borders forever, but that doesn't negate any of my activism and perspectives on how immigration and citizenship systems need to be much fairer and less hostile. As much as I'd like to set them all on fire, Immigration Departments still exist, and there are ways for them to do their job that isn't rooted in xenophobia and other forms of bigotry.  (Thankfully I've never met an anti-immigrant type using 'borders shouldn't exist anyway' as some kind of justification, but I do hear very similar rhetoric cloaked in the veneer of 'sustainability', 'gentrification', or 'overpopulation'. Leftists are not immune to xenophobia, and I say this as someone pretty far Left - I've found most of the super insidious xenophobia coming from the Left because it's hidden so well.)"

"I agree that any statistical differences between male and female brains likely does not account for why people identify as trans, but I still think there is something biologically innate in my identity at least. If we imagine a brain like a computer, I think gender identity is like an operating system, and the programs are like our sex characteristics. If you try to run Windows programs on iOS, the computer doesn't know what to do. Nothing is wrong with the OS, nor the programs, they simply aren't made for each other."

"'We're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.'  Oh wow. I totally get that--I'm a cis woman, and what you just said is something I've thought about but never been able to parse in this way. I mean, being a woman is both a private experience and a public performance, and there can be a real disconnect between those two things. Often what is most significant about my experience of womanhood, like my actual values and experiences as a woman, cannot be heard, you know? Like, in a private conversation with another woman, those experiences are real, but, brought out in mixed company, or in public discourse, it's like those things can't be believed or acknowledged. Meanwhile, those feminine signifiers--not just makeup and clothes, but also behaviors, especially passive, conciliatory, or conformist behaviors--those things are how I communicate to the world, 'Hey, I am actual,' or 'Hey, I'm safe, so don't hurt me.'"
"A tactic worth flagging up that I’ve seen: the claim that autistic children are somehow being brainwashed by the pro-trans establishment to believe themselves trans, on the assumption that autism prevents kids from knowing best about their own gender identity.   Proportionally there do seem to be more autistic trans kids than neurotypical ones, but since nobody knows what causes either autism or non-cis gender identities, nobody knows why they correlate. You can speculate - divergences often do cluster, or autism makes you less receptive or more resistant to society’s messages about gender, the list goes on - but brainwashing?  Well, that only works if you have another hidden prejudice under the guise of concern, or at least a misconception: the idea that autism equals totally clueless about everything related to being human. And if you know autistic people - my son is one, so are many friends - you’ll know that’s just not accurate.  But what this does is use ‘concerned’ hostility to autistic people as a weapon to discredit trans people. It’s an ignorance twofer and it really isn’t ok.  So if you hear that one, peeps, take it from one who knows: autistic kids are f%cking great, and like anyone else, they are the best authority on what it feels like to be themselves. Autism has its challenges, but recruitment by the Sinister Trans Brainwashing Conspiracy isn’t one of them."

"I lost it at the teapot mouthfeel moment. Also, the outtakes were a nice addition. Hope that becomes standard protocol."
"So is that a wrap on 'gender critical feminism' then?"
"It all boils down to terfs being authoritarians. For me anyways. Edit: thanks for the wonderful work as always. I always walk away from your videos feeling dumb and smarter at the same time. X)"
"she did THAT"
"Yaaaaaaaaaaaas! <3"
"It's SO interesting how you say at about 9:30 that you wear MORE girly things and act more girly so people don't mistake you for or treat you as a man... I have the opposite issue sorta; I am a straight woman but I have a great deal about me that is very male, and I used to tone down those mannerisms & be afraid to be myself because my straight male partner didn't find those things attractive, or shamed my wardrobe for being often mannish (but like David Bowie mannish so ya know)... he's gone & I have embraced my larger-than-one-gender personality, but now I feel I CAN'T be effeminate or girly AS a woman EVER because I can't wear anything except a burqa without other women treating me like I'm after attention and men treating me like I am for sale. I am jealous, actually, you are free to be as girly as you want and it makes you no less weak. It's like a shitty purgatory where I'm not allowed to be too manly OR too girly without so much BULLSHIT. Except Trek conventions, nuthin but LOVE there!!"
"“Excuse my beauty… TERF.”  Oh how iconic. How beautiful. Amazing. My trans heart is shook.  Also the little bits of your breaks of character in the video and the outtakes are so charming, you’re so amazing!! Brilliant video as always, thanks for all your hard work!!!!"
"21:56 same"
"Natalie looks so beautiful"
"Fantastic as always"
"15:05 I SPITED ALL MY COFFEE, LOL !!!!"
"Nat has a camerawoman now!"
"First thing you should ask: why does a person care so much about how *someone else* acts, dresses, talks or identifies?  Obviously they are the ones that have a problem with it, so why should anyone else bear the brunt of that fallout?"
"4:51 you have a gorgeous smile"
"ILY CONTRA"
"FART: 'TERF is a slur!'  Me: Ok, we can change it to Feminism Appropriating Reactionary Transphobe if TERF doesn't do it for you?"
"Splendid video as always Natalie!"
"You having abolished gender for some reason has former hippie suburban mom energy."
"Contrapoints is always highlight of the day, no matter the day! Seriously, I should be studying (and like, *really* should be), but this is one thing I will make expection for"
"I love your videos so much they're amazing and awesome and I think you're awesome and the greatest woman of all time"
"Your video editing continues to become more impeccable every video ❤️"
"Fuck my math homework, actually. This is more important"
"Beautiful"
"YES AND THANK YOU ♥"
"nEw VIDEO!!"
"AS A CINCINNATIAN I AM DISGUSTED, OUR SHITTY CHILI AND GOETTA WILL NOT FACE ERASURE!! (obviously jk love you, Natalie, keep demystifying the left and kicking ass with your bomb fits!! 💞💞)"
"Imagine if the word 'nazi' was a slur."
"Another emotional roller coaster. Thanks for your strength? Courage?"
"hit like less than 5 minutes in.  finished the vid, and my instincts were on fuckin point"
"i loled so hard because #mywhiteprivilege was trending today when i got the notification"
"Great video, was an interesting experience to just try to listen to this subject from the outside, which I think is what CIS, straight men should do with this question. It felt relaxing actually to kind of passively take in, so thanks for that Natalie"
"Let's do this!"
"You're a rock star, Natalie.<3"
"i love you 😭"
"I have no idea what it's like to catcalled as a 9-year-old girl."
"Yay another contra video. Today is a good day"
"Amazing video and it just flew by, I cannot believe that was over half an hour!"
"this is the hottest you have ever looked"
"when she sticks the whole teapot spout in her mouth I LOST IT."
"do you have acces to a whole studio or you just have that many props at home?"
"15:04 Super cute! 😍"
"The glorious moment when you live in Europe and therefore you come home far from sober when a new video comes out. I promise, its the best"
"If I'm 'a lost sister lesbian' then why do I like topping my very gay very male boyfriend"
"Vegan Cincinnati chili is sounds good now!"
"The most urgent matter at hand: where can I get this shirt ?"
"Natalie, I have truly come to appreciate the balancing act that you put on in these videos. Managing humor and uncomfortable conversations is not something everybody does well. Wonderful job. ☺️  Edit: Those last few minutes....damn. That hit hard."
"You're absolutely awesome!"
"MOTHER HAS FED US WELL TODAY"
"'Excuse my beauty... TERF.' YES NATALIE! <3"
"I deleted my Twitter a while ago. What are we gamer up to now? Just want to be uptodate and act accordingly to contra points lessons."
"Where is your definition of 'slur' from?  Why do you think it has only to do with race, religion or sexuality?"
"11:22 i would just like to let you know that my mom was walking behind me, saw the screen and said 'is she from some sort of cult?'"
"I'm delighted to finally discover the correct way to drink tea from a teapot, thank you mother."
"Seeing you in non-colorful lighting is jarring, but it still fits. Your aesthetics are amazing"
"I love you so fucking much 💗💗💗💗💗"
"... who gets catcalled at age 9?"
"Sorry, this is gonna sound creepy, but i think i've reached a point of fondness in which I just have zero interest in living in a world where Natalie doesn not exist    Thank you for shining multicolor lights in my darkest days :)"
"your videos are always the best part of my month."
"Love the music!"
"24:50 I think that's the edgiest joke you've ever made."
"Umm... actually! Um, Tiddies!"
"God this was just fucking excellent"
"I can't believe you attacked Skyline Chili!!!!"
"Please don't take this as a 'microagression' but you look GREAT!!!!"
"yay queen dropped another!"
"K but those bloopers tho rofl 😂😂😂"
"Please make more videos like this. It's like watching Pokemon fight."
"YAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Not upset you don't understand the transmedicalist movement, just dissapointed"
"The delivery of the thumbtack line had me in stitches! I love this. Informative and darkly funny."
"I can't believe my soulmate makes YT videos."
"What happens if you are a biological male, that identifies as a male and has been cat called by men since a very young age?  #awkward"
"wicked witch of the west who gender critical TERFS whomst"
"'Excuse my beauty, *TERFs*!' Talk about a mic drop. Also, are bloopers gonna be a thing now? Because YAAAASSS!"
"Excuse my beauty *tongue click*"
"The media engagement music was funny the first couple times but it's a little much now tbh. Still loved your video"
"Thank you, oh dark mother."
"*Couldn't you make the argument that the TERFs are more motivated by hatred of men and use transphobia as a tactic* ? For example, if a man hates women, he would use a woman's weight as a target to attack because he realizes that this is a soft target. I would not necessarily call him fatphobic, but rather someone employing fatphobia as a tactic."
"Good Lord, this is one of your best videos yet. Also you look absolutely incredible. Also too, hi from a recently out trans man. :-)"
"I'm not gonna lie, the outtakes are one of my favourite parts of this video because your laugh is so wonderful, Natalie. I love seeing you look genuinely happy ^_^"
"I've never clicked on a video so fast before. I love how well though out, enlightening and satirical your videos are 😂"
"I loved the whole video, but Hannukkah-tastrophy is the best!!"
"Nobody:   Terfs: *C H R O M O S O M E S*"
"I love the decision to include outtakes at the end, i used to love it when jackie chan did it and i love it now, more people should put bloopers during their credits"
"This video was awesome. Period. Mic drop. Done."
"The reason i believe in 'gender metaphysics' because if there was any way to be cis i would be, so there is something more inherent to being trans"
"What’s up M E N S T R U A T E R S"
"ay yo this vid was great (as always <3) but i was kinda intrigued by what you think of transmedicalists? i'm cis so there is, of course, a degree to which i can't understand trans experiences, but i always assumed that 'non-dysphoric trans' people were always kinda bullshitting (at least to a degree) because i don't really get why you'd transition w/o some form of gender dysphoria. it's always been my view if don't have gender dysphoria (whether that be physical, social, etc) you aren't trans, but i interpreted the way you were talking about them as indicating you disagree with that? maybe i'm wrong, but i'd love to hear your thoughts. love u btw :)"
"You have made a very wrong/extreme statement about Transmedicalists (Transmeds or Truscum). Majority of us simply belive that you need gender dysphoria to be trans. We don't think that you need to *_hate_* your body to be considered trans. That is a tucute statement. I think you need to do further research on our comunity before making bold claims like that. Other than that, amazing video!"
"I almost pissed myself when you did the „genderless sounds“. Beyond brilliant😂"
"“𝙄𝙩 𝙍𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚𝙨 𝙈𝙮 𝘾𝙝𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙨!”"
"I'd love to know Contrapoint's opinion on men pretending to be women to break athletics records and getting scholarships, also, I'd like to know hoe she explains Debra Soh's scientific findings on the difference between male and female brains."
"You are very agreeable. Thank you very much for your excellent work <3"
"This Video is for women and men aren't allowed to watch. What should I do if I'm both?"
"I'd like to hear more about Sinister Butt."
"I am with you 100%. Except about Cincinnati Chilli. That stuff is delicious."
"#YesAllGamers"
"Is it a new camera or better lighting? idk but these costumes look sooo good."
"MOTHER!!!!"
"please put TWs for seizures if you're going to have flashing imagery. it's an issue in a lot of your videos and i have had to stop watching them, only listen, and i like your pretty face natalie so pleaseeeeeeeeee try and include warnings or leave that kinda flashy stuff out. thank you"
"You are real, you are valid, and we love you."
"If only the rest of the trans community could engage with these points respectfully, we might get somewhere, but the problem is they won't. The very same people who are going to attack you and say nasty things about all the reasonable things you said here are going to go on to say even more nasty things to GC feminists as they do 24/7.  Someone's going to respond to this to say, 'Well nasty things SHOULD be said to those people.' And nope, you're wrong. All that does is create division and drive people further into GC/RF camps while scaring away moderates and giving the other side an opportunity to take said nasty things out of context and use them to paint with broad strokes against trans people as CONSTANTLY happens on the terfisaslur site."
"The genderless section made me die laughing."
"Omg. Are you reading my mind? For the last couple weeks I've been meditating on this shit."
"I love u"
"Exactly!  Most bigoted talking points are merely mental gymnastics employed to justify disgust and sadism.   As always, you nailed it, mommy."
"Great video as always.  ACAB"
"Okay, that WALLPAPER though!"
"This is your best video so far. Really just masterful, bravo bravo more please."
"thanks mom"
"Ya, if you consider living in Florida, dead. Either way she's still in the 'sunshine state' or gator gully, which ever you prefer."
"BURGEONING"
"I was waiting for you to do a video on this topic. Loved it. 💖💖💖💖"
"That highlight with the red dress sends me"
"Fuck me, I need like, 10 minutes after that break with the teapot xD"
"“Is Anita Bryant even dead? Scholars remains divided”  I laughed and then felt old. Sigh."
"No justified intro text ? the shame."
"Yessss"
"This was so good, and that ending!"
"How the fuck did you get anything DONE WITH THERYN!??!  xD"
"*cough* literally lolcow forums *cough*"
"OH MY GOD SHE'S BACK   I AM NOT READY"
"I might not know what it's like being socialised as a girl. But I also don't know what it's like being socialised as a boy.  I spent my teens alone and friendless. Unable to picture a future for myself. Being ashamed of who I knew, but couldn't accept, I was. Living in fear of which bone all the boys around me would break next. And living in fear that my parents, teachers or classmates would find out about me and that my ridicule would worsen tenfold. I never benefited from male privilege because I was too occupied with trying to figure out and escape root so that I could be the girl I knew I was. If fantasising about diving headfirst out a second story classroom window every single morning for three years is male privilege, then I guess I'm wrong and I did have it. But if that's what male privilege then it's not all it's cracked up to be."
"when she said 'terf' at the end..that gave me goosebumps O_O"
"Retitle: Natalie OWNS the terfs"
"Damn that BUUUURN"
"As an asexual AFAB enby, I'm hardly a lost lesbian sister, so am I allowed to transition according to TERFs?   Also: Thank you for acknowledging the validity of my utopian pipe dream"
"she should do a video on truscum/transmed or at least go more in depth about them in a future video!!"
"Natalie for the Wynn."
"this is,,, very powerful"
"BURGEONING"
"Excuse my beauty... Yesssssss.... yes!"
"'excuse my beauty, *terf* ' you heard it, the queen has spoken"
"I stan you, but I'm afraid you got transmedicalism wrong? The main transmed belief is that a person has to experience dysphoria in any degree to be trans, as opposed to believing that non-dysphoric trans people exist."
"The millinery is lovely, mother. These sets are also gorgeous. I'm really here for this visual drama. Yes I am one of those types of commenters who doesn't have the emotional energy to reply to the actual topic at hand, so just says YAS MOM. The house."
"'It´s almost like this is a hate movement hiding behind a hand of pseudofeminist platitudes' 12:32 It´s almost like feminism is a hate movement, and you are just becoming aware when it targets you specifically."
"Trap chasers jizz... We need Jesus up in here!"
"I loved it."
"goddamnit i love this woman and her videos uwu"
"FUCK. Natalie’s sense of humor undercutting (or underlining) her points every couple of minutes has me cackliiiingggg  She actually fucking pronounced it SwEAtY I have been SENT"
"Is she related to Jim Stirling?"
"23:10 take that back, Cincinnati is a beautiful"
"badass video"
"Thank you for your hard work!"
"Is Anita Bryant even dead?  SCHOLARS REMAIN DIVIDED"
"That was amazing! I wish i had your eloquent vocabulary so i could properly communicate how perfect you nailed it. 🖤💜 #ExcuseMyBeauty💅"
"14:46 Holy shit this is some big dick energy.. or um bad bitch energy. Like that disregard of the transphobes who obsess over making sure trans women are insecure is the kind of full circle redemption arc that really makes Nataly's transition such a power move."
"OMG, the only thing I hate about this channel is how long it takes for you to upload new videos. It twice a week too much to ask for???????????????"
"I really identify with this for some reason"
"truly B I O L O G I C A L"
"Yes we do stan Kim Petras 💞"
"yet another informative video that is fun to watch and aesthetically pleasing while never failing to educate! love ur content, points <33"
"Uh so I was told to leave a comment."
"omg there's a new video I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AHHHHHHHH"
"Genderless contra is my new crush"
"A tongue pop IS the solution to every problem"
"'Excuse my beauty, TERF.' One of the most powerful things I've heard in a long time."
"Natalie thanks so much for your work, it’s been vital to me coming to terms with myself as trans. This video touched on a lot of stuff that I’ve been struggling with lately. My internalized TERF is always trying to tear me down and what you said in this video really helped with my insecurities.   Keep doing what you do❤️"
"15:07 how’s that mouthfeel?"
"i love u"
"I fucking love you!!!! YOU NAILED IT. Btw, once I commented about my own experiences with heckling. I wasnt trying to compete, I honestly think I worded that shit horribly and was insecure the next day that it wpuld come across as a micro aggression. The intention was to show the relatability, and how maybe trans women have it even worse than noncomformative/unconventional cisgendered folks. ( I dont consider myself butch, but other people dont think I look femme enough, mostly because of things outside of my control). It doesnt matter who suffers at the hands of the asshole masses more. But the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and also, I love everything you do omfg"
"That was awesome, your production quality is getting amaaazing"
"I nearly died of laughter from Theryn's intro section. Also almost died of irony because the things the TERF in question was criticising the trans lady for were things I see cis women struggling with all the time. It was a great example of why, at the core, 'gender-critical' feminists end up being bad for women because toxic attitudes towards trans women fuel other people's hate in different ways. Talking about women as 'painted' and 'it' are both facets of misogynist objectification in men, for example."
"Greer's... verbosity is certainly a powerful advertisement for the highly intellectual and progressive Radical Feminist g e n d e r c r i t i c a l movement."
"QUEEN <3"
"Love it as always, but where are all the characters we love? #FreeTabby"
"Is it just me or does she look a lot like Winona Ryder in this video? Also I'm almost sure I've seen this video in a dream or nightmare before..."
"YEAH FUCK CINCINATTI"
"No u"
"I love you so much. You are an inspiration"
"can we see your ceramics collection? great videos as always!"
"Your lipstick is a little asymetrical. Still love you though."
"The end just made me depressed about our situation. I’m not criticising I knew what was coming, but sometimes you just burst out of the echo chamber, like a jump in cold water, to find that the world is still transphobic..."
"That smile over the dissolve-to-Patrons list at the end is *perfection*"
"NATHALIE THIS IS SO WELL MADE ILYSM"
"TERF: we want to be called gender critical.  Trans people: ok, we want to be referred to by our preferred pronouns.   TERF: never!  A bit hypocritical of them isn't it?"
"Saying menstruator instead of woman is actually more fair to cis women as well. Not all cis women have periods."
"how dare you shit talk Skyline"
"Bah-lanced"
"Very interesting!!!"
"I hope Theryn is doing well"
"You should be ashamed, Gamers are the most oppressed people our struggles are real and not to be used as a throw away joke #GamersRiseUp"

"This is me clapping. You go girl!"
"The outer fringes of any group are usually assholes."
"'I'm the tranny 1%' ...whoa new level"
"Made me cry. Natalie is actually my hero, I look up to her so much"
"You do a really great job and deserve a lot of credit. That said: I (congenially and without malice, but rather with true interest and desire for edification) dare you to do a video on detransition."
"Oh i genuinly thought you had boob surgery, that make up was too real"
"conservatism will always have an upper hand as the left is too busy trying to purse out the most perfect world view, the in fighting will never stop"
"Wait I'm a man....   Looks at knife, weighs the potential consequences of becoming a eunich versus getting to see contra....   Totally worth it"
"'Excuse my beauty.' POWERFUL"
"Natalie, you rule. Great stuff. 😁🎉"
"WE STAN A BIOLOGICAL QUEEN"
"I love Natalie's work, but I wish there weren't such a heavy feeling of irony around the Plath quote. Even with the mocking voice in which it was read, that passage brought tears to my eyes, just as it always does, because I can never recover from having freedom stolen from me because I am female. As a kid and teen, I wanted so much to roam outdoors, especially to explore the woods. It filled me with rage to see my younger brothers gain the freedom I couldn't have. I just wanted to go outside by myself, enjoy the silence; maybe say hello to another person, or maybe just learn to find my way around. I wasn't allowed. My female gender was the only reason. It's a completely normal experience. It's a completely standard, typical version of abuse, carried out by the entire world on all girls and young women. I understand that it might not seem like any great loss to someone urbane like Natalie, but I love nature. I love solitude and wide spaces, and I love deep silent woodlands, and reading aloud to myself under a leafy canopy, and I wanted to grow up doing those things, and I didn't, and I can never get that back."
"oh natalie you dork"
"This video has ascended to a higher plane of slick editing"
"One of the most powerful political lines about the tampon tax is that it's 'A tax on being a woman'. Pedants have a problem with it and want to instead discuss the bodily process, which makes it seem less like an equity issue and more akin to awareness of a particular 'disease' in terms of framing.   If you saw 'A tampon tax is a tax on being a woman', would you agree with that or chime in with a 'well actually'? Conservative trolls do the latter."
"The f in terf stands for fascist"
"Okay I seriously wish I could like this video more than once. BRB sockpuppeting"
"Unfortunately, I know who Anita Bryant is. She gave us a real gem warning about the evils of drugs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssS55G_1Af0&t=342s"

"Can you hold my whiskey sour while I stage a mutiny in the comments"
"what the fuck why are you dressed like a girl?"
"Okay!, Fine! I'm a super edgey OpReSsEd white male, who watches (technically) conservative YT Channels.  BUT, Natalie is the only person I will literally drop everything to enjoy,  (honestly, the hammer to my foot was pretty painful)       (Worth it!)"
"She's here, not queer, reads a lot of Germaine Greer hahaha fantastic"
"The new term for TERF is FART “Feminism Appropriating Reactionary Transphobes”."
"Happy TDoV Nat!"

"You know what ? As a male gamer myself,... fair enough."
"TWO NATALIE VIDEOS IN ONE MONTH!!! I’m dreaming this is a dream!! 💞thank you Natalie"
"Dat end though!! Perfect!"
"« Excuse my beauty, TERF »   IDOLO"
"Woot woot, Natalie mentioned Sudan in one of her videos. Not the best of mentions, but it's Natalie, so I'll take it. :D"
"WTF The content warning didn't include explicit imagery of Bolsonaro, that's seriously fucked up"
"germaine greer is somebody i have detested since high school ugh"
"Fuck, half an hour and 1,2mil likes. Oh mommy you're famous"
"Natalie, you truly are a beacon shining in The Darkness <3"
"**New Contra video comes out**  Oof I was feeling pretty good about my gender identity today, do I watch?  **Opening text crawl**  :( Why do I do this to myself?  EDIT: After sitting through the whole video, I'm glad I watched it. I'm a very early transfemme/nonbinary/labrador retriever who struggles a lot with the things Natalie spoke about regarding male privilege and socialization, and the impact they have on my 'womanhood'. As she said, most trans people do NOT want to talk about these things because so often it is a weapon wielded against us, but the fact is the points are in my head constantly.  It was pretty satisfying to see them laid out and discussed in a more nuanced way than would ever be kosher in either the trans or TERF circles."
"natalie resurrecting the 'sweaty' meme is everything."
"is there a word for someone who does want to eventually see a genderless utopia but not at the expense of trans people? before I knew that 'gender critical' was just another word for terf I considered myself gender critical but now I don't want to be associated with it."
"Seems like every couple months these videos LEAP ahead in quality"
"I would ask what have I done to deserve a lovely contra upload? But honestly I know I'm a pretty good egg."
"the power that that final line encapsulates.... my god"
"What I also find funny about terfs like Germain Greer, is they always present ultra feminine, despite hating gender stereotypes, they always have that fresh from the salon look"
"11:23 Haha, I'm dying! 😂😂😂"
"I was literally in the middle watching an interview with ContraPoints when I got this notification and SCREAMED"
"'I sold my soul to a Sudanese buisnessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit' That was beyond hilarious."
"I love that you didn't edit out the instances of losing your shit."

"'You guys do know that trans men exist right?' X3"
"When I see @contrapoints I click."
"Why is someone so vile even close to anything feminism? Go fuck yourself with your fucked up bullshit. That paragraph is vile and dehumanizing."
"But what's wrong with you liking makeup anyway? It's not just signifiers being thrown out like 'glitter spaghetti', it's self-expression and should be supported as such.  It's actually beautiful and inspiring to look at you."
"Very nuanced 👍"
"I have two term papers due in 7 hours. Sadly, this will be the longest I will have had to wait between seeing the notification and watching the latest Contra"
"Sir..."
"oi leave my games alone"
"Holy shit I was not prepared for how fabulous your RadFem alter ego was going to be"
"She's back!"

"Oddly ,it is always night in my country when you upload your seductively 'dark' films"
"Amazing as always. Thought provoking. Lovely aesthetic."
"Queen Contra is a justified hierarchy."
"Also at 8:24 this speaks to my soul!! I usually just think of myself as a 24/7 since brith masculine nb gender rebel, but when I describe growing up and specific feelings i do say, back when I was a girl, because while growing up that is how i identified, and categorized myself even if inside there was some turmoil. I identified as a girl, even if i know live masculinely and take testosterone! for me personally I think it's apt to remember each one of my identities and recognize that, while i may have 'figured it out' this is how i thought about myself previously and therefore say that 'back when i was a girl' bc i felt i was!"
"I differ with you there as a trans woman, I always considered myself a woman... this is something I knew about myself ad early as 5....i just considered myself as a girl who was forced to live as a boy.  I'm a 'Jazz Jennings' type trans girl, as it's something I've always known, and i was telling ppl I was a girl when I was 3, I've been told."
"I see a new Contrapoints video, I hit like."
"I actually screamed when I saw you uploaded!"
"Actuaaaaaaaaaaaaaallyyyy, your genderless persona is pretty cute tho so you fit into the beauty standards stablished for ethereal beings sooo IMAGINE..."
"I don't think you can abolish gender but I think gender can be changed, relaxed, made to not really matter at all.   To me gender is just the way people react to perceived sex.    Anyway yeah the terf argument about that is just another bullshit way to attack trans people."
"I have a teenage son who was starting to sip on the MRA Kool Aid, and today I sat him down and made him watch a bunch of your videos. Since then he's blocked the red pilled chucklefucks he was following and at this moment he's on the phone with the parents of a trans boy he called nasty names arranging a day to apologize in person. I just want to say from the bottom of my heart thank you, madam, for saving my boy and making him realize what a clueless and straight up bigoted dipshit he was being."
"Brilliant <3"
"'Concerns have been raised'"
"Hitler attempted to save the west from this shit and was balked at and ultimately defeated.  How I wish he won.  This is absolutely disgusting."
"yay another video!"
"Cis lesbians who are terfs really have no knowledge of their/our own history, the complications of gender in lesbian culture. not a trans woman, but ive had a complicated relationship with my gender as a gnc lesbian and lemme tell you, trans people especially trans women have been significantly more helpful for me understanding myself and my relationship to my sexuality and gender than cis lesbians who just call me confused and act like im equivalent to a man because im butch. trans women have been and are your allies, not our enemies."
"Good strategy making sure all terms used in the hottest discourse point to one of your videos."
"Goddammit Nat, I was just about to go to bed! Fuck, Im too tired to watch right now, I'll watch it for breakfast. Yarp!"
"'take a fucking sip babes' SENT me 15:03"

"Thank you so much, you are amazing xx"

"22 mins 21440 views. Wow. Just wow.   You are amazing!"
"Theryn :)"
"Damn, you like fine as hell without makeup."
"We don't need to abolish gender; what we need to abolish is gendered assumptions and associations. And by assumptions I mean the social expections imposed on the genders and by associations I mean the concrete stuff that is labelled boy or girl.   P. S I get what you were going for with the genderless thing yeah, unfortunately it kinda reinforces ideas about Nonbinary and agender people. It's OK, the point was made and very valid; it's just a little demeaning"
"When your so fabulous that Milo tries and fails to rip you off"
"You just keep getting prettier and prettier"
"We stan you forever"
"Never clicked so quickly."

"SOMEONE FINALLY SAID IT, SOMEONE FINALLY SAID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"17:19 'I despise the West' - Natalie Wynn, 2019 lol, I'm just kidding with you girl. Do you."
"Whew! There have been a lot of concerns among your audience that you might be a transmedicalist/truscum. Although I haven't finished the video yet (I'm on the part about gender metaphysics), it seems like that idea is being put to rest. Which is a huge relief!"
"literally all i had to do to understand the concept of Gender was google it and i'm in med school so i completely understood it. My knowledge in Behavioural Science & Anthropology made it very clear."

"If a transwoman isn't feminine, she's told that she's not a real woman. If a transwoman is feminine, she's told that she's upholding the stereotypes that she's just a man in a dress trying to rape lesbians and young girls. It really just sounds like someone trying to control someone else."
"I was 10 when I was first cat called. I was not an early bloomer, aka, I was *clearly* a child.  My mom had to sit me down when we got home and explain what happened to me.   It was one of the most scary and impactful situations I've ever been through.  Thank you for acknowledging my experience (which a lot of women can relate to)."
"You look like a high society lady from the 1930s and I'm living for it."
"I get gayer every time seeing her,,,"
"I see the 'stolen valor' gatekeeping attitude among another demographic - gamergaters and incels. They suffered for being socially awkward so they're the real nerds and women aren't welcome (never mind what female gamers have been through).   I think we should try to focus on ongoing inequalities instead of historical  injustice as a general rule (although they are connected  and there are valid arguments for AA/reparations)."

"8:00 Female and transwomen brains have a smaller BSTc region than male brains. See video by c0nc0rdance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re8d7SZ3Ys0 There has to be a biological cause of gender dysphoria unless you believe in souls."
"Your dress is gorgeous."
"All your videos are amazing Natalie. So well thought out.   3:57 Your costume and lighting is stunning.   Thank you"

"WOOOOO! 2000 VIEWS FOR THE WIN! WE MADE IT!"
"I ADORE YOU <3"
"I'm a late 30's male, grown up in a somewhat 'progressive' country in north-western Europe. And I honestly don't care about what gender people decide they are.  Happiness is not a zero-sum game: Someone deciding they are happier being another gender, or having sex with people of their own sex, has no real bearing on other people's happiness. Unless those people are sadists who cannot enjoy themselves if other people don't conform to norms that are completely outdated in industrial or post-industrial societies."
"cant wait to see the genderless robot in the next 'Contrapoints out of context' video"
"As a British person myself, I would like to mostly approve of your tea-drinking etiquette (and this should come as a compliment, since we Brits are the self-designated masters of tea-drinking). However it has come to my attention that you have fallen into the most unfortunate bad habit of... *slurping* ... which as I'm sure you know is the gravest possible offence. I will now proceed to write a 2000 word essay on the subject of proper beverage-consumption manners and---  *observes the gathering crowd*  What I meant to say was, I really liked the video as always Natalie!"

"So Natalie’s inner Rad-Fem is the daemontte of Slaanesh, the golden one is referring to? Interesting XD"
"You're one of the few trans people who actually engages in a relatively intelligent way with these issues. For that I thank you. However, even after watching your videos and reading whatever 'academic' material I can find, I cannot but form the conclusion that the trans activist side is intellectually very weak. As a philosopher and critical thinker, I cannot support it."
"As a hairy, stubbly, be-knuckled cis woman, I can’t believe Germaine Greer played me like that and used it as an excuse to be transphobic."
"What do you recommend people who actually do want society to move beyond gender roles do? It really does seem like they're making a comeback compared to earlier decades. I can accept that trans people aren't making it 'worse' and are leaning into society the way it is,  but how can we make it better?"
