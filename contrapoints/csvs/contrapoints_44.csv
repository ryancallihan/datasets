"14:30 ugh I want Natalie to call me a little goose 😔"
"14:13 'Mhm.' Oh god, my dying hahaha"
"But isn't one of humanity's greatest strengths our ability to defy our base instincts, to organize how we like, to make our own nature? We're obviously not aquatic crustaceans, why should we mimic lobsters just because they're 'natural'?"
"So postmodern social neo-marxical fascist tryptophantical stalinesque political coulrophobic maoism is just the newest conspiracy that conveniently includes anything the creator doesn't like. Good to know."
"Trust me, if there WAS a massive liberal conspiracy, Trump would not be in office."
"Conservatism and liberalism seem to differ on the point of suffering, in that conservatism would like to grin and bare it, because the status quo seems fine and to attempt improvement could end in disaster, where as liberalism would do all it can to fix the problems it sees, because a better world is worth the risk"
"'And for once, i would acctualy treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect it deserves.' *proceed to make a funny not serious clip with Dummy Peterson* That was funny, but also Dummy Peterson answers with machine beeps, wich is also hilarious because it represents how what he says is based on logic, and all that Contra understands when listening to logical sentences is beeps hahaha."
"I love the channel. I tend to agree with most of what you are saying. The only criticism I have here was the statement that 'no leftist thinks this' in reference to biological sex. The problem is that you don't have to look very hard to find leftists who say exactly those kind of things. I don't think that completely invalidates your argument, but we have to acknowledge the fact that there are some whack jobs that will argue that biological sex is a 'western construct'. Almost everything that comes out of the mouth of neocons and other right leaning wingnuts is horse shit. However, there are people on the left that deserve criticism for bad ideas and for generally making the  left look bad. I know that too many people get hung up on this and further hurt the left by making it  their only focus. They do this while the right continues to consolidate power. This is a huge mistake. But there is a place for criticism of those who claim to be representative of the left and say off the wall shit. So anyways, good work as usual. Hope to see a new vid soon."
"*Pedants Voice* AKCHYUALLY CATHY NEWMAN WORKS FOR CHANEL 4. ** But it is an easy mistake to make."
"You should do a video on Jared Taylor. He's the new 'intellectual' arm of the white supremacy movement. He's well spoken, and this appeal is reinforced by the fact that whoever he debates rages at him. I feel like a video with your calm delivery and demeanor would serve as the perfect counterpoint to his 'message'."
"You restrained yourself from trashing JP's most bonkers ideas ('Witches are real', 'Forced Monogamy', 'Disney cartoons featuring princess and talking snowmen are the work of Marxists'). Admirable restraint I guess, but I would have gone there."
"This was actually incredibly structured and organized.  This video was much better than Cathy Newman or the other interviewers/JP opponents that essentially sat down and did nothing besides call him a fascist, bigoted, racist. Incredibly well done and thorough.  However, I have one criticism about the video.  Jordan Peterson does not believe transgenderism leads to Stalinism nor does he oppose calling transgender people by their preferred pronouns.  He quite simply believes in the CHOICE of calling people by the preferred pronouns or not.  He has repeatedly said that if a student asks him personally and politely to call them something, then he is more than happy to oblige.  However, he does not agree when he is FORCED to call someone a pronoun for the following reasons:    A.) It is a breach of freedom (albeit a minor one)  B.) It is not always easy to interpret which pronoun a person prefers and how would he legally be held accountable if he mistook a pronoun by incorrectly guessing (since he most likely was not personally asked by the person)?   Jordan Peterson and a large majority of his supporters believe forcing people to say stuff is quite dangerous because if we impose censorship (even at a small scale) and ask our governments to regulate censorship about subjective things like pronouns and 'hate speech' (there is genuine hateful speech but it is subjective - one person might find criticisms/jokes as hate speech and one may find Nazi propaganda as hate speech), we risk making censorship the social norm and we become frogs in gradually heating water until we croak - e.i. before we realize we overdid it with the censorship.  And another thing:  It is not safe to let governments interpret what violates 'hate speech' laws or the like.  Hate speech is so vague and subjective that my idea of hate speech could be vastly different than yours - which leaves courts to pretty much say anything could be hate speech and throw anybody in jail for trivial reasons (for example, being a political opponent).  Take Count Dankula, for example, he is not much besides an internet edge-lord that makes edgy JOKES for HUMOUR.  He made a joke (an edgy one of course) by making his pug do a Nazi salute when he says 'gas the jews.'  Yes, it is clearly offensive, but that is what edgy jokes are - offensive.  Was the joke funny?  Probably not.  Does he support Nazi beliefs and regimes?  I don't know - does PewDiePie support Nazi regimes for doing an edgy Nazi joke?  NO.  He has stated many times that he is absolutely against Nazi regimes and the death and imprisonment that they impose.  Heck,  Count Dankula is a frickin' Libertarian.  And guess what?  The United Kingdom parliament said that this JOKE violated their vague hate speech laws and he was threatened with *jail time* and a hefty fine for a JOKE.  Granted, he has only an 800 pound fine now, but he has effectively been labeled a Nazi by the media, exhausted financially from the legal fees, and no one will hire him because of this JOKE.   *tl;dr:* Jordan Peterson and his followers (and most conservatives) have very few problems with the transgender community and instead; they are worried about the ever growing prominence of censorship in our society.  We have huge tech corporations like Google and Facebook controlling what we can and can't say.  We have media that will pick up an edgy quote you said at age 17 and dox you and ruin your entire life.  We are starting to ask our government to control what we can and can't say.  We are at a point where an edgy joke can send you to jail.  In short, JP and his followers are quite simply terrified of the censorship and that's about it - or at least how I interpreted it.   P.S.  Again, this was a spectacular opposing video with some strong arguments and definitely proves liberals can also engage in productive debate."
"'I'm gonna divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it' HA"
"This is brilliant! Well done.  I'm  not as enamored with Peterson as everyone else is."
"Im a spanish conservative enduring depression and i think i love you😻"
"I liked peterson when he was talking about apparent male aggression but then he praised it instead of admonishing it.... I watched a lot of his stuff after that, and a few of my friends like him, but he always seems to get the wrong message. He is just so wrong I don't know if he is lying or stupid."
"The lobster analogy is to explain hierarchies, not necessarily to justify them.  You can explain phenomena without saying that they *should* exist.  He's saying that inequality is a deeper problem than just capitalism."
"visiting centrist here. i love my dad, but what really bothers me about peterson is that peterson has the cognition to genuinely engage both the moderate and radical modern left, but instead chooses to vaguely fuck around this goofy and outdated strawman of a leftist he frankensteined from watching ben shapiro compilations and his freudian nightmares of stalin's resurrection. its as distasteful as hearing my actual dad talk to me about how millenials are ruining everything after reading a fox article from 2016."
"I liked your video, I really did. I think you expressed precisely the strange, stern derive taken by Peterson, which is quite unfortunate, because he started great and compassionate a couple of years ago.   At the same time, you can see why he gets his success, because he is able to speak to young white men, a group of people who are basically told that they are wrong no matter what they are or what they do or do not do or try to do, that they should pay for some strangely elusive privilege they are considered to hold, which become less thin, complex and evanescent the more one tries to pinpoint it to easy slogans, and that they should therefore be despised and should shut up.   He gives them understanding, support, purpose, some goal to achieve, instead of empty suffering. Of course they will then listen to ALL of the things he says,  because mostly everybody else is spiteful.   And you can see from the comments here why he will be even more successful in the time being. Because many people here are spitting hate and venting their own difficulties onto mostly innocent, decent people. This is quite undestandable, but at the same time, while people vent and scream and despise, they can't listen and look and think. A divide (many, actually) exists, and this is the way to widen it.   I suspect this is the main message we should keep. Listen up to the world around and to other people, because we are all very different ways of expressing our extremely similar human nature."

"So happy to have found you!!!"
"I just discovered this channel, and you are fucking brilliant."
"Excellent critiques! Find more here: https://youtu.be/KwzVM2uIx7U"

"Love this video and ContraPoints overall Yay! 😊👍"
"🐸🐸🐸 *CHAPO*"
"A friend encouraged me to watch this. I have. It's dishonest, unfair and unkind from start to finish."
"'Clock me Amadeus'   LMFAO I did not catch that on my first watch. 10/10"
"*SO MUCH FOR THE 'TOLERANT' JACOBINS*"
"I'll be honest, going into this video I did not expect this entire presentation of yours. I went into the video with the expectations of a developed deconstruction of Jordan's philosophy and ideas, and while I certainly got that, I was not prepared for everything up to 9:40. Slightly uncomfortable, but in hindsight immensely funny.   Thanks for making such a informative video, it was certainly both educational and entertaining to watch!"
"Nonsense of an immature, cowardice girl."
"Couldn't watch after 5:30, too much faggotry"
"Is this supposed to be critical thinking? youre far from JP’s league, I highly doubt you could even get close"
"Holy crap...this is like, at least the seventh time I've watched this video (but, important below, maybe only the second time since living in Quebec). I never caught you misspelled 'Foucault' the way Sargon pronounces it in the caption...niiiiiiiiiiice."
"Does anyone know the song that plays at 14:25?"
"'So much for the tolerant Jacobims' Holy shit, Nat. Everytime I rewatch your videos I find new gems. This channel is an embarrassment of riches."
"Peterson in a complete nut case!"
"Came to this channel thanks to a great piece in On The Media, on your work in helping pull right wing extremists out of the rabbit hole - a crucially important task at this stage. Only watched this and the Incels episodes thus far and am already a devout fan. Stellar stuff. Very illuminating and entertaining. Thanks for your work, Natalie! So nice to hear a clear voice of reason amongst all of the cacophony and screed."
"I absolutely"
"1. Love your content and creativity"
"2. Adore your sense of humor"

"Is this the best you people got against Jordan B.Peterson?  A /TTTT/ that makes shitty jokes?! Nope not my cup of tea! If you want some good videos though I would suggest Rationality Rules."
"13:04 we love this clip"
"Ughhhh my dad was watching this guy....I remember him talking about it and it made me not want to talk to my father at all, because do you know how exhausting it is for people to constantly question your gender or sexuality as if it's any of their business"
"21:50 I know someone who has said that."
"I know this far from the point of the video, but the grout between the tiles in the bathroom was brilliantly clean. I was impressed enough to comment on that.  OK back to paying attention to the actual points made in the video!"
"Peterson is a guy who if you think about what he says for more than no seconds it all falls apart."
"You think post-modernism is vague? Try equality."
"this is forn for polsci graduates"
"holy shit... this video is comedy genius! good fucking job contrapoints! never knew this existed until armored skeptic mentioned you. this is a total ROFL video.        ok... you also shouted out skeptic damn you are a lady and i mean that in a positive way!"
"I want to both upvote and downvote this video; so, I guess I will do neither."
"Contrapoints analyses the left from an ideological perspective whereas Peterson is against ideologies and in favour of pragmatism. That’s the big point that is missed in this video."
"Medically reconstructing genitals. I wonder why you didn't show some folded ham slices being trimmed down the front, you filthy jew-shill. I'm starting to enjoy hating every human on the planet. It's like you're all playing charades at my schizophrenic tendencies, and you keep drawing bleeding baby penises whenever I least expect it. Burn in hell, channel I just subscribed to."

"Since the release of this episode of contrapoint, Jordan Peterson has gone on a Falun Gong publication to give an interview as a part of the publication's anti-marxism series. It was a doozy, because the interviewer was asking questions that couched their anti-prc goals as academic anti-marxism, and jordan peterson either didn't understand or didn't care to, and answered it with his frankfurt school, jewish thought police, progressive us/canada politics talking points. In the end, it felt like two people having an agreeable conversation even though they were unintelligible to one another. Jordan peterson didn't care about chinese political thought, and falun gong didn't care about jewish people and lgbtq politics in the west."
"9:50 is that young Jordan Peterson behind her?"
"Peterson is fine with using trans pronouns. He's against being arrested for not using them."
"I was 100% going to say how the Greeks understood  sexuality  way better then modern culture 100% due to christianity. But you beat me to it :)"
"Postmodern Feminists want to show that the whole concept of of womanhood, for instance, is contingent and possibly oppressive, and they think we should be working to destabilize and undermine it.    Postmodern Neo-Marxists want to show that the whole concept of competence, for instance, is contingent and possibly oppressive, and they think we should be working to destabilize and undermine it.   HMMMMMMMMMM. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM"

"So the left aims to adjust unfair hierarchies of gender, race, and economics by creating exclusive political units based gender, race, and economics? Change the word 'adjust' in my last sentence to 'keep' and it reads like a musings of a white supremacist. Whatever you want to call the left's guiding philosophy,  it's obvious that it has has some real issues to sort out."
"Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market-place, and cried incessantly: 'I am looking for God! I am looking for God!' As many of those who did not believe in God were standing together there, he excited considerable laughter. Have you lost him, then? said one. Did he lose his way like a child? said another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? or emigrated? Thus they shouted and laughed. The madman sprang into their midst and pierced them with his glances.  'Where has God gone?' he cried. 'I shall tell you. We have killed him - you and I. We are his murderers. But how have we done this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained the earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? Away from all suns? Are we not perpetually falling? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is it not more and more night coming on all the time? Must not lanterns be lit in the morning? Do we not hear anything yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we not smell anything yet of God's decomposition? Gods too decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves? That which was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? With what water could we purify ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we need to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whosoever shall be born after us - for the sake of this deed he shall be part of a higher history than all history hitherto.'  Here the madman fell silent and again regarded his listeners; and they too were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern to the ground, and it broke and went out. 'I have come too early,' he said then; 'my time has not come yet. The tremendous event is still on its way, still travelling - it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds require time even after they are done, before they can be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the distant stars - and yet they have done it themselves.'  It has been further related that on that same day the madman entered divers churches and there sang a requiem. Led out and quietened, he is said to have retorted each time: 'what are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchres of God?'"
"What a great fuckin' video"
"But didn’t Jordon Peterson actually use the word “post-modernism” before?"
"“A fucking racist and also Scottish.”"
"The left want one thing. Equality between groups.  Example:  Women and men should earn the same amount of money as a group.  They want quotas so there is 50 % of both genders in top jobs.  They hate the idea of Equality of opportunity and only want Equality of outcome.  They hate and i mean HATE anyone making fun of sexuality, race, gender or the muslim religion in a way they dont approve.   They deny that any causation can be there unless the underlying problem is based in 'hate', 'sexism', 'racism' 'trans-homophobia' and allays want to go back to the oppressor and oppressed narrative."
"How would you describe a philosophy about dividing the population into oppressed and oppressor?"
"Is it a marxist way of thinking?"
"How about the"
"idea that we do not use Science and measurable date to guide our way of looking at Gender or Race."
"Is it not a postmodernism?    so what are Left-wing Activist pushing for?   I think they want to erase the individual and only look at people as groups that either oppress or are being oppressed.  They want to erase these difference between groups (like men and woman) without carrying about the underlying causation.  They often want a flat economy between everyone. They will go full out communism just so they can level what they find to be injustice.   I do not think its injustice that men make more then woman on average.  Men work more hours every week on average.  They work in jobs that pay more and are more dangerous.  They are allot stronger and faster then women biological, so they have more options on what to work with.   The left wing today are a new type of marxists. Maybe not Postmodern-neo-marxist. But its a group that want to erase the differences you se between the oppressed and the oppressors. Thats there world view on a basic level."
"you are soooo pretty!!!!!!!!!!"
"How dare you attack Jordan Peterson! The man who brought us such an intellectual position such as you can't quit smoking without God.   WAIT WHAT?!"
"He’s a fraud and a grifter, just like the rest of these pseudo-intellectuals.  If more people read, then they wouldn’t be so in awe each time these fascists string together polysyllabic words and call it intellectualism.  There’s nothing edgy or counter-cultural about fascism."

"Oy! Less of the Scottish bashing, thanks!"
"I have had four different teenage boys suggest I just watch Jordan Peterson videos in moments where I was struggling mentally. Thus, I’m almost 100% convinced that boys who just need therapy and a nice big hug run into daddy Peterson’s welcoming arms of two-bit-self-help and warped intellectualism instead of actually getting therapy and working through their anxiety and ruinous self-image"
"I hope that it was soy milk that you poured on him"
"All this talk of lobster is reminding me of an old joke.   A queer with a butt infection goes to a scruffy doctor, only to be told that the cure is to swish a lobster in there. So the doctor proceeded, then sent the queer back home with a nightly prescription."
"Come night, the queer asks his dad to help him with the remedy. Confused, the dad asks: 'If I am spreading both of your buttcheeks with my hands, how am I supposed to stick a lobster in?' So the queer goes 'THAT SON OF A...!'"
"ContraPoints are you an effing genius? Two days ago I had never heard of you! The talent, the humor, the intelligence, the creativity ... what's going on here?!! Help!"
"Lucifer lives here"
"so i dont really know if someone commented it till now, but just in case no one has i will. According to the lobster daddy himself (too fucked right now to look for the links, but i was into some of his lectures back in the day and i still kinda like a lot of his talks about meaning in life) his idea of neo-marxism is, that if broken down to its principles, marxism states that people belong to groups, that who they are and what their value in society is, is defined by their groups and that one group always works to opress another, while every relationship between groups is a form of struggle for power. He then claims that modern identity politics is similar to that as it divides people into groups (PoC; LGBTQ people; Male & Female etc.) and asserts that some groups are opressors while other are the opressed and that your role as a human is dictated by what group you belong to. He (as a liberal (not really in the modern sense) individualist) opposes that with the argument, that what group you belong to shouldnt matter, that only your individual character should be judged and that identity politics highlighting differences between groups is harmful to that. So in a sense, he has a point, but his arguments are completely detatched by our social and political reality and donte take into account that it might be neccessary to use people divided in groups to correct past wrongdoings and create a leveled playing field for people to act within as individuals."
"Identity politics is not the advocation of rights it’s merely the splitting of people into groups.  The “HR Department” does this but so did the Nazis so that’s clearly not linked to giving out rights  The problem with the whole thing: people should “not be judged by the colour of their skin (insert any category ie sexuality, gender) but the content of their character” MLK jr  I truly believe in full equality but discrimination is still discrimination even if you frame it as benefiting a needing group it’s not necessarily the case.  Yes it’s stupid to say “I don’t see such and such” but it’s so damaging to say. You are being judged on your “identity” rather than the content of your character which is what matters!"
"Is there actually any argument that a law should compel your speech?   No? (Peterson) Yes? (No one)   Why can’t I just call everyone a knob? Freedom"
"Why can't nobody seem to make leftist videos withour disturbing bullshit in them ?     I mean there was that guy, Oliver Thorn, but ... yeah"
"I like both JP and Contra so this video was just confusing to watch"
"i have no idea what anything shes saying means because all the psychological stuff is confusing and hard to process for me due to Big Boy Words and many references to famous ppl idk but i sure am entertained"
"i found your channel after overhearing my professor's conversation and oh my god thank you for putting words to thoughts i could never make coherent. i think i love you okay thanks bye"
"Damn, everyone needs to see your videos at least some point in their lifes."
"Jordan Peterson did not primarily speak out against personally using transgender pronouns, at least no from what I have heard. He was against it being compelled by law."
"Bravo!"
"Love this. I'm a pretty big Peterson fan too, as far as personal development goes. He brings up good points on criticism of the left (see, Gulap Archipalego, many of the 'liberals' I deal with in Portland who are just hateful), but overall he gets a C from me on political issues. You did a really good job here of breaking down his shortcomings.  Loooooove your points that acknowledge how people on the left could benefit from personal development ideas (yeah, they're really not common knowledge).   BTW, I dont think you're content to just sit around and watch reruns, as you're out here killing it with these videos ;)"
"I'll never understand how anyone takes Jordan Peterson seriously."
"So nilhistic & negative, let's just not think about anything and enjoy our time relaxing"
"Lol the voice gives it away every time 😂"
"nobody can see the big picture also i can't explain my ideas"
"nothing is real. the scientific method is sick though"

"wait what if life isn't suffering i know it is but if you cure it wouldn't life not be suffering"
"ii kinda like him i hope you don't change my mind"
"'clock me Amadeus' may be my new favorite quote from you after watching this for the third time 😂"
"i doubt JBP would be against this video lol, he loves conversation and people engaging in critical thinking.  he doesn't need to agree with everyone."
"People out here thinking big thunks and im just trying to figure out why I dont wanna fuck trans people, life is strange."
"There is no Foucault? What do you mean he's dead? I GOT BOXES FULL OF FOUXAULT!!!!"
"Wow some of the comments here are really thought out and mostly respectful . Thankfully we live in a society that is capable of thought, reason, and growth. Some cool comedy that made me laugh and the '' I disown them all '' statement was a great call to being a individual !"
"I really like JBP's self help stuff, and I kinda get his not wanting to criminalize misgendering. But I also never really understood what the 'grand scheme' of his enemies was. I also appreciate you pointing out how non-homogeneous Western thought truly is. You really made it feel like we're not people on clear cut sides, but all a bunch of idiots in a big room parroting the ideas closest to us. Cool video"
"omg, u look so pretty!!!! this look suits you :D"
"You neglected to mention Chomsky."
"I JUST SMOKED A BUNCH OF PCP = instant sub"
"1:30 This is a lie. You are gaslighting again."
"26:02 nice"
"I didn’t think I’d like this video, but a few minutes in, I have laughed out loud about ten times.  Well made, and spoken calmly without anger like some other political commentators."
"lady fobentin ( no clue how to spell the name) reminds me of max from rpdr"
"that part on sarde was straight up bullshit"
"JP: Maoism and transgender people can be compared, because they share philosophy Also JP (a Jung and Solzenitzyn fanboy): How dare you compare me with fascists and anti-semites!"
"I love you contra points!"
"Very insightful and sober analysis of JP. Thank you."
"'I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP' I lol'ed."
"felt like this one got over my head for a bit but then I really enjoyed the breakdown of his debating techniques around 20:00"
"Non on the left rejects? ah that was the greatest joke ♥"
"Philosophize This! has an episode, two parts, recently about Carl Schmitt on liberalism. The classical sense of the word. I HIGHLY recommend this episode and honestly every episode of the podcast. but yeah. Its eye opening in that; its rough explanation for the origins of our political parties is unique and honestly shocking once one starts to relate personally to the hidden ideals we sign up for.  And just our general ideologues that we subscribe to by visualizing certain inherent character traits of individuals we admire within our society. Admiration based on values coded into our identity from birth, through every single influence imaginable.   or something."
"JP is simply a rhetorician and demagogue. He speaks to deep rooted desires and appeals to young men who feel lost in an  opaque and uncontrollable world. If he helps people, great. But take what he says with a grain of salt. The fact that you can't pin him down to any particular view should make you question his motives."
"I kinda went the reverse of this video. I watched your video first, then learned a lot about JP and honestly I'm a big fan of his now. He changed my view on a lot of things. But then I'm also a young...ish.. male. Now watching your video again I appreciate your measured approach to what he's talking about. You're probably the only person who has been critical of him that I can stand to watch because everyone else just makes an assumption based on what they've been told about him by others. Or at least thats what it seems like."
"Love the 2001: Space Odessy reference at the end."
"The cadence of his voice, prone to a lot of mid-sentence pauses, makes Peterson sound like he's flustered in the bath scene, and this idea amuses me."
"white men will never be outdone in anything..  Not even being a woman."
"I am a JBP fan in terms of his philosophy of individual responsibility but I do agree with some of the criticisms about his political views. I love, love, love this video! It's hilarious! I think JBP himself could not help appreciating the laugh out loud hilarity of this video. Bravo! Someone should send this to him. He'd love it!"
"I'm on the other side but appreciate the video and humor.  I think you and him should have a 'real' one on one.  And record it for us to watch."
"18:07 I just realized I'm a Postmodernist."
"I would have loved to watch this but whoever is presenting made it unwatchable, very annoying, can you please redo the video but speak in a normal voice."
"Scholars would call it 'Abrahamic religions.' But I'll leave it to as to why these people leave out Muslims.."
"Please tell me where you got your wig."

"This entire video is straw-manning Peterson, and I’m not even a Peterson fan. She does exactly what she criticizes that reporter for doing in the beginning of the video - she takes bad-faith or misunderstood examples of Peterson’s theories and then argues against them, which proves nothing because she’s not arguing against Peterson’s actual ideas she’s just beating up the straw man she created.  A whole 10 minutes in and she’s said Peterson compares transgender “activism” to Stalinism many times, yet doesn’t address the issue of government forced pronouns - that’s Peterson’s whole example of Stalinism, the fact that the government is forcing you to use certain words - and she doesn’t even acknowledge it, instead just acts like Peterson is crazy for making the comparison. Government laws forcing you to use certain words =/= “equal protection”. The government does not fine you for calling a man a woman, so they should not fine you for calling a FtM a woman either. That’s equal. Where’s the counterpoint to that, which is Peterson’s real argument?  The description of what Peterson defines postmodernism as is completely off as well. His main characterization of postmodernism is people who believe power structures are complete fabrications and have no basis in reality - the upper class is there simply by chance, not because of higher capabilities. All power structures are constructs with no merit and therefore they are unjust - that’s the neo-Marxism part because what follows logically is to dissolve all power structures because they are oppressive.   There’s more examples too, here’s the last one I feel like typing because it actually made me laugh. “On the left we don’t tell people what to do, unlike Peterson” *first example is a Peterson rule on something NOT to do (allow kids to do bad things)* *second example is another rule on what NOT to do (criticize others)* *there is no third example*"
"This by far the best and most concise explanation of western ideologies/philosophies of Marxism, neo-Marxism, modernism, and post-moderni-sm/ty, all packaged under Jordan Peterson (he has a stench that reminds me of Jared Diamond). At the end of the day these fucks are just arguing for some form of  westernized ideology, while giving continuity to the western project: to impose its ideology on all others and ensure that white Europeans are the only survivors in this planet (at least the only rulers; their project is really going well as the universities in the US hold a great percentage of white tenure track motherfucking professors). Natalie, you are brilliant! Thank you so much for your genius voice!"
"Hey I don't really know where to ask this but has contrapoints done any videos on mansplaining? It's hard to find videos explaining it and when I google it I just get a bunch of anti-fem videos saying it's not real but I would like to see a video that talks about it without much bias or at least less bias. Thanks in advance"

"its an interesting thing in this world... how if you mutter one sentence that sounds like  deepak chopra... we can just dismiss everything else you say you stupid stupid fuck. (you know who I'm talkin bout, nobody talks like deepak and gets away with it)"
"It's fine attacking political views that do not overlap your own, but we should do this with the intent to dilute the debate and the 'clear as day' messages that were being thrown into discussion.   Watching the debate of Peterson with Katie, I understood where Katie was coming from.   You have made some vague points in your 'post-modernist' debate, defending Katie and attacking Peterson, while also mentioning that there is an unbalance between M v F in government jobs. How do we deal in present day, where the EU has over 50% females in their parliament which is based on merit and not the need for 'enforced' balance.     Going back to the social context of that time and that debate ... I think this is as well an attack on the equality of opportunity for the other males if we enforce equality in quantity instead of quality. This is where the 'Marxism' comes in the 'Neo-postmodernism'. 'Values of the west' are those that stood for democracy and capitalism, while those of the east are those predominately enforced by Russia after WW2  on half of the Europe, those mostly lying in the East. Marxism might've been born in Germany (west), it was preached by the (east).   Most of the modern philosophy that we cling to in modern day society, has its roots in the west.    Thanks for the valuable history in philosophy.   While I do not share your views on the debase with Peterson, I do not share his views either on his other debates, I still think my time spent on this video was entertaining and though provocative. Thus I've subscribed to see more of your content."
"1. Nop , petterson no usa argumentación de auto ayuda ya que sus tesis sw basan en el razonamiento del argumento contrario llevándolo al análisis y ala ejecusion . La auto ayuda por otra parte deja claro un egoísmo total diciendo que todos podemos ser algo si lo deseamos y si no , pues es culpa tuya por no desearlo tan fuerte .... Las tesis de petterson no se basan en esto . Estás usando parte de la premisas de sus tesis para decir que es autoayuda sin dar un análisis real .una falacia de AUTORIDAD sin dudas   2. El pensamiento Neo marxista posmoderno es más bien un producto del marxismo cultural están ligados pero no son lo mismo de forma directa ya que el ' pensamiento Neo marxista ' es un producto del marxismo cultural o también llamado por la propia escuela de Frankfurt teoría crítica que es criticar todo ámbito social bajo la lupa de las ideas de Marx pues eso es el.marxismo cultural es la teoría crítica dicha de una forma más actual pero que es básicamente eso . No es conspiración de los nazis esa es una falacia del Espantapájaros ( lo cual se me hace gracioso sabiendo que incluso Stalin y la.mayoria de magnates de la unión soviética eran judíos , y que los propios judíos se identifiquen con el marxismo ) ....   3. Petterson jamás les dice como vivir a las personas esto es otro aspecto del Espantapájaros de toda tu tesis ... Estás descontextualizando la tesis de petterson no estás REFUTANDO nada realmente"

"Fürst of all i fucking love this channel. I also like Jordan Peterson. I don’t agree with every opinion of his as I don’t agree with every Contrapoints opinion but I definitely respect both of your argumentative abilities. I’d just say that I think it’s not Peterson’s self help advices  that are a Trojan horse for his political opinions but the other way around. People are tired by left-leaning “SJW” politics and Peterson’s great at putting that into words and when they look more into his stuff do find out he has more interesting things to say. Overall his message is good, although he can definitely go overboard at times and be a bit of an asshole. On top of that he’s just plain wrong when it comes to some important stuff. Mainly not, however. But I’m a centrist so what do I know."
"Big Peterson fan right here, but DAMN, this video is really well-made, very informative and brings up very good points. And the comedic elements were fucking hilarious! I do still love JP though, but it would dope if you got to sit and talk face to face"
"I'm a fan of Peterson and I'm a big fan of yours after your incel video. All it took was one video and a recommendation from my friend. This is quality content."
"Very nicely made video. The only politics related thing I really agree with Peterson on is that vague rules on speech should not be enforced by the State, as there's a chance that the vagueness of such laws could be used to censor political ideas (e.g. hate speech is criminalized and Trump and his government declare that speaking against, say, how racist he is would be hate speech)"

"Wow, that is a great video. I am way more stupid that you, but i am going to try to argue against, because it is fun and why the fuck no. You are saying that when Jordan Peterson says 'postmodern neo-marxists' he is talking out of his ass. I agree with you, and logically his portrayal of left is wrong. But i think it is important to say two things, firstly he is not a philosophy graduate, he is psychologist, and this is why it is hard for him to portray them correctly, and secondly, the left itself is so shattered and convoluted, that it is hard to understand what they want, and why. But in a society, outside very of political leftist you can see two main trends in-trend to abolish all  social constructs, and trend to fight against oppression of capitalism.  Although, as you say, this to movements are in odds, from an outside you can see one thing that tie this people, they are all against traditionalism, which is, obviously, in a lot of people perception is 'the west'. This are traditions, therefore they are old, therefore represent the western ways. So, naturally, Peterson, and a lot of regular folks see left as a bunch if crazy, trying to destroy everything that looks like a somewhat good working hierearchy . And they want to stop it because they know-there are good things in order. I am not saying, that because of that Peterson justified to be wrong, but his mistakes are understandable, and it is more problem of the left, that need to some kind to restructure, if they want to be understood, and they need more voices like yours to be heard and to represent what is left. There are a bunch of crazy people in a left wing right now, and to downplay it like 'few weirdos' to support a misrepresentation of this movement. Also, Peterson was never against a request for a pronounce. I am not a fan of JP, just have nothing going on in my life, and trying to sound smart about things that doesn't matter is making me feel important. Love your video, great work!"

"the point about academia extremism being a tiny slice of reality is a lazy, unsustainable pathetic point that intentionally skips any analysis and just makes the universal claim attempt. you know it, everyone knows it. you are intentionally skimming on it for partizan convenience. academia is the root of culture influencing  for the next few decades. the professors of the 60's essentially introduced what today is the flanel shirt book reading hippie-light stereotype. they were the first to seriously integrate philosophy with science and practicality, and whereas before the role was relegated to one in a million geniuses that mostly got discovered half a century later, the academic hippie-lights defined a new age culture introducing a lot of elements into the mix, which are common today. atheism, peace of mind, the structure of being, meditation, historical context, while all the while making fierce advancements in technology. this is an extremely common figure today. and it's exclusively thanks to academic influence. young people are impressionable and looking for role models, and your teachers/masters are likely to influence you most outside of your family core, whenever you find great ones. by extension, the academic figures and their influence then moved into hollywood, not least because of book adaptations made by mostly academic thinkers, which were some of the biggest movies back in the '60-'80 era.   to think that all of this taking place then just doesn't influence the general public, which in first world countries finds more meaning in entertainment than anything else, is simply idiotic.     ignoring this point is intentionally being disingenuous. just because a group of people is small doesn't mean it won't be influential. look at internet edgy trolls. look at 3 people creating a meme around the OK sign that led to its meaning and ban. Look at Milo Yannopolous. Look at steve jobs. Look at Elon Musk.   i find it funny how all the criticism is like a hivemind script, not in the opinions themselves, but which ones warrant explaining and which do not. you all, each single one, follow the same unfounded assumptions for the same exact issues."

"This was exceptionally well done. I finally understand what pomo [and modernism] is. My other current hero @Russ Roberts is definitely a skeptic, so now i can see that I sympathize with both postmodern and 'archetypal' ideas. I'm a huge fan of Peterson's, and this raises some useful critiques [with some great comedy to boot] of his word choice and asks for clarification on how he believes we discern what is moral."
"Which he commonly confesses he's always trying to improve by studying the audience, the questions that come up, and paying careful attention to what the interviewer/debater says.   From how I understand his answer to that, he definitely talks about a neuro-biological-meta physical etc fundamental layer of reality being what we grapple with [hence the re-naming of Jacob to Israel, which means 'he who wrestles with God'] And that we get clues about meaning and right and wrong from our consciences, the things we find interesting and rewarding, and whether our actions are good for us, our families, and the world at large simultaneously.  I think he can be hyperbolic at times, but the main gist of his talk about HR departments/universities, is that he is *concerned* about the road that everyone segregating into their various 'political identities' and focusing intensely on the inevitable conflicts between groups, is what is driving the increasing polarization of left and right, which is a spectre of Collectivism [ie. Fascism AND Marxism]. Apologies for the run-on sentence there. It seems like a paradox perhaps: he says that there are differences when you look at the standard deviation between a large sampling of men/women for example, but is also concerned about if we focus too intently on that as a source of conflict.  If I were to [over] simplify, what I hear him saying is: we should recognize our inherent differences [like the classical feminists], but not so much that we create a new 'class' conflict [a la neo-Marxism]. Finding that happy middle ground is only as hard as we choose to make it. :-)  May the Force be with us all, even to the edges of Valinor."

"Thank you for actually taking on the points that people make. An unfortunate feature of debate in all circles, and sadly this does include liberalism, is the habit of trying to disarm your opponent not by actually defeating them or proving them wrong, but by making them confused, or calling out stupidities to shift the conversation, etc etc. It sucks and doesn't do people the favors they think it does for their point of views. When conservatives do this, they are seen as obstinate ostriches with their heads in the sand and a pole up their butts. When liberals do this, they are seen as stereotypically stupid and manic idiots.   Just because you called someone ugly doesn't mean you proved them wrong. You most likely gave them some new fans. Because everyone will almost always side with the underdog."

"A critique I have for this video is that you're strawmanning Jordan. The connection he draws between Marxism and Postmodernism is that a core aspect of their philosophies is that the world is best categorized as a battleground between people of a particular group identity, namely that of oppressed vs oppressor. Not only that, but the oppressed are necessarily morally superior because they are oppressed, and that there should be a change to bring about equality. Even if you disagree with the connection, you have to admit that *this* is the connection he's drawing (or else you would simply be wrong)."

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foUATcfD9rg  ^ Here Peterson explains the link he sees between post-modernism and Marxism. He follows Stephen Hicks, who basically says 'yes, postmodernism and marxism are incompatible. Marxists have used postmodernism as a dishonest slight of hand'.   I bit slippery of ContraPoints to say 'I am not saying Peterson is a Nazi, buuuuuuut.... his criticism of neo-marxism does resemble Nazi propaganda'. This is unfair - Peterson's critique may be wrong, but it is not unreasonable to propose a link between effectively 'postmodern' identitarianism, which is upset about inequalities of outcome, and Marxism, which is concerned with the same. They claim postmodernism is the cudgel used by marxists, not that postmodern neo-marxism is an intellectually coherent philosophy."
"Enjoyed it! You are fun and really smart.  I’d love to see you getting your responses directly from him though, and not from a real size picture that you control. I’m sure he would be smiling to you and saying “noooo this is not what I said!”.... and you would need to answer in your mind “I know, I totally got your point, and I think u are a genius, but I need to poison it otherwise how can I criticize and make fun of you?”"

Still I am very impressed by the content here. This video shows Contrapoints is very flexible in how she wants to present something. If I was to recommend the channel I think this one is a good starting point. Would have to get them used to the satirical and surreal humour, which I admit, I also need time to properly settle in.

"This is really well done. Nice"
"Thank you for your explanations. I have been having a heck of a time trying to figure out what Peterson means by 'postmodern'. It has been especially vexing since his 1 hour plus disagreement with Sam Harris about the epistemology of truth. Harris says that Peterson 'sees 'scientific realism as nested inside Darwinian competition' (which he views in ethical terms).' Peterson also said that truth arises out of morals. And most of us are like, WTF? Is this moral relativism which would be postmodern? So... Peterson is somewhat a postmodernist? No, Peterson is a learned person who has deceived himself."
"Well. One thing I noticed... If you look through the comments one thing is quite interesting. Most people who tend to agree with Peterson and usually support him often accept any arguments against him witch are well made and on point. I think that is not so common on the other side. One more thing. I think there is difference between telling people how to live and telling people that this particular way to do things usually leads to happier life. I know his words and sentences are 'slippery' but he himself admits that he needs to be very careful with words so people wont use it against him out of context. Didn´t expect you to read through all of this, here is your cookie. Anyway, I would say, don´t blindly follow and consume everything one person says. You can agree, learn and make your own ideas."

"Yeuuuup... I think this video reminded me of why I always rolled my eyes in my social sciences classes at marxists, non-marxists and the bullshit that Jordan Peterson says. The biggest irony that I find is that Jordan Peterson talks about hating on 'Post Modernism' but his ideas a very post modernist. I get that he's attacking 'Post Modern Neo-Marxism' but he fundamentally disagrees about universal truths that things happen in the world and somehow God is the answer to it all.   @21:10 There's actually a third option but requires a lot of work. You call him out on his anecdotal argument and he has admitted that he can't argue against collectivism well. His views are very inherently individualistic but they do not take into consideration of external influences (i.e. cultural or social influences). This would work against his stupid moronic anecdotal lobster argument. Yeah... I cringe way too much when hear him talk because it's mostly anecdotal arguments with the occasional straw man argument."

"There are so many big ideas in the air these days, it's very exciting (in an apocalyptic kind of way). I think a lot of conservatives get caught up in what Hume's Is/ Ought  problem.  They try to derive moral meaning from nature, they look at evolution and think it justifies Capitalism or they look at lobsters and think they tell us something about how we ought to live our lives. But we are those animals that are unfortunately have the wherewithal to make moral decisions, we are self aware evolution and so have to base our morality on something other than the bare mechanics that created us. We can see that our actions have consequences and so can use that to determine what ought to be for instance. But it's always complicated and like you say, the left loves to argue over minutia. The left offers complexity and the right offers simplicity, that's Trump's whole appea. In a world in which the complexity of it all is being revealed, Trump and  Peterson offer to build a wall around us, look at persons book subtitle. What the left needs is a positive (in the philosophical sense) worldview. We need to articulate what the better world we know is possible is, or better just start building it in small pieces (or connect the pieces that already exist)."
"Finally a leftist who gets that the whole postmodern everything-is-a-social-construct thing completely undermines the rest of the social justice movement.  I'll say that I don't think JP actually wants a return to invisibility for minorities or whatever, he just doesn't think that their problems are as big as the activists make them seem."
"It has now been two years since the bill Peterson has misrepresented to the public has passed. In the meantime, it's been clear that Peterson has pratically no knowledge of Marxism beyond having read the Communist Manifesto and has strange and nebulous concepts of religion and atheism if not outright truth. That's without considering the low profile bizarre things he says."

"As a logical thinker as opposed to an emotional thinker, I really enjoy listening to and respect Peterson for his commentary on society and the psychological aspects of why things are happening and why people do things. I would love to take his class, he is a deep and thoughtful thinker and I think the logical way he has of thinking and conveying his thoughts are why he is so popular and that popularity is continuously growing. People who do not see things as he does may have a different pov and that is fine, we are all entitled to our own opinion, until we're not."

Marxism comes into it by seeing the 'truth' as being defined by the powerful (again not totally inaccurate) and changing the focus from Marxist class analysis to a more general group based power analysis. I guess in the post modernism of Focault the only thing real is power itself. Identity politics and groups are real inasmuch they are affected by power or wielding power. But, you are right there is a confusion among us...  Hence, there is no such thing as gender and they was born the wrong gender can both exist and taken as truth by many people at the same time, which proves we have all gone a little bit mad. But, a very good video and you have gained a new subscriber. I would like to think that JP himself also would like to see a critical video on himself. Lastly, this is why I agree with JP that post modernists are particularly dangerous since they (many) believe there is no truth and only power really matters, they have sought out power and want to bend the 'truth' to their will.  That is their great evil...For those who are Tolkien fans, they have claimed the Ring for their own..."

"For a video criticizing the Lobster King, this has a surprisingly good like/dislike ratio"
"Just want to say that the infamous Cathy Newman interview was actually for Channel 4; the BBC has unusually strict protocols on interview style and balance. so strict - in fact - that the right wing in the UK has long figured out a fairly reliable method of subverting them and metaphorically grabbing the microphone. Their strategy is simple, but surprisingly effective.  1. At every opportunity accuse the BBC of being covertly leftist to the point that it almost becomes accepted fact. https://youtu.be/BfjF1o0tuBE?t=31 - Harry and Paul's Story of the 2's (commissioned by the BBC to celebrate BBC2's 50th birthday) 2. Loudly complain that any coverage of a political error by the right (or conversely that any omission  of coverage of a political error on the perceived left) is an example of bias. https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/bbc-bias/ - Peter Hitchens many blog posts for the Mail on Sunday on the apparent left-wing bias 3. When you have political power use it as far as possible to threaten and weaken the BBC. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/28/its-time-to-commercially-privatise-the-bbc/ - this was a louder cry back in 2016, but post-brexit the whole political dialog has gotten thoroughly jammed."

"I'm watching this video and asking myself why I'm still in university when your channel and all the other Lefttube channels are giving me a better education 😫"
"I'm a Peterson fan. I disagree with some of the opinions but definitely respect them and agree with the majority. They're valid and well informed. I think this comes down to ideological perspectives and what people as individuals want and care about. It's funny because I consider myself left leaning yet I disagree with a lot of leftist ideology around patriarchy, equality etc., but I also disagree with Peterson's views on western superiority; specifically impacts of neo-liberalism and capitalism. Then again that's my own bias showing."

"Nice video ~I really LMFAO at the bisexual manicure . 'Clock me Amedeus'  too.  I am confused by Contra's contrasting Marxism (orthodox) with post modernism , when Jordan Peterson says postmodern NEO- Marxism . She never addresses the Neo part at all in this vid . I like a hot entertaining video , but there are some problems here. NEO- Marxism incorporates Critical Theory and is completely compatible with the postmodern idea of subjectivism ~If there is no perceptive access to objective reality , then we are just left with groups competing for power with the narratives ingrained in them by the historical narrative of their group . There are NO individuals ~each person is just an Exemplar of the group to which they belong . That is the epitome of identity politics . Fits perfectly and that is why there is a marriage between Neo~Marxism and it's variants including extreme socialism and postmodernism ~'Faith requires the crucifixion  of reason'~Kierkegaard. So , society is just a battle of competing wills and words(even language itself), are just tools used in the struggle for power.Under such a schema , debate or discourse becomes impossible and there is no way different groups in society can negotiate or discuss . There is no open market place of ideas . One can either use their words, or lash -out . That is why a decent parent is always telling their child to 'Use their words'  ~ words mediate action and are the buffer to violence . That is why freedom of speech is not only a right , but it is more fundamental"

"I don't know if that is a new definition of identity politics that has come to light recently, but merriam-Webster defines it as, 'politics in which groups of people having a particular racial, religious, ethnic, social, or cultural identity tend to promote their own specific interests or concerns without regard to the interests or concerns of any larger political group.' Now I would say that I definitely appreciate the goals of the Identity politics defined in this video, can make it incredibly easy for anyone with a problem with collectivism (myself included) to miss understand what is meant by it. It also makes it extremely easy for the uninformed to dismiss it. Just a thought. Either way, great work :)"
"I’ve just spent almost an hour laughing at tiny head Professor Peterson in bed - I may need help 9:34"
"You will never pass."
"As if Peterson’s entire body of work can be appropriately critiqued in 30 minutes of satire by a self loathing YouTube ‘personality’, steeped in sensualistic nihilism.  The fact that anyone would consider this video as a useful counter to Peterson proves that the internet has done nothing to elevate our human race."
"And, yeah, a lot of people, particularly in the media here in't UK (esp. the Grauniad, of which I'm a reader) totally lost their shit over peterson. Never quite understood it myself, I think, on the one hand he's helpful for some people in his psychologicalism role and, on the other, he's a bit of kook easily led by his own hubris. Never really got why lots of people on the left saw him as public enemy number one, there are definitely much more egregious arseholes out there to get worked up about."
"Pedantic I know, but, the infamous Kathy Newman interview was on Channel 4 here in merry olde england not the Beeb. Doesn't really matter of course but I can't help myself."
"Let's review the 'highly localized problem of the left going too far' 1. Europe is collapsing under the weight of the refugee crisis 2. Antifa and far left activists are alienating moderates, causing a red wave 3. Research into anything related to gender, race or sex that doesnt conform is forced out of academia. 4. The media now ignores the execution of LGBTQ in the middle east. 5. The media now ignores women being oppressed in the middle east. 6.  The media now ignores literal slavery in Libya."
"So this is what mental illness would say if it could speak"
"I'm amazed at how someone could be so well spoken, but understand so little. We are indeed seeing the same phenomenon that we saw with Kathy nueman. The problem is that they are misidentifying said problem. It's not that Kathy nueman was purposely being uncharitable, it's that she legitimately didn't understand what was being said to her and therefore in an attempt to not look stupid, used the only information she had about the person saying the things she didn't understand to try to make sense of it. The problem there is the information she had was heavily biased and this made her look that way too. The lobster argument is a great example, jp is saying that social creatures arrange themselves in certain ways naturally, and it is not beneficial to try and fight the natural tendency of literally billions of people (e.g. because it won't work). And Kathy not understanding that just assumed he meant that lobsters were divine and we should mimic their behaviors in every way. Contra I'm sorry to say just doesn't understand the topics here. This becomes obvious when she says that people demanding certain people refer to them in a certain way (compelled speech) 'is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty' would want. It's painfully obvious this person doesn't understand the basic concept of individual liberty. Liberty is the freedom to do what is good for you, not the obligation to do what others think it's good for them."

"His book is actually brilliant."
"21:20 He is arguing against the idea that hierarchical structures are a social contruct. He does this by referring to lobsters because their hierarchical structures go back millions of years, proving that it's not something that was created by western patriarchy.

"Peterson’s argument against bill C-16 isn’t an argument against trans people themselves.   It’s an argument against enforced speech. Trivializing it as “the one thing liberals tell you not to do” and then proposing that Peterson commits a worse standard by telling people “what to do” are not equivalent. One is a person and another is government policy.   The problem with the bill is that you will be fined and go to jail for misgendering someone. There are many different reasons for misgendering someone. But the main thing is, not everyone agrees that gender equates to biological sex, and they’d prefer to use pronouns based on sex, not gender. Of course, reasons vary, some obviously malicious. But misgendering a person isn’t violence and should be considered protected speech. Outside of calls to actions and death threats, words shouldn’t be criminalized. I also don’t believe fining or punishing people who don’t agree as criminals would make them more open to the conversation of trans rights.   If transgender women are truly women, that shouldn’t matter since it’s not illegal to call a woman a man anyway.  Back to Peterson, he’s said many times that he is willing to address trans people by their pronouns. He’s also said that he won’t use them if he feels the person is not earnest in their request. Take that as you will.   His reason for attacking the trans-activists is not because they’re trans but because they are anti-free speech. By definition through their policy, and by the many counter-protestors who attempt to deny him a platform to speak by use of noise machines, shouting over him, unplugging his equipment, etc.   Not writing this to be a contrarian or a jerk, but I think this more accurately interprets his views and the people who appreciate him."
"I rather enjoyed watching Daddy in the tub...but...a conundrum has arisen...is that MILK being poured over him?  If so, is this some cryptogenic reference to the Alt Right attempts to hijack the meanings of popular icons?

"If 'postmodern neo-marxism' doesn't exist to destroy and rebuild the West then why does the far left hate the West and its history so feverishly?!  'Make America Great Again' is alleged by leftists  to be a Nazi slogan based on how America in years past was evil incarnate.  I don't know why Western leftists don't understand that 1. they hate their own countries when all they do is denunciate their conuntries' history, traditions and morés 2. that Western civilization is without a doubt the greatest achievement in human history.  Other countries like China have long and beautiful histories but they are filled with despotism up until present day with their prison camps for political dissidents and Uyghur Muslims."

"Huge Peterson fan here, I found you through Tim pool. I love the humor, i wish you and Peterson could have a discussion, he has discussed the incompatibility between Marxism and postmodernism."
"I don’t believe Peterson thinks the Neo-marxists are trying to destroy the world, I believe he thinks they will destroy the western world if we bow to their orthodoxy."
"Hum, I think Jordan Peterson addresses how he sees Marxism was smuggled into the Postmodernism. I think he dealt with that question many times in several of podcasts, even in few of JREs. I am surprised you did not challenge that directly if you thought that interpretation was false. He even talks about it in debate with Slavoj Zizek when Zizek specifically pins him down and ask him to point out which Postmodernist is Marxist, and JP tells him reason he sees that is their view points where the dividing the world into two classes where oppressed and oppressor (the patriarchy) where oppressed [insert any group that is marginalized here] is viewed as morally good.  I mean you can say that it isnt real post modernism when people are doing that, but people who are saying this wears the same outfit. Also, you keep say 'no one' in left is saying that.. but even your politicians are saying awfully same things. If you think that's not the left, and that's just fringe, then tell people to draw that boundary clearly because it is sure as hard to see it from the outside."
"Haha, “so much for the tolerant Jacobins.”"
"You started off with a blatant lie and expect people to believe you?  The law was not to protect transgender people, and that was not what he was objecting to.  What he objected to was being forced to use speech mandated by the government, or be fined or jailed for not using speech mandated by government.  Is there anyone dumb enough to believe anything this person says?"

I appreciate your honesty in regard to JBP. I'm totally a fan of the professor, and I disagree with a lot of what you say about his motivations, but I still appreciate what you present because its not really bias. Nobody else seems to be high enough in the I.Q. department to give the man any actual meaningful criticism. I think you still misrepresent 'the lobster' analogy tho...  And I think you know it too. You seem too smart to miss that point.     P.S. Please avoid sham outlets run by hacks like VICE. Showing up in places like that will attract the wrong audience for you and it really doesn't lend to your credibility. Because of your knack for objectivity, you have the ability to attract views from both sides of extreme politics, but only if you can get the right to take you 'seriously'. I would actually like to see you become ultra successful. The left needs people like you to help keep the right from getting too big, and right now, the left is losing that battle because there are so many people there who just don't have time to think for themselves."

"​Hierarchies are many times 'natural', a product of evolution. But everything that is natural is not necessarily moral or just. Nature can be very immoral, very cruel, very unjust. In fact, human civilization itself happened because humanity went against nature in many aspects. So, the point is, hierarchies may be natural but many of them are neither moral nor desirable for human civilization to become better."
"Why are your videos so sexual... like chill"
"What a brilliant human being."
"So much for the tolerant Jacobins!"
"Postmodernism replaces objective truth with 'your truth'. For instance, you are a man dressed as a woman. You are not a woman. If you want me to identify you as a woman by calling you the pronoun of your choice, that is postmodernism. Why? Because it is not objectively true that you are a woman, it's 'your' truth. Peterson has said that Neo-Marxism sneaks through the back door of postmodernism, which it does, because postmodernism has created the sociopolitical vacuum which leftists are filling with Neo-Marxism. 'Political correctness', which flowered after the Bolshevik revolution, seems to be the raison d'etre for SJW's. Hence, the control of speech. Who can speak and who can't, and what can they say? That is the question on college campuses Peterson observed first hand."
"This is so fkn weird and gay."
"Finally found a not so immaturely insane member of the left(?) to listen to.  I was a semi-fan of JP for a while until I began hearing his anti-'how I identify' stuff mixed in; so I distanced myself from his work a bit, albeit I had agreed to some degree with what he was saying even still, but I was not able to find another counter-argument personality with maturity & intellect to put any investment into listening to.  Until now.  Not saying I agree with you entirely or so, it is just that I had no one of the other side worth listening to.  I am someone who should be on the Left, in theory, but all I see on the Left, mostly, are whiny immaturity with a narrowminded worldview & cosmicview, so I end up leaning more to the right.  Politicians & Corporate Overlords need to be mature in order for the populous organized under them to not devolve into a Hellhole; but I have not been seeing that trait on the Left at all for those in any significant power.  The Left's diversity is strength thing I'd agree with, in theory, but their approach is too straight forward to the issue & discounts real world politics, and National functionality, that it devolves into an antithesis of their goals; or so it appears to me.  I'd rather live in a stable 'morally Evil' system, then a unstable, hypothetically, 'morally Good' system.  I am 'one of those people whom you'd expect to be on the left' but as I prioritize National Liberty & Economic Stability over morality: I am not politically on the Left.   Morality do not mean sh!t if you be dead."

"Is this a dude?"
"Look, I'm no 'Jordan Peterson expert', I don't know what he thinks behind his words and etc. BUT from what I understood he isn't against legislation to help the LGBT community neither does he think that helping trans people leads to totalitarism. (omg) Instead, the whole totalitarism thing emerges from the use of the law to enforce the use of some vocabulary, in this case, the pronouns. Pretty sure his issue is with the way its being done rather than its purpose.  I don't think he's anti-LGBT, I really do not get that from his speech. The fact he believes in the fundamental role of 'judeo-christian values' to 'the western society' doesn't mean he wants society to shush about minorities issues.    As a not-very-articulate-but-sexually-confused-and-gender-disphoric-male (phew), I just feel the deepest necessity to point out that not everyone who likes what he says is a god-damn neckbeard dammit"
"That part about cultural marxists trying to destroy western world is entirely your strawman. He never talked about any consipracy. It's just a branch of philosophy that got quite popular and he criticizes it.   As for post-modernism - yeah scepticism sound nice. A lot of things sounds nice, until you build overarching narrative obssesing about this one particular thing. Post-modernism didn't limit itself to the things it was meant for originally, things she mentioned in the video. No, it continued it path to a point where you are allowed (in the eyes of post-modernists) to be sceptic about anything. Even about hard data and evidence. And that creates rather dangerous rabbit hole."
"a pink flamingos reference! that's really nice."
"The credits song is 🔥"
"I like this lady."
"My comment is a response to 17:51 in your video: Identity politics is postmodern, per Amelia Jones. The contingency of self-hood means that privilege creates a schism of opportunities for some. A contingent self is a postmodern self. Stating that some have greater privilege would only be possible by seeing the self as non-Cartesian."
"To me watching and thinking of all things, there seem to be some sort of about mockery often over some actually few ideas Peterson talks about or facts about our culture he stresses over, I mean coming from people who try to like 'dismantle' Peterson's real face or de-idol him or something like that. I like Peterson and his ideas helped me a lot these few last years with really harsh stuff in my life at a very personal core level, and I really haven't even read his 'self-help book' everyone who just can't wait to jump at Peterson's bones for anything will criticize for 'being a self-help book'. And yes I am a man, and yes I am a 'white guy' (whatever that so much produces in certain people for worse results in judging me), and yes I'm a heterosexual man, though I had homosexual experiencies growing up and coming all the way to the place I'm today in my life, and yes I haven't had the best dad could have asked for for the raising matter with the 'father role' in my life, and yes I could find a fair bit of that feeling directed towards Peterson figure as well as few other men (and women) in my life experience. But I guess that is all mockery-worthy for a postmodern so smart vision of the world, I mean, I am being honest it sorta bothers how often and all about people who want to criticize the structure of western society or conservativism or Peterson for that matter always have to resort to ridicule 'regular hetero white people feelings' or something, and look all edgy and 'so interesting and diverse' and stuff. Like, I live in Argentina and am from there, you should go to public universities here and have a look at that situation, maybe you'd like it, but last time I tried to go and study, for which you need to have basic interaction with other students of course, first year students were so screwed with ideological frenzy, you couldn't say anything because they'd discriminate you in groups and comparing you with Hitler and those all sorts of really stupid stuff, and turned out past half of the year almost every one in my course seemed to hate me and I literally couldn't find groups who wanted to work with me, because you know I'm an angry aggressive white guy who has hidden plots and is up to no good, just because I had some opinions about stuff. And that's some of why I liked Peterson in the first times I got to see videos of him on youtube, he talks about all this shit that happens in our society, where the so-friendly leftist people are the ones who display the more totalitarianish behaviours, and I've seen it, I did see it in several levels and times in my life, and I do think there's some potencial danger around to take some notice of, maybe not comparing with Stalin but still, and you know how Peterson is all into Jungian way of conceptualizing the human mind and soul and its invisible dark roots, which 'reach all the way to hell' and all that. So yeah I came here because someone who just criticezed me again just because of having an opinion, sended me something that you said, paraphrasing you. I don't mean to be full-fledge attacking you with all this, really, your video made sense to me and all, though I felt disagreeament with some of it, and it made me laugh a bit with some of it, and I took it as a respetable opinion and as a youtube video of someone. I think I just wanted to get some stuff out of my chest. If you or someone reads this, sorry if some parts are hard to read or badly writen in terms of grammar and stuff, English ain't my mean language and I'm not an expert at it."
"I've listened to a great deal of Peterson. I agree with you, many of his points can be unclear and they seem to miss some nuances. That said, he does do a lot of good for people (I think, anyways) and I think you provided a reasonable response to his influence over the times. I will certainly be watching more of your videos to get your take on things. I've been prone to watch a lot of the 'intellectual dark web' but you are somebody I would love to hear talk to them about these finer points of their different ideas as you're clearly articulate. Hopefully, one day that can happen."
"I am a Jordan Peterson fan, and likely always will be. That being said, I really did enjoy your video. I agreed with many points made and could appreciate the perspective on the ones I didn't. Subscribed."
"Natalie, Have you written any articles or books whilst in academia?? Please I'm dying to read some of your work"
"The main reason I think Jordon sees postmodernists as a unified force is because of how prominent they presently are on the university campuses across the west. Then those people grow up and run institutions as well as media. And I really don’t think that’s hard to see. The de-platforming of invited speakers, the chanting for professors to be fired for voicing certain opinions (and facts), how students themselves feel that they can’t talk about certain things without the risk of feeling outcast amongst their peers.   The left are a joke because they are unified in that sense, but then still rip each other to shreds and condemn their own as racist, bigots, misogynists etc for some perceived utterance or another when they may already have previously agreed on a number of other issues. Which is why in the past .... what, 5 years? we’ve had a number of people who feel politically homeless because the left have changed over time and no longer accepts them. Trans terms for example are numerous, invented, not greatly helpful in terms of syntax; a discussing them, rather than just a blanket acceptance of things being made in to law will get you labelled as transphobic. It’s a very “unified” group of leftists who do that. And if they don’t get their way they beat their drums even louder with even more name calling."
"I'm watching a 2nd time. Still gave me a good laugh. It leaves me wondering if Jordan has ever contemplated sexual repression, which is what the left are probably mostly suffering from. IMO."

"Rachel Mclish?! Color me impressed. Also, you offered a very nuanced rebuttal of Peterson's world view, and, this from an admirer of his work.

"theres no quicker way to demonstrate ones absolute lack of value in a discussion than to bring up thw issue of ' personal pronouns'...  in other words, anyone who suggests that pronouns hold any sort of importance, or that its crucial that we identify a person by their chosen ' pronoun'... that person should be immediately cast out of all adult discussion and thereafter considered to be a nothing."

"Good work, to say the least"
"Really great video, I agree a lot on most of these considerations. 0ne thing I did think of when you talk about post-modernism and identity politics being incongruent--  I  do find actually some of us leftists do hold a contradicting ideology -- you always hear 'gender is an arbitrary construct' ,  yet support for transgender identity -- but does transgender identity (and the spiritual  urge to change  gender)  not point to the idea that there IS something real about gender? (this is just one example). In which case  I could understand Peterson's unification of seemingly contradictory ideologies -- because many H0LD the contradicting ideologies themselves. I am concerned about JP's possible highly covert conservatism masked beneath other issues as you illustrate in this great vid!!!!!!!"
"This is like the 5th video I’ve watched as I’ve fallen down the contrapoints rabbit hole and I mean, I subscribed 3 videos ago, but damn, had to mention that I am now SUBSCRIBED"
"One of the most intelligent videos I've ever seen."
"His 'postmodern marxism' talks about a fight of 'classes' (marxism) between what he calls the occident/judeochristian values and what deconstructs such values (the left, basically). The etimology does make sense if we took his stupid definitions as proper ones, but you already explained how 'the occident' is way more than he pretends it to be, as well as the left. He is indeed an asshole pushing a blatant agenda pro-status quo."
"i'm not exactly sure how this is supposed to discredit JP. he's explained why he links marxism and post modernism about a million times. he's also explained how he thinks people with these viewpoints are fighting amongst one another as well. instead of watching this as confirmation bias,  why don't people watch one of his more in depth lectures where he goes into greater detail? maybe i'm just stubborn and old school, but when people want to really know what a figure thinks, why don't they attempt to watch the 100 of hrs of content of that person? i understand if your time is limitted, but at least don't make the claim you know what they mean when they make a statement when its clear to everyone who has seen more of that person's work that you clearly don't know what they mean. this is a perfect example of what i'm talking about; constant misrepresentations which wouldn't be the case if more content was observed and the person observing was assessing said content objectively and not trying to spin a narrative.  i appreciate how the creator of this video attempted to break everything down, but it was done in such a surface level way that its coming across as a giant straw man the entire time. this would only convince someone who already dislikes JP. if you've watched enough of his lectures and debates, it doesn't bring about any new ideas or concrete reasons why he's wrong. he has rebuttals and 'counterpoints' 😁 for everything that was brought up.  i found the video entertaining and well executed, but it unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired. it would be awesome if Zoe (is that her name) got to interview JP. maybe that would clarify some confusion.   i really enjoyed when Zizek and Peterson got together, though calling it a debate of marxism vs capitolism was kind of a joke. they were in agreement during a lot of it, which is understable since Zizek has his own brand of marxism and Peterson isn't for unchecked capitolism like his radical leftist detractors claim. i think those discourses are at least a step in the right direction, though it would probably be more interesting to see a staunch conservative debate a marxist. JP is more of a centrist if anything"
"Contrapoints, when we combine terms the new definition is no long bound by a abolitionist interpretation of the original terms. Not sure why it’s difficult for you to understand that. Peterson combines Marxism with post modernism because the ideology he is referring to is a combination of the two. Post modern to the point that they want to deconstruct “the west” as you said, Marxist in their solution to the problems they see through that lens. You’re trying so hard to point out what’s different about the two world views when it’s actually mute considering it’s a combined definition. You keep referencing “a true post modernist” and “a true Marxist’s”, he’s not talking about strict interpretations or “true” anything, he’s combining the two terms to make an entirely different class of ideology. How could you have possibly lost that in your weeks of research!"

"The link with Marxism is that it expects equality of outcome, only pertaining to identity (gender, race etc) instead of class and dividing society into oppressers VS oppressed. It's different, but similar, hence 'neo'. But it is essentially post modern in how it tries to undermine the scientific method and logic with 'lived experience' (anecdotal evidence) and push cultural relativism (western feminists' endorsement of the hijab, for instance), hence skeptic, as you say, of modernist ideas. And I do think it is very much authoritarian. The push for control of social media, shutting down debates in college campus and call to fire and 'cancel' non confirming voices, the push to put children on hormones and puberty blockers and characterizing any critique as a call for promoting the 'genocide' of transgenders or denying their existance, denial of health risks associated with obesity within the body positivity movement, normalization of hate  if it's directed at perceived privileged groups, defense of open border policies with no vetting or concern for resource scarcity, job competition, culture shock and high probability of creating more ghettos of poorly integrated immigrants who are vulnerable to extremist ideologies and portray anyone who dare ask questions as a bigot. The mainstream liberal media hitpieces taking parts of videos purposefully out of context (Covington, Pewdiepie...) to scare monger people against an alt right threat when the reality is these are just corporations that are economically losing to alternative media and the Democratic party wants immigrant votes to sway election. A liberal politician attempting to dox underaged girls on Twitter for being pro life. Bill Clinton is a sexual predator, but we're supposed to believe Hillary has women's interest at heart. It's all very nice to defend minorities, but it feels more and more like doublespeak to me, the people who claim to fight for minorities are becoming the very thing that will make their lives intolerable."
"I watched less than 2 minutes before realizing this thing is dishonest and misrepresents  things Peterson has said."
"I find it amazing that someone took '12 basics that you should have under your belt by the time you're a card-carrying adult' and used it to propel himself to alt-right stardom.

But aside from that, it's all politically-neutral."

"From your first sentence about JP, you start by telling an outright lie..so ur entire diatribe has no point. Jordan Peterson's issue with bill c-16 has nothing to do with protecting transgender rights. His issue is censoring of language and forcing people to use specific language..that certainly will lead to Stalinism as we have begun to see in the UK where people are being investigated by the police for misgendering people. If you want to debunk someone's position, at least be honest about the person's position in the first place."
"I don't think Peterson wants to erase any or all of the labels and identifiers that people have coined to represent their interests or needs.  I think his only significant point is that these labels are cosmetic only and should not be given legal protections that over-rule free speech.  I might be wrong, but that's the entirety of what was impressed upon me by all of his ramblings."

"Late to the party here but have to say that I do agree with some of the concerns you have about Peterson. However, I think you may have down played what Peterson is targeting. He's coming from an education system that hosts teachers who deny the existence of biological sex, and legislation that forces citizens to use language that is untraditionally/unorganically set up(in regards to bill c16 and the growing list of gender pronouns)."

"Don’t you just love a 5 minute long intro"
"I love this video, and your sense of humour! I do think you misunderstand 'The Lobster Argument', however. From what I understand, Peterson is pointing out that hierarchies are somewhat biologically determined, and he draws several conclusions from this: (1) they are not the exclusive fault of capitalism (a straw man, I agree), (2) that raw power and oppression is never the strategy for a stable leader in the animal kingdom and many critics of human hierarchies wrongly assume the people in charge are always oppressive, (3) that group inequality in these structures might be significantly explained from biologically determined free choices of individuals and if true it would be a moral error to strive for equality of outcome for its own sake at the expense of the preference of the individuals."
"I think you're way off on a bunch of your critiques here (specifically: neo-Marxism vs Marxism, corporate culture in relation to thereof, postmodernism and how neo-Marxism is a bridge between the two) but I won't slam an essay here.   Would love to send a convo your way though, you seem like you'd actually be willing to have the discussion on this."

"Statler and Waldorf are the perfect example of postmodernists"
"While a lot of what you are saying is very insightful, and most of your comments about JP can be a fair representation (FOR the audience that has actually a decent familiarity of him, they certainly would be a terrible summary) I think you are wrong on the 'go back to silence' part.  His problem with the c-16 was specifically the legal compelling to call speech, he has never said that transexuals shout shut up. If anything, he almost completely enshrines speech and dialogue."
"Finally, someone smart and funny talking about JP's non-sense, strawman arguments and ad hominem attacks."
"JP discourse is the classic example of a mott-and-bailey strategy. Whenever he seems like he's trying to defense the indefensible, he retreats to some uncontroversial position."
"Is it just me or does Jordan Peterson say a whole lotta nothin'. Dude is effing crazy. He tries so hard to sound smart he might as well never say anything at all."
"Excellent"
"Of course you dont care about truth"
"Peterson is awesome haha"
"Peterson certainly has his personal political bias but he's a good psychologist and bona fide philosopher. Certainly not the devil that many on the left makes him out to be"
"Isnt Peterson just using the term postmodernist marxism , to represent the tendency of the modern left to support some sort of hippy commune utopia, where  basically every person with a given set of identity categories is content and fulfilled. The postmodernism term is to represent the tendency of tearing society apart, and the marxism element is to represent the idea that somehow race gender and other identities wont play a factor in an individual's success in life.   The main issue seems to be the language used to discuss these ideas , and i think that is the strength of JP, as he can combine historical terms and concepts in a colloquial and easily digestible form. The problem with todays 'progressive' ideologies, is they are completely unfocused and lacking in some 'grand narrative' which can combine and give some 'heart' or grounding to all the demonstrable activism.  The deeper issue to me , is that all these (mostly talked about) 'micro opressions',  can not be simply solved. Especially because in many forms they are just speech transgressions or some other insignificant political correctness.  To solve the underlying issues of (sometimes innate) prejudice towards a particular class, it seems to me , there should be creative ideas and testable hypothesis and plans that can be seen to some fruition.  Without those  ideas it seems pronounced 'progressive' people mostly like to stroke their egos about who can come up with a more 'fair' sounding theory, without having to demonstrate their theory in a more accomplished real context."
"I'm from the netherlands and dutch politics are different from yours. Like all countries have different politics. But there are similarities. I am far-left and i totally disagree with guys like Peterson and Trump and ofcourse our own Baudet and Wilders. ContraPoints i like your video's and how you mix humor with valid arguments and facts. I wish i could do that."
"comedic timing on poiiiint"
"Just saying the interview with Cathy Newman was channel 4 not BBC"
"'Listen to some zeppelin' I'm sold👍"
"I don't always agree or disagree with you contra but I enjoy your videos all the same. You're highly entertaining and thought provoking as well as an eloquent speaker and well researched on your video topics. I agree it's annoying that Jordan Peterson plays the misconstrued game and implies things rather than stating his actual beliefs to tack him down so to speak. But the bill in question that he protested was for COMPELLED speech. Not requested pronouns. Compelled and enforced by law and possible fines. It feels in a way that you skirted the crux of the argument. Should pronouns be enforced by law? Peterson has even stated before that if his students came to him as individuals and with respect and told him what they wished to be called that he would have no problem in doing so. But being compelled by penalty of law to indulge an ever growing list of pronouns that is by no means static is an entirely different matter. Thank you for all of your videos."
"'Marxism is an extension of enlightenment philosophy.'     ok. I'll be your roommate."
"So... Is it good to have a law that forces a person, by fines and/or the loss of employment, to use specific language in regards to how one prefers to be  referred to e.g. gender pronouns?  You seem to like your free speech, as you should, so I would assume this would not be agreeable. Laws, with the force of government behind them, aimed at what we must say, will eventually effect everyone negatively. This law and J.P.'s blatant refusal to abide by it was not even mentioned. Do you agree with said law?"
"You need to listen to more Peterson... Many of the things he was vague about in the Cathy Newman Interview he's explained thoroughly in his lectures. It's nice that for once someone did their research to criticize him, but I think you should have done more. The Trojan horse stuff you mention just doesn't make sense when you know what his arguments are. Doesn't mean he's right about everything, but I don't think he has any hidden motives, and he's not against real equality lmao"
"That was kinda good.  Lobster for lunch. Fab."
"I'm straight despite my best efforts but ur hot."
"How does Natalie have so many things???"
"Are you being sarcastic when you say calling Jordan Peterson a fascist would be over the top?  Because, the wealth of information (interrupted with distracting interludes of theatrics) seems to pretty much establish that Peterson is a fascist.  Sure, he is a coy fascist - holding his cards tightly.  But so was Hitler.  As late as early 1938 - and certainly before 1933, someone claiming that Hitler has a plan to literally exterminate millions of poeple based on their ethnic identity  would have been dismissed as a kook.  So I'll say it.  Jordan Peterson is a fascist.  And, he, along with Bannon,  Orban, and Dugan (and now, also, Canada's Maxime Bernier) are among the most dangerous individuals at large right now."
"THAT PINK FLAMINGOS REFERENCE AHH I LOVE YOU"
"Referring to JP listeners at 1:50 'He's got a lotta fans on youtube! Fans, I hope you guys are here, because I wanna talk!'   Referring to JP listeners at 3:55 'Most of Peterson's fans are young men and... I mean, SOMEONE has to whip the neckbeards into shape!'   A bad-faith call for discussion with people you (and I) disagree with followed by cheap, snarky dismissal of their perspective and beliefs while applying a mean-spirited label that stereotypes them on their appearance, weight, and social difficulties. Quite a genuine attempt at changing people's minds, there."
"I love the bath scene.... That is all."
"What he means is a 'Marxism' (oppressed peoples of society seizing power from the ruling class) informed by a 'post modernist' (power is all there is, everything is nothing/nothing is everything) view of who comprises the new 'proletariat' and 'bourgeois'.   I find it I much more simple to refer to it as 'Revenge of the nerds'. It basically gets the same point across."
"When are we going to get a debate between ContraPoints and JP? Or like... a mud wrestling match?"
"Kinda wonder what's so complicated about this concept of cultural Marxism, similar to alt right, it's not a term people use to describe themselves but a description of what the person is doing. Which in the case of cultural Marxists or modern far left, is presupposing that all cultures or groups should be treated equally in all areas, an idea that doesn't make sense as it ignores the differences between all these different peoples.   Like Muslims in Malaysia having people arrested for kissing in public, that is their culture and plenty people there think that's reasonable I suppose, but it wouldn't make sense to say that culture is equal to Western culture. But then you have people that are essentially cultural Marxists that will say either you shouldn't look down on cultures for these practices you see as oppressive or that those oppressive aspects aren't really a part of those cultures (a sort of rejection that there could be fundamental differences between groups/peoples)."
"This is very, very well done. By far the best response I've seen to JP from the left. (And I like JP a lot.)"
"This is bringing back bad memories of my art philosophy class.... goddammit, derrida..."

"Here is some truth but you will not take the bananas out of your ears."
"As much as you tried, you're still shadow boxing.  'Transgender people are telling me what words to use and I don't like it' ... No, he was predicting that in the messed up Canadian human rights tribunal system, such a rule would be abused, and brought in expert testimony to support that claim. Which came true.  'Postmodern neo-marxism is trying to bring down the western world' ... It doesn't have to be a conspiracy. Intersectionalism is unsupported pseudo-science, and it has become mainstream, used to dupe the public into abandoning the principles that allowed Western civilization to flourish in the first place. A big driver has been the impoverishment of media, through clickbait and call-out culture. All you gotta do is call people nazis hard enough, and then run the story over and over again, using the handful of real nazis as props. Moral panic ensues. As a result, there are now harsher penalties being proposed for online trolling than for physical violence, and the kind of censorship the West used to mock China for 10 years ago is now becoming mainstream here. The UK in particular is in a sorry state.  I liken it to Climate Change: there is a generation lag time between the cause, of weakening the intellectual infrastructure of civilization, and the effect, a descent into petty tribalism held together by a bureaucratic tarpit of rent seeking. I don't think Peterson is our lord and savior, and his lectures are longwinded and anecdotal much of the time. That doesn't change the fact that he's right on much of the underpinnings of the culture war, and the long-term effects. Even if each incident is local, it is happening all over the western world, and it has reached the largest technology platforms and influencers. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent appeasing this non-sense. That's not a conspiracy theory, that's just a good old fashioned religious racket."

"While  I dont agree on you with all of your points, I think you've done a really great job with your research. This video is well thought out and made me think. Jordan Peterson has baffled me for a while because of how seemingly normal he make some of the most outlandish claims sound. I almost never agree with him when I actually view is beliefs but I can see why he could sway so many to his side, he has a lot of charisma."
"it was a channel 4 interview not BBC"
"This guy's Canadian? Wow... This guy doesn't even have the excuse of buying into the American corporate media narrative about public health care and other social democratic ideas or institutions. And yeah, he justifies his oversimplified worldview by harping about some idealized form of  'The West' that is often an arbitrary ideal that reinvents the past."

"22:20 Not at all true. I have been orchestrating the greatest lobster takeover since 16 BCE and have contributed to a Fantastic amount of Mr. Peterson's anxiety and paranoia, and boy is that shit bird going to need it when the lobsters are making a Jackson Pollack painting out of his large intestine and urethra to be carried on the lid of his coffin at the aforementioned funeral below."
"7:40 Oppression has a couple definitions in that context, I think. Oppression can be a government, like of a country, imposing laws that either literally create slavery, or effectively make daily-life feel and have all the workings of slavery. Oppression can also just be something you know as common sense being broken down  by someone who does not have any real intention for why they're telling you something. In the second case, there's not much social-reform to be had. In the first case, living with your parents isn't slavery, nor is someone not recognizing your genius; that's also not slavery.   Jordan Peterson will be L. Ron Hubbard in ten years. YouTubers will be there to document and carry the coffin."

"I want to start by saying that I really enjoyed this video as a JBP fan, and I'm coming from a place of respect for the author of this video.  I think a lot of people are getting hung up on the Post-Modern Neo-Marxism claim, and it's something pretty straightforward for me as someone who studied philosophy in undergrad, so here goes for those who actually want to know what JBP means.  In Maps of Meaning,  JBP explains that the world is divided in our minds as 'explored' and 'unexplored' territory, or 'a priori' and 'a posteriori' knowledge, each of which is managed by a different hemisphere of the brain.  Truth makes ontological claims (what is) that can be empirically verified.  Post-modernists disagree.  JBP also says that truth can be normative, i.e. 'what should be.' The lobster thing is so ridiculous because JBP is making an ontological claim about 'what is' and then Newman tries to infer a normative statement from it, which if you actually read David Hume, that's an informal fallacy known as a violation of Humes Guillotine, which is the core of JBPs beef with Sam Harris' 'The moral landscape.'  So, when JBP brings up lobster hierarchies, he's refuting the position that Marxists can achieve economic equity and demolish hierarchies, he is in essence saying (steelman) 'No, capitalism isn't the cause of hierarchy, evolution is, and Western capitalism results in wealth and freedom in addition to dispossession. Marxism just results in dispossession and tyranny.'  The Post-Modernism label is a critique of Nihilistic assaults on John Locke and Adam Smith.  Neo-Marxism is an attempt to achieve social equity by allowing discrimination against historically privileged groups (thus creating a new historically privileged group).  Put together the critique of Modernist claims of 'What is,' and the critique of the Capitalist claim of 'of what should be' and viola, you have 'Post-Modern Neo-Marxism.'  The next claim is, 'well, I don't see people in HR departments explaining what they are doing in these terms.  JBP is a conspiracy theorist.'  Peterson argues that what we see in society is an emergent property of the philosophical and theological debates in academia over ideology.  People don't have to understand these concepts to follow an ideology without any self-awareness."
"The way Natalie composes herself in this video makes me feel like she's into the boxed wine part of her life here."
"Please take 1 minute to read this.   Peterson is against using COMPELLED language in the Canadian laws. It has literally NOTHING to do with transgenders. People are now going in prison for misgendering because of that exact law. That's why he claims that it opens the door to more compelled language (on any topics) and this in turn leads to totalitarianism."
"Everyone: 'Hey man!' Government: 'Prison'  Also, you asked the question why people talk about postmodernism in relation to identity politics and I think it's because of the following: When you advocate for rights for particular groups and throw in intersectionality, you can't draw a line. There is an infinite amount of minority groups for whom you can advocate for. So now you're left with two choices: 1_ Either you try to advocate for an infinite amount of minority groups (which is impossible and you'll find that at the end they are individuals) 2_ You take a stance minority vs majority along the lines of oppressed and non oppressed (hence the Marxism). *** I'm not saying to stop advocating for groups but like you said in the video, it has to respect the boundary of categories. Some postmodernism don't want that because they view it on a Marxist term and can justify behaviors and censorship.  I understand however that his call to regard the pomo-neo-marxist as individuals instead of a trend of ideas can be damaging and calling upon his view of the western world when it is his conservative political ideology. However, I don't know how much of the post modernism philosophy we have built the current society upon.  Almost all creatures on the planet has a serotonin level, lobster and humans alike. Your confidence and aggressiveness comes from your serotonin system. In the context of gender equality in a job environment in the interview with Cathy Newman, he simply says, man has more serotonin therefore use their assertiveness to climb up the corporate ladder. He's not saying woman can't do that, he's saying woman SHOULD do that because that's how you climb all hierarchy. As much as advocating rights for any groups needs assertiveness and a degree of aggressiveness. So what you say is correct, you can use the lobster argument for any hierarchy and you would be totally, 100% right. The problem is when assertiveness transforms into violent aggression and bourgeois loses their head. It's hard to get a middle ground."

"Cultural Marxism is real, ever heard of the Chinese Communist Party and the Confucius Institution? (You can wikipedia that). Post modern Neo-Marxism and other variants of critical theory is great for figuring out the flaws of society... not so great at setting up socially accepted norms, mores, and laws that function in a world with finite resources that 7 billion people desire."

"Contra, your video is absolutely brilliant, on so many levels! :  informative, artistic, analytically delicious, as-fair-as-one-could-be-to-JP, ... and HILARIOUS!  I loved the line about David Hume, '...even though he was a fucking racist and also Scottish.'  HA!"
"My biggest issue with this video is towards the beginning. She notes that JP is basically giving fatherly advice to people but then she doesnt develop that. Like, why are we in a situation where an internet celebrity is filling this basic role for a lot of men? She doesn't seem to acknowledge the possibility that this could be part of a greater breakdown in family values and relationships (not in the 'gays can now get married that's awful!!' kinda way but in the 'the role of a family is to foster certain relationships and teach children certain life skills and coping mechanisms'). This breakdown could also be partially responsible for a lot of young men retreating to their rooms in the first place. No one on Lefttube likes to address this that I've seen (I guess because  it doesnt fit with a New Left critique or worldview)."
"I'm sorry for your condition but.. Dude, you're not fooling anyone. Cut out the silly voice. You will never. ever. be a woman. I'm sorry."

"23:56 'A true postmodernist would want to deconstruct the whole concept of the West and show that the very idea is racist and supremacist...(etc)' You gloss over this, but it is crucial. When a movement seeks, by its own admission, to erase from people's minds the very idea that they even have a culture, and teaches that those who continue to identify with their own culture are merely perpetuating white supremacy and racism, how can you possibly deny that this is a profound attack on the culture in question?"
"I'd say some of the criticism of JP's thoughts and ideas in this vid is pretty valid, logically sound and overaly - smart and fun to watch. But more importantly - on a deeper level I sense too much nihilism, intellectual snobbery, narcissism and a pretty strong ambition to create yet another circle jerk of people-who-know-better In other words: toxic shit right here, be careful when entering."

"About hierarchies, I think Peterson is talking about a special kind of hierarchy, that exists across the animal kingdom and is at the core of the disputes for sex partners. It is not a bureaucratic hierarchy or something like that. It is a very biologic and visceral behavior. Just look to our closest relatives. Most of the life of a male adult chimp revolves around fighting for dominance. I am not saying that humans behave in the same way, but we came from creatures like chimps and we have these drives coded in our DNA.  People make fun of Peterson for talking about lobsters, and they argue that it is a completely different kind of organism. But this is precisely the point. Even in an animal so different and distant as a lobster the biochemistry of hierarchies is the same. His point is to show how old, and ubiquitous, these things are."

Don't forget his audience are mostly virgins, who have a problem with themselves. It's a verry gay anti-lgtb, women and anythink else movement. Sorry for the cretique, I love you anyways"
"I agree with Dr. Peterson, I think the point he is trying to make is that these ideologies while western contain a framework for repudiating western culture and that proponents are not understanding or wise of what exactly remains after that and that his experience with evolutionary theories reinforce certain grim, foreboding apprehensions."
"Ok, you are way better than the professors talking about these topics. I mean, like, Focault is cute and all, but I didn't understand sh*t."

"I wonder if Peterson's fear can be deconstructed? Skepticism of traditional values ('judeo-christian in this case') would let modernism run amok (hence usher in an autocracy), but to question modernism would lead (per it's defining Grand Story) to the 'chaos which came before'. It reminds me of the Chinese Communist Party rhetoric for some reason?"
"Even though my knowledge of philosopy is of the grade school variety: I watched a few hours of JP's lectures and picked up on the Christian conservative messages fairly quickly. He just sweetens it with a frosting of psychology and philosophy without committing himself in absolute terms; no doubt a dance he learned from a career in academia."
"I'm a fan of jbp but i think i love you"
"There's so many wrong things about this video. Sorry, but when you defined identity politics i quit. Its at 17:58.

That's what we call textbook bias."

I've read 12 Rules and a bunch of interviews, I've listened to several of his podcasts, and I could barely keep my eyes open through most of them. He has a dull, muddied writing style, and he tends to go on neverending tangents when talking. He speaks in insipid personal anecdotes and banalities. He's not even entertainingly bad, he's just boring as hell."

"ConraPoints, hello. Your video us a little bit missleading in my view. It is Peterson's mistake to use terms sarcastically as there is high probability that people will take it literally since his public persona's based on this damn-so-manly-and-fuckin-serious pose, however it is not so difficult to understand, what he means by the words he uses (finally, searching for a 2 minute video where he explains the term takes about 5-10 seconds depending on the speed of your internet connection). So, what Peterson is refering to by the term 'postmodern neomarxism' is: a) by neomarxism he means 'that people are able to create a whatever identity they decide', which is not a marxistic idea, however it is one of the constitutive ideas of soveitian regime  - in sovietian union, the science was not how you know, in biology the leading paradigm was LAMARCKISM - I highly recommend reading about biologist named Lysenko, it is quite amuzing.. So, this belief in quite arbitrary changes in spieces gained during life which was legitimized by science was a basis of ideology of the possibility of arbitrary manipulation in citizens - you can make anything out of them as the party desires. So that was a very dark totalitarian thinking and again, it is not marxism, to call it that is a vulgarization of history but anyway, people tend to use terms 'sovetian' and 'marxistic interchangeablly. b) postmodernism - well he's clearly ponting to the 'gender fluidity', 'performativity', and 'social construstvism'  and again he sees it the sense of the possibility of forced manipulation with personality nad also the 'political correctness' which he sees as an act against free thinking and speech and shit you know that stuff. So like... I would prefer to see an argument against what he actually means you know..."
"I hope that was soy milk ."
"this dude had some ok points i guess"
"I think this video does a better job than most leftists of criticising Jordan Peterson, but I still found it to be subpar. The reason being that you seem so hung up on how Jordan Peterson wrongly uses the term 'Postmodern Neo-Marxism',  which I do accept, however you fail to argue very well against the actual individual ideas that he puts under this umbrella.   Also with regards to your criticism of Peterson regarding pronouns falls into the same trap that basically every critic of his falls into. Jordan Peterson specifically is not against using trans people's preffered pronouns, but he is against a piece of legislation (bill c16) which forces people to use certain pronouns, or else go to prison. Sure, the use of pronouns might be 'easier' than setting your life in order or raising your kids well, but there is no legal obligation for you to follow his twelve rules, just as there should be no legal obligation to use any type of pronoun.    Also while I get we all have different priorities, the fact that you say at the start that you dont care about reason or truth basically feels like one massive excuse. In my opinion its incredibly disingenuous and ignorant to think that way.    Overall, I accept the small criticisms about Peterson you did manage to make, and I think its good context to know when reading or listening to his stuff, but ultimately I still think his messages and ideas are rather useful and mostly correct on many topics, and you have not changed my stance in that regard."
"I'm left. A lot of people in the left say that patriarchy is the WHOLE hierarchal structure of capitalism, they are wrong.  You approach petersons' points (who is left also, he's only conservative in the religious sense) without the understanding, that marx was missing too, that capitalism is NOT DESIGNED, while communism is. God-King governance was not designed either. Democracy was designed.  Now, when a communist says hierarchy, he means completely designed, peterson's point is capitalist hierarchies occur, because capitalism is a force of nature, not a man-made system, the man-made system is money+democracy, the result of that is capitalism, you could say the result of almost any system, given our current industrial might will be capitalism, you're fighting against a current, with 0 proof that your struggle will produce anything better than the cataract that is capitalism. That is peterson's point, and that a mass mobilization of a nation or the whole world to fight against capitalism, will produce millions of deaths with the result of only coming full circle on capitalism again.  Zizek says it's time to think, not rebel, try and take that advice, try and think with your opponents, peterson's strategy is the game theoreticly correct approach to the torture the left does to everyone, for people to take the left seriously, the media has to stop this... we all know it.  If you're searching for an easy solution, more industrial might, automation, machines, computing, this is your solution, stop trying for social change and start trying to think of ways to produce so much, that it is impossible to have economic gaps (in which case beauty, social ability and likes is going to become the new currency because we'll have everything, and capitalism will come full circle with social standing being the new money... capitalism like Thanos, is inevitable)"

The 'Jungle' episode shows that an uncanny toxic mold that will infect and kill species that become out of balance.  How long then can minorities gain authority over the majority before natural heirarchy adjusts it back ?  Is conservatism then actually balance, and not equality ?  Interesting video. Good job.."

What all sides of this multi-faceted coin we call our world seem to have in common is their penchant for trying to put the world in a box, a penchant that acts as a sort of uneven sieve, sifting out most but not all good ideas, so that every side has as many points as noise. The world is complicated. It's a complete, catastrophic mess. It can't be shrunk down to good guys and bad guys, heterosexual nuclear families and abominations, 'post-modernist no-Marxists' and 'The West'. It just can't."
"See people who use the DCM or DMC whatever it is called confuse the crap out of me and DSM makes more sense but that is probably because I understood the DSM before I even what the other one was.

I just came from a Lindsay Ellis essay about theatrical portrayals about fascism and I think its unfortunate that Peterson is only recognized for his criticism of the left. Much of his lecture content focuses on the trappings of fascist ideology if not explicitly. Life's a complicated game of charades and I'm worried we're getting lost in translation."
"I don't know how I got here in the rabbit hole of youtube, but fun video truly. I don't think you are giving Peterson a fair chance though, it sounds like you agree with Peterson on core topics, but than shine a light on grey areas and make them sound bad. Like the guy is debating and arguing people on the daily, it's the dudes job to be ready and get aggressive if needed when dealing with people who are doing the same thing to him, while also trying to balance a civil conversation if possible. How do you want him to act? lol.  You are well spoken but you criticize with little to no clear"

"This isn't really the best criticism for Peterson out there. You too are kind of lining up straw-men.   Neo-marxism = Power struggle✓ Support social engineering✓ Denial of human nature✓ Post-modernism = Power struggle✓ Support social engineering✓ Denial of human nature✓  He's explained the response to your objection in multiple videos including ones that you showed.  As for the 'brocialists' vs 'female ceos' false dichotomy, well than ANTIFA must be a miracle and I guess a hammer and sickle just look really good on blue haired and feminism t-shirt loving college girls.  And I genuinely mean this in good faith don't embarrass yourself by quoting Judith Butler. Quoting her is almost as pretentious as her existence. This earned her first place for a bad writing contest in a scholarly journal in 1997:  The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.  Continuously painting him as a gateway drug and insulting people's intelligence draws them towards him and away from the radical fringes. If you want to advocate for progressive ideas then express them in a way that is meaningful not dependant on attacking one figure who worries you (who by the way isn't really that right-wing)."

"Who learns that capitalism is bad. Capitalism is one of the greatest advancements in human history. The ability to make anything of yourself with a little blood sweat and tears. That's capitalism. And this idea that women are somehow oppressed is absurd. You don't make 70¢ to the dollar you likely make the same amount of money as the McDonald's cashier next to you. Peterson lays out a number of reasons why men tend to make a little more money than women and one of those things is agreeableness. Women are generally more agreeable which may be due to their historical role as caregivers to their children. As it turns out,men and  women that score lower in agreeableness are more likely to ask for a raise and more likely to make more money than those who are less agreeable. Also, men are historically not very agreeable, thus men are more likely to ask for a raise and make more money. This isn't the only argument either."
"If you look at the political scale, those on the left are closer to fascism than those on the right. Fascism is a byproduct of socialist governments that fall under the control of a dictator. Fascism is evil and so is socialism. Beyond that, the identity politics that is being played by the left has some striking resemblance to classical Marxism. Just because I'm a white man doesn't mean I don't have morals or that I have no right talking about women's rights or minorities and anyone who opposes me on that by trying to control my language is clearly a fascist. You leftist pigs."

Complacent pacifist. Idenitiarian. Anti Identitarian. Pro Immigration. Xenophobic Bigot. Etc.  These videos usually aren't very enlightening. Unfortunately this was no different. I can't fully tell if you were being serious sometimes bc the opinion you kept oumping in was that you essentially didnt understand what was going on. This could be good if you pumped the brakes a bit and looked at things deeper and without so much opinion in there. Post Modernism has a pretty specific definition in the way JP is intending it."

"While I found your critiques of Jordan Peterson's tendency to compare the left to totalitarians (which obviously isn't the case) rather entertaining and true, I found the rest of the video unhelpful in discerning what exactly is wrong with JP. You spent a good 10-15 minutes defining what JP means by 'post-modernism'  (when he has clearly defined what his interpretation of post modernism is already) and then proceeded to deflate your own definition rather than directly attack his ideas. I think you should tackle some of his repeated ideas a little more specifically. I came here for an alternate opinion and was pleasantly surprised by the first few minutes of this video but by the end of it you has lost me by staging your entire breakdown of JP on a made-up definition of a term he happens to use sometimes. Even if this assesment of the term happened to be correct, I think Peterson has a few more ideas up his sleeve other than 'postmodernism is BAD'. I still enjoyed the video though, good work  :)"
"Maybe my grounding in Marxism isn’t super solid... but where is the connection between Marxism/Bolshevikism and claiming that a society is following those ideals makes you a fascist? Isn’t Peterson saying the opposite? That the far left is adhering to a similar ideology as a Marxist revolution and that although it seems positive on the surface that underneath the guise is just fascism (similar to the social revolutions of communist countries that slowly eliminated conflicting thoughts/freedoms in order to further a political agenda)? This issue is so damn convoluted and I’m genuinely interested in some opinions of people smarter than I."

Well either you lied or did not do your research well both indicatie you do not realise how much influence and power YOU HAVE yes you. You have POWER so you saying you don’t care about “topics” like power literally is stupid when It’s more like a broad term that can mean way more than whatever you give it credit. Power exists everywhere where life is so saying you don’t care about it isn’t that bad but it kinda is when you have this much of it and are talking about people that discuss power structures. Even you discuss power structures so now I’m wondering why you said you don’t care about power when it’s pretty evident you study it, or at least make long analytical videos about it. Are you saying it to make you look like a less power hungry person? Waving around the flag of peace whilst unknowingly to your fans, lying and deceiving. I know you don’t care, what I am wondering about is why your fans don’t care. Well it’s become pretty self evident that people stopped caring about the truth long ago. Just to make sure I know you aren’t part of the truth I’ll watch some hours of your videos and then never come back at least I’ll understand why a big part of my generation got lost following people like you."

"I mean, isnt his 'postmodern neo-marxism' thing just saying that the intersectionalism of the modern far left is generally based on a) a deconstruction of contemporary western ideals in that everything is just a  social construct/everything is socially/culturally relative, 'we are only what we define ourselves to be, there is no objective, overarching positive order to society/humanity/reality/personal identity' (post modernism, i dont know much about it but assume this is what it gets at) and b) because everything is ultimately a social construct, the reason why we have the specific constructs we have today is because we live in a system of oppression and exploitation, controlled by an elite few, who enforce these sociocultural normative agendas to maintain and ultimately reinforce said hierarchy and position of 'elite few' (ie marxism)? Ie the modern left is a symbiosis of the anti-hierarchy notions of marxism and reality deconstructing notions of post-modernism?  And ultimately JP's success is based on him 'deconstructing the deconstructions of the left', ie saying that hierarchy isn't just a tool of oppression but is an evolutionary mechanism found in many species, gender archetypes aren't purely a social construct and means of control, evolutionary biology points to their being innate behavioural differences between the sexes etc etc., and that is ultimately why alot of people support him?"
"'In the 1920's many Germans experienced their situation as a confused mess. They didn't understand what is happening to them, with military defeat, economic crisis, what they perceived as moral decay, and so on. Hitler provided a story, a plot, which was precisely that of a Jewish plot. We are in this mess because of the Jews. That's what I'd like to insist on. We are telling ourselves stories about ourselves in order to acquire a meaningful experience of our lives. However, this is not enough. One of the most stupid wisdoms, and they're mostly stupid, is an enemy is someone whose story you have not heard. Really? Are you also ready to affirm that Hitler was our enemy because his story was not heard? The experience that we have of our lives from within, the story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing is (and this is what I call ideology) fundamentally a lie. The truth lies outside in what we do. In a similar way, the Alt-Right obsession with 'Cultural Marxism' expresses the rejection to confront the fact that the phenomena they criticize as the attack of the 'Cultural Marxist' plot (moral degradation, sexual promiscuity, consumerist hedonism and so on) are the outcome of the immanent dynamic of capitalist societies. I would like to refer to a classic, Daniel Bell's Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism, written back in 1976, where the author argues that the unbounded drive of modern capitalism undermines the moral foundation of the original Protestant ethics. And in a new afterword Bell offers a bracing perspective on contemporary Western societies, revealing the crucial cultural fault lines we face as the 21st century is here. The turn towards culture as a key component of capitalist reproduction and (concomitant to it) the commodification of cultural life itself are I think crucial moments of capitalist expanded reproduction. So the term 'Cultural Marxism' I think plays the same role as that of the Jewish plot in anti-Semitism: it projects, or transposes, some immanent antagonism (however you call it), ambiguity, tension of our social-economic life unto some external cause. In exactly the same way, now let me tell you a different more problematic example, in exactly the same way liberal critics of Trump and Alt-Right never seriously ask how our liberal society could give birth to Trump. In this sense, the image of Donald Trump is also a fetish: the last thing a liberal sees before confronting actual social tensions. Hegel's motto 'Evil resides in the gaze which sees evil everywhere' fully applies here. The very liberal gaze which demonizes Trump is also evil because it ignores how its own failures opened up the space for Trump's type of patriotic populism.' 1:25:25-1:30:00    April 19th Zizek debate with Jordan Peterson   Show less"
"Below are a selection  of quotes from the article that got JP shadow-boxing the air in his head with an impotent desire to find author and punch him. What a pity Mishra doesn't have a collection of twitter-bots for JP to amuse himself with.     Pankaj Mishra -'Jordan Peterson & Fascist Mysticism'     https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/19/jordan-peterson-and-fascist-mysticism/      'it is worth remembering that Jung recklessly generalized about the superior “Aryan soul” and the inferior “Jewish psyche” and was initially sympathetic to the Nazis. Mircea Eliade was a devotee of Romania’s fascistic Iron Guard. Campbell’s loathing of “Marxist” academics at his college concealed a virulent loathing of Jews and blacks. Solzhenitsyn, Peterson’s revered mentor, was a zealous Russian expansionist, who denounced Ukraine’s independence and hailed Vladimir Putin as the right man to lead Russia’s overdue regeneration.     Nowhere in his published writings does Peterson reckon with the moral fiascos of his gurus and their political ramifications; he seems unbothered by the fact that thinking of human relations in such terms as dominance and hierarchy connects too easily with such nascent viciousness such as misogyny, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. '    (…)     'the modern fascination with myth has never been free from an illiberal and anti-democratic agenda. Richard Wagner, along with many German nationalists, became notorious for using myth to regenerate the volk and stoke hatred of the aliens—largely Jews—who he thought polluted the pure community rooted in blood and soil. By the early twentieth century, ethnic-racial chauvinists everywhere—Hindu supremacists in India as well as Catholic ultra-nationalists in France—were offering visions to uprooted peoples of a rooted organic society in which hierarchies and values had been stable. As Karla Poewe points out in New Religions and the Nazis (2005), political cultists would typically mix “pieces of Yogic and Abrahamic traditions” with “popular notions of science—or rather pseudo-science—such as concepts of ‘race,’ ‘eugenics,’ or ‘evolution.’” It was this opportunistic amalgam of ideas that helped nourish “new mythologies of would-be totalitarian regimes.”     Peterson rails today against “softness,” arguing that men have been “pushed too hard to feminize.” In his bestselling book Degeneration (1892), the Zionist critic Max Nordau amplified, more than a century before Peterson, the fear that the empires and nations of the West are populated by the weak-willed, the effeminate, and the degenerate. The French philosopher Georges Sorel identified myth as the necessary antidote to decadence and spur to rejuvenation. An intellectual inspiration to fascists across Europe, Sorel was particularly nostalgic about the patriarchal systems of ancient Israel and Greece.     Like Peterson, many of these hyper-masculinist thinkers saw compassion as a vice and urged insecure men to harden their hearts against the weak (women and minorities) on the grounds that the latter were biologically and culturally inferior. Hailing myth and dreams as the repository of fundamental human truths, they became popular because they addressed a widely felt spiritual hunger: of men looking desperately for maps of meaning in a world they found opaque and uncontrollable.'     (...) .   'In the end, deskbound pedants and fantasists helped bring about, in Thomas Mann’s words in 1936, an extensive “moral devastation” with their “worship of the unconscious”—that “knows no values, no good or evil, no morality.” Nothing less than the foundations for knowledge and ethics, politics and science, collapsed, ultimately triggering the cataclysms of the twentieth century: two world wars, totalitarian regimes, and the Holocaust.'     https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/19/jordan-peterson-and-fascist-mysticism/"
"JP is really just recycling ancient philosophy to make a type of self help credo in a platonian manner of 'live your best life' idealogies and secular dogmas.   That's all well and good. I had a healthy dose of Western and Eastern philosophy when I was in my late teens and early twenties when attending college. The issue arises when beneath the layers of self help lies a very reactionary patriarchal hierarchical structure manifesto that bids itself as a queer and feminist erasure.   Self help is great. Live your best life. Just don't do it in the name of preventing others from the same. You know.....Unless they're Nazis, fascists or enjoy harming others."

"2:03 *channel 4 interview"
"'On the left we don't tell people what to do' LOL are you serious? HAHAHAHAHA"
"11 minutes in..no point made yet...entertaining though. Then a question finally comes...'is it true that post modern neo-marxism IS OUT TO destroy us all?' and now i lose almost all hope of a good counter or discussion because he never says this...its far simpler. They do not recognize the costs and those costs can and have destroyed societies. He doesn't assume malice because its not necessary. Ignorance and incompetence are sufficient.  while here i'll make the point i expect you've heard before. He has a problem with government mandated speech, not with you being called whatever you like. Right...ill hold on in hope there is something other than mere entertainment coming...  16 mins in: post-modern-neo-marxism, its self contradictory. YES, and JP has directly addressed this multiple times. He is describing a group of people that ARE self contradictory. It's their lack of sense...not JP's 'as a unifying idea for the left is nonsensical' NO SHIT...THATS JP's POINT...ffs this was brilliantly entertaining but worthless on the actual subject (despite obvious work that was put into trying to understand JP which most don't)  This said, I think you would make for an excellent discussion with him which would hopefully clear up these things opening up the possibility of some real progress in the discussion.  oh, and the reason it doesn't seem like a group is because on the surface it is completely different but digging deeper they are driven by the same things. Arguing over which are and aren't 'real' groups for identity politics has all side choosing group politics and THAT is whats bad.  the left might well know that hierarchies naturally exist yes..they fail to understand WHICH hierarchies are responsible for things. For example capitalism is blamed for people going hungry when in reality its fed more than we have ever managed to and so the blame is misplaced.  Finally, a point, just semantic really but ill take it. marxism etc is indeed western philosophy.....but it's not 'western values' defined by the majority of westerners over time.  I still think, having now finished watching, you would make for an excellent and interesting discussion with JP."

He must be dreaming. He was given a merciful three hours of last words before being torn apart by his own former cheerleaders (who didn't need him and more and had moved on to masturbating to trans women on youtube anyways). A whole warehouse of patriarchal symbolism came crushing down on Jordan, and all he could think was... Mommy, Mommy... where is my milk, Mommy??! 😢"

Also I got in trouble back in my Uni staffer days when I convinced a class that Foucault was pronounced 'Fuck-Oh' which lead to total hilarity the following week when one of the students made a presentation to the lecture. Also can I just say that photo with Giles Deleuze, Foucault and old boggly eye Satre is one party I would have given *anything* to be at. If I wasn't a todler around that era, that is. And yeah, Foucault would have had a total fit at people listing their identies and pronouns and shit on their twitter pages."
"I'm a JBP fan but would agree - the picture he paints of left vs right is a little too stark to be helpful."
"Good video (funny, well researched, good production values), didn't change any of my positive opinions on Peterson because I still fundamentally believe that the anti-everything brigade is just hijacking the LGBT / trans community to push their horrendous ideology. So whilst you dislike him because you think he's stifling your idea of progress and LGBT rights, I see him as defending against the trojan horses. You kind of touched on this when you talked about different fractions of the left. For example, i believe that allowing trans athletes in contact womens sports is grossly unfair to women. If that makes me a bigot then so be it. You can clearly see there's a strong element of the left that is willing to deny reality and science to push their agenda, that is something that should worry any reasonable, rational, sane person."

"I don't find him pro-fascist or right wing at all. He seems pretty centrist. The problem with being centrist is that you react to extremes with counter-information, and it makes you look like you support the opposite polarity. For example if you critique ideas of the left, you look right wing. The reason why he more often than not comes out critiquing the left is because he works in a liberal university where he has been exposed to leftism and speech politics. I've seen him critique right wingers a lot in his various videos.   It seems like people who call him pro-fascist are failing to understand that just because he critiques the left does not mean he is in fact right wing. I think in today's world, being centrist is the most radical thing you can be."
"Seems like Mr. Peterson is an intellectual using pseudo intellectualism to get popular, kind of like a slightly smarter sounding Ann Coulter."
"I agree with basically everything here, but while your point on postmodern neomarxism being a problem confined to a small number of academics is mostly accurate, I think it understates the amount of influence that they actually have. Peterson can be a bit hysterical about it, but it's not a sweep under the rug type of issue either. Federal politics is mostly untouched by it at the moment, but cultural influence is still there."
"Fun fact Jordan Peterson was a socilist in highschool but became a right winger when he had a dream about wanting to fuck his cousin and eat her corpse he talks about it in his book maps of meaning the only psychology book he ever wrote."

"I can see that Peterson is using the wrong words but that doesn't make what he is referring to any less real. The Chinese refer to the same thing was some mandarin words that mean white left. Let's use that instead. The red left being the followers of Marxist theory. The white left being the followers of intersectionalism. I'm not here to defend Peterson's ideas, I find that he oversimplifies many problems. However, I tend to agree that the white left's ideology would have the United States devolve into a totalitarian society. Not because the white left will take over, but rather that in our squabbling over social justice and our effeminacy, a totalitarian regime whether foreign or domestic will seize power."

I must say if the purpose of this channel is to try and convert us this is a terrible method to do so. The way you film your videos with the constants breaks of 'funny' moments, such as at 9.26 (which is where I am at before deciding and can barely stand to watch) you will do nothing but push those on the right away. This video style with its weird sexual nature with a trans person and the constant brakes and lack of seriousness as mentioned before is everything we hate. Get to the point no one cares about these additions they're a waste of our time. You make it hard for us to hear what you're actually saying.  Finally nothing in this video at this up to this point where I've decided to stop watching actually say the Peterson is wrong on anything. The only thing you said is that he is fuelling hate towards LGBT people, but they make up 4.5% of the population. If they have to suffer discomfort for the sake of the majority of the population to feel comfort than so be it."

"I have to say, even as a jp groupie, that your content is very funny, and you have well though out and well articulated points. But when you get to your criticism of him, you make proxy arguments instead of contending with his own work directly. You can't criticise someone unless you indicate precisely what they have said that is wrong. Instead of 'Jordan talks about X, this is what X is, this is what I think about X ' instead of 'Jordan said Y, Y is wrong because Z'"
"I really enjoyed and appreciated this video. And you made a lot of fair points. But, respectfully, I think you glossed over the historical substance of JP’s arguments in order to attack its philosophical categorization. For example, no discussion of Solzhenitsyn, who aside from Jung and Nietzsche is the most important touchstone of JP’s work. And historically, it is accurate that Marxism has been totalitarian. And Marxism in the West historically gave way to identity politics on the Left in the 1960s onward. Even today, AOC is hellbent on uniting Marxism and identity politics. AOC is the poster child for POMO Neo Marxism. You are correct that this movement is contradictory. But that doesn’t mean it’s not real. Very good video though. Thanks for the honest discussion on this."

"Sorry but no. I like this channel ( that I just discovered yesterday) and I can tell Contrapoints is a reasonable person with good intentions and whatnot. This is as to say that I don't consider her a demon or a bad foolish person. But after watching the entire video I must say that there are two options imo:   1) Not enough actual research on Peterson's PoV. There are literally hundreds of hours online of this man explaining in excruciatingly complex detail why he defends what he defends and the logical reasons behind it. There are valid criticisms to his views and deconstructions, but none of them are explored in this video, and none of them are clear cut enough that one can say Peterson is lying or intentionally missrepresenting the truth.   2) A personal bias based on her own experiences and political environment that makes her see what he's defending in the worst possible light.   I'm gonna go for the outright easier case, being 'personal pronouns' or whatever you wanna call it, as a very basic and quick example: Creating a law that MANDATES individual so adhere to subjective perceptions of other individuals is a very slippery slope to venture in, because it negates the right of the individual to express themselves freely and honestly. Peterson has explained several times that he thinks it is a good thing to adapt to a person's prefered pronouns if they request it, out of respect, and I concur. But if you force individuals to do it out of fear (because they will be legally punished otherwise) you're not only creating a very exploitable loophole that will be abused by non trans people and unscrupulous fucks, but you're also oppressing the majority of the population over something that affects a very very low percentage of people. You can't legislate acceptance and you can't legislate respect, those are earned.    Is there another slippery slope in this argument? fuck yeah. If we don't find a way to protect minorities from exclusion or punishment then we are risking them to be exploited or marginalised. It's important to recognise that, and it's important to find a solution for this issue, but in order to do this we also need to be able to have a realistic conversation, questioning the various solutions that have been put forward in a very dogmatic way by 'progresists' , that solution being punishing people for not being open minded with laws. I think that to do that there are ways to reach the population averse to minorities that work better than telling them 'you're trash and a bigot and should be punished for it'.   The problem with all ideas, both in the left and the right is that they're both legit bringing up issues and concerns that are legitimate, but the solutions proposed on both sides for said issues are not fail-safe at all, and prone to be abused by unscrupoulous individuals. What I can clearly say without a doubt is that the whole bickering and demonising only works to make people grow further apart.   And as a sidenote, the rise of Peterson's popularity is due, to a great degree , to the fact that even trying to have a discussion about any of these issues has landed a ton of people in the streets, had them vilinised and isolated, for the crime of wanting to explore other avenues of thinking that might be controversial but that also hide bits of truth in them. The moment you censor your oponent you show yourself as the bad guy, and the left have been into censoring harder than the right was during the 80's. So maybe calm your tits everybody, and start listening a bit."

"I came to this video having seen multiple videos of PSA Sitch’s on Jordan Peterson. There was an NBC interview of Peterson in which he further explains the idea behind “lobsters have hierarchy”. He explains that it is in nature, in our genes for hierarchical society to exist, but that society would have to overcome this predisposition, not that he is therefore in favor of it. I liked your comments and breakdown of “Post-Modern Marxism” as it did need explaining to me, and is nonsensical, but I wish that you had also looked into other interviews or sources so that I could get the multiple options, and your opinions on things I have already seen explained through different eyes. I like your channel and videos, though I am still new to them. I am open to your ideas. Thank you."
"This is a really effective analysis of Peterson, and I thank you so much for taking the time to do it. It must have been quite tedious to hear these old reactionary views being recycled in this way. I really feel like I've got a handle on Peterson in a way I wouldn't have been bothered to even attempt without you.   And once we get the bones of the argument laid bare, it occurs to me the ACTUAL questions Cathy Newman should have asked him. I would have loved to see his answers:  'You say lobsters have a hierarchy and that this is why there are hierarchies in humans. You then state that this is natural and imply if not stating directly that that is its justification. So, here are some other things that are natural:'  'Lions, when they take over a pride, kill all the cubs of the previous pride leader. This is natural. Lions mate with many females in a pride. This is natural. How does this sit with your Judaeo-Christian valus which celebrate monogramy?'  'Unlike lions, seahorses are monogamous during a mating season. Is this more the natural example we should be looking at? Female seahorses compete for access to males, and thus have the characteristics often associated with males - for example, bright colours in order to bring attention to them. Do you think, like seahorse hierarchy, human females should compete for access to human males? The reason they compete for access to males is that seahorses have male pregnancy. The eggs are deposited in the male seahorse and he then incorporates them into his body and carries them. Male pregnancy is thus natural.'  'A school of clownfish is always built into a hierarchy with a female fish at the top. When she dies, the most dominant male changes sex and takes her place. Should we be seeing this in boardrooms across the world? Sex change is natural.'  'A quarter of all black swan pairings are between males. These are homosexual relationships in nature. Black homosexuals are natural.'  'The Ignobel Prize was given to a researcher who discovered that some male ducks will have sex with recently dead male ducks. Homosexual necrophilia in ducks is natural.'  'Why, exactly, did you choose lobsters as your example, and not necrophiliac homosexual ducks?'  'In lobster society, you say hierarchy is natural. Can you show me where, in the lobster economy, wages are rigged in order to disempower females, and lobsters of a different colour? Can you show me where lobster law makes it legal in some lobster states to carry guns in an open carry system? Can you show me where lobster society has free democratic voting? Can you show me in lobster society where gerrymandering and power is abused to further economic and political aims of a particular homogeneous group?'  'Or can you not do that, because human society is far more complex than lobster society, and ceased to be natural quite some time ago? - Or, are you saying human society is natural, then homosexuality, murder, sex change and reassignment of gender roles are all natural too - so what is your point?'"
"His point is that hierarchies are a culturally homologous structure shared by lobsters and humans. Lobsters and humans most recent common ancestor existed a very long time ago, therefore hierarchies are very old. Things that have been around that long probably have some important purpose. These are all basic concepts JP is borrowing from evolutionary biology"
"JP openly admits that “postmodern neomarxism” is an apparently contradictory term. He’s addressed that on multiple occasions"
"Of course the smartest woman on YouTube is really a man"

Anyone without compassion is far far more liable to lie. Jp has no compassion for people he doesn't like, therefore it is very likely he is a liar. And that is just a simple truth."
"M I C H E L    F U C U"
"The best description is still that Peterson is a dumb persons idea of a smart person. The lobster thing has to be one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. I keep thinking that one day he will admit the whole thing is some kind of performance art project designed to show how people will believe any mumbo jumbo especially if it has academic sounding words in it.I am all for debate but it actually has to be coherent. Peterson is basically the equivalent of a 6 year old saying ' I know you are but what am I'."
"J.P. knows that Postmodernism and Maxism are theoretically mutually exclusive, he said so in an interview with Joe Rogan if I remember correctly. That fact doesn't prevent such merging of ideologies from occurring, I mean, humans have a thing for being incoherent at times, don't they?! I think the reason why he also doesn't separate them as 2 different phenomenon is because you can actually find people that will indeed have adopted both ideologies. For example, a feminist that will defend Islam (the religion itself as an ideology, I make the distinction because of course she can defend Muslim women and should, but to do so in a coherent manner would be to criticize the misogynistic edicts of Islam)."

"This video is an incredibly weak , arrogant, and ignorant attempt to refute Peterson's perspective on neomarxism and post-modernism. The main argument of the author is that Marxism has nothing in common with post-modernism since neomarxism is Marxism and Marxism is an ideology enhancing a grand narrative, whereas post-modernism rejects all grand narratives as mere social constructs. But the author of the video is totally ignorant that Marxism is not neomarxism (see Marxisms vs Frankfurt school - Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse) and that neomarxist paradigm (based on the assertion that western culture is oppressive to many groups and communities) that  fits perfectly the one of post-modernism. The basic flaws in the argument of the author of this video, cannot be hidden by his attempts to mock Peterson through patronizing scenes with sexual connotations."

"@ContraPoints I'm sorry, but why do you use word fascist, when he clearly isn't happy about etatism. Which is one of the pillars that describe fascistism as an ideology. I mean fascist are not happy about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly just like the left wingers. Actually we can find lots of similarities between Nazism and Communism in USSR (Im russian so I know that as fact). And if you really want to sound serious about politics you should know that nazism and communism are in fact both left ideologies. Nazism is righter than communism and fascism is righter than nazism, but that doesn't mean they are right ideologies, they are all left. Classical liberalism is a right ideology, libertarianism is a right ideology etc., because they value individual freedom. You can hate somebody based on that person's opinions, but you cannot shut him down - that is a freedom, which right ideologies are all about. And what about communism - look at USSR. Closed borders, you could go to jail for a joke, goverment-made starvation, mass shootings of peaceful demonstrations, propaganda all over the country, concentration camps, labor camps (GULAG) etc. These are things that commies led my country to, you don't wanna see it in your."
"Neo-marxism is an extension of marxism which doesn't seem to be addressed in the video, but regardless Peterson also says he doesn't understand contradicting viewpoints of the left with postmodernism rejecting a grand narrative and neo-marxism providing one. https://youtu.be/ih4avuHRUUc"

"I think he means that neo-marxists are on the surface of things leftist and promoting social values and fighting for under-represented groups, but actually, their subconscious mind is nihilistic, questioning every useful concept that people use to interact,  self-destructive and self-hating, and he equates that with post-modernism. He is not saying that neo-marxists have a cohesive plan and are organizing themselves to destroy western civilization, but that they have a subconscious, chaotic, drive to do so. But that was my first impression of him too, that his worries are misguided and he's freaking out for no reason."

Throughout the entire lecture he doesn't mention anything about the show the characters or his actions throughout the series and goes off on a tangent about facsist soldiers ... Da fuck! I listened through the whole fucking thing for nothing. I wanted somw deep philosophical analysis on some new perspective on the character of W.W. He doesn't even mention the references to his initials! Then I realize wait he's not a philosopher. He's not even a sociologist. Not even a social psychologist. He's just a psychologist. He's just talking fancy and for long periods of time like a runoff sentence. By the time he's finished we got a bunch of definitions and terms to go over, thinking 'Hmm He knows what he's talking about! He's good at this! ' Of course He's good at it. IT'S PSYCHOLOGY! That's all he's good at, and it's all he knows. Mind shit. He was heading for the right direction driving down the road of Breaking bad character analysis, but then completely leavesthe car for a pitstop and instead takes his shirt off doses himself in oil and runs into traffic with a lightsaber. He doesn't seem to show interest in wanting to dive or pick apart anyone's mind fictional or not. He's only interested in expanding and imprinting his own. He's a deluded clickbait Malcolm Tucker doppleganger."

"7:00 Hoooold on, 'the left don't tell people what to do'. Except the thing that catapulted Peterson to fame was his resistance to coercive speech, i.e. the Canadian government telling how to speak, forcing him to use certain words (as opposed to censoring certain words)."

"Mr. Peterson has a problem with his speaking I really wish he would fix.  He will say three points.  The first will be something about how Stalin was evil, which we need a new word to describe his level of horror.  Next he will say how Communism was about pushing for class equality among people and that Stalin, who was a monster, was a communist.  Finally he will say how SJWs, Leftists, and others want to push for class equality.  He never said that SJWs, leftists, and others in the modern world are pushing for the same genocide Stalin committed.  But, people on the right and left, because we are people who like to fill in blanks and make connections, will draw the conclusion that he is telling us SJWs and Leftists are trying to be Stalin.  I do not know if he is doing this on purpose or he is unaware, but I believe this removes us from discussing his words to talking about what he is implying and diminishes the quality of public discourse."

"Identity politics is advocacy for rights, equality, justice, visibility for particular groups? I thought identity politics just refers to the more common trend of people of particular identities forming individual political entities that addresses issues concerning their particular identity, as opposed to the more traditional, broader method of forming alliances among multiple groups of people and identities. It's more of a description of 'how' people are advocating than 'what' they are actually advocating."

First, Peterson objects to the government compelling him to use preferred pronouns, not the use of them per se. Second, the Marxists were the original identitarians, classifying people into the rich (capitalists/bourgeoisie) vs the poor (workers/proletariat). Peterson objects to the radical leftists that push group identity as being more important than individuality."

It's a parody of postmodernism where they tell the story of a love triangle via postmodern knock-knock jokes.

"How conspiracy theory about marxists wanting destruction of the west is automatically fascist? fascism is something different, first of all: a totalitarian regime - these two things don't bond together.  It's also anti democracy, and pro state - terror. And Marx in his work openly claimed, that through the revolution, communists must build a terror police, to keep population from contrrevolting, cause they surely will(because of innate inefficiency of communism). My private opinion is, that contrcultural revolution or anticultural revolution driven partly by marxists like Institut für Sozialforschung and many others is a ideological subversion. It's a well known fact, that during Andropov presidency in KGB, USSR spent more on ideological, informational warfare, than conventional energetic warfare."
"Postmodern neo marxism is able to coexist with itself under the authority of meta-modernism. Through postmodernism, it is able to deconstruct binary gender identities into a fluid spectrum, and then, through modernism, can select areas of that spectrum to construct additional identities. Where Marxism really comes into play is it’s narrative of oppression, the way the white western patriarchy oppresses marginalized bodies of all kinds. LGBT stata is then grouped right alongside ethnicity.   Now you have different identities under the umbrella of marginalized bodies, including people of color and LGBT, some of whom desire classification, others of who shun classification. The only way progressives are able to rationalize this paradox is under the framework of meta-modernism.  If you don’t know what meta modernism is, it has to do with Shia labeouf jumping rope for 19 hours."

"Less than 2 minutes in and you have either A) Overlooked a VERY important detail or B) Choosing to deliberately Straw Man the guy  Look, I'm not the biggest fan of Jordan Peterson either. In fact, I disagree with him on many issues. But.. one thing I definitely agree with him on is Free Speech.   'For sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people shall surely lead to Stalinism'  Right there, you already have simplified and misrepresented the stance that he has on this issue.   It's not about 'being against transgender people', it's about 'being required by law to say certain things'.  I'm sure many of you already know this, but there have been many laws involving speech that have limited what you are allowed to say (i.e. yelling fire in a crowded theater). This was the first law in history that did not prevent one from saying something, but rather forced them to say the 'right' thing. This, in principle, is totalitarian by definition, with hints of Fascism. And since the party I'm sure you represent is constantly denouncing Fascism, it's ironic and hypocritical for you all to promote this law.  It's not about trans issues. The law could have just as easily been that it is illegal to call a squirrel a rabbit, and he still would have had the same opposition to said law. The only difference would be that he would only have to worry about squirrel enthusiasts calling him a Nazi Sympathizer.."

"Ok great critique, very insightful. I am just another Youtube scholar (not reading any those things made out of dead trees), forgive me if I am wrong, but I believe he is connecting neo/cultural marxism to postmodernism because both are concerned about oppression and power dynamics (btw I used to think post modernism was just like nothing is real and everything is use and meaningless, apparently power dynamics is also some post modernistic thing I was recently informed, I should really start reading some stuff some day)."
"Ight. As an ethnic Uyghur, do NOT compare an activist with Mao. Have your gripes with an activist. No one completely agrees with anyone. But comparing them to MAO? No bitch. Most of my family DIED because of that man, and the remaining members of my family had to flee TO the Soviet Union. You know it’s bad when they fled TO there. And because Mao’s regime is STILL in power, the few couple family members that still live in “China” either live in camps or live in fear of being imprisoned in said camps. Ever year, I’m hearing of another missing family member that no one knows whether they’re in prison or fled. So the comparisons to Mao ... yeah, they gotta FUCKING STOP."
"I don’t think his backlash targets LGBT or other minorities. He’s expressed concern for those groups at every opportunity. The left asking people to politely use pronouns is fine, but Peterson opposes the government mandated use of particular language. He certainly doesn’t support any type of government compelled behaviour, even if it were congruent with what he suggests people should do.  Also, you frame his perspective on postmodernist neo Marxism as if it’s a conspiracy theory, but he sees it as a point at which the left has just crossed the line into extremism, similarly how white nationalism is a clear line on the right that we shouldn’t let ourselves get to.  Postmodernism is criticized often and very fairly so. You even aptly raised some of the most obvious problems. Peterson doesn’t characterize the left as a unified force. He often says that there is a small vocal minority in the left that pushes such a message. That’s who he opposes.  About hierarchies, I like your comparison to a monarch using the same argument to maintain their hegemony, but that’s a slight mischaracterization of his argument. He’s just saying that if we observe a skewed ratio of gender in politics, for example, it’s not necessarily an example of the oppression of women. It may be the way humans naturally choose to organize themselves when given freedom of choice. I mean, there are no institutional structures preventing women from becoming politicians in the same way there are none preventing men from becoming nurses or school teachers, but we observe a skewed ratio towards women in those professions. Are those matriarchal institutions that exist to oppress men? Should we also try to address the inequality between men and women in workplace fatalities, life expectancy, or rate of homelessness? Personally I think we should give everyone equal opportunity and support, then mostly let people choose the life they want, as long as it doesn’t infringe on another’s rights.  I appreciate the depth of your analysis, because it’s obvious you’ve gone quite deep with it, but I worry you might be denying your viewers a great learning opportunity by confirming their unfounded suspicion of Peterson, when instead you could admit to them that his stance is very nuanced and recommend they check out his stuff themselves."
"What the fuck am I watching"
"At 25:00 it is said 'The very idea of requesting different pronouns to suite their individual needs'. That’s the issue; requesting different pronouns and having those pronouns enforced by law are two completely different things. The fact that you can use the force of the government to have people comply with using pronouns that are not biologically true is really scary. In the UK in the last few weeks, the police questioned someone for misgendering a trans-women. There was another case where police questioned someone…for liking a tweet that commented on transgenderism. The trans community is being used by the most evil people on the planet in what is looking like a successful attempt at banning speech in the name of social justice. The dangers of it are starting to be actualized."

"Compulsory speech/respect is disgusting, disingenuous, and makes for bad law. The best way to make good people into criminals is with bad law. 'Rights' are never something you have to recieve from another person. Your healthcare comes from a doctor for instance, to make it a 'right' puts that doctor in your servitude. Respect is similar, it is a decision, a sort of mutual contract between people after they've proven themselves to one another. To make respect a 'right' attempts to make everyone act or even feel toward others a particular way. You can make laws that prevent people from hurting one another, but you cant compell them to support each other. No man 'deserves' another's gold..  Rights are personal, they do not intrinsically infringe on other people. You have the rights to be as free and safe as a human can be. You do not have the 'right' to make people behave a certain way around you, be nice to you, or just generally not upset you. Which is the way it should be..  EDIT: In regards to 'trans rights'. Transexuals have the right to be safe, free, and behave (within the boundaries of society) as they see fit. Not intrinsic to their 'rights' are: Compulsory language laws aimed at forcing a particular language or behavior on non-trans individuals, public or tax funding for their 'transition', or sectors in government and business that are held and filled specifically by transexual individuals even though other more qualified individuals are immediately available."

"Identity politics ignores idividuals and puts people into groups, whether they want to are feel like they identify with that group or not. Also, it is a gainst free speech, which I think is one of the main things JP is arguing for when he is against identity politics, like being forced to use a specific pronoun. I will gladly use what ever pronoune you prefer, but I would not in anyway accept that it would become law."

Not once did you acknowledge the very real, punitive and dangerous results that can occur when people stand up against the left's forceful ideology. Case in point, count dankula. The philosophies may be interesting but what he's arguing against are the actions being taken in order to deny anyone who disagrees with the zeitgeist as much agency as possible. Nobody goes to jail for exclaiming that all white cis gendered males should die. But, teach a pug to nazi salute as an obvious, trashy joke? Handcuffs."

"I would assert, just because it's a set of philosophies not logically consistent or compatible in principle, does not stop it being adopted by a significant portion of society that is extremely prone to doublethink and fundamentalism  I would describe 'post-modern neo marxism' as an 'ideological trainwreck in progress'."

As a nurse I have worked with people who are so obviously in the wrong gendered body and when reassigned many of their emotional problems reduce dramatically as well as their admissions to hospital for self harm and suicide attempts. Let people be who they really are. I hope JP watches these. Many thanks ContraPoints"
"are you trans?"
"I liked the video, it’s a good response to his ideas. One note on lobsters though: The monarchy comparison actually doesn’t hold, lobsters organize their hierarchy along inborn competence. Social structures such as monarchies are inherited hierarchies. Lobster groups have no real social memory, only human societies do. Petersons point with lobsters is that competence hierarchies are natural and usually a good thing. That doesn’t mean he thinks the same thing about social hierarchies where your place in it is determined by birth. At least that’s my interpretation of his statements and what I would agree with. And I would say that capitalism tries to reflect natural competence hierarchies in social hierarchies, at least more so than other workable economic systems which we’ve tried. That’s why I like capitalism, and it’s also the reason why Peterson claims that a lot of left-wing people oppose the notion of natural hierarchies: because he sees a whole-sale critique of capitalism as based in denial of competence differentials."

"This is a terrible video. You clearly know very little about the subject matter at hand. You come off as a reasonably bright individual, but its clear you don't know what Peterson is saying, or much about the history of the issue.  First issue: Peterson isn't 'telling people' what to do. He is giving his opinion on what people should do, in particular young men who have little direction and have been badly misdirected by modern society. I have never heard him argue a single totalitarian idea. I have my issues with Peterson but honestly I don't think you know enough to even explain them to you.  Second issue: You clearly know nothing about cultural Marxism, it isn't a conspiracy theory or Nazi propaganda. It is the Frankfurt school ideology. There is nothing crazy or even debatable about its existence since Frankfurt school ideology has dominated schools for literally 60 years. If you think this isn't an issue, try talking to someone who remembers China's cultural revolution, or the lived under the communist regimes of eastern Europe. These methodologies were used both in the 1910's and 20's in Europe/Russia and in the 50's in Stalinist Russia as well as throughout Eastern Europe.  Third Issue: You say that 0% of corporate HR departments believe in Marxism. Once again, you are showing tremendous ignorance. There are huge numbers of Marxists and specifically cultural Marxists in HR departments. Why do you think so many of them have been renamed to Equity and Diversity departments? Want an example? How about Alphabet, Twitter, Facebook. Three of the largest companies in the world, companies that control human communications to a staggering degree are dominated by Marxist theory. James Demore was literally fired for opposing these ideas.  Forth Issue: Postmodernism is the fundamental belief that transitionary differences and the inevitability of natural and unavoidable inaccuracies created by imperfect perception creates a subjective world. Or if you want it from a different angle, it is the idea that since objective reality is impossible to confirm, that reality should be taken as subjective.  Fifth Issue: Your mistaken understanding of what Peterson means by postmodern neo-marxism is a the root of your issue in understanding this situation. Peterson is defining a Neo-Marxism that consists of a substitution of identity membership in place of class membership. The issue here, and why he defines it as post modern is the general belief in a lack of rigid structural differences between these identity groups combined with their acting as distinct groups. This is pure Frankfurt school, which defined truth as that which advanced their ideology. This fits quite well with the modern left which has quite a number of these kinds of absurdly incompatible ideas. For example, men and women aren't different, but transsexuals exist and their condition is based in biology. Those ideas are rationally incompatible and yet they are fought for by nearly the entirety of the left. Don't believe me? examine the treatment of TERFs.   Sixth Issue: You talked about the fact that the left isn't monolithic, this is obviously true, so true in fact that it really shouldn't need to be mentioned. So why exactly do you think that Peterson is talking about the entirety of the left? What he is addressing is the rather ruthlessly enforced Frankfurt orthodoxy. I think maybe the difficultly you and many people have with this idea is that they have trouble rapping their head around Frankfurt school ideology which is literally, 'we must destroy the west in order to enable the great revolution'.  You think his idea is wacky because you are uneducated on the issue. The fundamental goal of maybe the most influential group of intellectuals in the US in the last 100 years truly is the destruction of the west by any means necessary.  Many people absolutely believe this which is why you see things like absurd alliances between feminists and Islam.  Seventh Issue: This sort of a personal pet peeve of mine. You don't get to define progress, nor do you get to conflate equity with equality without challenge. I have always been more then happy to hear arguments about how minorities and women are disadvantaged but nobody has ever made a coherent argument to me for either. The fundamental idea that outcome inequalities are based on inherent systemic bias that is invisible and or undefinable is predicated on the fundamental belief that there are no differences between the sexes or the races. This is factually untrue to an extent that attempting to argue it puts an individual in the camp of absurdists. One need not believe in holistic value disparities to recognize these differences. You suggest off handily that he is against economic progress for what you define as disadvantaged groups. That is a meaningless statement, his position is quite clear. He believes in equality of opportunity and freedom of choice. That is the pure liberal position which seems representative of his belief system in general.  Eighth Issue: I think you are just being obtuse here, he is implying that women are underrepresented in government because of sex differences. This is hardly difficult to decipher, or controversial. Men are far more interested in politics, are more aggressive and prone to seek leadership roles, are naturally more confident and are harder working. This is part of the sex differences and there is nothing controversial about those facts if you actually know the facts.  Ninth Issue: Again his meaning is clear. Lobsters are a species which has a behavioral pattern predicated almost entirely on instinct. They essentially act out there biological imperatives. If a species as uncomplex neurologically as lobsters can be clearly biologically hierarchical then clearly the much more complex human species can. You are also very very wrong that there aren't those who claim that the patriarchy isn't the source of all human hierarchy. It was in fact the essential position of Marcuse that human society was naturally Matriarchal in nature and that it was through male violence that the patriarchy is established. So no, its not a straw man at all. You also extend this completely unnaturally, he used this analogy purely to demonstrate that biologically driven hierarchies clearly exist. It is rationally as meaningless as the 'homosexuality exists in nature' canard. But while meaningless, both are clearly true.  Tenth Issue: Marxists and Anarchists most certainly do not limit themselves to the elimination of unjust hierarchies, in fact it is a central platform of inter-sectional feminism as derived from critical theory that ALL hierarchies are power relationships and thus inherently abusive.  Eleventh Issue: You describe Hierarchies based in sex, race, and economics as inherently unjust. So is it your fundamental belief that economic differences between groups should be adjusted for regardless of the potential differences in ability and behavior? If so then how exactly are you not a Marxist? If you believe that the differences are solely based in biases in social structure, then you are going to have to show your evidence which is something you will be unable to do because it doesn't exist. You are trapped in the exact delusion that Peterson is largely describing. Beings with free will belonging to different groups with different fundamental behaviors will have different fundamental levels of productivity. This will inevitably lead to differing wealth accumulation in a merit based society. There is simply no way around that. A rational discussion around the degree to which the system results in wealth accumulation between individuals with different behaviors can reasonably be had but unless you can demonstrate systemic injustice acted out by society against a specific group then you are making a group identity based argument. This is why rational people say the left has lost the plot. The fundamental position espoused by an overwhelming majority of the left is presented as an argument based in fairness when in reality it is one based in compassion.  Twelfth Issue: You clearly don't understand the concept of individual liberty. In no way is the legally based demand for recognition of specific gender recognition compatible with the idea of individual liberty. The entire premise is absurd. Individual liberty is about rights invested in the individual, you cannot make undo demands on other individuals. You may make requests which is something Peterson is fine with, but when you attempt to enact laws in order to force this behavior then you are acting in a purely totalitarian fashion.  Thirteenth Issue: No, nobody would reasonably argue that Marxism is an extension of enlightenment thinking, that is dumb.   So..Ya...Terrible video."
"Oh that's why I know his name! I just remembered that I read a blog post by one of his colleagues some time back. He was upset at Petersons change of reasoning, saying he wasn't so bad when they were close.   Edit: changed wording to be more accurate. Also it was an article not a blog post."
"I think he/dhe has a crush on Peterson..."
"Thank you good job. You're hitting the points where I'd like JP to be clearer.  I think however that PM-marxists is referring to marxists that use Post modernism to deconstruct capitalism to replace it with their utopia. Of course the ideology is nonsensical and a frankensteins monster. But they simply don't care as long as the get to use the deconstructing hammer to make way for marxism. A destructive ideology like this should be fought and I think he can provide a lot of value if the left engaged him as a potential ally to solve some of their internal squabbles."
"It's 9:00 on a Saturday night, and I'm alone and watching someone pour milk on a mannequin with Peterson's face on it. I'm doing alright"
"If you know someone getting into this dude's book when they're at a point where they're looking for a self help book, who might be a good author to introduce them to instead with more positive views?"
"I should have cleaned my room, but here I am, watching ContraPoints.  <333"
"Cathy Newman wasn't guessing at what point he was making, she was trying to piss him off. This was most evident when she was talking about his supposed ties to the alt right. To anyone familiar with the Newman interview, it's obvious that you severely misrepresented it."
"I admire Jordan Peterson if not simply for the fact that he exposed me to old wisdom. He said in one of his interviews that he recognizes he is 'riding the wave' and that the practical aspects of his life philosophy (the self-help stuff) aren't necessarily new ideas, and he doesn't take credit for the wisdom he is repackaging. Like you said, for some reason it's being lost culturally, at least where I'm from. It seems like a lot of that wisdom was held by religious institutions which have become less and less popular in recent years. Maybe I'm not precise about this, but that's the sense I get. This isn't to say religious institutions haven't done tremendous harm as well, especially with regards to dogma.  Funnily enough watching his lectures and discussions online lead me to critical videos like yours, and I've been really appreciating taking a more critical view of his ideas. I think the key is keeping an open mind and avoid idolization of ANY public intellectual, (or anyone for that matter) because all are human: fallible and myopic in some areas and deeply understanding in others. I had a conversation with my girlfriend last night where I pointed out some of the dangers of 'social justice' mentality, and she said that I was falsely conflating far-left ideology with ALL forms of leftist activism. After some consideration I realized she was right, and that I needed to think a bit deeper about the issue. Without challenge to my notions I know I can become dangerously ignorant.   I'm grateful for his popularity opening the door to a wider breadth of philosophy that wouldn't have interested me in the past. And of course for leading me to your videos! They're extremely entertaining. Thanks for giving me a little more information to chew on as I try to sort out what it means to be a human on this crazy planet. :)"
"I think most of the confusion surrounding Jordan peterson is he's trying to keep his psychological opinion and political opinion separate, and when he's happy just making a statement to be accurate about the state of reality based on his knowledge from his profession and implies nothing with it, people try to draw a conclusion from that which promotes a political agenda where he doesn't actually have one. Which is what pretty much the entire gender pay gap conversation was: he says they can confidently point to certain factors about WHY there's a pay gap (or isn't; depends on how much you'll respect women's own responsibility in the matter and which two points you decide to measure the gap from), while not saying anything about WHAT to do about it. The WHY is for his field to demonstrate. The WHAT is for politicians.  Which is why it gets confusing as he DOES have political opinions elsewhere, specifically about legally enforced nomenclature in Canada, where it still isn't clear to me what the groups pushing the agenda actually believe and are lobbying, what the people against it actually believe, nor what the people in the law were/are actually considering and taking seriously, so I can't even speak to how much of Jordan's stance on it is justified. But I don't believe he actually wants to create problems for the LGBT community, but if he believes what he believes (again, without being able to speak to what degree his belief is justified), then I can understand why he'd push against it, and doesn't know how to be nicer about the LGBT being used as human shields by 'Post modern neo-marxist' boogeymen. Who I still don't know exactly who are, but apparently there's a lot of them at universities."
"Natalie, what do you think of evolutionary psychology?"
"I like the way you explain with chill composure against dissenters...you're like all wutevs about it and nonetheless have all your points across in an articulate manner...funny at the same time...you don't come off butt hurt sensitive pissed and loud like some people...you have that rationale vibe going on..."
"Excellent video breakdown of Peterson. I recently subbed to your channel, what I appreciate is the intellectual and well researched approach, as well as the humour. I've gotten to used to approaching fellow left wing people with no doubt the same frustration some of the right get when I questions views on the left. And I like that you're willing to give credit where credit is due and not jump to conclusions.   And I think this is the kinda danger we sometimes see with the left and how Jordan Peterson is able to do so well. We're looking like lunatics when we're unwilling to engage people intellectually, whilst he is able to provide a coherent and well constructed argument as to why he is right and he knows exactly how to engage people to promote his ideas.   I've always supported the idea that reason wins the debate, even if you don't convince the person you're raising points against, you may engage people who're watching. It of course requires that you have a strong argument, meaning if your ideas don't stand the test of scrutiny, then they're not really good ideas.   I feel it is evidenced in the comments section here by people who're Jordan Peterson fans are having a positive reaction to the video. It's why I am adamently against deplatformation, except in cases like Alex Jones where there is a direct threat as a result of his platform. Which is a shame, because Alex Jones is my favourite lunatic. Deplatformation just tucks it under the rug so we can pretend it doesn't exist, they still find a platform out of your sight.   Ideas need to be challenged, even our own, because ultimately, if they remain unchallenged, we fall into the risk of forming an echo chamber, which I've seen a lot of."
"All Hail the Lobster Queen !"
"Hi, I liked your video but I have two problems with your arguments. I'll be brief. 1) it is 'neo' marxism because it replaces the concept of class with the one of oppression. 2)As you said post-modernism is a deep scepticism ans as such it aims to de-construct and nullify  every concept, including historical and scientific ones (!) and as such it brings the relativism and the feelings of people as more important then rational and scientific method. And that's why, I believe, postmodern neo-marxism it's a brilliant combination that identifies our time."
"Jordan peterson is just Opera for dudes."
"Hey explains a lot of this in his book"
"JP fanboy here and I gotta say this is the most nuanced and funny critique of JP I've seen to this day"
"LGBT..whatever dudes can destroy a life and existence with one single shitstorm. they are very powerful and in more and more western countries they have the law and law enforcment behind their ideology. people are at courts for 'misgendering' and twitter bans people who refuse to call a dude with a dick a woman.  also the best hierachies should base on competence and equality of opportunity. 2 concepts which the radical leftists hate because they promote equality of outcome and hate individualism and competence.  the right defends the competence element in the hierachy and the non radical left prevents the hierachies to become corrupt and too narrow on the top.  you got him totally wrong."

"capitalism is a system of exploitation as Malcolm X once have say you don't can have capitalism without discrimination, capitalism is based on the private ownership of property by the capitalist it is not based on sustainability, capitalism is based on short Solutions and clever schemes. that's technically what the etymology of the word capitalism is.' Communism is the philosophy that we have to focus on the health of the community.  in the Essence It support worker Rights gender equality and anti racismand if we put a little bit of ';biocentric philosophy'' to it it will also create a vegan world. you maybe know our Society is built on the backs of animals the lowest part of the working class.' capitalism is a system of capitalising this means exploiting. The essence of capitalism is to turn nature into commodities and commodities into capital. The live green earth is transformed into dead gold bricks, with luxury items for the few and toxic slag heaps for the many. The glittering mansion overlooks a vast sprawl of shanty towns, wherein a desperate, demoralized humanity is kept in line with drugs, television, and armed force .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3xxNfnXDKE#action=share I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. even if it being against my myopic arrogance specie,' i being a earthling first and foremost, and as such I'm for whoever and whatever benefits the earth as a whole.' I will be as harsh as the truth and as uncompromising as justice. 2 The corporate capitalists no more encourage prosperity than do they propagate democracy. Most of the world is capitalist, and most of the world is neither prosperous nor particularly democratic. One need only think of capitalist Nigeria, capitalist Indonesia, capitalist Thailand, capitalist Haiti, capitalist Colombia, capitalist Pakistan, capitalist South Africa, capitalist Latvia, and various other members of the Free World–more accurately, the Free Market World. A prosperous, politically literate populace with high expectations about its standard of living and a keen sense of entitlement, pushing for continually better social conditions, is not the plutocracy’s notion of an ideal workforce and a properly pliant polity. Corporate investors prefer poor populations. The poorer you are, the harder you will work—for less. The poorer you are, the less equipped you are to defend yourself against the abuses of wealth. In the corporate world of “free-trade,” the number of billionaires is increasing faster than ever while the number of people living in poverty is growing at a faster rate than the world’s population. Poverty spreads as wealth accumulates. Consider the United States. In the last eight years alone, while vast fortunes accrued at record rates, an additional six million Americans sank below the poverty level; median family income declined by over $2,000; consumer debt more than doubled; over seven million Americans lost their health insurance, and more than four million lost their pensions; meanwhile homelessness increased and housing foreclosures reached pandemic levels. It is only in countries where capitalism has been reined in to some degree by social democracy that the populace has been able to secure a measure of prosperity; northern European nations such as Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark come to mind. But even in these social democracies popular gains are always at risk of being rolled back. It is ironic to credit capitalism with the genius of economic prosperity when most attempts at material betterment have been vehemently and sometimes violently resisted by the capitalist class. The history of labor struggle provides endless illustration of this. To the extent that life is bearable under the present U.S. economic order, it is because millions of people have waged bitter class struggles to advance their living standards and their rights as citizens, bringing some measure of humanity to an otherwise heartless politico-economic order. 3 If you think capitalism give your free choice I've news for you you are very much mistaken in thinking capitalism provides freedom of choice. Sure, you have lots of choices, but capital and the decide what it is you have to choose from - what government to control you, what boss to exploit you, what shop to sell you shit you don’t need. Just try breaking one of it’s arbitrary rules, see how free you feel when subjected to its statutory laws, designed not to protect you but to control and exploit you and see how free you feel then.  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon put it very nicely(though maybe with a touch too much bombast)... To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.'"
"Damn Girl! Does anyone have as many patrons as you?"
"My most pertinent question is where on Earth did you aquire the random mannequin?"
"I don't know where you studied if you've never crossed paths with the SJW Marxists... As contradictory as it may be, that's something you should hold THEM accountable for, not Peterson for simply pointing it out! Where are all these SJW free market champions??   On the other point you've made: I don't think you've understood the lobster analogy as many haven't. It's not dubious or obscure what he means by it and he's not being ambiguous and there's no evil 'obviously true' implied statement behind what he says! If you read the chapter about that you'll understand that his points are 1) Hierarchies, and their inherent inequalities, can't simply be laid at the feet of capitalism or the patriarchy. They go way way back. So far back that lobsters, who are cousins we have LONG diverged from, are organized in such ways. 2) We have deeply embedded systems of assessing our ranking in hierarchies and it's only normal that we'd be depressed and prone to further defeats if we don't find a hierarchy in which we can excel. The same chemicals that make us feel good about ourselves or make us shrink and whither are present and work the same way in lobsters. So strive for climbing one hierarchy you feel you have a chance at, BY BEING COMPETENT! If you pay any attention to what J. Peterson says you know he's always stressing competence and its importance in securing a place for yourself in society, in a hierarchy! No, his lobster argument couldn't 'be used to justify any hierarchy no matter how unjust'! He's repeated ad nauseam that hierarchies can be corrupted and totalitarian and that the left's importance partially lies on keeping that in check. His point is not about gender and race and if you think it is, we just know you haven't actually read the chapter and are arguing something you haven't even bothered to check."
"I think what a lot of critics of JP miss something very important and to an extent you did the same. He's saying that many of those issue radical left wingers want to blame on 'patriarchy' or 'insitutional racism' when there's no evidence It's the case and more than that he's making the point that the reasons why women for example are underrepresented in CEO positions and prisons is more complicated than 'patriarchy'. It's actually so easy to completely refute the 'misogyny' belief I could do it in a youtube comment which really should put some red flags on the ideology in the first place.   I agree with most things he says because they aren't controversial for someone who isn't biased and is a rational skeptic. The one thing i don't agree with is the religious part and his view on atheists as I think It's flawed logic.  I respect this video and Its really well made but you didn't even disagree with him in this video, you just asserted that he might have some 'malicious political agenda' but that's not relevant for most of people who listen to him, what's relevant is that most his arguments are far more convincing than the radical leftists ones."
"Peterson's main political point is against compulsion. This video is just misdirection with irrelevant facts and severe mischaracterization. Peterson's famous objection to imposed pronoun use mandates was not an objection to 'human rights for gender and sexuality minorities', it was an objection to compelled speech. He says this over and over and his core ideas aren't even in this video.  Instead, ContraPoints makes a damn semantic argument about whether what he calls neo-Marxism is really Marxist. That's not important. You're just engaging in the leftist semantic quibbling you deplore. Categorization is not as important or relevant as ideas. You're not talking about what his ideology is, but where to file him under. You end up completely dancing around what his political ideas actually are.  He's clearly not reactionary or for making queer people invisible as this video suggests. He did not even object to the use of gender pronouns and said he was happy to change a pronoun if one of his students of colleagues made a polite and reasonable request. If you'd really watched hours of his interviews, you would have heard this as he gets the same questions from the left over and over.  Peterson's core political message is against authoritarianism. He opposes compelled speech because it's authoritarian and he jumps to comparisons to Stalinism because the idea of compelled speech, of being legally forced to say things you disagree with, is so totalitarian that it is without precedent in our liberal democracies. You should be able to speak or not speak as you please without being jailed, except in the well-established exceptions to protected speech, which are extreme and direct (like ordering a murder).  Fuck you for this propaganda. Maybe 10% is relevant to the point of this video, evaluating what Peterson's message is. This video boils down to a total hand-wave and 'he's not a fascist, but maybe he is a fascist'. There is no justification for asking questions like 'does he want gays back in the closet?' 'Does he push Nazi ideology?' 'Is he gonna put y'all back in chains?' And then you just shrug and say 'I don't know.' Does ContraPoints kidnap and eat children? I don't know. See how that works? Stick to accusations you have evidence for. This is trash. Peterson clearly finds right-wing totalitarianism as horrific as left-wing totalitarianism. He's thoroughly anti-Nazi and could not be more clear about it.  Most of this video is a Philosophy 101 lesson summary meant to make the speaker sound credible when advancing claims with incredibly lazy arguments. It's the same as strategy that it claims Peterson uses, a Trojan horse. ContraPoints talks about stuff he knows for 28 of 30 minutes (with the remainder mostly comedy), so that he sounds educated and credible, and inserted throughout a minute here and a minute there he delivers his lazy ideas that lack real thinking and research. Cut the crap and actually make a good argument. You're only dwelling on what is easy and fun for you instead of gathering evidence to actually make a solid case for your view of Jordan Peterson, the subject of this video but directly engaged with very little. It's a classic strategy. Bury the weak bullshit under reasonable statements and it will be much harder to detect that you're full of shit because most of the time your words will be reasonable.  Just because someone is capable of making 'educated' references doesn't mean that they're a clear and rigorous thinker, as plainly demonstrated by this video. ContraPoints can read. That doesn't mean ContraPoints has a great ability to comprehend. This video communicates a dismal comprehension of it's subject."
"Feels over reals"
"I can see why Sargon likes you. Thought I don't agree with all your points I still found this video extremely entertaining. One thing that doesn't make sense, however, is the fact that you're for intersectional this and that, but don't like hierarchical structures. That's all intersectionality is. Building people, genders, sexualities, races et. Into stacks of perceived oppression and giving them power accordingly. The Black man gets more 'power' than the White man, but less than the White woman, who gets less than the Black woman. This way of thinking is the reason the Left, of which I am a part of, is completely silent on what's been happening in the UK. Muslims are protesting their children being taught about homosexuality and the like in school at a young age. Now they're just flat out protesting homosexuality. Because of the intersectionality mindset the Left doesn't know who to support in this situation. The 'oppressed' LGBT community or the 'oppressed' Muslim community.  Majority of people reject intersectionality because they see these flaws that go unanswered. They see that questions aren't allowed to be asked about it lest accusations of sexism, racism, homophobia, blah, blah, blah be thrown at them and their lives ruined by 'activists.' Intersectionality isn't making people equal like it claims. It's giving people points based on 'how oppressed you think you are.' 'You're more equal than ______ but less than _____.'    Ps.

"I want to marry you, seriously.  Amazing, you are.  And always, thank you so much for your competence and wit.  To me the bottom line of Peterson is the foundation of his entire Shtick is based on a mis-characterization of two anti-discrimination laws, one Canadian and New York, as if they threatened by punishment those exercising free speech."
"I'm here because a (male) friend of mine mentioned about being really into Jordan Peterson a couple of years ago, and I'm a bit worried. I hope he didn't buy into the weirder shit that Peterson had been talking about."
"I've already watched this twice, I'm here for a third 😊"
"Rather long winded and not extremely compelling. Peterson does have an issue with using intentional vague terms that can seem misleading and unclear while still getting an emotional response from both sides. But the correct response is not to assume the worse, but to ask for clarification. In the context of the under representation of women in government, he makes the claim that 'men and women are biologically different', to which you most ask 'what he things are the biological differences in men and women cause a under representation of women in government?'. He can not reasonable deny that he thinks that biological differences in men and women cause a under representation of women in government. He will state, and there likely are, some biological differences in men and women cause a under representation of women in government, but the important thing is to move the conversation forward. For those who don't believe me that biological differences in men and women can be a (not the only) cause a under representation of women in government, think how views on risk. Men are inherently more higher risk takers do to testosterone, not only is the data showing men are bigger risk takers, but a strong link between men with higher testosterone levels and higher risk taking. So, might this cause women to be under representation in government? Well, is it a risk? A person running for congress in the US, will generally need to be willing to quite their job up to a year in advance, then often spend a lot of their own money, risk public attacks on who you are and your past and have a reasonable chance that you lose and get nothing. It is a very risky proposal. So, that might be a factor for why and how biological differences in men and women cause a under representation of women in government. What is interesting and good about this type of conversation is that we can look at some real, solvable issues what cause the issues and how we might address it. Running for congress seems really crappy and a lot of people would not want to try to run because of it. And this risk will likely disproportionately effect women, so what can we do to lower those risks? What if congressional candidate was a job that had some reasonable amount of pay and benefits? Might that lead to better and more open congressional races? Of course, feminism often tries to deny any negative effects on women because of biological differences in men and women and simply blame things on sexism.     And finally, I don't think Peterson has any issue with Trans people or calling someone by a different pronoun if requested politely, there is only an issue when it is forced. The lefts idea that people should be allow to be them selves and people should not be sexist or racist are great, but the issue changes when it you go from 'shouldn't' or illegal."
"I liked this video a lot and I think you made some good criticisms but you also made a couple of JP's points for him. For example, the idea that Postmodernism and Marxism don't go together because Marxism is a grand narrative and Postmodernism says there are no grand narratives. I heard him give a whole talk making this exact point. I think part of why he uses the phrase 'Postmodern neo-Marxist,' is to show the internal contradictions of the philosophies used by people pushing 'progressive' policies."
"I have to admit this guy is pretty knowledgeable. Fair arguments but I think he gets too caught up in thinking Peterson has some sort of subversive agenda, cause he really doesn’t. He wants the best for people and society"
"ContraPoints, what would be your stand?"
"doesnt matter got luls"
"I love her, and this video is probably the most edifying refutation of JP and his arguments, all without giving to offense in the process. I had to chortle, though, at 20:40 when it sounded like you had as much a time as I in saying _incontrovertibly._  It's a tongue-twister for sure, so I try to use irrefutably instead."
"@ContraPoints Interesting stuff. I've watched it twice now; I think I have to watch several times more maybe and continue to fight hard to take in - partly due to lovely soporific voice and the patterns behind text and the pacing editing that rolls along.  And the introductions to philosophers don't quite stand alone - or take a lot of processing to put them into the context of what I know already, it would help to have a basis from which to consider your assertions. And I don't really care about dead philosophers either: I am not yet convinced that I need to, but I am not sure that this video is mainly aimed at me. I am just an odd bod with no training who isn't read up on JP or philosophers and if I was I probably couldn't remember it with anything like this precision you manage. And it feels slightly alienating! Invalidating maybe. But I am not particularly feeling attacked. I dunno if it educates you or JP-fans or anyone, this is stream-of-conciousness-ish. But I am a non-binary lefty with some kind of mixed unique cognitive set-up and struggling to say what I feel but I don't think you'd totally hate me.   However I perhaps see the world very differently. I am generally quite impressionistic in my mental pictures. I see the world as more of a network than  a series of discrete quantities: ideas are like juicy, nutritional little information packets flowing and combining across the wood wide web. I am a tree, or maybe a perverted Ent. And drifting, ambient: ambivalently trying to figure out the the rules of the game and the general flow of strategic good sense or just what feels right, rather than nail any particular positions. And that's how I try to view others too.  Political and commodified and philosophical positions are a blurry melee of dynamics, positions, conceptions and movements to me, and maybe in some kind of quantum position too: shrodingers constituents/citizens.  I tend to look for unity where it's practical to do so, but also peg people in various ways it's practical to do so. So I see lefties as a much more unified bunch than you do, without being naive about it. What you said about everybody fighting and being in discrete and opposed boxes in not my truth and it hurts! lol The practical, cultural and philosophical differences between movements on the left and individuals are really important, I'm not naive or Pollyanna. However imo, people on the left are generally in line with _trying_ to reduce harm, meet needs and actively extend acceptance, value and safety to those most in need of it including ourselves. For this is the law and the prophets. lol.  I do believe this is some kind of universal project, the point of political philosophy, and I'd rather nudge people in the right direction or spit back at affronts than dissect and nullify. I do all three though! If not literally spitting. Notwithstanding just getting angry at people who seem antithetical to everything right or good as it seems right then in my frame of mind that moment.  Or uncomfortable and self-reflective as per rules of the game.  I guess Peterson's likewise got a schema going on that draws on emotional and organisational word associations, helped by encounters with the array of people you say he mentions, and with language and culture of or influenced by the philosophies or political movements that talk about cultural marxism which you were explicitly avoiding analysis of here. It might not make a lot of sense to you, but I think it's some kind of gathered 'wisdom' and mode of being that for him is about grasping towards what he needs. Maslow's triangle is a lobster game and building podiums a human one!? In his view!? Illuminati confirmed, lol.   But I think that's also true of the various segments of the right and conservatism in general: it's a schema or several tied to notions of heirarchy. And tied to safety-seeking or status seeking behaviour and defensiveness. And I don't really have a clear model for how it ties in with philosophical schools of thought except that it's a circular or spiralling relationship based on a mixture of social experiences, language, mood and and thought and conviction - maybe the CBT vicious flower is the right model here!? It's sketchy wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff. In my head.  I am not sure how far you can recognise or do also function like this!?  Here you're mainly doing the dissect and nullify, or at least K.O./melt: treating this like a card game or RPG but also like a taxonomist, alchemist or early chemist. There are discrete positions or elements which you're lining up and testing against the phenomena that is Jordan Peterson. You're treating this like a straight-up battle of ideas: like a Pokemon battle somewhere on the gym trail of public discourse. And the mood music is part of it, because we are also aesthetic and sensory beings, lol.   But it's still a bit weird! (the things you do in the name of progress!)  Cutting room floor bits:  1. I didn't grow up with precise definitions and I definitely didn't grow up loving gender categories or any kind of expectation or conceptual boxes! For example: I am not a terf but I quite liked the articles on Everyday Feminism that said we can be trans/trans-inclusive and gender-critical. And though I do loosely peg people politically or otherwise, I don't think I should trust it and I do not experience nor feel able to definitively analyse and categorise the people I interact with who are expressing any kind of idea as firmly within one philosophical box or another: that would seem peevish or small minded and a bit random to me, it also seems unlikely to be especially accurate, or maybe likely to project a false kind of accuracy: and prejudicial to people and the ethics and causes I want to promote.   2. I do get a feel for some more well known figures and schools of thought as it comes through into popular culture and  form the idea of ideological spectrums like colour/tone/saturation graphs in graphics apps or like landscapes with town squares and fancy bridges as well as  backwaters - philosophy is like bunches of associations made by people everyday or various kind of mapmaking not boxes - in my mind these maps and spectrums of thought and behaviour and impressions and cultural tendencies work more like graphic equalisers, or say county boundaries, or a person or animal's typical ranges or ergonomic patterns of life - this within a landscape - a pattern or boundary or range which might be any shape at all rather than seeing the world as a wide grassy plain full of herds of venn populants belonging to discrete philosophical schools of thought who as individuals might be identified via dichotomous keys; nor in reverse can a person be scanned, processed and traced on the holographic war map of philosophical thought using particular  steampunk-ish barometric pointers that hover over it, pinpointing one specific water-tight philosphical locus. Fun as that sounds! I am also not sure why such an impressionistic distillation, according to cognitive peculiarities etcetera, etcetera, is less valid: but it seems to be so in the world you create, somehow. Sorry. Not that I am feeling immediately attacked. But I think that's an aspect you're missing as to why and how Jordan Peterson can characterise the whole of the left as a unified attacking force meaningfully called (finishing the unfinished off)  *whatever he called it*   Sign-off It's just gone 4am - I have been at this _hours_ - I hope it was interesting and digestible, for you Natalie and for anyone else  who has read this far! All the best! xx"

"All ism's are dangerous imho"
"Postmodernism and identity politics, at least how I see it, go hand in hand because postmodernism, from one of its most influential sources (if you hadn’t skipped Derrida who is at the very core of Peterson’s notion of postmodernism, and who frequently invoked Marx’ spirit in connection with postmodernism), advocates for the possibility of as many interpretations of the world as there are individuals interpreting from different experiences lived and different meanings associated with those experiences. The association of the two, from the right, aside from Marx’ obvious influence on the postmodernist enterprise as a whole, is a result of their criticism that the left has no boundaries on what is permissible in terms of identity, leading to an inscrutable subjectivity with no value-system to provide a hierarchical structure that they deem so necessary. Neo-Marxism, in this context, seems more of a moniker to collectively refer to “Marxism through the lens of postmodernity”."
"'...infamous BBC interview, where Cathy Newman...'  I'm gonna assume BBC means BIG Black Cock so the video remains factually accurate going forward."
"This video got me to postpone my human>>lobster operation until I've had some more time to think it over. Thank you!"
"Natalie, its time to stop calling Peterson a professor and a clinical psychologist. He is no longer either, at least in part due to his violation of professional standards in both capacities."
"Ok this made me literally laugh out loud multiple times.  Signed, irresponsible incel with a dirty room and borderline obsession and krab krush on the lobster king."
"26:05 aye pink flamingo"
"Is this person a tranny?"
"I enjoy this channel. But the comments are so fucking groin-curdlingly cringe inducing for me to read. Lefty internet is filth."
"After just one minute, I can honestly say that this is one of the most fascinatingly funny videos I’ve seen in a long time...anyone who can pull off an in-joke about “tolerant Jacobins” is a genius. I salute you!"
"You're incredible, and truly an inspiration. Devious and genius. Almost alllllll-lllllllll of Academia ain't got shit on you. Thanks for sharing your smarts, struggles and perspective."
"Off to a great start when just 1:30 in and (especially when considering that a drawn out skit was used as an intro) an over simplification misleads the audience into creating a misconception about his politics, leaving viewers with a bad taste in their mouths before the critics have even begun.   No, Peterson’s problem wasn’t with respecting a transgendered individuals need for correct pronoun usage. He has shown (so many times that it’s exhausting to watch a podcast he’s on anymore because he’s always asked the same damn questions) an understanding that when many students come up to him to request a different set of pronouns be used that it’s to destroy the chain of power in the classroom, but to provide the student a safe environment to learn, and telling the difference between these two motives is impossible and therefore unfair to attempt to find.   No, Peterson’s problem was being required to respect these pronouns by law, as now mandatory language is instated. This is the same as making it mandatory to thank anyone who holds a door for you. It’s the social consensus of what you’re supposed to do and it wouldn’t hurt to have everyone respect this rule but it violates every humans basic right to free speech.   In short, Peterson would respect any students wish to be referred by their preferred pronouns, he was just offended by the obligation to do so by law. It had nothing to do with some irrational fear of the LGBT+ community or far left ideologies."
"Peterson is pro-cultural dialectic, pro-free speech, which is nice, but implies that Judeo-Christian values are superior to animism / mainstream secular society. Higher purpose, we may concede, may be more likely to be neglected without weekly meetings or some kind of disciplined and recurrent spirituality. Let's remember also, though, that 'higher purpose' can loosely equate to philosophical certainty..which is itself manifest in the SJW rhetoric that Peterson so detests.  When Peterson says the West has lost faith in Masculinity, he seems largely to criticize post-modernist skepticism in narratives, sense data, and value judgments within the individual ontologic experience..but this sort of psychological masculinity (firmness, what Peterson likes to refer to as 'low in openness')..is it not more present in the 'angry SJW' than in the average individual today? Rorty is good to study for the 21st century. He acknowledges the futility of attempting to secure a final vocabulary but also places a priori value on progressive, secular society, egalitarian values which have their root in the enlightenment and ancient Greek society. Peterson reads maybe half of what a PoMo thinker has said / written and then equates it with a collegiate freshman's 'idk' mindset, typical after having read, say, Nietzsche's On Truth and Lies in an Extramoral Sense and then experiencing an existential crisis of faith. BTW the East, Buddhism, Taoism, blahblah Confuscian though, much of it bears resemblance to central texts of stoicism, epicureanism, and skepticism re: Ancient Athens. So - TLDR: cultural influencers are just really loudmouthed people who like to show people they can defend a firm stance. It's all playground shit until someone loses a job, experiences an eviction, or falls below standards of safe living due to discrimination."
"The dude at the end - realizes your points are reasonable and intelligent yet still 'disagrees' with everything you say...how...sad. for him."
"First time checking out your channel,awesome and funny.I will subscribe please continue to make yourself heard."
"Here’s a simpler hypothesis. The fundamental biological driving force behind evolution (including the form of our societies) is to improve the odds of reproducing and giving your offspring the same or better odds. This also makes a prediction. Society will almost always fall on the side of whichever politics they think will give their kids a better chance of reproducing and allowing their kids to do the same. You can say this is morally wrong if it steamrolls your particular philosophy, but getting upset about it would be like getting upset at your tree for doing photosynthesis.  This isn’t a vacuous claim either. When one views society instead through the hedonistic/utilitarian lens of societies role being to make life the most enjoyable for as many people as possible, one would be left confused and angry about how people can be transphobic or follow this or that particular conservative political figure/theory.  In short, “humans choose/do/believe ______ because they want a better chance for their genetic code to get passed on” will likely help us understand the majority of human behavior better than most theories that get lost in minor details of this or that idea/person/group/value system."
"Jordan Peterson speaks traditional common sense backed by experience, research, studies and statistics - and judging by history traditionalism with specialised gender roles is the only system that has ever succeeded long term, even across disparate societies. Contrapoints is basically a shock factor trannie who hasn't got the credentials to take on the more sensible Jordan Peterson and Helen Smith. If you think you're smarter than all the wisest traditional people in history that built the world - chances are very strong you're an idiot who's just trying to justify being a freak. Trans people are not important at all. Normal people who do useful jobs like tradesmen, and high IQ people like engineers and scientists are important because they actually do useful things and make the world better instead of dressing up and spouting rubbish on YouTube."
"Man. I wish I found this channel earlier. Its just grand."
"20:38  Considering we live in a world where talking about the wrong crimes stats is racist or saying that men and women are physically distinguishable from one another is a hate crime... Yeah, non-controversial topics, these days, are contoversal."
"8:52  C E N S O R   I T"
"11:34 cheddar cheese"
"1:26  Less then two minutes in and its already misunderstood the fundamental basis of his argunent lol."
"This was so good that I actually have nothing to add. Well done!"
"Hi, love your videos and especially love this one. I've been following Jordan for a while now and there is a Joe rogan podcast where Jordan talks about the development of the idea of a post-modern Neo-marxist in a good amount of detail which I think you might find gives a greater understanding of what he means by the concept, also he himself claims that it's a contradictory idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G59zsjM2UI. It starts around the 1:25:00 mark. I would love if you watched it and made a second Jordan Peterson vid.   Cheers x"
"You omitted a major important detail for which J Peterson came out to the public. Freedom of speech."
"I still lean alt-right but I think Contrapoints is hilarious and JP is annoying and a hypocrite"
"YEAH, FUCK YOU DERRIDA."
"How funny, I came across Peterson in the lead-up to the 2016 election in the USA. There were many things on YouTube at that time that were very challenging and alarming. For example black pigeon speaks ,Rebel media, Stefan molyneux, Etc. These sites and points of view were  easy to unpack, but Peterson was very oblique to me, I felt that I was being sold a reactionary bill of goods, and I held him in great skepticism but I didn't know why..... I just knew he was I disruptive provocateur and nefarious Pied Piper. Thank you contrapoints for Illuminating exactly why his gobbledygook is gobbledygook."
"was that Collin Moriarty at the end?"
"My friend sent me to your channel. Tried to watch another video, and though it was well produced, it wasn't quite my style. I decided to check this one out. Love the use of lighting to splash color and the overall use of color throughout. I appreciate that you don't only mention your grievances but also the things you like about Peterson, which I really respect. Too many videos I watch seem to go out of their way to cast the subject in a very specific light, usually all negative, and it makes them feel less genuine. This is great."
"'Nitpicking' the video"
"man i like what he speaks about but i despise all that trashy 'scenes'/opportunities to crosss-dress. they are terrible.... and dont bring anything of value to the message and just prolong it"
"Jordan Peterson’s stance seems pretty clear, he’s against fanatical destruction of norms that hold society together in the push for some utopian promise of a fair and equal world. It doesn’t matter anyway we’re all going to be swept by development of AI where humanity will find itself even more isolated and jaded, where everything will culminate in manufactured transhumanism. At that point it won’t matter what labels are used."
"9min is enough to see that this video has little to offer"
"Who got an erection watching this?"
"that wallpaper!"
"as someone who you would all consider alt-right i would like to say that we do not support jordan peterson. He is controlled opposition used to lead the right down the wrong path. that is all, good day"
"+ContraPoints YASSS omg this video is the best. Thanks for the informative and dankly made video. You're golden."
"Very nice video, raising cool questions. I was always been bothered by JP bringing up Neo-Marxism without explaining what it actually is. You point out the contradictions between postmodernism and identity politics and theoretically, they should indeed be mutually exclusive.  However, this raises a question. How common is it for the same person to argue that womanhood is a construct that we need to be careful about how to present and teach young children, while also advocating quotas in positions of power? I'm not an intense observer of politics in general, but I don't think you need to scratch too deeply to find that these Ideas are commonly bundled in spite of being contradictive on the surface: on one hand, there is no objective difference between races and sexes e.t.c and on the other hand, we need to have quotas for races and sexes. Both Ideas don't seem super common, but when I do hear them but I feel like I hear both ideas uttered from the same mouth."
"My first experience of rigorous examination of my own sexuality, and of course, Jordan Peterson's opinion."
"4:10 scrambles for the tinfoil. 20:12 Opposes ALL social progress? HMM yes tricky, tricky... hard to say but I'm leaning towards a strong yes on this one. 20:44 when has he ever left this open ended? From what I've heard JBP always elaborates on this example with something like a discussion on 'the big five' and in what way personality traits on average differ between men and women which in turn inform our preferences or the gender-equality paradox that shows the more egalitarian a society is the less gender balance can be found in the typically male-dominated fields and top-level positions in company structures.   I'm looking for something concrete? Most of the video is just about postmodern neo-marxism being a vague goofy term, which I mean... sure? I see a lot of people seem to love the constant comedic digressions in this video but I just find it distracting, I wish you just went more in-depth on a big topic you disagree with him on aside from vocabulary. It's so tiring to hear someone claim things about a person and then like in this video back it up with 'oh this or that person is just TOO good at public speaking and rhetoric, it's impossible to pin them down BUT also they clearly have a repulsive agenda'.   Not good enough, if someone cares to respond with their opinion: which single point presented by Contra in this video is the strongest and most clear-cut example of why JBP is 'insert negative adjective'. I constantly see this video shared and circle-jerked in response like: 'LOL did I hear the name Jordan Peterson? He dun goofed, check this vid out.. ye that's right, checkmate atheists.'"
"Saargon... you little goose. Still makes me laugh so much."
"im just imagining the look on Jordan's face as he's watches this abomination"
"This is so absurdly well done.  Please continue what you're doing as it makes the world a better place."
"Haven't we been here before?"
"Hahaha I quite like Peterson but this is fucking brilliant"
"Generalizations aren't the same as strawmans. But go on"
"1.  Sorry but you don't actually properly addressed post modernist neo-marxist claim. You just simplified it to bad SJWs vs Peterson when Peterson said it multiple times already that it is like you said contradictory at first glance but only at first glance.  Inter-sectional Faminism is literally structured like Marxist movement. They take from Post Modernist deconstruction part which drives ideas looking for next oppression and then they take from Marx structure part which creates victims vs oppressed aka proletariat vs bourgeois   Which is why you have White people vs Black people as new Burgoise vs ploretariat. Women against Men Minorities against Majority Disabled vs Abled Fat vs Thin   And so on.  You are disingenuous to suggest this is simple painting of SJWs as slight or pseudo garbage. And it is disingenous to suggest that post modernism has nothing to do with marxism when Derida and rest of founders were themselves defending Marxism up until 70s when bodies stacked high.   2.   You claim that he uses tactic to rally behind truth to further his arguments and making people fight against the truth which makes them look bad.  You used example of 'women and men are biologically different' to which you said that him using that for talk about government jobs has nothing to do with it.  My question is: ' Why it is not ? when we have decades of research pointing out how women pick jobs, how women very by temperament and how government job is highly stressful job that might not be something women want to pursue, that women want to have children and by that they don't want to spend their best part of life in government working 24/7 under scrutinize.  I mean look at Scandinavian gender paradox itself. A study was done where countries were rated by freedom of women factor and amount of women in STEM fields.  It showed exactly that the countries which give women the most rights have the least amount of women in STEM jobs. Countries like Algeria have 40% women in STEM fields and they have shit laws toward women.  The obvious conclusion is that as reduce environmental factor which represents laws against women, biological factor like temperaments, iq and so on INCREASES which pushes women into more sociological work where they can meet people instead of working on things.  That is not some white nationalist MRA claim that is proper study done. Science. An undeniable fact.  --------------------------------  And this is the sort of thing i see in your video. You go deeper than most in what he has said because most of the time his critique is that 'he is nazi' but you can't fight his ideas if you don't take his core arguments and can't debate them openly and win those arguments.  the other part is that if Peterson is your problem then i seriously think you don't have problems in life. Peterson is left wing just not left wing as some people would love him to be."
"We do realize Jordan Peterson has an autoimmune disorder and during his biggest touring time was up for a month straight sick as a f****** dog it's so sad all this world has become so fake and we don't feel people as real people not saying I agree with it I'm just saying we're all just f***** up y'all can we just f****** get along damn or we just going to kill each other"
"Yeah it's quite hilarious when your parents met through AA and both of them are counselors and you have a bigender grandma am I literally the only person who was aware of this stuff pre 2010's you don't know what it's like rebelling against your Jewish and Neo atheist family by becoming a Christian Mystic Jew"
"I ain't afraid of anything I literally just used 3-ho-pce  come and get me bitch!"
"Your videos are great, I'm late to the party but I'm happy I discovered your channel !"
"PZ Myers sent me here and I thank him profoundly! 👍🏼 WOW Girlfriend YOU ROCK!!! 🤩😍 I’ve rarely seen such exuberantly beautiful intelligence! I’m flabbergasted! My flabber has never been so gasted!  Sincere thanks from a Gay Socialist Canadian! Vive la Reine! ❤️⚜️🌈⭐️🌹🖖🏼🍁🏳️‍🌈☮️❤️"
"I view jordan peterson like a con man cut from the same cloth as a Donald trump but with a much more pleasant disposition. He brings in so many subjects into his ideas to make a gumbo of nonsense and it sounds so smart. But to see the gaping holes in his arguments all you have to do is to see him speak with a person who is a expert on one of those subjects. The problem is that he's a better salesman than most experts."
"You know there are many points you make which I disagree with massively yet you make a lot of damn good points too which I can tell you have actually thought about, which I respect hugely. Also, you’re funny as shit and I love your weird ass humour, I can tell you are a natural born performer, which I’d respect even without the damn good points. Just shows that you don’t need to agree with me on contentious issues for me to respect you, fair play to you, good video!"
"Well its a lot like motte and bailey..academics who are intellectually supportive of post sructuralism can have personal political ideas that share resonances with marxism..I mean if we are Talking Foucault, he actually had positive views that were somewhere around libertarianism/standard centrist liberalism. The whole idea that  postmodern neomarxism doesnt hang together is akin to the famous 'motte and bailey' style of argument"
"Natalie Wynn, I want to lick your brain."
"A lot of this confusion over JP is pretty obvious in many of his other videos. He constantly says to some of these new topics that we don't know what will happen yet, or what will work, and he has actively encouraged people to start marking the studies and gather the facts. His negative response towards so many left-leaning political ideas is because they are unfounded and often disproven. He is not saying 'Be silent', he is saying 'Go gather the facts first, then come up with policies.'"
"Dude, that video was awesome! As a right-leaning guy who never understood Peterson's success, I'm glad I can finally with a left-leaning guy on that. The whole thing was hilarious. Sorry about my broken English.  Cheers!"
"Natalie, thank you for taking down this tool down."
"Shut the fuck up thot"
"God, I wish the left was as unified as JP daddy thinks it is."
"This is a man"
"I hate you Natalie for making me realize you're probably not the first person to make a JP sex mannequin"
"Its a bit ironic that the left sees the right as a 'bunch of straight white men who love patriarchy...etc etc' and other troupes, but when the right (or centre for that matter) cherry pick philosophical points from the left - they are missing to many nuances and shades of grey. Aha.. sure.  Postmodern, rejecting all narratives. Neo-marxists, evolution of proletariat and bourgeoisie to a more simple oppressor/oppressed narrative.  postmodern neo-marxist - anyone that rejects all narratives and only sees remaining narrative of oppressor/oppressed. Simples.  A few other points: Hobbs, Hegel, Satre and basically all idealists and existentialists were pro-totalitarian governments. Come at me with your 'no, you don't really understand their work...' and make a point."
"Not going to waste any time on whats-his-name, but GOD this woman is smart, entertaining, makes me uncomfortable, makes me think, and sets me scurrying off looking shit up."
"lol at the Pink Flamingos reference"
"'Echoes past bestsellers like...'  You forgot to mention 'how to make money and influence cunts'  FTFY ;)"
"it was Channel four with the Peterson interview, not BBC.  We really dont need to be giving silly twats anymore reason to come up with these BBC conspiracies"
"Thanks for talking with mostly words I can't understand but lots I don't either."
"I want you to have a conversation with Jordan in person. I enjoyed the video but damn I'd prefer just face to face conversation. Prepare the topics and points beforehand so no one complains and make it happen."
"That was awesome, well done. I've never heard of this channel before. Subscribed:)"
"Full version god save the lobster queen when?"
"Suscribed :)"
"wow a talking dildo."
"Jp fan 2minutes in this is super entertaining"
"Very insightful commentary"
"You start the video off with a blatant lie. “He thinks laws created to protect transgender people will lead to Stalinism” He is VERY clear with his point that his issue is with government compelled speech and the protection of speech freedom. His stance has NOTHING to do with transgender people."
"“So many daddies in this one” 😂😂"
"I hope everybody watched till the end of the credits :D"
"This is even more excellent than David Pankman's critique."
"This is so much better than anything I could make I love u"
"you defeat 'the patriarchy' via the competence hierarchy which makes it not very patriarchal at all, really. which makes a mixed economy developed from capitalism kind of, historically, the most inclusive system with the least amount of social oppression ever instituted. not bad for a bunch of boring old white dudes."
"He doesn’t have a problem with gender issues, he’s said it many times and said he would use pronouns. He has a problem with his government legislating what he can say, no one should control what you say and think, they have no right, we should all live free"
"Did a bit of a dive on this sort of thing today.  This video is delightful, the set is wonderful, the research is thoughtful and thorough.  Thank you! The thing that escapes scrutiny by the left is actual body count and loss of quality of life due to Marxist ideas.  For that, Solzhenitsyn.  It's the elephant in the room.  It's why the alarm he's sounded is heard as so aggressive.  The people who see a bit down the road where people who are different are dropped from roofs are very disturbed by what they see.  There are elements of our society that guide us for ill.  Not everyone sees them.  But they exist, and they ascribe to some view of the world where everyone must agree and free (opposing) thought should be abolished.  The opinions may change but this drive doesn't waver.  It's sad, but true.  I think terms are irrelevant.  This quality of man is the thing that must be fought, whatever you call it, and it exists in all of us.  Again, thank you.  This was great.  I learned a good deal and refined my thoughts on some things."
"19:52 so true!"
"I just watched this and it seems like valid criticism to me. I’ve watched some of Peterson’s psychological lectures in the past and it seems to me like he’s got pretty decent insight into his field of study but it seems like everyone that tries to talk in any way about mass political anything is going to be subject to so many holes in thought that it’s impossible to be coherent and to to talk about things that big. So, I suppose it’s completely valid to undermine anyone’s large political philosophy.   Epistemologically speaking, it seems like I can’t find anyone who enters into that arena that doesn’t make almost catastrophic errors in logic or has everything riding on some faith based dogmatic scheme which may imply that it’s beyond the scope of our minds in the first place    Plato, for example, was talking about political ideology for city states with approximate populations of, maybe, 350,000 people. And in something that “small” you could probably actually see the sociopolitical outcomes of subgroups and their impacts on surrounding communities in a more realistic way; almost like we could see the kind of craziness of the ferndalians (a small farming town in Humboldt county, CA) who got into all of those ridiculous scandals because of the county fair, obviously their behavior was pretty shameful and not actually in the interest of the city. (This is just an observational truism, obviously some people make selfish decisions that don’t have a positive outcome. In regards to Plato, his ideology was even at odds with the size of Athens and his attempt to actually found the republic failed.)   But, there is no way for me to do the same thing in say, like, San Francisco where there are almost 3x’s the number of people there versus ancient Athens, spread over a larger area. There’s too much practical chaos for me, as an individual, to sort through the information without resorting to faith based assumptions provided by 3rd parties that usually use fairly lazy scientific methods to prove their points or try to persuade me via fear based rhetoric.   Which is just to say that I have no clue and am not sure if there is anything really useful that can be said about the “mass political good” without resulting in some sort of suppression of some group (whether popular or small) and we’re generally left without the tools to determine whose suppression actually results in a higher quality of life. (That’s an interesting and new thought to me; mass political good only as the suppression of some belief.)   Which, enter Buddhist philosophy, Buddha suggests that no one should even talk about “what army is doing what, what the king should or shouldn’t do, etc.” aka mass political good.  It’s one of the things frequently listed as a no-no under “right speech”. Perhaps, outside of the philosophy of world abandonment, there’s a really sound epistemological limit that suggests we should do otherwise and avoid the thing all together.   In which case, maybe the reason we only find people who are vehemently opposed to political ideology in the field of political ideology is because the only reasonable thing is to be opposed to political ideology.   Either way, it’s a perspective that seems to be closer to an observable “here and now” than an endless loop of relatively abstract, hostile interlocution. That’s just my opinion though."
"My purpose in life is to criticize Plato. Fuck Plato, that essentialist bastard."
"One flaw in defining possible paradoxes within definitions. Dismantling grand narratives (such as belief in patriarchy) ultimately IS a GRAND NARRATIVE. Hence a connection between postmodern and - mind it- a NEO(!) Marxism. Also, why list all those groups under the definition of Identity Politics? Just say it doesn't cater to rights, equality, justice of Straight White Men (TM). I think this is the reason for the entire issue right there. The exclusion, abandonment and non-recognition radicalises these men. We need to be mindful about their struggles, in a non-ironic way."
"As a JP fan, this was brilliant! 👏🏾😄"
"While I applaud you for trying to articulate a couple of counter points to Peterson’s line of thought, I think there are a couple of issues with your arguments.  First: Peterson never denied that Post moderns and marxists are in this constant intellectual fight over the notion of a core ideology versus the abolition of narratives. In fact he even said it himself: sometimes without grand narratives the post modern teachers resort to basic marxism, which he states, and rightfully so, as being an incoherent intellectual maneuver.  Second: Peterson never said there is no diversity of thought in the West. His main assumption is, on the contrario, that diversity of thought and the enlightenment developed because of the judeo Christian tradition among the academia during that time, as the bible is a text with multiple stories and visions of the world. Personally I do agree with you that he neglects the importance of Greek philosophy and the rediscovery of Aristotle in the 17th century but all in all, his main assumptions are still correct and you did not refute them in the slightest. Ask yourself: why didn’t you have enlightenment in Islamic countries? For the development of a philosophy you need a fertile ground, and a religion that’s not TOO dogmatic."
"Im reading all these commemts, along with this video  And one thing fascinates me There are a lot of people here who say here that they didnt get jordan peterson or what he implies by his videos until you watched this video, eventhough you have seen dozens of JPs  Back in the day when you didnt get something we called you stupid Well if you watch something a lot of times and you didnt understand it  Dont you understand that you are IMPLYING that you are stupid?  You see guys that you 'imply' with your words what i say that you imply  Well thats exactly what contrapoints does to JP Doesnt understand jack shit what JP is saying, than CP makes video for attention and views portraiting him as a bad guy by saying he implies bad things about other people, taking things he says out of context, people who are lazy (what left mostly consists of, and the reason it always fails) wont watch his full video And will just agree with this edited propaganda  You guys do realise that if anything contrapoints said in this video was true, JP would at least start losing popularity, instead he has never had such a big support till now  But than again, you people said you dont get half the shit he talks about, well probably you dont get he is gaining support not losing it  XD"
"I'm dying here, thanks for putting the fun back into this internet rabbit hole! lmfao."
"I actually despise Peterson so much that this video was useful in hearing more of his arguments second hand, because I literally cannot listen to him speak without getting pissed off for more than two minutes. You have a soothing voice and presence and are so funny and insightful. Danke gorgeous."
"The 'I need new roommates' joke is so good on so many levels"
"Couldn’t you just ask Peterson, What do you imply with that statement?"
"The epilogue! Hah! Yeah I'm sure Dave _totally_ disagrees with _everything_ this person says and isn't just saying that to avoid outing himself as a fan on his _totally_ fair and unbiased platform where agreeing with a leftist on _even a single thing_ would be _totally_ unproblematic. Sure. We see you, Dave... welcome..."
"'I'm going to divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it.'    This hit my funny bone so hard and at such an unexpected time, I fucking dropped a full bowl of soup. I was holding it with both hands. And then, wham, with neither. As my mad cackling faded into something halfway between a sigh and a snicker, I remembered something.    Fuck soup, ya know? It's just a hot, oily version of cereal and it doesn't even get you high. Yeah. Yeah, soup can fuck right off."
"I officially dislike jordan peterson now. Someone that tries to always put his opinions in an unknown area where people will never know what he actually thinks is dangerous and cowardice! Not to mention the far right wing audience that actually like to listen to him and interpret his answers matching their world views ....and jordan peterson not acknowledging this is irresponsible"
"So is the cross dressing shtick? Or is it really how you dress?"
"👏👋👏👋👏👋👋👋"
"1. *Designating the enemy* ContraPoints presents JBP as someone who was against something assumed to be progressive to dogwhistle right off the bat, as any leftist would, that the man is regressive and limited. Then the professor just rose to fame with help from the media, implying JBP shills for some superstructural system (capitalism, patriarchy, take you pick). The fact he already had a following among the Alt Right and 'dark' intellectuals because he talked publicly about things (eg, IQ v. unemployment with automation) that most academics avoid is omitted. _Balance it off by admitting the Cathy Newman thing wasn't great (To libs, this means 'I will do better', to others it means 'look my video is reasonable, keep watching')_ 2. *Devaluing the input* CP boils JBP's discourse and Jung's writings down to three generalizations about 'world religions'. The three points are correct but, just as they say nothing about any individual religion, they're meant to give the impression that JBP has nothing relevant or deeper to say beyond them, which is dishonest. By way of a heavy joke, his following is dismissively characterized as 'neckbeards'. _New offset: admit JBP isn't a nazi_ 3. *Put the guy on trial* CP then acknowledges JBP's criticism of the left only to contain its perceived validity ('within a certain mediocre corner of academia') and suggests that his concerns are parochial ('localized') and he's obliviously ghost-driving some international backlash that hurts the vulnerable. Note that vulnerable = sacred cows of the left. 'Gender equality, LGBT acceptance (etc.)' aren't vulnerable, they're often the official ideology/religion throughout the West and increasingly legislated. People who question them in a less 'professoral' way than JBP lose their jobs and reputations, but this all comes down to who is 'privileged' and who is 'oppressed' according to the left's arbitrary dogmas. _No more offsets_ 4. *Strawman time* CP takes advantage of the editorial format in JBP's bestseller to enumerate and insist on his 'rules'. Message to the audience: the left is freedom-loving, why would you listen to a guy who wants to set limits on what you do? CP falls victim to his own hedonistic biases in his assessment of other people's wants and needs. JBP's audience is actively looking for time-tested rules to knock their lives into shape, but CP lets you think they're getting disempowered. 5. *Call to laziness and false dichotomy* 'Ughhh who wants to talk about deep shit?' It's a dead white guy thing apparently, and pathetic at that. CP wants you to choose between 'fighting oppression' and reflecting on 'deep shit', ie, Western philosophy. _'Remember when I said JBP was not a nazi? Well that's actually where I'm going with this but we're still halfway (ish) so for now I'll just say that I can't say it because everyone will think I'm crazy. Of course, if you've put up with me for 10 minutes already, you might as well climb Mount Woke for the next 20. Get bang for your bucks, get an akkkshuall talking point, you know. Crazy is good.'_ And so on and so forth. The only subtle and intelligent thing about CP is his impressionistic use of fallacies and baits to create a crescendo and defuse your critical thinking."
"7:57 this is a deviation from rhetoric I've heard before, if you ever see this comment can you explain more?  I was under the impression that 'patriarchy hurts men too', and that since all the ills of the world are mens fault, any and all men who have gotten a shit end of a deal (even ones who were abused by women at any stage in their lives, but particularly childhood) have gotten that deal because of, dun da daaaaaa, PATRIARCHY!  So did you misspeak or do you define the patriarchy differently than what I am familiar with?"
"i came across your channel yesterday and, i mean this genuinely from the bottom of my heart, i have learned so much! i love your world view, i feel like you use humor on both sides to have a wider scope of society and thats how im tryna be!!"
"I love the solemnity and simultaneous disdain that you give JP and his extremely derivative ideas."
"I think you brought up some great points but your intro could have been more specific, he opposed government legislation regarding the pronouns we have to use, he opposed the government forcing citizens to use certain pronouns under legislation."
"16:51 No. That is all."
"Bravoo!!!!"
"I do not think it means what you think it means. You are obviously very smart but JP our lord and savor has keyed in on something and many are clamoring to course correct and save face.  Make no mistake there is a war against western civilization and it is happening from within."

"Jordan Peterson often says that postmodernism and marxism are at odds and thats one of the most important criticisms he has of the left. They believe that there is no way we can know anything about the world and yet want to propagate a socialist agenda, thereby claiming their own 'correct' view of the world. He always says that it doesn't make sense but that's because the left uses postmodernism as an argument against others to deconstruct and marxism to claim that they have the solution. The big problem is the incoherency that even this highest level of analysis reveals. Gender has become a spectrum, race is indicative of opportunity and so on. Such contradictions. Then there is the problem of prescribing essentially the same solution to every single problem.  I think one of the biggest practical threats is that of abortion. The left claims that we can't know any fundamental truths, yet says that abortion should be the choice of the mother. Nonsense. Identity politics is in itself a horrible ideology. I think it is very clear what Jordan Peterson believes in terms of social hierarchies. Basically men and women sort themselves into hierarchies based on different characteristics and the economic hierarchies can be explained by a largely meritocratic system. The only reason for dismantling that hierarchy is if you wanted to make everyone economically equal, which is a marxist idea. Or because the hierarchy had become so corrupt that it would fall apart anyway. In the west there is no evidence for a racial hierarchy and using that claim to dismantle the 'patriarchy' is a postmodernist tactic. Marxism and postmodernism are antithetical to what has made the west unique and better than other political and philosophical traditions. They arose from the same society but they are antithetical. The problem is that there may be three major schools of thought on the left that internally conflict and all those ideas in their own right are bad. Marxism is the founding idea of states that murdered approx. 100 million people in the different states that it was adopted. Postmodernism is an incoherent idea that can be used to support any political philosophy since its premise is one of moral relativism. Identity politics may be a useful tool against oppression of certain groups but when those groups become enfranchised it tilts easily toward a totalitarian stance. All of these ideas are also being used as justification for censoring political opponents and for violence. They all capitalize on a selfish notion of entitlement and false virtue and wisdom."
"This video made me feel safe"
"Jordan Peterson: I'm always right because I say the biggest words. Alex Jones: I'M ALWAYS RIGHT BECAUSE I TALK LOUDEST!!!!!!! Ben Shapiro: ImalwaysrightbecauseItalkthefastest!"
"Lots of good stuff here."
"Do you need a Russia caption person?"
"I’m a left leaning person, who stumbled upon Jordan Peterson videos online and thought he seemed very insightful, reasoned and “straight talking”, and makes a good case for his views.  I was concerned with some of the points he made, but equally he seemed to be coming from a logical, fair and level headed place. What i’m trying to say is this is a brilliant video, and you are amazing at explaining where Mr Peterson is succeeding and not succeeding as much, and why. So thank you."
"I love your style"
"Ive watched this video like eight times and only now did I pick up on the Pink Flamingos reference XD"
"That bastard Peterson stole Charlie Hunnam. Goddammit Charlie"
"Thanks, mommy."
"Oh 511k subscribers that sounds it’s quite lucrative.  I wonder how that would work in a non capitalist society. Mmm"
"Nice echo chamber!"
"Good critique of Peterson (I can't stand the right-wing reactionay fuckhed). Reasonable and critical and I'm sure he'd be whining about it! Haha. I do disagree with the implication about Stalin being a '20th century mass murderer', but that's another discussion."
"Perhaps he hadn't yet clarified this at the point of you making this video, but I think your section on hierarchies is a gross misrepresentation of Peterson's points.  At numerous times he has stated that hierarchies only work if they are just, and that a leftist view is required to keep hierarchies in check in order to make sure they function correctly.  In conversations with Eric Weinstein they have gone into depth about specific hierarchies and institutions (such as banking) that are not being kept within the rules properly and as a result have been become corrupt and self-interested.  I think you straw-manned his lobster hierarchy point, and I think it's disingenuous to pretend there aren't people railing against ALL hierarchies when there are people openly calling for socialism in the US.  There are absolutely people who are railing against the very concept of even a just, competence-based hierarchy, and these are the people Peterson is making the point against.   Also your pronoun point is so completely incorrect.  Wildly so.  Yes, the concept of an individual requesting different pronoun usage (ie treatment for themselves) is an individualistic notion.  Taking that concept to the extreme and codifying it into law as compelled speech is not even close.  If you'll notice, Peterson did not appear on the cultural scene years prior when pronouns became a thing.  He appeared when it became a thing to encroach upon freedom of speech.  Very sudden misrepresentation in an otherwise well done video."
"i'll never get why so many leftists love it's always sunny in philadelphia"
"great video. correction it's channel 4 not the bbc at 2:03 :D"
"LMAO it really looks like him having you sleeping on his chest."
"Great Analysis 👍Personally I believe the nature of reality is best understood by amalgamating pre, modern and post modern philosophy."
"💘💘💘"
"Hot damn, I'm totally a Jordanite but this was delightfully entertaining. Besides, it's very rare to come across reasoned, non-hysterical criticism of JBP. Awesome job, even if I disagree with a majority of these critical points. Subbing regardless."
"I love your vids. It’s hard to argue to the people in my life that trans people are people too. It’s good to see an intelligent, confident, and (convincing even tho that doesn’t matter) trans woman doing the good work of modern critique of philosophy"
"Not gonna lie I got war flashbacks when Foucault popped up"
"I would also add that I think you pay scant attention to the influence of Nietzsche and C.G. Jung in Peterson's work."
"Thanks for the perspicacious and entertaining video. I am a Peterson fan but appreciated the astute criticism. I do think that many on the left conflate a Post-Modernist ontology and/or epistemology with a Marxist political ideology. Yes, these two views are very much in conflict--as you point out--but Peterson's critique is also valid. Figures like Gilles Deleuze or Jean Baudrillard would most likely label themselves as 'Marxist' or at least 'post-Marxist' despite espousing ideas more suited to Post-Modern discourse. I think Peterson's grouping SJWs and more traditional Marxists together in a single critique might seem facile but it is nevertheless warranted."
"I'm into weird shit.... But this is the weirdest fap session I've ever had....."
"Who ARE you and where have you been all my life"
"I fucking love you. Fucking awesome video, time to binge watch the rest"
"This critique is shallow, like my response"
"On the point about how Peterson tells us to do things. I think there's a difference in demanding pronoun usage from someone and merely giving suggestions on how to raise your kids, the latter is what his book is really doing (as you mentioned it's akin to other self-help books).  The rest is pretty nuanced so I can't say much until I think about more deeply.   Nice video :)"
"If you want to talk with jordan peterson fans dont start the video by 1) saying canada wanted to protect transgender people, calling someone by their preferred pronoun isnt protection, keeping them from being beat on the street is protection. 2) Dont generalize his arguments by saying that he thought canada would become stalinist if legislation was passed to call transgender persons by their preffered pronoun. Im half inclined to turn off your video right now, as your bias is clearly showing. Also get over yourself, im half asian and kids used to call me 'chink', i wasnt inspired to run for office and ban the use of the word 'chink', i moved on and got over it."
"thank you ver much for this. really liked this piece. the best part is that you're beaultiful."
"Peterson is a hippie wierdo but at least he's taking on the postmodernist neo-Marxists. Frankly I don't care what you call them, there IS a unified front on the left towards driving conservatives out of the public sphere, especially in universities and HR departments.  Conservatives in college know what I'm talking about- it's an extremely isolating experience. I once accidentally made a joke to a conservative friend in class to 'just tell her you're voting for Hillary'. The whole room went silent and you should have seen the look of fear in his eyes. I still feel bad about it to this day. That feeling is why Peterson is popular."
"I want to be your friend"
"How did I JUST find this channel? This channel is a gem and I wish I had found it sooner."
"It's true. Marxists and Postmodernists have different ways of trying to subvert Western values... But they both want to shut down opposing viewpoints, such as Peterson (and anyone like him), try to hound out any opposition, and serve the purpose of the enemies of the West - be it the Soviet Union, or Islamists. In that way they are totalitarian. And no - you don't need any Nazi propaganda to warn you of subversion of the West... Is an ex-KGB agent not enough? - https://youtu.be/5gnpCqsXE8g"
"Peterson fan here.  But I have to say I love your sense of humor.  Are nails the only thing that you need to be a woman.  Yes!  And Daddy Daddy Daddy!  I love it and just subscribed.  Still love JP but you're beautiful, funny and intelligent enough to have meaningful criticisms.  Also, you are not afraid to sprinkle in humor to your serious insights.  Much needed in this evermore humorless political landscape.  Just remember keep one hand for the hole, one hand for the pole, both for debauchery!!"
"just one thing... how can people still think the Bible is the West? like... How??? Look at native American beliefs or native pagan beliefs of Europeans, if you want to talk about the West, you bloody lobster."
"laughed my head of and it was very detailed well done!"
"Crap I love this. I wanted to criticize this as a conservative and Peterson fan, but nah. Just the different perspective I've been searching for outside of Tim Pool"
"These are so well done.  Impressive!"
"You fearless bitch, you make me laugh so hard."
"Ouch! the cutting board scene with voice-over ' the reconfiguration of human genitals! ' On Hierarchies, I think Peterson is foolish to talk about lobsters, when there are simpler more obvious examples to draw from nature. And for the Left eating itself, what more appropriate example is feminists now defending trans people competing in sport against opposition by classic lesbians like Martina Navratilova."
"If left are so good and generous could they please give back my ELEVEN relatives that they took along twenties century? And thirteen years my grandfather spend in their concentration camps? So shut the fuck up, socialism fail every time."
"I seriously thought the Jordan Peterson mask was Gordon Brown for a second... Erstwhile UK Prime Minister. You're welcome."
"Oh, the biological erasure.  You're right.  We never experience reproductive oppression, like being forced to have babies and are judged by breasts we might not want and a myriad of other biological reasons that that have contribute to our oppression of what people know to be 'a woman' today.  All destructive gender stereotypes - particularly 'I'm so submissive.  I must be a woman.'"
"Thanks."
"fascinating !! (^:"
"Peterson: I heard a bird flap its wings in a trunk and when i opened the trunk it wasn't there, therefor God.  After that BS I couldn't take him seriously.   There are obvious paths he wants people to follow to because he totally leads you there and then when you ask him 'Is this what you're on about?' He'll deny cause it sounds damning and bad. You can't pin him down because that's the way he designs his arguments...kinda like the alt right he reserves the right to plausible deniability.  He's constantly redefining things to use semantics to trick others. Says he believes in god but if you pin him down to what he considers god it isn't in any way how anyone else in the world defines god. To him god is a feeling or an impulse, not anything like what 99% of the people in the worlds idea of what god is."
"Thanks, great video.  'Clock me, Amadeus' - another flawless gem!"
"Thanks, great video.  'Clock me, Amadeus' - another flawless gem!"
"I’ve come across this channel before. I guess I wasn’t as enchanted as other people. The one thing I’ve wanted to say is this: you fit my category of boy, and I’d kiss you on the mouth (with tongue)."
"I'm so happy my friend recommended your channel, you're incredibly patient. I relate to your heavy sighs 😄 I don't know how you managed to deconstruct all this bullshit (with humor no less) -- thank you for doing it, keep going, sending you lots of love ♥️"
"This was very funny"
"'because everyone is problematic and I disown them all'"
"This commentary is just dizzying. I finally lost interest when she argues that Marxism and Postmodernism are Western philosophy. True, but they can originate in the west and be anti-west at the same time. And then she uses de Sade to illustrate that the western tradition isn't all Judeo-Christian values. Yes, but the exception is not the rule. By her logic we could then say that because de Sade is western the west has always been a culture of sado-masochism. The exception does not define the general rule, and a rejection or rebellion against a culture can arise in the same culture without being synonymous with the former culture.  Further, she argues that postmodernism has nothing to do with identity politics. This is patently false, and postmodernism asserts that because everything is a narrative (including the scientific method), and all narratives are fictions, in which case they are all equally viable, we should then give precedence to formerly marginalized narratives. This is the same as saying something like, 'We should listen to what a POC has to say about the issue'. There's a direct link between identity politics, social justice, and postmodernism.  That said, Peterson gets his take on postmodernism mostly from just one source, which is a  book by Stephen Hicks, which means his knowledge on the topic is largely second hand, and filtered. There are some good points in this amusing video, but, I just found it confusing."
"This has 15k comments and it's old as fuck so I am positive you won't ever read this, but the things you said after claiming spending a really long time watching lots of Jordan Peterson and reading his books will be thorn in my side if I don't express it."
"I haven't even spend that much time towards Peterson, I don't really like self help and literal interpretations of Abrahamic religions, but I know enough to get bewildered at the things you associate with him. You talk about trans people wanting to be referred as a certain way. Peterson time and time again has stated that he never misgendered anyone and never insulted one of his students based on pronouns, his entire point was that the government was regulating language and telling him HE HAD TO DO IT and that's why he wouldn't do, and when he talks about transactivists he's talking about people promoting, passing and praising such acts. Are you actually in favor of this? From the very little I've gathered about your personality I doubt you would be, so I assume you'd agree with him on that. When you link his ideas to reactionary ways and the use of 'neo-marxist postmodernists' as a scapegoat to shut down progressive politics? He has been extremely clear that he believes in equality of outcome and the progression of living standards to all. He never defined identity politics as an exclusivity to the left and he has criticized the ones on the right who do it, leading to alt-righters' passionate hatred for him."
"So your perception of Peterson's stances are way, way of the mark. And I can't really understand how you missed so much when he has to explain himself every 5 seconds to anyone so he isn't portrayed as neo-nazi by the media."
""
"Ok, that's for Peterson, now in regards to your ideas about 'neo-marxist postmodernism'. When you see us use that word (us in the sense of non-conformists who are critical of the current leftist status quo) you need to understand that the current wave of postmodernism was born out of the arts movements."
"I don't personally add 'neo-marxists' to it because I think it's a pleonasm, but just to clarify what he means by neo-marxist, it is the philosophy that socialist insurrection cannot happen by sudden revolution but instead it has to happen through slow, creeping appropriation of academia and media, which then deconstructs hierarchical notions of capitalism. See, the german socialists had figured a long time ago that Marx was an idiot in regards to economy. Marginal value, surplus value, worker's ownership of the means of production, the idea that capitalists aren't workers, it's all really infantile rubbish. But they were still quite fond of his descriptions of class struggle, so just adapt that to other microcosms of society, you can separate pretty much anything. That's neo-marxism in a very basic way to put it."
"Now, post-modernism. Like you said, modernism introduced the scientific method, objectivity, logical standards and the most important thing, when talking about the arts fields: discipline."
"If you want to be a good artist you need discipline. You need to invest your time in learning the principles and then exhaust yourself practicing these principles until you acquire the eyes of an artist, where you look at things and you see tridimensional shapes, lights and shadows, planes and perspectives, color and reflection of color. These things were all pretty great, but like anything humans do it was taken a bit too far. Art teachers were exclusively about discipline. Don't waste my time with creativity unless you have the principles in there. No anatomy? Fuck off. Yeah, that was restricting a lot of creative expression, as you can imagine. And that's where postmodernism comes from, before Foucault. Artists wanted to expand their art further from the confinements of disciplinary rules."
"And, at first, it was pretty great, some great artists came from that movement. But then, like anything humans do, it was taken too far. Yeah, you can express yourself freely but you should still learn the principles, you only have to gain from learning perspective and color theory, discipline is actually a good thing, but that's not the direction postmodernists went."
"Like you said about the philosophy, it's skepticism, right? At first, yeah, it is, and the whole progression of postmodernism in art is reflected in the philosophy. It went from skepticism to deconstruction to compulsory deconstruction. It was no longer about questioning the modernist discipline and what it had established, it was about deconstructing it for the sake of deconstruction, without ever even wondering if something needed to be deconstructed. The absolute pile of shit you see in museums and people laugh and call it modern art is actually postmodern art. It's first concerned with deconstruction of any sense of aesthetic you could appreciate to make a statement about relativism, and then it is art second. What used to be a middle finger to the establishment has now become the establishment (Much like the entire left, which always needed to be counter-culture and rebellious by nature but now that it won the new millennium's culture war it has become the system and the status quo, so it requires constant victimization and alienation to convince people they are still an unpopular marginalized group of warriors and revolutionaries. This is no better observed than in the existence of feminism, where every single one of it's narratives is a lie to convince women they got the shit end of the deal, which makes it a lot easier to control around with populist speeches) and so the entire thing is now a circle jerk of 'intellectuals' sniffing their own farts and bragging about how avant garde and deconstructive they are."
""
"So to link this culmination of postmodernism to this notion that you find comically conspiratory."
"I know as a first worlder you must be so disconnected from the cold war struggles and all that shit that you really would find hard to believe there's actually socialists still alive trying to control the world, so let me take you through our Brazilian history."
"In 1990 (the year I was born, so not trying to say I'm youthful but I'd call that pretty goddamn recent history) in the city of São Paulo there was a reunion of socialist political parties and organizations from all over the world with the intent of discussing socialist progress in latin america. This would be called the Foro de São Paulo."
"Lula, from the Brazilian Worker's Party (the organizers of the thing) said that while talking to Fidel Castro about the importance of Latin America in the socialist cause Castro said that Brazil was the most vital part of the operation and that would be the inspiration for the creation of the forum."
"You see, socialist interest in Latin America wasn't anything new. Interest in Brazil in general wasn't anything new. The US knew from even before the world war that Brazil held the largest reserves of natural resources in the world, they always played close buddies, Brazil even helped them in WW2 even though it had fuckall to do with us. In the Cold War the soviets also became very interested, if you know your history then you probably already know about the Caribbean Missile Crisis so no need to go deep into it, the important thing is that there was financing in socialist groups and guerrillas in Brazil. The US didn't quite like the socialist insurrection in Brazil growing in the horizon, so they supported the Brazilian military in the execution of a coup, where they took the government and said 'yeah, this socialist shit? it ain't happening'. Throughout this military dictatorship the socialists guerrillas tried to destabilize the government, one of those guys was Lula and his buddies, the guy that would make the Forum decades later. The socialists lost short game but the Brazilian military lost long game, because in order to prevent socialism from spreading they had to engage in what you americans call McCarthism. Lots of innocent people were persecuted because of that, lots of artists and intellectuals who were too dangerous to even run the risk that they had socialist affiliations. So their popularity went to shit and it would be used to this day as a talking point from socialists (who nowadays say they were fighting fascists for democracy, as a socialist is one to do)."
"Of course, the long and determined crawl paid off, Lula was elected in 2003, the most voted president in human history. Needless to say, guy was popular, and he used the abundant wealth of resources to do some really good stuff. But it's never that simple with socialists, is it? They quickly set up state monopolies in all the major industries and then through the BIGGEST CORRUPTION SCHEME IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND they financed socialist regimes all over the world with billions upon billions of dollars. And then they went on restructuring Brazilian media, art and academia.  They made art incentive laws, which poured tons of money into artists (most of them who seemed to conveniently be very aligned with the party). They created a lot of welfare infrastructure and affirmative action-esque policies to benefit all kinds of groups, even going as far as creating legislature that puts the life of a woman as more valuable than that of a man in the eyes of the law, if she's killed by a man (despite the fact that in Brazil half of the people killed by their partners are male), so you can guess who had the allegiance of feminists. They created lots of Federal Universities to offer free higher education. They were the major contributor to the largest television network. With their seemingly endless amount of money they seemed to have most of the influential spheres of society either under direct bribe or having a sense of debt to them."

"As a 13 year old i fell deep into watching jordain peterson and the armourd skeptic, shoe on head, sargon of akkad and other people that are comonly concidered alt right talkers. Luckily for me i was curious enough to be skeptical and look into the other side. I pulled myself out of that fucking sad rabbit hole. Anyways point is keep it going your doing fucking great. Im 17 now for reference."
"So hierarchies are natural. But which ones are the most natural should be the follow up question.   I would argue the small self organising tribe/ village. I would also point out that the positions he seems to advocate for all require force to keep their hierarchies. The further right you go the more force.  Of course the response will be so does communism. To which the obvious response is that every tried communist nation state is inherently autocratic and so not natural.  But then I'm not one who believes that natural hierarchies are inherently the best ones. Just an argument against lobster theory."

"the problem with the pronouns was the fact that they were to be enforced by law....meaning if you call someone a girl a guy because they look more masculine than feminine you could go to jail for it. That was his whole issue on the subject, to which you respond by saying he is against the use of pronouns people prefer. You are doing the very thing you are accusing the left of doing, ignoring what he is saying and trying to make him seem controversial"
"My understanding is that he got the post-modern part from the fact that many political activists these days will dismiss opinions from other ethnic, racial and gender groups based on the argument 'you don't know what it's like to be _____' Like when she says that it's easy not to complain about the patriarchy if you're not the one that suffers under it. I may be wrong, but I'd imagine that is a sort of post modern thinking 'your unique perspective prevents you from understanding my unique perspective and suffering'"
"I'm really glad I found you. You're gorgeous, smart, and funny. I love your videos and how you think."
"I only watch You and Jordan Peterson to keep an „open mind“. I don’t agree with any of you 100% but i think the both of you are making really good points and have some insight ideas. Could you PLEASE have a public discussion i bet anyone could learn something new and change their minds a bit after hearing such a conversation."
"I’m a big Peterson guy and this is probably the most articulate challenge to the ideas of any person of whom I am a fan I’ve ever seen. I’m impressed."

"8:08 yassssss"
"I want your lighting"
"This is kinda dishonest. Peterson doesn’t tell people how to live and force them. He tells them how to live if they want to live a good life. No force. The left does however force people to use pronouns and shuts down speech they don’t like and try to boycott and ruin people’s lives and reputations.  And Neo Marxism is the repurposing of the class struggle to a race struggle. That’s what Peterson elaborates on then greatly. identity politics doesn’t advocate equality it’s proponents think it does. When it establishes a class guilt like race guilt."
"Nietzsche said  Christianity was an orientalization of the west."
"Youre the only sjw ive ever heard that was both funny and smart. Good on you! made me think"
"- Came here with my guard up. - Saw comments from allegedly Jordan Peterson fans saying that you had good points that made them think. - Lowered my guard and watched the video. But being honest, I got very little value out of it. It's a fairly long video so I expected at least some new ideas and criticisms, but honestly I've heard it all before. And most of the time of the video was eaten up by all this pointless acting. Also, talk about misrepresenting points and straw men, my goodness... It was like you were taking cues from Cathy herself. I feel like the only reason these videos are even remotely popular is because of the way you present yourself, because it certainly isn't for what you are saying.  Although I would love to watch a video of you and him having a discussion, maybe then there would be some value in the result."
"Upvoted for Bach"
"What's your milk budget?"
"I'm on the right, but the thing that most pissed me off is the way that cucumber was cut.. Awesome video"
"Do I agree w/ everything Jordan Peterson says, no. But, the difference btwn his book of life advice and the issue he took a stand on was that the left was going to make a LAW compelling speech. Wether or not the effects of such a law ended up benign or not is irrelevant. Somebody had to at least say something. B/c this was around the same time the left was wanting to criminalize 'hate speech' w/out a clear definition of what that was. We can not let one force of motion bulldoze it's way too far w/out any opposition or question. We know that as a society we have to very careful about what liberties we give up and why b/c you would be an idiot to trust the govt with anything. And the right is far too trusting of the govt as well, like when Nixon completely screwed us out of a working health care system. They stand by that system blindly. Are these idiots who follow Jordan Peterson or any social leader in debate blindly dumb dumbs? Yes. But there's a lot of dumb dumbs in this world. And there needs to be an open discussion and counter point ideas. Which is why I love and respect your videos as well. But making law compelling speech, even if it IS for a good cause, is a slippery slope move. Just like when Nixon OKed health insurance."
"No but seriously i love this show. Thanks Contrapoints you fiesty intellectual lady😙"
"Wait wait wait....whats my seafood got to do with any of this!!?!"
"Yes, yes, I noticed this. I was like what? what? How can they on the one hand say they are fighting for the rights of women and for trans people and then start saying gender is a social construct and not real? Don't those two fights contradict each other? Weird. I feel like all roads that the left is fighting for leads to fewer people being born though. It's like they aren't trying to destroy the west, but people. They want fewer people. Maybe no people. Maybe not the left, but the shadow government, the evil puppet masters ultimate goal are fewer people. Being trans, or same sex attraction makes it harder to procreate. Then the feminism makes it so women are less likely to have kids, or have a lot of kids, then abortion is getting rid of kids at a very young age. Their belief in climate change means that humans are bad for the planet and we need to stop procreating. See all roads lead to we shouldn't procreate. See."
"26:00 nice Pink Flamingos reference"
"A friend introduced me to Peterson recently and I couldn't get over how little sense his whole narrative made. Jumbling and redefining marxist, post-modernist, neoliberal ideas and confusing individualism and collectivism in key arguments - - presumably to suit his own butthurt over getting booted out of the university system. Glad to see I'm not the only one thinking these things (of course, explained and researched much more eloquently here than any sentences I could string together)."
"4:55 'Nazi conspiracy theory'  I mean... aside from all of the Fabians, Gramsci, and the Frankfurt School, all of which gives extensive and in-depth guides on how to destroy the bourgeois society from inside out, culturally and politically, in order to achieve the late-stage capitalism and make the final communist revolution possible... Sure, it's a nazi conspiracy theory, clearly that, no bearing in reality whatsoever."
"this is completely off topic but my god, she's so beautiful"
"As far as I understand Peterson's definition of postmodern Neo-Marxism, it isn't fully postmodern nor Marxist. In his view the postmodern idea that there are no truths, just interpretations leads to a lack of meaning in one's life. A void that is replaced by Marxist ideas. Because of this I don't see it as a fundamentally impossible Ideology."
"Lets just imagine for a moment that J.Peterson(or other guy) would of done that thing in the bathroom to a manequin with HER face on it...imagine the controversy"
"AAAAAAAAAHH! amazing! and the peterson fans are the ones you can actually have a dialogue, you can see by this comment section"
"Absolutely stunned by the creativity and argumentation of this video.  Delighted to meet you, ContraPoints!"
"To the people who came here from vice welcome to the family. Hope you stay and subscribe."
"This is the most important YouTube video. Ever."
"I think it’s really funny you said someone needs to get boys in shape cause I used be a centrist and Peterson’s psychology lectures were a spring board for me improving my mental health and analyzing the world more clearly and after that I moved away from a centrist to more left view. So yeah you’re right"
"Please go into politics. We need people like you!"
"If you are confident enough in your opinions, you wouldn't feel the need to put all of these unnecessary props and all the acting."

"You're awesome, and funny, and this video saved me several hours of youtube 'reasearch'. Sooooo subscribed"
"I have been looking for someone to properly and in detail explain this to me  for a long time. Thank you!"
"The reason the left is postmodernist is because they basically took traditionally accepted truths and subverted them, basically saying, “f*** 2 genders, we think gender is a social construct, or we don’t know if god exists, or being gay is fine because we can’t know if god disapproves, or women should not have to cover themselves in muslim countries, but should feel empowered to do so in western countries.” Its these ideas that basically takes all the truth we thought we knew for centuries, and turns it on its head. Postmodernism is exactly that. You might say identity politics are not postmodern because they are organized, but that’s not what Jordan Peterson is talking about. He’s talking about the progression of skepticism. Postmodernism isn’t about doing away with everything. It’s a vagueness, the idea that we can’t be sure of anything, that truth can turn into something else entirely. It’s essentially relativism. I’m Catholic and this a major theological issue in the Catholic Church right now. Many bishops and priests are postmodernist/relativists."
"Love you 🌷"
"Peterson fan here,I bet he would like the video (loved the lobster queen)"
"Thank you. You've opened up my mind, and more importantly, my heart."
"What’s the difference between postmodernism and early modernism?"
"love your work"
"Not much of a response, just some theories masquerading as facts with far too much filler. Maybe I'm just not counting points."
"Wasn't Jordan Peterson opposing c16 because it's supposedly compelled speech? Does anyone know what part of the bill could have lead him (whether it is true or not) to believe this?"
"She did a great job. This is most likely the best rebuttal of Peterson on youtube. But I think she could've examined the postmodern neo-Marxism a bit more in depth.  I thought Peterson's formulation of postmodern neo-Marxism is the transformation of the dialectic from one of human history being that of the struggle between the working class and the owners of the means of production to being that of the struggle between the oppressed and the oppressor (i.e. subaltern theory) - criticizing the supposed us v. them approach of left social justice politics. To me he's obviously wrong because there simply isn't a monolithic approach to this formulation (the dogma doesn't exist, and if it does is localized as she says earlierin the video) - and in fact he engages in the same supposed dogmatism he decries.  I'm curious if there are more direct rebuttals to his conceptualization of supposed culturalmarxism.  P.S. This potential misunderstanding on my part (or may giving more credit to his statements overall) may also highlight how Peterson is totally incoherent himself (and not those 'postmodern Marxists' he claims have overrun nonexistent universities...)"
"Derrida still sucks."
"'So much for the tolerant jacobin' already have me rolling"
"Why didn't I know about this person before, simply brilliant!"
"Left wing milo"
"It's easy to not complain about the patriarchy because it doesn't fucking exist. Women (particularly in the West) are freer than they have ever been in human history, with limitless opportunity, and that buzzword is only used as a crutch for self-pitying failures who require an authoritarian specter to explain their misery."
"i think the main point Jordan Peterson is makeing is words should organically grow into use and should not be forced onto a populous via law. i think law changing is the thing that freaks him out. other than that i would like to see Jordan Peterson and yourself in a debate."
"If you don't know what he means by 'post modern neo Marxism' just pick up Stephen Hicks book. He's had him on his podcast too. His book details the connection between Marxism and post modernism, particularly in politics. There is a common intellectual thread connecting collectivists of all types, whether the classification they use is economic (Marxism) or cultural (Gender, Race). It's not a conspiracy, it's a well documented argument about intellectual traditions - whether you agree or not. Cheers."
"All your videos are a Gesamtkunstwerk!"
"I came here because Vice made this fella out to be as the savior of the internet, with his ironclad logic and well thought out counterpoint or contrapoints. Although quite intelligent, mischaracterizes the arguments that Dr. Peterson proposes. Not only that, but completely misses the point on why Dr. Peterson makes these arguments. For example, on the straw-man argument of the hierarchy of monarchies counterpoints, that's not at all what Peterson states, he just claims that hierarchies are an eventuality of social-animal organizations. And yes, monarchies were an aggregate result of generation upon generations of families successfully attaining and consolidating wealth and power. Peterson also talks about he tyranny of hierarchies and the oppression they bring, which this guy conveniently sidesteps. This is just one of many misleading, straw man arguments he makes. For all his pseudo-intellectualism he's just as much of a philosophical charlatan as any of his left-leaning brood."
"I really enjoyed this video. I am a fan of JP and just heard of you, so thought I'd start here to see where you stand. This was a great, educational and informative video, but I think you make a few assumptions and implications that a lot of people who I'd consider your intellectual inferior make in regards to JP. However, great vid and will watch your other stuff and subscribe, due to your excellent ability to explain things that I have trouble quantifying in my mind. Thank you!"
"New subscriber here... you are my new found angel/demon!!! I love your videos!!!"
"And lobsters aren’t Kosher, so there you go..."
"Hello and thank you! This ruled. I've read a fair bit of Marx and Marxists thinkers, and I have never come across (heh) the phrase 'equality of outcome.' But, like 'postmodern neo-Marxism,' Peterson tosses the phrase around it's a central tenet of Marxist theory."
"That bbc interview was just badly done."
"26:01 Literally word for words of an intro to a Skinless song, 'Skinless - Pool of Stool' \m/ Great track! 'Condone first degree murder, advocate cannibalism, eat shit!' https://youtu.be/eXEYMRjFsrU Check it out \m/"
"With regard to the lobster, Peterson is saying if examples of patriarchal hierarchies exist in the animal kingdom, then it is evidence that Patriarchy may not just be a Western cultural phenomenon, or a purely socio-cultural human construct dreamed up by men in power -- unless one accepts that lobsters have the intellectual prowess to construct abstract ideas such as social power structures. It should be a pretty clear inference to anyone who watches the interview in context, since he does explain exactly what he means through the back and forth.  What's silly is that although you were right that he masks Judeo-Christian values within what he refers to as 'the West', in his gravely mistaken cultural Marxist narrative, and even that he often obscures more controversial points by prefacing them with more acceptable ones, it seems to me like you couldn't resist the urge to take a low blow, and justify Kathy Newman's low blows, by mischaracterizing him, possibly as payback to his blatant transphobia. Part way through the video, you admitted you might come off as sarcastic, and your disdain clearly shows.  Of course, the lobster argument isn't foolproof, or even a good argument, so one should ask why everyone feels the need to strawman the claim instead of just arguing against the actual claim, which should be easy."
"Good points about Jordan Peterson up to about 21:00. By suggesting inherent biological differences between genders, he is obviously saying that the metric for determining equality from making social justice policies must account for these factors. There is a method (by old white men, if that matters) that has been in effect for a thousand years for countering claims that one thinks is incorrect: By demonstrating how they are incorrect through inductive (scientific) or deductive reasoning. Regardless of Kathy Newman's frustrations -- and it is quite unfair to even characterize this, since she started with her dishonest debate tactic from the beginning of the interview -- blatantly strawmanning the opposition to influence the public is massively disrespectful to Jordan Peterson, herself, and as a feminist figurehead, the feminist movement. It is in no way justifiable despite Peterson's mistakes; two wrongs do not make it right."
"1:07  'Reason. Power. Truth. These are the kinds of topics that I don't care about.'  And like that, you've lost any standing for a good argument."
"20:35 Peterson is probably implying that the unequal outcome of men to women in government is not empirical evidence of systematic patriarchal oppression (though he as no delusions of some corruption in every system). I gather that he believes that we should take into account that less women on average, choose a demanding political career, have personalities with enough trait disagreeableness, or are interested in politics, among other legitimate reasons, and that these factors are not products of a corrupt power system or socially constructed western artifacts of Judaeo-Christianity. It is more of a critique of social constructionist than postmodernism, and he never said that all postmodernists believe there are no legitimate hierarchies. Then he would probably point to the studies that empirically show that when gender freedom of choice increases, so does the inequality of the outcome of these choices. I'm just guessing what he would say because i read both of his books and have a decent grasp on his whole deal. I'm speculating a bit more when i would guess that it's the root of his issue with postmodernist that they would believe these things to be unknowable therefor not true."

"If you're not wearing nails you're not doing womanhood."
"Hi ContraPoints, I think you have the conception of 'postmodern Neomarxism' a bit off kilter in your video. You say it's nonsensical but I think it's because you're viewing them as wholly disparate entities that can't share parts.  The consequences of power = the postmodernism side  The focus on group identity = the Neomarxist side  The fact that people heavy on identity politics tend almost exclusively to relate a group's misfortune to power grievances is evidence of what I mean. If there are no power differentials, in their view at least, then the need for identity politics diminishes.  Thoughtful video but I felt this is a critical distinction you failed to pick up on."
"Thanks for making this Natalie, you're doing important work."
"Says the capitalist"
"That is a damn fine video."
"The problem is who decides if the hierarchy is oppressive or not"
"Great video =) However, my understanding is that JP opposed Bill C16 due to the idea of compelled speech rather than anything to do with the trans community. It is a long running principle that while the govt can prohibit certain forms of speech (shouting fire in a theatre for example) it cannot force you to say things. BTW, the lobster queen was awesome.. extra points for using impugn in a sentence.. =)"
"My first contrapoint video. Im a fan of Jordan Petersen, maybe it my rebellion after graduation from a shit show of a liberal college. But I have to say, you are sooooo funny. Im five minutes into this video, and i snorted a bunch of milk and it came out my nose, because I was laughing so hard. Thanks for these videos."
"genius!"
"I always wondered what was all that hype in the English speaking world about Peterson. Thank you for enlightening me!"
"I will re-appraise Jordan Petersons ideas in future"
"Honestly, 28 minutes are too short. I could have watched for another hour. So happy to have found this channel!!"
"Hello :) I discovered you through Vice and as a Peterson-Fan I HAD to watch this video! Thank you for putting the criticism and doubts I had about him in hilarious, informative words!! ❤️❤️❤️"
"I have dreamt for ages that someone would put the work in to make accessible, intelligently made, well researched, clear and funny videos which dissect these kind of issues. As there is so much trash on the reactionary right that is poorly researched and relies mostly on rhetoric to convince buffoons to agree. I do not have the time or the courage to make something like this myself, but knew that there was a big gap there. AND YOU DID IT! Thank you so much, ContraPoints, these are amazing."
"I lose it every time you call him daddy lol"
"love your videos. This one could be simplified tho by saying: Go read philosophy. Also, This jerk JP is a hack who found a way to make money with polemics disguised in headiness. And Btw you are gorgeous."
"The hierarchy argument Peterson invokes is his most direct way of pushing back against fundamentals of postmodernism which ostensibly shun all idea of hierarchy/value systems - postmodernism in his mind leads to a foundational bedrock that naturally facilitates moral relativism - moral relativism, which he despises and sees as the evil of our time...this gyrates uncomfortably with identity politics which, it can be argued, relies upon as much value being placed in a person's perception of something as is given to the seemingly 'objective reality' (which doesn't exist when you use deconstruction and postmodern ideas to upend and call into question the immutability [and position in the now democratised value system] of so-called objective truth/reality). Postmodernism is kind of a form of philosophical and linguistic anarchism...rebelling against the very language used to form it...and espousing the 'undecideability' of meaning...which affords further focus on 'narrative and interpretation' as opposed to 'science'. This is extrapolated in his perception of how academia is being increasingly 'corrupted' by postmodernism...the knock on effect being his on campus clashes with SJWs that were the catalyst for his meteoric rise. I think he sees the postmodernists as tricksters who were playing word games and challenging the establishment for the sake of being recalcitrant... and in the process of doing so created a monster that they couldn't/wouldn't/didn't care to control - a monster that now running amuck and threatening to dismantle the sacred 'church' of academia/science. The result of all this is what he calls 'neo-marxist postmodernism'...the genesis of  'lefties' who use postmodernism as the underlying principle to justify their ideas."
"@contrapoints I’d like to say, as a white, cis, mostly straight, gun owning, construction working, weight lifting, sort of republican macho daddy... I think you’re super hot and this video was a pleasure to imbibe. Anyway, I dig Jordan Peterson’s lectures and some of his ideas. I even went and saw him talk live on his tour with his lackey, Puppy Dave.   One complaint I have of his critics on the left is that they blow his “controversial” opinions way out of proportion and seem to pass up good arguments in favor of crying wolf about his supposed ties to the alt right. You didn’t do that even when vice did, and THAT kept me watching and listening- along with your hotness and set design skills. 😉⛓ You probably won’t read this, but I feel compelled to say it. Keep it up! You’re doing good work."
"these are terrific"
"Also loving that she is singlehandedly furthering the normalization of the trans community."
"Interesting topic and perspective, do not necessarily agree with everything that was said."
"Peterson's talks and writings remind me of the what one critic said of a particular book:'Mein Kamf' as written by Kahlil Gibran.' I picture him drowning in water and in his big words, and dying because of being unable to call for help because only being able to yell in such lofty terms as 'I, being singled out by the Marxist rabble and left to be immersed in the fluids of their words and liquidity find myself in a perilous situation.'"
"Peterson would destroy Contrapoints in a real debate.  Contrapoints relies on costumes, lighting and bad humor.  Voice is barely even audible"
"I came here from VICE to be 'de-radicalized'. I found a bunch of bad takes on JP, a lot of assumptions on his positions, and end ending that was basically 'meh, but he says things that sound vaguely like Nazi-speak.'   Can anyone recommend a more persuasive video?"
"You're adorable but I don't think that you are wise enough to understand Dr. Peterson's books.. perhaps try again in 10 or 20 years,"
"I don't like Peterson because he simply wants to take away all my rights."
"ommmmmmg gurl, perfectioooooon"
"alt right == post modern marxism ,   tell people what to do == tell people what not to do, i interpret peterson post modern marxism as the narrative that am opressed to push my no narrative, isnt that were both meet? cos he constantly complains about it, i agree the point that he is exaggerates his narrative to prove a point, arent we all? . I would love to see a debate betwwen you both,  good video!"
"This was therapeutic."
"Jordan has emotional issues"
"For the first time on YouTube, I actually feel smarter after watching a video. Cudos!"
"In JPs defence. Wouldn't you rather be called by your prefered pronoun because people actually want to say it, instead of a law forcing them to use it on you? Either way I think freedom of speech (inlcuding all other human rights) is paramount. It was one of the reasons for the french revolution and a driving force for colonies to become independant. If thousands of people were wiling to die for this maybe we shouldn't throw it away."
"Aaaah!! Absolutely brilliant!!!!"
"this is a so much valuable video. Thanks for doing  this"
"'He got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting trans people would lead to stahlinism'... Great and here i thought you werent gunna mis-represent the guy........ Continue i guess...."
"Great video but piano is hella loud watching on mobile"
"VICE brought me here.  Glad I watched.  I read Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life and I thought it was brilliant.  This was a very interesting and entertaining analysis.  I'm subscribing."
"A liberal criticizing someone for 'using intentionally designed lexicon for the purpose of over exaggerating a non-issue.'  Or,   'Handy definition of 'Every word invented by SJWs', see also 'Micro-agression', 'man-spreading', 'man-splaining', et. all.  6:00  Well crap. Now I legit almost feel bad.  You are the person I most vehemently disagree with, yet still respect for honest self reflection.   And somehow managing to find a strong submissiveness. That's probably hard as hell to balance."
"Honestly, I appreciate all the hard work and the suffering required to read and listen to Peterson.  However, I think a couple well timed farts is the ideal retort to his whiny grandstanding."

"You look like a librarian you only just recently started working at the library but is already done with everybody’s bullshit."
"left is good right is only considered good by some because right is allows right"
"Haha this is tooo good , what are you?!"
"At @17:10 I think you misunderstand Peterson's meaning of Marxism; he generally means the relation between the collective and the individual in the context of identity. He argues that under Marxism the individual was subservient to the collective. This is an idea that the 'right' (Peterson in this case) is resistant to"
"You seriously need to stop wasting milk"
"Identity politics just keeps the door open for bigotry.  It might help in the short term, but as long as it exist, so will bigotry.  The whole reason that one can discriminate against womanhood is because people except it as an identity.  It's the only reason that dresses, lipstick, and long hair are associate with womanhood.  If identity politics didn't create social constructs.  Then wearing dresses, lipstick, and having long hair would just be people things instead of woman things.  Identity politics is hurting it's own cause and nobody seems to realize it. If you want equality, then you have to treat people EQUALLY.  You can't do that when you divide people into groups, even if you're trying to do it in a positive way. Now I'm not saying you can't have woman's groups or any other type of group.  But when you define those groups by their identity, you're participating in prejudice, that's just a fact."
"The problem is Jordan only wanted to reject bill C16, he didn’t have a problem with the lgbtq community just being forced to call people by their chosen name or pronoun by law was his issue. Which I agree with. But I’m American so I like my freedom of speech, but people didn’t understand that was his problem and then they believed he didn’t want to call anyone their preferred name just because he didn’t want to. Then he got famous and can sometimes go over his knowledge area and start spouting things that aren’t always right. But he’s only a man and only knows so much."
"20:20 'resists being pinned down to any given philosophical position' That is postmodern as F. This is not a duck... This is also not a duck... and this... and this... and this.

"Peterson like any other 'Big picture' idea person is great when you take it on the surface but digging deeper brings problems and I feel you have covered him very fairly.   However I will say in several of the interviews he says that there should always be a left and a right fighting against each other politically, and i agree with that its just i think the argument shoudl be shifted more left and im sure he wants it shifted more right ."

"I have to semi-disagree with your point about what 'post-modernism' is, or at least, what modern academic post-modernism is. I agree that's distinct from Marxism and many of your other points, but aside from that it _does_ form a broadly coherent academic paradigm (at least compared to academic strands of thought). It's not just that it is 'skeptical' (all academic disciplines see themselves as 'skeptical') - there are common epistemological, methodological and political threads found throughout post-modernist academic work. It's not just philosophy either - you get post-modernist takes in almost every discipline in the social sciences (post-functionalists/constructivists in the field of International Relations, for example, will give you a broadly post-modernist take - complete with references to Foucault - on European Integration and the formation of the EU)   Having said that, I think the distinction between disliking intellectual post-modernism and disliking progressive politics is well made. Personally, I _loathe_ intellectual post-modernism - most of it is almost deliberately obscurantist (people can't legitimately argue against you if you never actually make a clear point), openly antagonistic to the concept of science, objective truth and _trying to be objective or fair_ and, worst of all, only ever concerned with in-fighting and tearing down existing power structures never elaborating on alternatives that actually address thorny issues or really making non-obvious points. Post-modernism can be an interesting intellectual road, but it's road to nowhere. I honestly think it ruined my undergraduate education and has contributed to current political polarisation."
"That said, politically, I consider myself left wing - I'm pro- progressive taxation and redistributive state policies, anti-nationalist and socially liberal on pretty much all issues.   Policing this distinction is sometimes a headache. You often encounter concepts from the left that are clearly sourced from academic post-modernism. Cultural appropriation is the one that immediately comes to mind, as is, everything that touches on human biology. I'm not really opposed to the underlying political point that is trying to be made, but it's epistemologically mired in so much shit I almost want to run screaming. Until I hit an anti-feminist, 'SJW-bashing' type then run right back. It's exhausting."
"I love your videos and how they make this complicated academic dialog so accessible!"
"I love Jordan Peterson, but I also LOVE this video and subscribed to you. Much respect. My opinion: Compassion and empathy are tools to facilitate TRUE human connection. Soul to soul. Consciousness to consciousness. However you wanna frame it. JBP is not doing a good job in terms of trying to have that true connection. Hell, he seems to lack just having sympathy for the people he criticizes. That's the one thing I don't support about him and most of the people in the whole 'IDW' thing. Love the video.

Just the fact that you take someone you disagree with seriously is super refreshing, since it seems like neither the right nor the left is willing to do that these days."

"1:28 That is a horrible misrepresentation of JP's stance. His stance has nothing to do with Trans rights, he is simply saying that state compelled speech is a breach of human rights and a scary precedent to set. He has no problem with calling trans people by the pronouns they want, he has a problem with the state forcing him to.   4:12 Saying that everything he is doing is for the purpose of replacing progressive politics is not only a fallacy of intention, but a pretty thinly veiled conspiracy theory. He has been saying these things for decades, he is a clinical psychologist who has helped hundreds, maybe even thousands of people. His goals with everything he does are to help guide people to leading meaningful lives, and to help promote liberty, primarily by steering people away from horrible political and thought systems that lead to the horrors of the 20th century. Everything he has ever done has been in line with these goals, to say otherwise would be illogical.    8:20 Yes it could be made without comparing them to Stalin (although the example was Mao), but when they are operating on the same thought process as Mao and Stalin, even if the intentions are in the opposite direction, that is a problem that should be pointed out.    10:20 You are misunderstanding what he is saying. He is not saying that there is some grand conspiracy to destroy the west, he is saying the the PC ideology that has popped up and is driving these areas that you talk about is inherently the same logic used by Marxists and communists. He recognizes that the left is trying to create an utopia where everyone is equal and where the state provides everything anyone needs. His argument is that the pursuit of this end game will have catastrophic consequences and destroy liberty in the process, because the state will take away rights from the general public to try and force equality. This is a problem. Humans all inherently have differences, and if allowed to pursue what they want, they will all end up at different places in life, classes if you want to look at it from that lens. Succinctly put, if men are free they are not equal, if they are equal then they are not free. Peterson argues against restricting freedoms, as he despises all authoritarians, as everyone should.   17:55 The problem with Identity politics that you left out is that it puts a person's group identity first, it tries to eliminate individualism in so many ways, and that is a huge problem to a lot of people. You also leave out how it tries to force equality of outcome. The definition you provided is that of egalitarianism, not identity politics.   20:26 It implies, as he has explicitly stated before, that women and men have different interests and proclivities on average that cause them to seek different fields of work, and that these differences in preferences have a strong biological basis.   22:25 It is not a non sequitur, it is a way to illustrate that hierarchy are inevitable, and to abolish hierarchies is foolish because it is against our nature. This only really applies to social hierarchies, and he is not trying to apply it to every hierarchy, he explains this in 12 Rules For Life.    23:40 He does not promote a 'childishly simply world view' he is constantly saying that the world is so much more complicated than any one explanation can ever cover. He is not trying to explain all of society through his post-modernist thing, and he has said so explicitly on multiple occasions, but I can't expect you to know everything he has ever publicly said, so I can't fault you for making this erroneous claim.   25:15 and he would be on board with it if it wan't the government forcing people to do so. You know, taking away people's civil liberties. Your point has no internal consistency. And JP has always addressed people with the pronouns they prefer when they ask him politely or reasonably to do so. His ONLY problem with the C16 situation is the government compelling speech, which is an abhorrent restriction on freedom of speech, no matter how small the compulsion is.   Overall I enjoyed the video, even if you misrepresented him repeatedly. You brought up good points about how his post-modern neomarxism seems to contradict itself. I think this is due to you straw manning it or misunderstanding it a bit, but you might be right, and I will definitely be more critical about it in the future. Another good point you made was that his ideology, liberty, egalitarianism, self-efficacy and personal responsibility is western thought, but so is Marxism, so when he tries to say that western thought is being attacked by neoMarxists, it doesn't make such sense, but perhaps there is more than one definition of western thought and the discrepancy is arising due to a miscommunication of what western thought means to each side. Thank you so much for the fun video, it was entertaining and gave me a lot to think about."

"I might be a post modern marxist identity politics...guy. because I'm a bit of a nihilist which is skepticism about everything really, and I believe that concepts like gender and race are shaky at best, but I also think that communism is the best way to maximize human happiness and the best way to minimize human suffering because despite my nihilist tendencies I'm a hedonist (as in life has no meaning so we make our own meaning and I have personally chosen the maximization of pleasure as my meaning). I believe that the struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors, which right now under capitalism, are the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, is the thing that can bring about the end of all human induced suffering if the oppressed win. And I think that the shakey consepts of race and gender were, in the case of race, invented by the ruling class to devide the working class, and in the case of gender, probably invented to distinguish who could have the babies and who couldn't and then perverted by a need by those in power to exercise control. but I also believe that just because these constructs come from oppressive systems, doesnt' mean we should throw them out because the culture created around them means a lot to the people who belong to the marginalized identities there in, and that we need to do our best to incorperate our differences into a community rather than a hive mind where we're all the same tl;dr: I'm the post modern neo-marxist that Jordan Peterson is afraid of."

"His characterization of postmodernism barely resembles actual philosophy, and is based on the 'oh no postmodernism is the boogy man' conspiracy that various idiots've already pushed for years. It's actually the same thing if you go back a few decades or so with existentialism. His conspiracies about postmodernism literally mirror older conspiracies about existentialism. His version of Jung is so stupid and off base it's offensive. He's an absolute piece of shit who preys on under-educated, undersexed little boys who need a guru. It's very pathetic."

"Mmmmmm, interesting view point, but its just a critique of a very small point in his overall argument. And doesnt adress why he thinks that the current overall climate of left politics is a danger to western society. And he gives plenty of examples of why this might be the case. The 'Gulag Archipelago' his favourited one. Its hre where i think your critique falls short, and you instead focus far too much on the lobster example. Instead of addressing the myriad of other examples and theories he uses to back his arguements. The lobster example isnt even used to defend hierarchy, its used as an example of how correct posture and maintenance of your nervous system will lead to an increase of self respect, and how this will boost your hierarchical standing."
"God save the Lobster Queen!"
"Mmmh, postmodern philosophy is not 'an actual skepticism', that sound vague..   in fact it's most close to radical skepticism or epistemological relativism that actually an a moderated skepticism or a scientific skepticism..  agree about the 'skepticism about modernism' but..even that is not totally true, bc exist all of kind of types of ideas inside postmodern philosophy..   quoute:  'According to Susan Haack, the term includes, at least, social constructivisms, feminist epistemologies, forms of relativism and extremist sociologies of science (Haack 2003).'  in that way, a postmodern philosophy englobes a variety of ideas and ideologies that requires establish nuances"

It was difficult to reconcile my respect for him and the idea of bearing your suffering honourably with the fact he's generally misinformed and an apocalyptic reactionary. As someone with infinitely more reason to discount Peterson than me, I respect your ability to at least recognise some of the value he provides. The acknowledgement of the good that he does if anything makes your case for the problematic and damaging paranoia he espouses more compelling.   Thanks for educating me, Natalie. I was a looking for a check and balance and I think I've found it in you."

"Peterson denies any agenda. And tells people not to lie. This has confused and fascinated me for two years.  He did one little protest and then it was as if he had a production team in his garage.  I think Peterson's rise to fame was orchestrated well in advance. And pushing a controversy on any sensitive issue was a way to get a following.  But what is his real agenda? It is simple. create a new classical liberal brand for the right wing. Because the right wing moved towards populism, proto-facism and even overt Nazi.  Postmodern neomarxist is a way of taking the old conspiracy theory and tweaking it, and making it contemporary so people had talking points. But also the right suddenly had visible antisemitism which was not visible for decades. Which would not make certain people on the right very happy like Dennis Prager.  So look at it you have David Rubin who is gay, Shapiro wearing a Kippah, and Peterson the mainline Christian, all sitting in a well decorated gay room talking about conservative stuff and how intolerant the left really is.  The problem is it works because a lot of people including people on the left like myself are annoyed by certain social activists who are completely full shit, hypocrites who have no transcendent perspective and tell everyone what to do even if it is unfair and makes no sense. Part of this comes from non-thinking, piss poor critical thinking and consensus political thinking.  And then Jordan Peterson comes along to point out some transcendent humanist perspectives. And people go woah!  The problem is it is really complete subterfuge.  It kills two birds with one stone. It misrepresents relevant economic argument so people will just agree that Bernie sanders is really a communist. And discredit all minority identity politics as meaningless.  But as I said he might actually be doing something socially beneficial by pulling the right wing youth more to the center so they are not completely fascist, just neo-liberal apologists.  The thing is we don't need neo-liberal apologists. We can no longer apologize for a corrupt economic and political system. We can't pretend as Peterson pretends that the system is creating a merit based hierarchy. It's not.  I am in Germany right now. And policies like codetermination democratic industry (an idea implemented in the 70's which had its origins in Weimar when Marxist and socialist compromized) and welfare state (a conservative Idea from the Bismark era)has made Germany the most productive country per capita in the world. Not to mention Germanys basic law pretty much covers free speech and the right to dignity means it has a highly sophisticated civil rights laws.  Heaven forbid the USA knows any useful historical or economic information."
"This video is quite better than I expected. He is boring for most of the time, but he criticizes some crazy things the left is doing, and there is so much hypocrisy... Like they collectivize guilty, saying all men are evil because of some statistical number... How is it any different from racist arguments that uses statistic against blacks? But while they hate the method in one case, will shamelessly use on another. And there is so much overlapping between Marxists and SJWs that it is quite understandable putting them together. There are people on facebook using Stalin as profile picture that will say some bullshit about wage gap and such, but maybe they won't say transgenders are women, so there is that. Yeah, there are some old Marxists that hate this, but they are kind of psychos saying things like 'Stalin should have killed more', so they don't really count. There are many stupid right-wingers that make leftists think everything is insane on this side, as there are many stupid left-wingers that makes us see you as a bunch of lunatics. I'm quite glad this video actually tried to go further and refrain from just being a raging rant, it's actually quite deep."
"Interestingly I agree with JPs view of post-modern, SJW, HR in the corporate world, but I don't think it leads to destruction of the west."
"I think if these people were dominant then there would be a problem. The reason why I like JP is he's putting a voice to something I've disliked since the 90s. I would hope most people support him for that reason as opposed to blindly following him. I think the number of people supporting him reflects the angry white male persona which exists in society. Are we allowed to be angered by things? Apparently not, we're the elite and should just enjoy our reign."

"I agree with a great deal of you points, although I believe that you are misinterpreting his use of 'postmodern neo-marxism'. In his view, as I understand it, it is evident that the post modernism comes into play in certain groups opposing the conventional gender roles, and the grand narratives that result form that point of view. To oppose him saying that 'Post modernists dislike categories, identity politicians like categories' is to simplify the moments and making a false statement. Yes, they create new categories, but only to lingually distinguishing themselves from the conventional categories. This is needed because there are those who ask 'If you are neither man-, nor woman, that what are you?', and as a person you kinda need a better answer than, it's indescribable and uncategorizable. This is why the fight conventional categorization, with more nuanced categories in their post modern fight against the conventional way of explaining the world and the narratives that stem therefrom. It is fair to say that Marxist analysis of history is inherently against the post modern movement, but again I believe that this would be a simplification. Some post modernists are purely out to dissolve convention, the American convention is the American dream and the capitalist model, having two genders and having a specific relationship of the specific gender roles. This can be dissolved by introducing Marxist theory, although not all who practice this are philosophers, we have to account for the fact that Peterson is not saying that cunning lizards are running the place, but uninformed people. Therefor there are bound to be mistakes, and his term 'Post modern neo-marxists' is supposed to seem illogical, since he would call it an uneducated or flat-out wrong opinion.  Having said this, I love you and you show."

"25:03 But they're not 'requesting' individual pronouns, they were actually trying to bend the law itself for their 'requests' to become law, at which point that's totally not okay. And granted, it's only been done by an extremely vola minority of transers, not all of them, but regardless, it did happen. I value individual liberty over collective dogmas, as you've put it, but I'd rather not live in a world where I'm required to mislabel a person's sex, just because it might threaten their subjective sense of what they are, as Ben put it. I'm all for getting offended myself - it's unavoidable in life, after all - but it's not the same as forcing one another to do something the other person doesn't agree with, let alone have it be enforced by law itself."
"The first real criticism of Peterson.  I still love JP, but at least now I have a better understanding of where his limited experience, outside the glass bead game, leads to his confusion.  He might have just read too many horribly violent books and has spent much too much time around undergraduates.   But he is responding to a rising radical left and I think its important for there to be push back.  Not because I am anti radical left, just to say that there should be healthy rational uuuuh passionate push back."
"Can I get a spicy makeup tutorial"

"05:02 You make some good points about JP's flawed terminology and then you go on to bring up fascism in the context of his ideology? He is clearly against totalitarianism and advocates individual right. How does that put him even remotely into the corner of fascism? Or did I miss the sarcasm here?"
"This entire video is just a straw-man."
"Youre not getting it. Him using 'Post modern Neo-Marxism' as a term and it being a clusterfuck is the point. Call them the Green haired feminists, 'Diversity' Committees, Activist types of the modern mainstream left, they are running with this 'Clusterfuck'. THAT IS HIS POINT. The fact that it doesnt make sense is the danger. 'Lets deconstruct everything about social norms and everything we know about the world because its not possible to put a finger on it anyway.'   Theres nothing wrong with being skeptical about the world around you. What you and they dont understand is its a slippery slope, and will culminate in de-legitimizing actual facts of life. It'll creep down in the basic things we know and attack them. The biologists are next, theyve already gotten the psychologists. 'Differences in men and women is sexist'. Nevermind the differences not even specified, let alone specified as positive or negative; But the knee-jerk reaction to that statement is a fear that 'White male science' AS IF SCIENCE IS WHITE AND MALE AS SUCH, will use any discovery of 'male superiority' in any area or subject to belittle or pull women back or down. Which why people like you are alarmed by Peterson. Theres nothing misogynistic about him.   As for your point that he says 'Trans protections will lead to Stalinism' Thats so intellectually dishonest. (but do people on the left actually care about discourse and actual solutions?) He said the things they are calling for in the legislation are the first steps to the removal of Freedom Of Speech. Even people who do blackface or use the 'N-word' dont go to jail. (and really why should they reflexively be put in court?) Why should people who misgender? Nobody needs to go jail because you suffered the indignity of somebody who doesnt see you how you see you. Unless they are trying to abuse you or harass you.We CANNOT get to the point in society where shit talking (or honest mistakes a la 'Super Maam') from afar, outside of threats and harassment turn into a court date, fine or prison sentence. You really want to live in a society that doesnt give you room to fuck up? Everyone would be in jail in such a society. But because of this decadent, insulated civilization and our removal from the real world and the natural burden, people like you are desensitized and underestimate the depths of human dysfunction.    Plenty of the modern left is driven by empathy, plenty is driven by dissatisfaction, resentment, and nihilism. The latter two, hatred for others and existence are regrettably stronger than love and empathy. It wont take long before you too, are left behind the modern left. Long Term this ideology is unttenable. Whenever some one tries to break down why the lefts philosophy and methods are destructive or wrong, instead of engaging usually its insults and 'I dont care'. Exactly. You dont.  But you will.      All this being said, I dislike conservative ideology and politics as well.  That chaos and order abstraction conceptually can really help you visualize whats happening.  A good way to look at it is...  Think of it like a platform with an area above it and an area below it. lets say nature and civilization. Nature is 'Chaos'. Civilization is 'Order'. Order=Conservatism, Chaos=Liberalism. Chaos is a larger looming void where were in our 'natural' state, worrying every second about where our food comes from, who might kill us in our sleep, etc. An urgent purpose every day. Is it good? At least theres no capitalism and the food is organic, as well existential dread isnt an issue. Then an explosion. Order. Iron fisted and no nonsense structure. Value systems, mores and Law is created. Across time things develop more and more and we are farther and farther removed from the stress of nature and have more time to think. Is it good? At least disease and predators are kept at bay and we can watch people do the things we cant/wont on television. But now were weary of the decadence and luxury. Looking for purpose looking for pain and pleasure because weve been overloaded with so much already. So the conflict becomes internal, instead of fighting sabertooth tigers were fighting depression. Now we feel the urge to tear everything down just so we can feel something. Boom. Anarchy, Catastrophy, War and famine and were pulled back down into the thrasher of life. Chaos. We regain our passions. good and bad. Our primal bloodlust or our symbiosis with nature. Until we become weary of that, and Order is yet again, established. I suggest you study the late phases of the last great empires, like Rome or Egypt. I for one, would rather us keep moving forward instead of having the whole thing come crashing down because of our arrogance and lack of insight.   That was a lot, but I hope you take a look.  Trey"
"Maybe Peterson just needs to reframe his argument as 'Canadian and US culture face opposition from radical-to-moderate liberals that disagree with people as far back as 2000 years ago.' Which is a very dumb and broad argument, but probably more accurate to what he's thinking."

"I don't know if I'm a Peterson fan but I definitely am a Contrapoints fan. And as cool as it'd be I doubt I'll see the two share a milkshake any time soon. But I'd like Contrapoints to do another piece on Peterson with a focus more on his take on identity politics and other more contraversial stuff because I like how she unpacks ideas n there's more to play with with Peterson."
"2:41 this is my first contrapoints video and I am too drunk for shit like this i've never been so scared in my life"
"I-Is this a voice in the fog of popular ignorance?"
"Not sure you'll see this but it's worth a shot. Have you ever thought about going on Joe Rogan's podcast? I felt pretty frustrated watching his Jordan Peterson episode because so many of Peterson's points went unchallenged, and they weren't very good to begin with. We need someone to be able to counter these points that isn't an overly emotional, overreacting leftist that doesn't fully comprehend the issues they're arguing for. I'd love to be able to do this myself but alas, I'm a nobody lol. I think you have the gift of being able to express yourself and your points in an eloquent manner, a gift Jordan Peterson also shares. So although Peterson makes some decent points at times, it would be good for society as a whole to be able to see where his points fall short, and to hear them from someone in a reserved, well articulated manner. I think you should strongly consider being on Joe Rogan's podcast."

"After getting on boat called JP hype I started researching 'other side'. Came here today. Enjoyed watching video and watched few other your videos(impressive how you changed from 2016 and I mean in positive way), but I think you miss biggest point he is making. That those totalitarian regimes that were created by us - were creation of the unconcious collective mind. That's why he 'invests' in individuals and want's to bring them up to 'speed'.  That's why he does such generalisation on 'postmodern-neomarxism' as well, cause creation of such regime is not made by 'coherent group' but by many that actually work for something like this, just want more of their own ideology that's on their side or just ignore it. And he came to this conclusion after studying totalitarian regimes. Ok his views are a bit old and some are outdated but..   For me it is already starting to show especially in UK. We actually starting to have 'word' police, and I don't mean hateful words. I mean people stating someones gender in their perspective and police trying to prosecute them for it.  It's madness and it has to stop. PC-culture is creating real Cenzorship in this world and you have to admit it. It bans people from speaking their minds on social media. Makes them scared. Stigmatizes and threats with calling people 'racists'. Your red lamp isn't glowing when this happens? When we are canceling 'Womens march' cause it's 'too white'?   This is 'light' version of Stalin ministry of propaganda, but it still is. And it's huge problem cause it kills debate, creates even more divison and makes people go either extreme-left or extreme-right. This made Trump win election(in small part ofc)  I think JP is voice of reason cause we are turning in bad way on many levels. Cause nobody else can open this debate now, cause they are either 'racist' or 'pseudo-scientific'(arguments that are used against him as well, that just can't hit in first place) If they try they are slaughered in media by journalists with agenda. Shouted on social-media and attacked relentlessly. For sure everyone is right winged if they are not left winged..just lol.   So many try to bring JP down..and it's inaccurate. He is exposing this and making people some people actually challenge themselfes. Of course there are mindless followers on both sides. I fundamentally disagree on him with many points, like religion surely and I'm unsure of his psychological views and I didn't like his hidden remarks to christianity in 12 rules book.. but he finally broke the bubble of mass media left propaganda and fact that it is going to far.   Like on Patreon you can find left calling to violence. Daily! They make fun of it and are proud of it. But Sargon will say 1 bad word on some youtube channel that's not even his and he is banned. Gone forver that evil facist bastard. That's not healthy at all.  It makes me go bonkers that we are living in world where we can't have a debate cause it will 'offend' someone. Gods fckin thinking is offensive! Don't think! Meanwhile Asia just laughs at us.  I know you tackle this inteligently, but since you don't give a fuck..It's quite nihilistic in my view. I mean we have as culture on West problems, but I think this is best there currently is. I mean can you try and do same thing you are doing now in run by islam culture places..but you know you would not survive most likely. In Asia yeah not everywhere, but they would treat you much worse then in 'West'. So of course some people claim we are 'descendands' of 'Western civilisation' for their own agenta/reasons. But it is what it is and it doesn't mean we can't strive for better.   Left has to wake up and end this patting on their own backs tactic cause it leads us to greater division. When media joined left side widely - you see reaction with people to join the other. People like Trump that would never gain influence before, now are being elected cause SJW culture is polarising us at light speed. I wish there were balance in 'all things' here, but isn't. Nationalism is rising in Europe for a good reason, cause left is getting out of hand and like always people are 'revolting against'. Maybe you need to see how mass immigration works, currently there is turnmoil in France and Germany, especially in cities where there are a lot of migrants. Not cause people are racists, but fast mixing different cultures always gives conflict. And a lot of newcomers don't want our culture, just money. We need healthy debate, but it's immposible with current situation so I will advocate for JP cause we need to break this stalemate."
"I love that end clip. Cool."
"9:17 yep, that's completly normal"
"I always assumed that when Peterson is saying 'post-modernism' he is thinking of the Social Constructionism, which was a source of the postmodern movement and influential in the fields of cultural studies. He doesn't like characterizing all social phenomenon as purely 'social constructs' as he sees a biological origin for them, even injustices. He's essentially re-purposing biology and psychology for a personal attack on political progressivism."
"Just because you mentioned Steven Covey, he originally wrote a religious version but it didn't sell as well so he made it more secular. That's why the seven habits doesn't sound as problematic as Peterson's lectures. If you heard Covey talk in a religious context, I wonder how he'd compare to Peterson?"

Turns out, that's true of all his gigs. So with that in mind, I revisited this video, and it turns out that most of the summations of his positions are wrong. Funny, well produced, but totally lacking. So I guess we'll have to wait for someone else to come along who can take him at his word and make proper, thought-out arguments."

The Marxists and SJW'S are simply the usefully idiots for the (((Postmodernist)))."

"I'm glad this was more fair than most critics of Jordan but I think there is a major point you don't bring up: Jordan's biggest issue involving the whole LGBT disrespect debacle is that he has openly stated several times that he has no issue with personally calling someone by their preferred pronouns. His only issue is with the dangers of speech prohibited by the government. He does not believe that anyone should be commanded, by law to say certain words while outlawing others. That is the main reason he compares the issue to Communism. He believes, as I do, that once you take a right away or begin to tweak it, it can be chipped down and misused depending on who is running things. And that is the fine line where either justice or injustice can take place. Entertaining and informative video, great humor, and I'm glad you aren't just mouthing off psychobabble and actually know what you're talking about. I just think there's more to the issue. But, as you said, it's not your main area of concern and I understand.  You've got another subscriber, nonetheless."

"Jordan Peterson doesn't believe he has a political agenda, and he's wrong because it is impossible not to in a sense. However, to reiterate what ContraPoints says at the very beginning of the video - his work is worth reading, and has been read by millions of people. You don't have to agree with it all of it, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. I'm listening if someone can name another person living today with a higher level of intellect, or at least articulate philosophical/psychological intellect, which has been read today by as many people. This partly it is why its worth reading 12 Rules, because at the end of the day, even if Peterson has flaws and is combative in interviews, etc., his ideas mean well and are novel in the way he synthesizes them to convey the significance of basic values such as responsibility. This doesn't make JP any greater than the best scholars necessary, but it does make him the most accessible.    I enjoyed this video, but I fundamentally believe there are universal truths which can be measured, and do not share the same philosophical interests as ContraPoints."

I suppose that is why it is easy for the average person to give all of the SJW's petty protests and transgender activists a 2-second look, then go about their days. Their base is too 'nuanced' for all of white privileged males that control the patriarchy, and their base is so fluid that there is no real way to define it.

"You make a lot of salient points here, but I feel like this video largely ignores Peterson's larger concerns about the government and other agencies overstepping bounds. Most of these people don't have a problem with personal pronouns per se; they take issue with the idea of that becoming a legal or regulated issue. Sure, if someone is repeatedly, intentionally targeting someone by calling them the wrong pronoun and not giving that person the ability to disengage, that's harassment, pure and simple, and that needs to be dealt with. But there are already cases in the UK and Canada where it's become much more than that,  which is scary in the context of free speech. I don't like the idea of the government having power in ANY direction to take legal action for the words people say. That's how people like Putin and Kim Jong-un begin to operate with impunity. To me Jordan's argument is not necessarily that the activists and professors ARE the fascists, but that they are the tools by which fascism is able to be constructed. When we're getting to a place where banks and pay services are being empowered to stop processing certain people's payments over ideology, I don't think that's too far fetched. There's a real discussion to be had here, and I'm thankful for people like yourself who are actually engaging in the ideas rather than just slinging mud."

"You cherry picked the interview with Cathy Newman, the sort of tactic Fox News is known for. This interview completely discredited Cathy Newman, I would urge people to look into it, lots of analysis on YouTube. She repeatedly misrepresented Peterson with her questioning, assigning all kinds of beliefs to him, he shot her down every time. It really boosted Peterson's reputation, exposed how he's been misrepresented.   I'm in agreement about Peterson's near obsession with 'Marxism', his scare tactics. That identity politics will lead to genocide like under Stalin. I think he should be taken to task on that point.   He doesn't oppose basic civil rights protections for transgender people, in the way that is defined in the US for other minorities. Protection in jobs, housing and public accommodation. You suggest that he does at the beginning of the video, painting him as a bigot. He clearly lays out a case that the law in Canada is a dangerous overreach. A person can go to jail for misgendering someone. That's an extreme that deserves to be challenged. I think its telling that his critics deny that this is possible, it's like an admission that Peterson is right.  'Hate speech' is open to interpretation and activists are now calling being 'misgendered' an act of violence. It's also officially a human rights violation in Canada under the law if coming from an employer or teacher or some similar scenario. If a person gets cited and refuses to show up for a hearing or refuses to pay a fine, they can be imprisoned for refusing to use someone's pronoun choice. This is one of the comparisons to Marxism, or the Soviet Union more accurately. Forcing conformity in speech through threat of imprisonment.   This isn't about disrespecting transgender people, or suggesting that someone doesn't have the right to choose their pronoun. Choosing your own pronoun is another expression of free speech, just as someone refusing to use it would be. Whether that is 'hate' or not is very open to interpretation imo. Each instance unique perhaps. This is about addressing the overreach of this movement. There are officially over 30 genders in Canada and in NYC. That list is growing, there is an increasing demand that people recognize a long list of genders in speech. This is going far beyond 'he, she and they.' It's an unrealistic demand on a major change in the language. Nothing wrong with urging people to make the change, It may or may catch on to one degree or another. We transitioned from referring to women as 'Miss' and 'Mrs', to replacing with 'Ms.' It happened but it took time, with no threats of a hate speech charge. This gender issue is far more complicated, it's my belief that it will never catch on as it's been defined. I think there is an extremist element that has taken control of this issue, making delusional and aggressive demands for a change in language. Many trans and other LGBTQ people have been highly critical, they've been shut out of the debate.   I find it very confusing that the most obvious solution is to move to one gender neutral pronoun for everyone, like in the Turkish language. Making us all the same. This is something that some feminists have been debating since the 1970s. It's not even on the table for debate. It's my opinion that this would take away from the current victimhood mentality of the social justice world so there's no interest in debate. This doesn't mean that I don't support real social justice, I'm just critical that social justice in its current manifestation, is no longer concerned with important issues much of the time.   An important issue with trans people imo, is making sure they're able to get a government ID that reflects their gender, even if that is a binary definition at the moment. Just to avoid hassles in travel, traffic stops, using the bathroom, etc. That sort of focus makes sense for a social justice movement. Asserting 30 genders onto the language and threatening people with fines or imprisonment is just causing resentment, setting back the LGBTQ movement."

"I agree with alot and I never bother listening to him when he speaks of his marxism paranoia bullshit and other boring subjects of his , but I think you've twisted his lobster argument a bit . You cut out a part before when he says ' it's part of my attempt to demonstrate that the idea of hierarchy has absolutely nothing to do with socio-cultural constructions ' which I think sheds light on the fact that hes not trying to say that 'hierarchies are natural thus all hierarchies are ok' but rather that 'hierarchies and patriarchal hierarchies are not a human construct but a natural one' , nothing more nothing less. I believe that if you ask JP whether he was arguing for all hierarchies even the unjust ones he would tell you no and that he is just pointing out that it is natural for human societies to organize themselves into hierarchies for better or worse.   Its relevant because it goes against some popular feminist views where its all about nurture and nothing about nature because their theories revolve heavily around cultural and social influences ."

"When JP calls someone a postmodern neo-marxist he's making reference to a very specific group of people. People who push for equality of outcome and don't seem to have any concept of reality. It's more of a pejorative than a critique. They deny science and think diversity in everything will solve everything. I think it gets confusing because they're not an actual group and the mish mash of words may not really apply to them. A lot of JP fans think science should influence our decisions which is where the whole trans issue comes up. The JP fans are p much all going by biological terms. I personally think that's stupid, but it does make more sense than adding an infinite number of pronouns. For me the issue isn't really about biology, it's about freedom. Legally requiring people to address people in certain ways is bonkers to me. As much as I don't like assholes, I think people have the right to be assholes. That was JP's main beef. I know people are going to say C-137 wasn't compelling speech, but I disagree. I read it, it was p short and p  broad. Looks like misgendering someone would get you a fine, don't pay that fine and you go to jail. I definitely call that compelled speech. I guess you'd have to prove to me that misgendering someone is more than just a mean thing to do."
"Oh look another confused transsexual with no interest in reason or truth, what a huge surprise for everyone. Also obvious edit of the JP interview is obvious, learn to edit maybe before you make videos? Nevermind, I will leave you to your echo chamber and your shills, have fun being you."
"Peterson wasn't justifying Western culture with lobsters  If you really listen to it he's saying hierarchies are bad in general and they been around before people  He speaks about personal responsibility and if we all had personal responsibility it's very hard to have a hierarchy  That can harm people   I've been listening to him for over a year now and that's what It"
"Jordan Peterson doesn't have any problem with people choosing their pronoms but the rest of the world too have the liberty not to follow those demands. The reason why he had a strong stance against it is because the Canadian government wanted to make it against to law to mis-gender trans/queers. Thats why he compared to totalitarian, the fact that it was about lgbtq+ wasnt important,  what was important was the law against freedom of speech. Threats should always be against the law, not using the wrong pronom... talking about a strawman."
"I hope you dig into the Pepe Silvia conspiracy one of these days. Great video!"
"'I''m not saying he's a Nazi... but he's kinda a Nazi' - He'd probably say : passiv aggressiv much? But it's interesting to see an echo-chamber from the 'other side'. Ever considered that there's no active drive to destroy the society and it still can lead to the same result? People can act individually towards a goal they don't even actively entertain. There's plenty of people destroying themselves, their lifes and they aren't aware of it until it finally happens. If it was limited to their lifes, I wouldn't care. All you did was relativize the fringes of his concept and add a good dose of semantics about defintions as spice. Bigger picture be damned."

"This video does a good job exposing some of Peterson's contradictions and vagueness (and yeah I know this is an old video now) - BUT  Race / gender focused corporate hiring/ HR departments exist. Simply the case.  Race / gender focused hiring / HR becomes obvious when companies want to know your race and your sexuality when you apply for work. Western governments encourage such things in attempts to calm down the firestarter wing of progressives, not understanding that these people can't be appeased. It's frustrating how thinking someone should be hired off their skills alone is interpreted as racist dog whistling when it's just common sense.  HR departments treat people differently depending on their race and gender. Also 6:55 - 'the sheep need a shepherd'?? Really??  That's not individualist. The 12 rules is overrated, again just some overhyped/over studied/over criticised common sense. Yeah, 'clean your room', thanks, what a shepherd."
"You're brilliant and hilarious."
"14:45 I think this point about power structuring our institutions illustrates best what Peterson means when he criticizes progressive politics and where he draws the line to postmodernism: The reduction of inequality to a power struggle between two demographics (one oppressor and one oppressed). Take the wage gap for example. People just assume that inequalities like this are linked to some form of discrimination, when in fact there are laws guarding against such a thing in the workplace and the disparaty can be easily explained by a multitude of other factors which are at play. The line he draws to Marxism is also pretty easy to follow: Marxism also sees the world in terms of a power struggle causing inequality, the only difference being that modern day progressives mostly see this struggle occur on the axis of race, sexuality, gender identity etc. instead of class."
"This video has completely misinterpreted the part about lobsters' hierarchies.   What Peterson says is that it is inevitable for any species to organize themselves into hierarchical structures.  BUT, and there is a BUT, he also acknowledges that some hierarchies are tyrannical. And Peterson never fails to make it clear how appalling and dangerous tyrannical hierarchies are. He stands firm that any tyrannical structure must always be cut to its roots at the earliest sign of manifestation. He makes it clear. All the time. Tyrannical hierarchies are evil, and must be dealt with in a manner that is so. But seeing tyrannical hierarchies and deciding to destroy all types of hierarchies, even valid and beneficial ones, is just naive and dangerous."

"Late to the party. Peterson while describing transactivists isn't generalizing all transactivists, but is addressing his concerns about the ones who are trying to dictate what he can or cannot say. You could argue that he's not making that clear enough, but then the interview he did (that you are referencing) is a hostile one where he's on the defensive.  He's clarified multiple times that he doesn't mind calling people by their preffered pronouns. If the issue is that he's against a law that influences what people can or cannot say, then the issue goes beyond trans rights and into general freedoms.  I don't think Peterson (or any rational person) minds the skepticism of postmodernism, as much as the dogma of the current version of postmodernism that we've seen in *some* colleges/unis. Going into what it was/is in some ways is sort of a bad faith argument. We're talking about people who are undermining and attacking history, math, physics and especially social studies that has to do with 'normative views'. If your argument is that he shouldn't use postmodernism as a shorthand for the psychotic attempt at dismantling all reason in an effort to get rid of the 'bad stuff', then that's kind of pedantic and very much a misrepresentation. The marxism that's at play here is (I think at least) probably also a catch-all definition for the kids who are unironically calling for the seizure of private property, because they don't want to pay for iphones. They're kids, obviously most of them don't have the experience to tell what's a good idea or not. Call me an age-ist, it doesn't make me less right about this :)  I think you should try this again from a better steel manning perspective. You do some, but I don't think you're giving it a good enough try. Otherwise interesting vid <3"

"You are misunderstanding Hume. Hume saying that reason is a slave to the passions is not 'feels over reals', he means that our emotions motivate us to do anything at all. And once our emotions give us a direction to walk, reason gets us there as correctly as possible. It's not to say that we should ignore reason and believe what we feel is true in spite of facts. For Hume, 'the passions' is more like a motivating force giving reason a job to do. A perfectly logical, but emotionless, brain in a vat would not be motivated to do anything at all.  Also, I agree JBP shouldn't be attributing Marxism to SJWs. That is out of place for the most part. But post-modernism is sport on for the types that claim 'there is no biological difference between males and females' or 'science and logic are patriarchal structures of racist heteronormative societies and ought to be questioned'. Those are the postmodern beliefs of the grievance studies departments that allowed JBP to eloquently point out and gain over 1M subs on youtube. It just so happens these same professors will also believe in Marxist grand narratives even though that contradicts their postmodern beliefs about western beliefs being suspect. The SJW professors beliefs are incoherent. You can't really blame JBP for pointing that out."

You have arguably all of TED which leans left and talks about building a better world and living a good life. Most of modern psychology is fundamentally left leaning, or perhaps the left is leaning toward modern psychology. There’s a reason Peterson clings so heavily to first gen psychoanalysis. I think we just don’t take a prescriptivists stance on how to live a good life, rather we don’t want other people dictating how to live a good life to others for whom those dictations are destructive and hurtful."

Peterson was correct that the female chooses who to fuck, but she pisses him in the face with drug laced piss to coerce him into having sex. After a couple of weeks she leaves the poor guy and lets the next female abuse him. Also, if anyone calls themselves an alpha male again, remind them it is the alpha female who rules the pack and the alpha male is only the top dog after all of the other females and it's definitely not the alpha male who self proclaim they are, it's the females who decide who is manly enough for the job.  We have so much to learn about our nature, but first of all it's the women who rule the universe. Male dominance is a very human perversion."

This still doesn't mean that free speech should be controlled by law. Also when it comes to 12 Rules for life, JBP has always said that most of the stuff he talks about in his book are obvious things but the purpose of the book is to explain these ideas in a way that is easy to comprehend and take in so that you can apply this way of thinking to your daily life.

"If you hadn't misrepresented Peterson's rise to fame at the start, you would have been able to understand his opposition to bill C16... which I think would be hard to misunderstand given how many times he's spelled it out in plain language. Taking you at your word, how is it that a highly intelligent person watched hours and hours of his videos and not learned that what he opposes is using the power of the state to compel speech?   And that the reason he opposes this is because he regards speech as the foundational means for bringing about and correcting social order. This faith in 'the logos' is the heart of his idea of 'the West', and you seem to have missed it entirely.  Finally, you entirely miss the point of what Peterson means by 'postmodern neo-Marxist', while imagining that he's unaware that it is a sort of oxymoron. In practice what it means is postmodernism for thee, and neo-Marxism for me. Meaning: I deconstruct your beliefs and values and social structures through radical skepticism, and then push my own through what we might call radical credulity - a credulity that refuses to learn, because that would mean letting the reactionaries win."
"Jordan Peterson was quite specific in his opposition to Bill C-16 that he was more against making pronouns compulsory than the pronouns themselves (and he has also stated that he's never refused to use a requested pronoun with his own students).   From Florence Ashley: _Using the wrong pronouns repeatedly after being made aware that a person uses other pronouns might amount to harassment, a position that is taken by the Ontario Human Rights Commission._  Peterson has pointed out that the list of potential 'other' pronouns is open-ended and arbitrary, few with any accepted standard of common usage. He has also suggested that he would relax somewhat about getting the cart before the horse (legal compulsion in advance of the cultural commonplace) if these additional pronouns had earned their place in English usage much like every other word.   So here I'll make up my own pronoun which—to avoid hunting down some specific short syllable not yet allocated in the amalgamation of all whimsy—we'll call 'ze'. As I don't really give a toot about aligning my pronouns to express gender preference, 'ze' shall be the wildcard pronoun (entirely complementary to 'it'). Excellent for reducing cognitive load devoted to a social nuance I almost always find secondary to the discussion at hand, unless the conversation turns to another person's specific social experience. Mostly I don't care if Ze Random Person is a Pekingese, Dalmatian, or St Bernard—isn't the point of progressivism to care less about these categories, rather than more?   Linguistically, it's actually difficult to reform English to replace he/she across the board with ze (which would make English closer to spoken Mandarin where 'ta' signifies all of he/she/it) because English uses pronouns the same way Perl uses $1 and $2 to refer back to two recent variables. You can keep many narratives in English straight that consist mainly of $HE and $SHE that would become hopelessly muddled should both be replaced by $ZE. (In the right company, you could keep a long, tangled narrative encompassing the whole of _Gosford Park_ or _Le Cage aux Folles_ entirely straight with $ze, $sie, $hir, $co, $ey, and $etc etc.)    If I had to pick my own gender pronoun it would mean: pay as little attention to the abundant ampleness behind the curtain as humanly possible (maximally non-committal, though far from non-existent). We generally _should_ pay attention to the fact that people have cherished identities, even as we bend over backwards to discount this as a pertinent factor in nine social contexts out of ten.   Linguistically, English pronouns are one of the hardest aspects of English to relearn after kindergarten. I've trained myself for my entire adult life to be self-conscious about the difference between 'between you and I' and 'between you and me' (the second form is considered correct if you feel that the backbone of English grammar should be isomorphic to Latin to the greatest extent practical; which is at least pedagogically defensible, because if you adhere to the Latin-esque system of agreement, the clarity of one's writing almost always improves over slovenly beginnings—then once you master the basic scales, you can jazz later where English has developed weird crevices).   For myself, even after thirty years, I'm still mentally supplying 'you and I' or 'you and me' using a prepositional-phrase trigger-alert situated in high consciousness, where I catch and repair words on the way out of my mouth—but still, there are _so many_ prepositions, my wonkish trigger-alert never quite catches them all, and I sometimes slip into sloppy vernacular without meaning to. (This verbal practice being my own equivalent of futzing with set and lighting rather than content, because I find it extremely interesting just hard hard this formalism is to deeply internalize.)    Someone whose grammatical ear is as well-trained as Erik Singer's (dialect coach on YouTube with an awesome clip dissecting 32 different actors) surely won't have any trouble internalizing another dozen new pronouns: fluently, in character, and with the cameras rolling. But half the native English speaking population has never mastered you/you're/your and most people over the age of 50 aren't going to patch a grammatical trigger-alert over their aging brainstem. (Another group of people who'll have no trouble mastering this new linguistic landscape as native speakers across the extended pronoun suite are Swedish children who first encounter English in Swedish kindergarten—unless they're instead taught that Henglish only uses 'hen' as in reformed Swedish.)    Thus I hope it becomes clear why a prudent person would ask the question whether it might be prudent to anchor reformed pronouns to established usage—mastered as children as much as possible—before anchoring linguistic reform in a legal framework of compulsion, as with Bill C-16. I agree with Peterson that overly hasty compulsion of the state is indeed a warning sign of a slip toward totalitarianism (even if only totalitarianism lite), though I also believe than nine slippery-slope arguments out of ten are more smoke than fire. Prudence, however, attends to even the first tiny puff in the aftermath of 30 million dead. Could it happen here, too? Yes, it could, in the worst case.   I'm no great fan of Peterson's overstretched lobster as an entry point into the debate about equality of opportunity vs. equity of outcome (if you want to take a shot at Dave Rubin, I suggest punching up at Bret Weinstein, who advances similar arguments with less outré trappings, instead of down at Jordan Peterson's eccentric populism).   Next question: Even if I master attaching the right syllabic novelty to the right person all the time (unlikely at my age, but given my linguistic training at least there's a hope) how respectful is it, really, if I treat them all like nonsense words and never learn the intended distinctions (grafting fifteen different pronunciations of 'ze' into my verbal output stream in the final cognitive edit)?    Honestly, I'd rather skip all this pronoun nonsense, and instead invest the same cognitive effort into actually understanding the person on the other side. For example, I don't presently know whether the eye in the pyramid references the Illuminati or the Freemasons, and I'll remain the happier if I never do. Categories and symbols are overrated. For that matter, I've never taken 'he' or 'she' literally, either, always understanding that both were just placeholders at best for a messy biological reality (though also functioning, linguistically, as super-convenient narrative-agent anaphor $1 and $2). That said, if I heard a Jeff Sessions–fanboy in the room going 'marriage is between a man and a women' I'd probably have ten new pronouns memorized in ten minutes, just to piss that person off. Unfortunately the vengeance memory boost soon wears off, or the proposed pronoun burden would be almost free for all progressives who delight in pistol-whipping traditionalists, such as myself. (Here I find myself seriously contemplating whether the 'marriage = man + woman' moral gun-turret constitutes a stark-enough gender-normative identity to qualify for its own pronoun, too. Suggested pronoun: 'ab' for Archie Bunker. Never heard of Archie Bunker? Too bad. All you young people are surely plastic enough to incorporate my 1970s archetype into your fabulous new pronoun system without even blinking; no, it's mainly the abs who won't ever master 'ab'.)"

"I think JP is just trying to open up logical discussion. There is without doubt a strong push from the left in recent decades. There are some silly policies coming into play from these ideas. I think all JP really needs to get across is that there is a good body of historical knowledge that can help us have more logical debates and make better decisions, but must people do not possess this knowledge. While I dont agree with all of what JP says, I do appreciate that he is very publicly calling some contemporary viewpoints into question and directing the populous youth at some classical ideas that may contain some nuggets of universal truth...or maybe not, but at least we should think about it."
"despite personally believing that JP is, well, pretty fashy, I appreciate that you didn't just default to 'JP is a fascist because his ideas are similar to Nazi ideas and therefore literally everything he's ever said isn't worth your time of day listening to.' I appreciate the genuine, analytical breakdown of exactly why his ideas are flawed."
"As a student of History (3rd Semester only), whenever people say things like ' The West ' and ' Judeo-Christian values ' my blood boils because you are picking up literally hundreds if not thousands of different philosophers, philosophies and moral systems and putting all in the same bag as if they were the same, it is so all-encompassing, so broad and ill-defined it looks like a fucking joke. You'd be hard pressed to find something more representative of ' western philosophy and western values ' than the Nazi's Aryanism, it fits ' The West ' so perfectly it's astonishing.   Jordan Peterson only makes sense if you don't care about looking at things in a deep perspective and understand that every little difference sets itself a huge world apart from the other thing that doesn't have that difference, tell someone who really knows and has studied Nazism and Fascism, a PhD Historian who has many published articles about those two, go up to them and tell them ' Nazism is basically Fascism but from Germany ' and the best reaction you'll get is a resounding ' No ', now go to someone who knows the basics of Nazism and Fascism and say ' Nazism is basically Fascism but from Germany ' and that person'll be like ' Yeah, pretty much '. And THAT is Jordan Peterson's target audience, people who know, who might actually know above average about Philosophy, STEM, History, Geography, Sociology, etc. But they don't know like, say, an University teacher does, and Jordan looks like a fucking Oasis of truth and intelligence.  This video describes perfectly that: Jordan Peterson looks like a genius to people who don't know what a genius is, people thinking he's some type of second coming of Alexis de Tocqueville, when he just spits basic BS like ' Be responsible for your actions ' and with a rethorical style so broad and so all-encompassing that whenever someone tries to talk about and criticize his views he goes ' You're misinterpretating my views ' because he's just that level of broad and basic."
"Stalinesque tyrannical instinct is wherever you find it.  It's all about hateful bullies hatefully bullying others in the name of anti-bullying.  And yes, it's dangerous.  You think they're heroes till you find they've made the world safe for bullying for anyone, because bullying loses its bad name.  Then someone comes for you.  Peterson is very interested in your rights and freedoms and, I think, is happy, nay eager, to stand up for them unless your claims reach the point of unfairness to others, or absurdity.  And rights, alas, aren't absolute and infinite.  It's about a civil, good-faith debate on the exact placement of the lines that need to be drawn.  Not about who gets to have all the power, not about shutting others up.  I assert those are values that will stand the test of time.  Abandon them and invite a future where Trump looks like Bob Rae by comparison.  All the best."
"Great video. However, I think you misunderstand Peterson’s connection with the unhappy marriage between post modernism and Marxism. They have a common goal under different principles. They both think “power” is unfairly distributed. Post modernist just belief power isn’t “real” and is socially constructed to be oppressive .Marxist believe power is actually real, ill-gained and oppressive . Both seem to believe  that Western Culture is inherently bad and must be radically altered at the least (Marxist) or completely dismantled (post modernism). Ironically the West has been able to achieve (or make extraordinary progress towards) more of the meta goals either side wish to achieve (social equality, ending poverty, etc). Also it’s unclear what post modernist would replace any culture or society with due to the fact their core believe is nothing is real, so any hierarchy  would essentially be subject to the same fate or criticism by the people who installed it. It’s like a snake eating its tail. So ultimately post-modernist neomarxist in principle aren’t compatible but in practice it’s appears that Neo-Marxist are using Postmodernism  as a weapon to chip away at or destroy the “Western Ideals” to achieve a more Neo-Marxist society. Of course this isn’t a logical marriage but you have to remember post modernist don’t actually believe logic is real. More of a tool used by an oppressive racist patriarchy that serves to maintain ill-gotten power. Either way, I enjoyed your video and it’s nice to see someone from the other side willing to have an honest, good faith objection to ideas. We need more of it. Keep it up!"
"im so fucking creeped out by the fact that your video descriptions(yes all of them) are in my native language, despite no other youtube videos description being it.   Good video otherwise."
"The weirdness put me off at first but the points are good"
"19:45 Jordan Peterson knows about the debates going on in leftist circles. His character has been defamed by the schoolyard namecalling of trans rights activists who want to make it an offense punishable by fine to fail to address someone by their preferred gender pronouns... Arbitrarily hand-selected gender pronouns, not 'he' or 'she' or any of the words us heteronormative oppressors possess in our vocabulary... meanwhile said trans rights activists fail to understand how the English language even works because there are few conceivable situations in which you would use third-person gender pronouns around the person to whom you were referring.  It's not that heteronormies oppress the queers. It's that the queers are bad at facts and try to justify being bad at facts by saying 'I don't care.' and 'It's okay not to care.' I know the facts are oppressive, but we're all gonna die someday. Do you HAVE TO let it get you down all the time JUST BECAUSE things are pretty okay right now? Know that you are complete within yourself. This is the voice of Inner Peace.  The Jordan Peterson being your daddy bit was highly enjoyable though."
"Peterson is basically a right wing. Conservative pretending to be objective.  The dead give away is that everyone he's against is left of center. He avoids criticism of right wingers and/or creates excuses for conservative dogma. He's a supremely devious trickster, who should just come out of the closet and admit that he is a clever servant of right wing extremist dogma."

Yes, what an amazing counter argument, man. Takes real balls to make a video about JP. ...  You're a man."
"I like Jordan Peterson, but I don't agree with all of his opinions. While I am on the side of biology, and biology being used for gender, and subsequently pronouns, I don't think the the far left are trying to 'destroy the west', and I certainly do not have Judeo/Christian values. I just like simplicity. Isn't it so much easier to go by the pronouns of your biology rather than having to ask everyone? Isn't it more peaceful to have a set standard for pronouns rather than fight each other over which one we want to be called? If you were once a man, but transitioned into being a woman, you can be called she, and vice versa. Why do we have to have 75 genders when 2 is so much easier, and keeps everyone on the same level? It would just be one less thing to argue about.   I also have a problem with identity politics in general. I don't think it should matter who you are or where you come from, as long as you have valid points. You should be able to contribute to a conversation whether you be a black trans woman, or a straight white guy, as long as your thought process isn't completely ridiculous. Everyone has different circumstances, but that shouldn't mean that some people's opinions are looked down upon, or seen as less or more valuable because of them. We should judge people on their character, not their identity."
"1. He wasn’t arguing about transgender rights, they already have rights. He was arguing that punishing misgendering someone is compelled speech and authoritarian.   2. 3:40 People haven’t heard such insights because we are currently living in a blame game culture. Blacks are doing poorly not because of the lack of fathers in their lives but because the all powerful white man is keeping them down. Women are not equally represented in top earning positions not because of life choices but because the evil man is keeping them down. No one is taking responsibility for themselves and in our current culture what Peterson is saying is refreshing.   3. 6:50 He is not telling people how to live their lives, he gives recommendations and advice on how to live a better life. As all the characteristics in successful people are common and therefore people can learn from it to improve themselves.  4. 8:00 Assuming we actually live in a patriarchy. Come on now, the entire idea that men are oppressing women has been debunked countless times.  5. 8:20 Well compelled speech and forcing people to say certain things and have the same line of thinking IS like Stalin, Mao, and every other authoritarian leader. If only people just say and think the right way we would achieve a utopia (sarcasm).  6. 10:00 Political correctness IS stifling. When comedians are losing their jobs and are afraid to do their job then maybe just maybe there is a problem.   7. 17:55 Why not look up the definition of identity politics instead of creating your own definition to suit your needs. Identity politics has been used throughout history by people like Hitler (Saving the Aryan race), the kkk, in order to separate people based on race to justify atrocities towards other races. There have been good uses of identity politics as seen with 1st and 2nd wave feminism but it is ultimately divisive and says that if someone has a viewpoint that doesn’t align with X group then that person must be against X group. It is even being used by the alt-right in order to galvanize white people into joining their cause.   8. 19:31 Yet we see it being used constantly by the left. White oppressing blacks, men oppressing women, cisgender oppressing transgender. Postmodernism also calls into question what is real, that includes gender (is gender real?), which is something that benefits the transgender arguments.  9. 20:15 Good job straw-manning Peterson. He is not against social progress, he is against social regress. Why do you think everyone calls sjws regressives? Among other things the left currently thinks segregation of races is social progress.  10.  22:00 The entire argument of 3rd wave feminists is that they are being oppressed by the patriarchy and that this is due to sexism. The lobster argument is showing that even animals form hierarchies without understanding social constructs. Take the idea of a patriarchy away from the feminists and they are forced to admit that nothing is holding women back and that the unequal distribution of men and women in the workplace is a result of individual choices.   11. 25:00 But transgender’s aren’t “requesting” people to use different pronouns, they are forcing it. In Canada you will be fined for misgendering someone and if you don’t pay you will go to jail. Think about that for a second, you could go to jail for not using the right pronouns, how is that not totalitarian?"
"I really like that wallpaper."
"As a fan of JP's work, good video! I agree that when talking about the modern left (especially towards the authoritarian side), he isn't always 'precise in his speech', to use one of his rules against him. However, there are a couple of things I'd like to point out. 1) His ideas are not new, and *that's the whole point*. His core message is obvious, but not to those who need it. Anyone going anywhere in life understands the vital importance of adopting responsibility and telling the truth, but I know I didn't use to. His popularity demonstrates that I'm not alone. 2) He doesn't have a problem with trans-people or anyone of the LGBT+ variety. He wouldn't even necessarily refuse to use a pronoun of their choosing. It's not trans-rights that he disagreed with, it's that this was the first law in a country with the common law system that introduced compelled speech, ie. 'Use these words or else!'. That was his problem, and the context was irrelevant ('I don't care what your excuse is'). Most other things in the video that I would disagree with are differences in opinion, so I think I'll end this comment here. Otherwise, good video, decently researched!"

"Stop misrepresenting lobsterdaddy. His rhetoric style isn't dishonest at all, in fact it's the opposite. Cathy Newman was trying to pin him down on topics that are too complex to give one-dimensional answers to. He describes tendencies that apply to certain percentages of certain groups, well aware of the limitations of his claims. This is how psychologists think."

Jordan Peterson sucks; he is a jewish shill (no doubt about that), his task is to keep the truly dangerous right at bay (white nationalist, neo nazis, neo fascist, patriotic socialists, etc) and that is the reason why we (I am neo-fascist, not follower of Mussolini but of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, Curzio Malaparte, Giovanni Gentile, Julius Evola mixed with some elements of christian anarchism such as Jacques Ellul), the 'dangerous right' (yes, we are dangerous because we will not hesitate with the use of violence, we are heavily armed and trained) reject this jewish puppet.

"Even as a Peterson fan, I enjoyed this. You take the Head Lobster to task on his shortcomings in a way that is measured and obvious (with a nice bit of comedy to keep it light).   I think one of the things that drew me to Peterson is sort of what I loved so much about your critique of him... my short time in academia we were taught to read what was prescribed and learn how to we should be interpreting it, rather than to gather contrary points and argue against it to find the 'most right' solution. Peterson gave me that contrary opinion I craved in his attempts to critique academia as an amalgam of postmodernism and neo-marxism who are striving to deconstruct 'the West,' and you've done it, as well, in your critique of his lack of a coherent central thesis and oversimplification of hard topics/categories. I love it when people can tactfully remove the rose-colored glasses we tend to wear when approaching new ideas in a way that causes us to think a bit deeper about message and intent. I think this sort of critique would do well to all of humanity if someone like you and he were able to sit and have a civil discussion on your differences (like good Liberals should) rather than the coddling he's received from the Right (which is pushing him further so) vs. the cudgeling he receives from the militant Leftists with whom he's often bickering.  All of that to say, you've earned yourself a fan. Though I won't be leaving the fold of Daddy Peterson anytime soon, I will look forward to your work and a contrary point of view I might not have received in my mostly Right/conservative sources of infotainment.   Cheers!"

"'Someone needs to whip the neckbeards into shape and if Peterson can do that, more power to him.'  I honestly think the man freaked out, overreacted and it somehow caused him to blow up, so he's gone with it and let people believe about him what they may.  I followed his lectures way before all this shit happened and ever since, I've been annoyed at the whole thing.   Wish he'd just go back to being a small time youtuber doing lectures.  But honestly I got all I needed out of his lectures anyway."
"I think Peterson just doesn't know that much about postmodernism, or political theory, or philosophy, or history - academics in the sciences don't really know anything about developments in the humanities, and vice versa. I attended a lecture recently where an eminent engineer claimed that there had been 'no significant developments in the humanities and social sciences for thirty years' - and then proceeded to discuss his novel 'insight' that perhaps scientists should consider abandoning an objective worldview and take contingency into account when applying their models to real-world problems. He was apparently unaware of the irony that contingency has been a basic concept in the humanities for decades. I regard Peterson as yet another example of how stepping outside your field can trip you up and make you look foolish. A toast - to the Queen Under the Water!"
"I think if you were to invite him on your channel to discuss this he actually would. I have seen him on much smaller channels. Because I think you are being disingenuous or atleast you are to close to the subject to be impartial.  Because you have done what every other lefty has done. Ignored what he keeps trying to talk about, the warning he is actually trying to give. That compelled speach by a government is ALWAYS A BAD IDEA that WILL lead to making things worse and not better. PERIOD. And he is right. He right about something else, it is easy to gaurd against the far right because what their primary motivational force is (hate that comes from fear) is something that is easy to see as harmful. The far left on the other hand is not as easy to to pin down as harmful because their motivation comes not from fear but from the desire to help, to make things better. Dispite that, or maybe because oc that, the far left is easily far more dangerous than the far right. I understand this sounds counter intuitive but stay with me. The desire to help without the knowledge of how to actually help can be a very bad combination. If ypu don't believe me just try to rescue a drowning person whithout first being taught how to. So that is bad enough. Unfortunately it gets worse because the far left are an especially dangerous kind of ignorant. The kind that believes it has the correct answers and is incredibly arrogant because it is also educated. Well highly educated but not well informed. So you end up with a arrogant idiot who wants to not only tell you what to do but also how to think. Fuck this is too long. The short of it is that Dr. Peterson is 100% right on this matter. The law sets a dangerous precedent and the far left needs to be checked."
"'Everyone is problematic and I disown them all.' This pretty much sums up how I feel about the constant squabbling between all the different ideologues, dogmatic tribalists, 'public intellectuals' and political groups at each others throats.

"You do realize that the lobster argument is explanatory, and not used as an activist statement? Peterson states facts not as a means of implying things in the subtext but as a way of illustrating the current topic of conversation and directly explaining his views. When you push him to give a direct political statement, he resists it, because as you yourself pointed out, he is a postmodernist. You can only pin him down on his strong views. This comes down to the fact that despite being active in the political arena, he is not an activist. He does not invest the time, effort, or energy required to engage in that sphere, and it shows. He isn't super educated about the left and the differences within it because he is not an activist. So basically, your arguments about his hidden statements do not hold water due to the fact that his agenda is public non-activist resistance rather than private hidden activism. For an example of private hidden activism, find yourself an alt-righter.  Despite that criticism, I think you did a fine job on this video. You raised some good points, and may have revealed that Peterson does not understand the meaning of postmodernism. You are also very funny. All in all, an enjoyable thing to watch."
"all those dislikes...  all those fedoras..."
"1:20 I spontaneously heaved the same heavy sigh at the same point you did! ;-D"
"Peterson's Argument bout Lobsters to defend hierarchy is a bullshit argument entirely simply because it doesn't matter whether the patriarchy is holding up hierarchy or it's other forces holding up the hierarchy the simple truth is lobsters have almost nothing in common with humans and humans are much more socially evolved and closer to bonobo's than lobsters.  Hierarchy is not human nature, it's not natural, it has to be imposed and is."
"Thank you for the great content. That was unbiased, analytical, witty and funny. You also do a great job showing his strawman arguments.   Peterson makes a lot of sense to me when he talks about psychology. This is his domain and I believe he's quite knowledgeable in it. When it comes to politics, he raises many valid points, but I lose him when he backs his argument with religion. I also admire the fact that his book and lectures helped many people deal with their problems."

"Postmodernism is correct. Identity politics is bad."
"The contradictory title of 'post-modern neo-Marxism' is the title for the disparate groups of neo-Marxists and 'progressives' who have ended up heading in the same legal and regulatory direction. The progressives declare that personal pronouns exist and must be respected, and the neo-Marxists follow that up with declaring that this is evidence of the 'neo-bourgeoisie' (which can vary wildly, from whites, to hetero, to men, to the more standard bourgeoisie like governments, capitalism, etc) who are oppressing 'neo-proletariat' (why can't we just make new words? In this case it's non-binary people, but by the previous examples I bet you can guess the list) by calling them the improper pronouns. Then, both of them petition the government to make it illegal to do this, causing it to be legislated.   In Canada it is a crime to misgender someone, in-fact, it is a human rights violation. Of course it's not all doom and gloom, it has to be seen to be repeated, and preferably intentional, but this makes it no longer a choice. Anyone who doesn't want to conform to the current pronoun usage and acts on it can be brought to the human rights tribunal. In quite a few Western countries there are 'heresy' laws, which depending on country can make it so you can't criticize religions, and depending on country only protect certain religions. Even when the law doesn't discriminate based on what religion, the practices of the police tend to not reflect this, with the EU especially, where Muslims tend to be the only ones protected by these laws (or disproportionately). Alternatively, laws that would limit the practice of religion (ie. wearing religious iconography, religious garb, prayer, etc) tend to not apply to Muslims.   This has led to many people being upset, because there is clear preferential treatment, especially because the countries are not the region where these religions originated, it isn't the state religion, and that the actual enforcement of these laws are very 'fuzzy' and imprecise. You can't know one day if saying anything bad will have you arrested, so people are avoiding mentioning anything bad that anyone of those religions do, even when completely unrelated to their religion.   These general complaints tend to extend to many of the 'progressive' viewpoints. It isn't the general sentiment that bothers people, it's the execution. Most agree that nobody should be persecuted for their religion, and people being intentionally bigoted and insulting should stop. But, when one group gets privileges that others do not, especially when the group being corralled are the majority, they become displeased. It's similar to the anti-colonial sentiment in Africa and India, where the masses were forced to act against their will by a small number of people from far off who recently came to their land and they were unable to stop the newcomers. For as much as North America wasn't always European, as they have become the majority they are upset at being told they must do what you want them to. As Modernist European policies were based on the majority being satisfied, this post-modernist control dissatisfies them, especially because the people next to them are neo-Marxists, and North America hasn't had the best relationship with other Marxists. For as much as they are against each-other, post-modernists and neo-Marxists have a common enemy in the Western world, for as equally nebulous of a concept as that is.   This is also why many positions to the right of the far and moderate left seem confusing, it's because they don't have a common enemy, and their various opposition groups often have aligning goals for wildly different reasons, all of which are damaging what they value.   This also extends from general ideology. Where the left tends towards identity politics, where what group you fall in matters more than most would think, the right (minus the far-right) tends towards individuality. Identity politics until very recently was solely the propriety of both far left and far right (nationalism's focus on citizenship, fascism's state vs non-state, communism's workers vs the wealthy), which further puts modern identity politics into a bad light, as it's often seen as a slippery slope into the extremes of both sides, so a universal red flag.   Most people also don't like identity politics from a general perspective, because it splits the world based on gender, race, sexuality, etc, claiming that these differences are what must be focused on. It leads to things like white people being told they aren't allowed to talk about race, because of their race. They are being told that because you are white either your opinion has no value, or you can't have a valid opinion because without being black you can't see racism. It comes in many forms, from whites not being able to recognize it, to never experiencing it, etc. Now, these white people who have seen racism and want to stop it become angry because they are being told they don't have the same intellectual value due to their race. Were someone to say a black person didn't have the same intellectual value due to their race we would rightfully protest that claim. The same occurs with men and sexism, straight people and homophobia, etc.   As the past 100 years have been a struggle to teach the world that we are all equal based on race, gender, etc, this sudden change of direction rubs most of us the wrong way. We were told we were equals, so why are you now saying I'm less than you? You told us that we were equal, so we recognized you were right and treated you as such, and now that you are equal (legally, and for the most part in all respects, aggregated across Western society) it looks like you're trying to turn the tables so we are now disadvantaged.   This has ironically led to the resurgence of the far-right and all of the things that social advocacy has been fighting against. Why? Because it's the perfect scapegoat. 'The left is taking away your free speech, giving your jobs to immigrants, [insert racial, religious, etc, propaganda of your choice]!' With all of these changes being led by the left and social justice, the response is the inverse, the right and social injustice. It's only furthered along by the co-opting of words to fit new definitions, or creating new words to attack the opposition. This has gone off-track, but I hope it was informative."
"Hey Dave"
"When I first saw Peterson book I legit thought that the cover said 'An Anecdote to CHADS' on the bottom instead of 'An Anecdote to CHAOS.'"
"ok wtf"
"I don't mind Peterson, some of his ideas are worth listening, notably about psychology. But I'm saddened to hear him jabber about philosophy, when he talks trash on Derrida because of 'his heavily Marxist implications', he just shows how badly he wants to put socialism down regardless of any intellectual integrity.   So yeah, I don't even listen his political outcomes. But his course sessions are worth wasting time on."
"I find nothing objectionable about this."

"new kid in the comment section, a lobster-kid in fact!  You're absolutely right peterson leaves people in some kind of a right-leaning reactionary place in which I am not comfortable, and don't think anyone should be comfortable, as well as I think capitalism shouldn't be treated indifferently. Thanks for sitting down straight with your shoulders back, it's keeping the lobster in me under control :) I'm in line with conventional feminism all the way since my earliest memories, witnessing my feminist grandmother flip of (rightly) every fucking gender bias directed towards her career, but have always recognized feminism (including any form of sexual activism) as primarily founded in individualism, which I consider the only truly liberal way of perceiving the world (excuse my up-tight language, not a native English speaker). I think that amongst peterson's audience there is a  majority of people that share my beliefs. Individualism is the reason I adore listening to Camile Paglia, but at the same time hold my vomit whenever I listen to any kind of identity-politics bullshit. Oh, and yeah, I certainly found peterson to be my internet daddy, but at the same time I'm new to the channel, so I wasn't aware of my beautiful trans mommy! I urge you to regain your title as the lobster queen, it's healthy for parents to fight every once in a while!"
"One of the more bareable leftists. As you admitted Peterson provides much needed guidance for angsty young men who were stripped of role models by outrage culture and single parent households. I disagree with your dismissal of cultural marxism as a conspiracy theory however, because the class struggle has indeed shifted from rich vs. poor to racial and sexual identities against eachother based on an ideology of victimhood and slave morality. Of course you could call it coincidental but when many ideologically driven people deliberately go for a career in academia and educatin you have to acknowledge there is an organised effort in some capacity."

"I came to this video ready to defend Peterson. His main point about the 'trans agenda' was forced speech and the right to respect. That's a dangerous road. People don't have a right to respect–they earn it. Also, having a LAW say, 'if you don't use this pronoun, you're a criminal,' is freaking insane. It's not against the law to say cuss words, or even call someone a name, but this law would make it illegal. He even argued that the law is written in a way that people will be required to use the pronoun and you cannot use that person's name in place of a pronoun because of the way it is phrased.  If someone corrects me in a nice way that I got their pronoun wrong (it happens) then I'll use what they want. I have a trans friend that went through gender dysphoria and changed her pronoun from he to they to she. I got it wrong all the time, but she never corrected me. I eventually started correcting myself. Because in the long run, why does a pronoun matter if you're just accidentally using it incorrectly.  But you did make some very good points about how he presents arguments in certain manners. Long live the lobster queen!"
"You're gorgious. Teach me. 💚"
"Goodjob as a Peterson fan, I came out of this more informed from a different side. Also I only cringed once, in the bathroom scene. Lol"
"Jordan Peterson is NOT arguing against trans people requesting others to use their pronouns. He actually explicitly states this in the video that first got him really famous. Jordan Peterson is against trans people using the legal system to FORCE others into using their pronouns. That is NOT something you would support if you are strongly individualist, regardless of whether you think it's right or wrong.  There were lots of mistakes in this video that show a lack of research. It quite honestly seems slapped together on the basis of the Cathy Newman video and a skimming of his newer book.  I do think 'postmodern neo-marxism' is a really fucking stupid term tho."
"ContaPoints on the Rubin Report in the future?!"
"Just fell in love with your channel. You're basically putting words on things i have been thinking and ranting about for the past few years. Maybe now i can actually learn how to verbalize my thoughts without sounding like an angry asshole."
"Camus can do but Sartre is smarter."
"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I like to go through YouTube comments and be disappointed by them. Fertile ground here.   Did anybody want to take a stab at examples of ntellectual variation within post-modern Marxism with respect to Peterson's characterization for it? Maybe compare differences he talks about between Peterson’s P-m Marxism and his idea of the Western tradition to the variation within those groups? That could go a long way toward showing he’s simplifying these concepts so much that criticism of one with respect to the other is meaningless.  Or what about this idea that the heterosexual, two parent family where the number of children is an integer greater than zero is the smallest ‘viable’ unit. Why? Well, because ‘studies show’ they ‘do better’? That gets really vague, really fast.  Not so fast. This is YouTube, guys. We’re not going anywhere before we decide how far to the left or right of some kind of political center the guy is. And how each of us feel about our preceived positions on the universal continuum political thought. We should also spend a LOT of time pointing out that nazi nazi nazi. And slaves. Oh, and hopefully, we’ll get around to confusing politics with economics in order to prove that logic totally facts."
"As a Jordan Peterson fan, I have to say thank you. Thank you for respecting his views and our intelligence. I have to say you made A LOT of valid points and I can see that you've actually viewed his material. Keep up the good work. I still love JP too, dont get it twisted."

"Am I transphopic for saying I'd rather watch this than RuPaul?"

"post modernism and marxism are often found together through the goal of the left to reduce inequality.   one of the main ideas of marxism is to bring forth economic equality.   post modernism is often used to explain problems in our society such as racial and gender inequality, blaming the beliefs and cultural systems in our society as responsible for the oppression (financially and otherwise) of certain groups.  a common post modern critique of the patriarchy is the idea that undue status and power is attributed to (white) men because of the perpetuating cultural belief that men are superior.  since those at the top of the richness hierarchy tend to be men, this ties into the idea that capitalism is corrupt and inherently unfair because we promote white men and oppress everyone else.  i have also seen post modernism critique capitalism in other ways such as: 1. the idea that advertising is feeding us stories that we need to buy things to feel complete, 2. and that in order to do this we have to prostrate ourselves to capitalism, often working meaningless jobs that only serve to make money for an already wealthy and powerful person or corporation. (even if we are sufficiently enlightened to see through the lie of advertising and consumerism, since the world believes in money and capitalism, we have to play that game to survive)  i frequently hear this narrative and i used to believe it myself.  the problem with this view is that it seems to put all the blame on culture for perpetuating the observed inequalities between men and women, whereas Jordan Peterson puts forward compelling evidence for biological reasons for the inequalities we see (?v=_iudkPi4_sY&feature=youtu.be&t=350)"
"This was very entertaining and inspiring!"
"Just a criticism, no hate here, honestly think your different personas are very entertaining,  but I feel like you misrepresented Peterson’s argument about the trans pronouns, he stated that he was perfectly ok with calling trans people by their preferred pronouns, but he was aggrieved  that laws requires him to speak a certain way, which may seem minor, but when not speaking in a certain manner can be considered a criminal offense, it can lead to more and more restrictions on free speech, also, he was comparing trans activist to the authoritarian in the context that one individual is speaking for their entire community not as a way to degrade trans people by and large."

It makes me sad that someone I once had such respect for has shown himself to be a intellectual coward and a bit of a bigot. I come to your video someone who has been a fan of JP’s for about a year, but has had trouble with his political statements since the beginning, but particularly in the past 6 months."
""
"I attribute a lot of the success and happiness in my life over the past year with listening to his ideas on meaning, responsibility and morality, so it is extremely regrettable that he has not displayed the introspection he preaches to turn his ideas honestly on himself. I know none of his ideas on those topics are original, but as someone who was lost for a good many years, it was extremely comforting and empowering to hear them being targeted at me for what felt like the first time."

"Good points but I feel like there's too much attention to deconstructing the semantics of what he's saying and not the actual meaning of what he's saying. For instance, you totally gloss over what put Jordan Peterson on the map by saying he didn't like 'laws that protect trans people.' that's a categoric misrepresentation and you don't seem dumb enough to actually believe it. What got him riled up and made his message resonate with thousands of people wasnt a desire not to protect trans people but a desire not to institute laws that, at risk of jail time, force people not to speak words that would offend a trans person's sensibilities. It's not a matter of trans rights it's a matter of free speech."

"An additional point, is that much of the reasoning towards the end of this video is based on the earlier arguaments given against late modernism, and dismissal of the fact that processes that are apparently stochastic can be empirically observed, or can be acurately predicated, and therefore used as a basis of reasoning. As such, the point that was made about economics as a non-natural hierarchy is not correct, yes, it is a social construction, but it exists as an unavoidable abstraction of the process of evolution. The advantage of economics, is that we have a greater control over it than evolution itself, and that it exists as a macro structure that wnables society to function at large scale. But it is, just that, a proxy for evolution. Consequently, the effect it has on society has an extensive commonality in respect to the evolutionary process, and is, almost, an isomorphism of it. It also, by extention, shares, pretty much, all the same models, in respect to the population as evolution, such as the modelling of competition as a pareto distribution, which is an underlying trend for wealth inequality in society and, although it can be tempered is seemingly an inescapeable feature of any competative system, which unavoidably humanity is, due to its existence as a biological system constrained and optimised, with respect to environment, through the evolutionary process."
"Although, most of your critique is nuanced and well analysed, one thing that I noticed is that you seem to dismiss insight provided by statistical analysis and modelling of stochastic processes ( that you group into late modernism). Information gathered by statistical means is perfectly valid, and in fact what you categorise as early modernism still has stochastic vectors, although in the cases you group under that category, the general trends in those fields are significant relative to the stochasticity, as oposed to the categories of research you group as late modernism. You praise David Hulme for his critique on the limitations of empirical knowledge, although empirical knowledge is that which can be verified through observation and experience, which, by nature, statistical information is. From a mathematical perspective, such processes can be modelled statistically precisely due to them being a result of a convolution of many factors, of which a large number are known to be, or presumed to be, defineable trends, in their own right. Of the three notions, that Hulme presents as limits to empirical knowlege, I would propose that none of them are, as a result of many developments in science and technology, since he posed this theory. Despite this it is perfectly clear why, to someone of that era, he could believe this.   Systems of morality have developed, through most of human history, in parallel, in the majority of cases (by this I jmean absent of interactions which would effect one another in any significant way). Despite this, many cultures developed very similar systems of morality, often supplimented by religions which enhance the moral frameworks with an explanitory context. A highly likely basis for this is evolutionary theory, that what many do not realise expands beyond the confines of genetics and crosses into knowlege and societal structures. Since many aspects of morality, particulary the most similar across cultures,  provide distinct benefits for a culture that adopts them, it presents a competative advantage over societies that do not share them. An example can be seen in the ten commandments of Christian, and Jewish moral frameworks, that undoubtably provides a benefit to societies in 'Shalt not kill', among with the vast majority of the tenants. Very similar rules can be found in most current religions, or variations thereof. Also, it should be noted that, in terms of religion, although there are not a huge number of religions, not relative to the number of cultures that have ever existed, similar religions promote cultures that predispose them to consensus with similar religions, to an extent. When this is taken along with the expansionist past of humanity, in particular when larger civilizations began forming, from the third millenium BC (Sumer, considered the earliest complex civilisation) it explains the lack of variation today, in terms of the number of religions that have survived today.   Causation, can be relitively trivial, such as the causation that underpins the sciences you group as early modernism. When it becomes complex, it can become difficult to determine, and can become confused when people conflate correlation and causality. Despite this, where causation occurs, there is always some result which can be empirically observed,  and consequently an underlying model can be formulated. With more data comes more accuracy, as with any of the fields you group in early modernism. It is just that, in many cases, causality is convolved with other factors that obscure the trends to an extent where a very large data set is required to determine the trend with statistical significance.  Self, is, by nature, very complex, requiring a huge amount of data to make empirical determinations, particuarly on an individual level. It is this way as humans are enormously sensitive on a biological, physical, and chemical level to a vast range of convolved factors, and the trends we are trying to observe are often abstract, defined in terms of human classification systems, themselves formulated through the same range of factors, and often highly subjective in nature. Despite this, we know have technologies that are making precisley those determinations, based on statistical models of the distinctions that make them subjective, as well as more objective predictors. Technology giants now have a vast pool of data, not seen or processable ever before in our existence, they make incredibly accurate predictions of self, and with increasingly more data, become increasingly more accurate. The extent of this can be seen in the huge impact of online advertising, the Cambridge Analytica political scandal, and the soft censorship that constitutes the great firewall of China. These technologies are improving every day, and with enough data have proven to be a better prediction of self than one can predict ones own self.  Bit of a rant, sorry, but they were points that I believe were completely overlooked."
"I can't understand how you argue that Peterson's life lessons are basic, and you can't explain how it can be other than throwing an insult at the future generation. Young people, millenials have no reason to live in our society. They are controlled, and yes, some of them are spoiled, but that is due to wrong parenting by the older generations, and usually causes the millenials to either be selfish, or find no value in money which is leading to them living poor, miserable lives. Jordan Peterson is so adored, because he talks to, and helps the part of society that has been forgotten nowadays by the popular media - white people. Actual white people. Not the nazis, who are portrayed like they are on every corner all around the world. Not the homosexuals, minorities - although his lessons are not race-specific, or sexuality specific, and could help people from those groups, too. His messages talk to a forgotten part of society that is often hated, viewed with bias, looked upon as the enemy, or just simply not cared for: young, white men.  Nobody can tell me that there are ever events for white people. Ever movies, or series specifically for white people, or talking about white men, their issues, the younger generations. Everything that is part of our social media nowadays cares for minorities, or the left - and even view it as dangerous, or offensive, if someone dares to care for that other group that exists within society. The media is controlled by liberals, and leftists, and they view every white person as racist. Society, as a whole, does not, but white people are still abandoned. It's not that there is nothing wrong with them, the reality is that there are many things wrong with them, yet all they get is the talk about privilege, or how they are all nazis/bigots.  Jordan Peterson's political values were never in the forefront. Sure, he is a conservative, so he has a specific set of values - I guess that already makes him an enemy to be exterminated in some people's eyes. As he makes it clear many times, his political values only came into question when he protested that Canadian bill. That's it. Otherwise, he would be a simple psychologist, but when he spoke up against something that he deemed wrong, and irrational, all he got was people attacking him and his basic values - that, by the way, many people hold. I didn't know that having a certain opinion was wrong, but that is the world we live in now, I guess. If there was no bill that forces people to speak in a certain way, Jordan Peterson's ideas would have only gotten interest in the psychologic community. He was never political, the media, and politicans attacking him turned him political. Of course, he will share his views when people question those views. This is no basis to judge Peterson."

"While this is a better treatment than most (I rather like the Trojan horse analogy), Contra seems to miss what I thought was an obvious feature 'post modern neo marxists.' She seems to think that showing the inconsistencies in that pseudo-philosophy proves her point (and rebuts Peterson's) when in fact it does just the opposite. My reading of Jordan when he's talking about the postmodern-neo-blah-blahs is that they are inconsistent, *and they don't even realize it.* In his words on the Joe Rogan podcast, 'solzhenitsyn cut off the knees of the Marxists intellectuals.' Postmodern Neo Marxism in other words was an adhoc revision created by a class of disaffected intellectuals when 'it was no longer tenable to remain a Marxist.' That there are contradictions is the point. Its a kind of philosophy-religion."
"To be clear:::: This video starts with restating a lie about Peterson. Starting with a falsity will always taint all that follows. In this diatribe, many false statements are offered as reality. Consequently the conclusions are also false."
"The first lie:"
""
"Peterson's opposition to Bill C-16 had nothing to do with transgender issues."
"His stance  was about opposing government mandated compelled speech.   He has actually said, if asked if he would use a person's preferred pronoun,  if the person was sincere, and not trying to manipulate him.  And he also has actually said that NO ONE has ever asked him to use a preferred pronoun."
"This issue is about a government compelling speech with the force of law. Everyone should be profoundly concerned about the implications. This is Orwellian Newspeak. What comes next?  Fascism is all about what you can and cannot say.  In the United States this issue was settled in 1942 by the supreme court stating that no one can be compelled to speak that which they did not want to. The court case was brought By  Jehovah's Witnesses, who objected to their children being forced to recite the 'Pledge of Allegiance' in schools."

"This really highlights my biggest issue with Peterson. If you only take what he explicitly says then you're left with a series of true factoids that add nothing to the conversation being had, as the 'physical differences between a man and woman' example points out. If you read any deeper he denies any subtext exists and you're now part of the problem for twisting his words. It's a no-win conversation."
"I do agree with a lot of comments here. I enjoy Peterson but I strongly am opposed to the bible serving and particularly right serving types of agruments he posses that cater implicitly to the right sympathizers. Also he does talk a lot of fluff, but a great public and motivational speaker. There are a lot of incongruity issues in his agruememts compared to the sources he draws from. I will say that in the case he made about the laws passed to require people to call others by their prefered pronouns is an enroachment on free speech, however, if the left is concerned with that issue to the point they wish to overthrow all groups freedom of speech to protect a particular group, they are failing at clearly articulating their reasoning for the need to provide a case such individuals and how they need that accommodation(and why that point contradicts their love of self expression as mentioned). Yes, people are dill weeds and will say hateful things and that is inevitable. I think the general public are centrists on the political spectrum. The left has some really great ideas, they do, but their brand goes south when they dont maintain their levelheadedness and unify their ideas instead of the scattered approach they take to things from being pretty chill, to a raging monster of hormones in a debate. Perhaps this is why in the past years there has been a trend to favour the right more simply on the basis their general brand comes off as unified and stable?"

It kinda confirms all these things that peterson was talking about. Check mate against you."
"I think Jordan Peterson is as reasonable as anyone and that his big problem is that he is very enthusiastic to think things through verbally. He invites you to participate in his way of thinking, and like CG Jung, he has a lot of knowledge that is not common knowledge. His concern is that we have poured the baby out with the bath and alienated ourselves from our psyche by trying to be purely rational in our thoughts. He also considers this to be extremely dangerous, because such thinking leads to death and suffering, as has been observed in many cases. Even the attempt to liberate people in a repressive society like the French Revolution became the opposite of what they intended, especially because they formed an ideology that had all the bad qualities of religion while radically trying to impose what they thought was best for people. One can even see it in everyday life when students gather around their professors and radicalize their theories, which often amazes the professors themselves. He believes, as I do, that this is because we read and look at stories as if they were historically correct or visually realistic, rather than asking what a story means. The meaning is that we didn't think so until after the Enlightenment, and although it's important for scientific studies and evidence-based research, it doesn't tell us what things mean. If we forget what means something, rationality takes over and, above all, tries to become efficient. This has led to inquisitions, genocides, extermination camps and gulags, to Pol Pot and several atrocities in the name of progress. These things happen across the entire religious and political spectrum, and the transfiguration of each colour is indeed the open door to the repetition of history, because we have not learned what history means to people or could mean to us if we repeat it.  I find this to be a very typical and sensible debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G59zsjM2UI"

"Jordan Peterson is the modern day Ayn Rand, sent out to parse words like altruism into something nefarious. He provides cover for douchebags chafing at a more and more empathic world.  What is his end game though? Ayn was sent out to promote corporatism/globalism with her 'greed is good' memes. Does Jordan have an agenda besides dividing society by convincing the fearful that peer pressure to be empathic is somehow a terrible oppression?"
"I wish that the 'compelled speech' requirement had been addressed. It was compelled speech, legally mandated,  which Peterson opposed.  I agree with his opposition to that. I agree with the analysis given here that Peterson is functioning, whether intentionally or not, as cover for unbridled capitalism.  He claims concern for those who are stuck on the bottom at zero, the poor, but offers no answer, what so ever, about how to ameliorate their circumstances.  He more or less shrugs them off, with a 'what can you do?' attitude. Peterson all too often skates away from answering, or even meaningfully acknowledging, real substantive criticism. Most disappointing was his insisting that the left would not debate him, thus implying they were scared to, and then when Marxist professor Richard Wolff took up Peterson's debate offer, Peterson reneged by claiming that a Marxist was beyond the pale of polite society.   I was appalled on Peterson's behalf. He revealed hypocrisy, dishonesty, and extreme arrogance in his dismissal of Wolff."

"I'm not saying that Peterson is a fascist, but all fascists do quote him, alot.  Look this guy is only popular because he is a 'smart' person with a lot of corporate money behind him, and yes I put smart in quotation marks because, if you believe with all the technology and evidence we have today, that the world is somehow being controlled or subverted by 'neo-marxists' you have to be an idiot, I personally don't think he believes what he says but is just using it because a lot of white men will listen to that crap and knows that it is a dog whistle to corporations that he is willing to espouse their propaganda, but lets be clear, Marx wanted a form of democratic socialism that would then lead to communism, now while being a libertarian socialist myself I don't agree with him on everything, the fact that we have corporations exploiting the f*ck out the third world while we sip champagne should be enough to tell you that, no, Marxists are not in charge, all that is happening now is some people are waking up to the fact that for many years minorities and women have not had a fair say in politics and the media, and its amazing the amount of push back their getting just because one or two films has a minority or female lead, its really incredible, like out of 100 Hollywood films only about 2 have a female lead and we're like 'Feminism has taken over!'. Its disturbingly humorous..."
"O U R B O Y S"
"I like this video but there's a problem when you group up people like Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx in the same category as modernist scientists. Maybe I misunderstood, but if I didn't, then it's simply wrong because psychoanalysis and marxism are not scientific theories, they are philosophical approaches to social and human phenomenons. Under no way could anyone reasonably judge the oedipus complex as a serious theory that can be analyzed by observation and/or experimentation.  I am aware this was not the point, but the entire explanation falls flat on it's face without proper foundation."

"20:10 I experienced the opposite. First, people are very specific with their hatered and then it turns out they don't hate at all.  I heard people hatefully saying things like 'fat feminists with dyed hair who major in gender studies are stupid'  And then I try to figure out if they hate equality, women, colorful hair, gender studies or obese people or what. After several exhausting hours, we come to terms that nobody actually hates anybody. People just say shit like this and then it turns out they don't actually hate any of the good things. wtf  And the whole SJW thing is not even that big in Ukraine, my hateful friends just watch pewdiepie, lol"
"This video was a turning point for me from being a fan of jordan peterson and not being a fan. There were other factors, and the more I heard of his opinions the more strongly I disagreed with him, but this video really informed me of his beliefs and the way he approaches debates, whereas before I only knew pieces of what he was about and formed my admiration according to that.  P.S: I'd love to see contra make a video about male domestic abuse and/or the MRA (mostly the abuse but the MRA discourse is kinda unavoidable). I really hate how this is seen as a lesser issue and is knocked down by the overall discourse surrounding it and the MRA's.   Edit: When I say male abuse I'm talking about men being abused."

"This is really good, and the effort to address the grains of truth in what Peterson says or his good attributes is what is needed if only to defy the idea that any left criticism of him is 'screeching'.  A lot of what he starts with is 'common sense' but he then frequently steps well beyond his field of expertise to make wild, unsubstantiated claims that rationalise his conservative ideas, coming across as his resentment for having his cowboy boots laughed at once by some female faculty members or something."
"It depends on how you define the West. When we had the wall in germany and communism was on the eastern side and capitalism on the western side, JPs argument makes sense. You have to look at it in a historical perspective and not how we view eastern and western countries today."
"25:50 - I'm so sick of everyone misreading Hume's 'reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions' quote. He's saying reason can help you get your passions (desire), but it can't help you decide what your desires should be. E.g. if you want ice cream, reason can help you locate the closest ice cream shop but it can't tell you to want a salad instead. Only other desires can do that, like a long-term desire to be fit and healthy. He's NOT saying you can believe whatever makes you feel good."

"Cathy Newman doesn't work for the BBC. You're not very good an providing accurate information or objectivity."
"I agree that the 'Postmodern Neo-Marxist' expression is an empty signifier (as almost any expression, right? some Saussure, Derrida and Laclau to the rescue, please!) that tries to envelope a series of unclassifiable groups (that you smartly call 'modern left', you smart cookie! so many empty signifiers today!). But he smartly adds the prefix 'neo' to the adjective 'marxist', which means he's not referring to the initial all-encompassing Marxist theory, but to some reformed theory. And what would that be? Well a good start would be the Frankfurt school, a mixture of psychologists and sociologists that gave birth to strong and fruitful branches of post-modern philosophy (that are now intermingled with each other in a philosophical orgy). So this mixture of hegellian-marxist ideas with sociology and philosophy would come to get along pretty well with postmodern philosophy, since now we are not looking at one big international human fight of oppressed against oppressors, but a series of micro battle fields where power structures are challenged and power changes hands in a sort of dynamic equilibrium, once in a while gathering momentum to generate big power tensions that break through revolutions. All these said, now the term postmodern neo-marxist is not at odds, and you could even see how a postmodern hero (Foucault) could be comfortable within this framework of a diluted class struggle (seen as a series of power relations in dynamic equilibrium were everyone wants to have the hegemony on some particular issue). With the caveat, of course, that when you break down the class struggle to a million little-oppressed-classes with their nemesis you lose the teleological aspect of the original marxism (that some neo-marxist wanted to keep, but inevitably would eventually fall): there is NO clear horizon of history, just a random and changeable direction of a particular moment in history that beats at the rhythm of an infinite number of simultaneous class struggles of the time. And this would be even more relatable to a Foucault or a postmodern philosopher. So in fact, it is not that bad a signifier in his usage of the term because it could include postmodern thinkers, but also other micro-oppressed groups of this alleged or real multi-front class war (for instance, SJWs or gender equality right defenders, or feminists, or any group of people fighting the fight for these new postmodern values that de-class the old modern classes or even make a case for diversity). Having this said, the 2nd part of the video is impeccable!"
"Great deconstruction of Peterson, postmodernism and Marxism."

"The left agenda has very real implications and is in fact ruining the social cohesion. More crime, more alienation etc. The censoring part is also starting to get out of hand. 'social justice' is a bad idea and should have been abandoned long ago. And this is coming form a person leaning very much to the left."
"ᵈ ᵃ ᵈ ᵈ ʸ"
"This is very very good, and funny, and whitty and makes me think and think again. I like all the layers under the layers in your debunking Peterson. For what it's worth, I don't think Peterson is confusing the audience (me anyhow) deliberately, as a clever debating strategy. It's just that he has been thinking a lot about life and finding meaning in something that inheretingly (evolution theory) has none of its own. He found his own solution, I think, in a combination of Jungian psychology and a kind of liberal kapitalism, as far as I understand his verbiage anyhow. That he is very often defining complex concepts in a very  ideosyncratical way makes it not easy for even a bright guy as Sam Harris to have a real confrontation of ideas with him.   It is very interesting though that Jordan Peterson apparently touches with all these vague almost hypnotic forms of showing his many opinions so many people in the heart, or should I say the heart of their need for meaning, a reason to live for. This points to a disturbing emptiness in the lives of post-(joke ;-))modern western society. When you say that you don't need meaning as much as Peterson implies to be a prerequisite for a good life I have my doubts about the honesty of your position. Maybe you are so busy countering Peterson that you become in this respect an anti-typing of Peterson himself. Peterson would call that (Jungian) the Shadow, or something like that. Anyhow I fullheartedly subscribe onto your channel."
"This is how a proper response should be. I think Jordan Peterson would be impressed with this video, it shows that you're capable of forming a counterargument without throwing insults and hate speech at him. This is what society needs from the left and I think Jordan Peterson would also agree."
"I enjoy this video, the bath stuff was really funny.  I do feel that the further along you get in this video, the less you understand Peterson.  For example, the hierarchy discussion... Peterson's claim is that hierarchies exist and are going to exist, that's why he brings up the lobsters, to show it is an evolutionary thing, not socially constructed... he actually explains in the interview why he brought it up.  He goes on to claim, that we should push hierarchies toward COMPETENCY instead of POWER.  So a more competent person moves up the hierarchy, not just someone with more power.  The implication is then that things like intentionally hiring more people of category X move us away from the ideal of a hierarchy based solely on competency, and move toward power, which is a negative.      A lot of your critiques on his use of post modern neo marxism I feel is justified, as I have listened to him a lot and realize i have no idea what it means.  But that isn't really a dispute of his actual beliefs in the negative effects of the things he points out that belong in his (seemingly made up) definition.  Your problem seems to be more with his definition than anything else.  I think you could change post modern neo marxism to 'the far left' and most of this video then misses the mark."
"Trans activism is Maoism? If a person asks you to treat them with respect he's suddenly on a quest to destroy western civilization? Just how did we end up here?   BTW you're awesome, this feels like a short movie, really great quality."

"i`m in love"
"I think you are missing the point that DJP has studied many totalitarian historical events and why and how they happened and he sees some of the same signs that have led to the soviet union and the gulags and the events that led up to the Holocaust. I have watched literally every single one of his lectures and podcasts. I feel a sense that he wants, like you said, the resurgence of the importance of the individual not the group. To quote the man, ' the thing that we got right in the west is that we put the individual first and I'm not willing to see that eroded. it's a mistake and it's not because of rights, it's because of responsibility. So the way out of the oppressive structure of history is through the maximum adoption of individual responsibility.' you can find this quote on his podcast with doctor Oz of all people. But I loved the video and I think it is refreshing to see an argument about him that isn't just name calling the entire time."
"I love you <3"
"This video has misconceptions"
"Psuedointellectualism at its finest 👌🏼😎👌🏼 Shame, i thought ContraPoints was gonna make an intellectually honest argument :("
"I can't help but think that part of the problem with trying to devote much energy to thinking about Jordan Peterson is that he's an intellectual lightweight; his ideas are vague, derivative, and so just not that interesting. Seriously, if you are genuinely interested in truth, reason, and knowledge go take a philosophy course."
"I love your videos. My friend now votes republican suddenly ever since she starting dating one (I gave her a long talk about how I’m worried for her, even thought it might be none of my business). Tonight she just called to catch up and she asks me what I am reading, I say frankfurt school writers and I share. And then she says, “Oh that’s cool. you know what you should read? Jordan Peterson...” omgosh"

"there is nothing wrong with jordan peterson... is what i used to say. the more and more i investigate about this, the more and more JBP seems to me like a fallable being with flaws and biases. i still respect him and i genuinely think he has good intentions. he does help a lot of people. it might be very simplistic, but i think it's important to state the obvious, beucause too many people take it for granted and it often gets forgotten. i really feel that JP's self help stuff is a pretty good antidote for young people (not just young men) to the anxiety and depression inducing modern world that is this polarized abomination. JP is a great introduction in intellectual conversation, but should certainly not be taken as a sole source of intellectual knowledge, which is specifically the mistake i've made in the first place. his political arguments are kind of deluded the more i think about it. i'm glad i've found this channel and this video, because that's one of peterson's rules : listen to other people as if they have something to teach you. this video has taught me a great deal so thanks! btw check out the channel rationality rules. that guy has great criticism of jordan peterson's religious arguments and i highly recommend it."

"I thought this was a very intelligent and funny response to Peterson. Subscribed"
"Peterson is the little boy's Oprah"
"It's worth mentioning that when you dissect everything someone has ever talked about it's easy to 'get lost in the sauce'. Think, if you answered every random question thrown at you for a year, in person, off the cuff... The primary changes JP pushes: Don't make laws for speech, regardless of the goal... And universities need a fix as they seem to not take contradicting points of view well lately... Many comments are along the lines of 'dunno wut he say', so just adding this bit.. Have a great day!"
"Peterson makes some good points, I have listened to quite a bit over the past months. That said, your video has some valid critiques (and is oddly compelling). Thanks, after all, 'the more you know'."
"Subscribed for this. The left's overall criticism of Peterson has been weak and has missed the point, which contributed to his rise among the right thanks to 'owning the libs mentality'. You provide something much more insightful and incisive."

"Funny how a confused individual has to dress up as anything but his original gender to make a point about a man who just doesnt want to abide by leftist gender pronoun demands."
"Peterson fan here, thanks for the informative, funny, and well-made video. I've been trying to see some of these issues from different perspectives, and this video has been very helpful."
"I honestly felt the same when i started hearing about him. I liked the basic premises of self help he described, and his addressing of some issues on the left, and the existing culture we live in, but I dislike a lot of his extrapolations he takes from these baseline problems (baseline being a sore representation). I like how he wants to address these greater issues, but when you get to his inner philosophy beyond the simple stuff, his ideas concern me, and are misleading. Sort of like how a cult indoctrinates its members with a sense of purpose, belonging and community, before you start feeding them the cool aide."
"This was incredibly strange and highly convincing."
"10/10 would die for you"
"'Why does everybody think identity politics is postmodern?'  You actually said the reason why, because of how one of the most popular postmodern ideas is that the world is nothing more than a power struggle that is constantly shifting. Can you not see how marxism is analogous with that idea? The bourgeoisie being the people in power who keep all the wealth, and the working class being the oppressed masses just being kept in their place by capitalism. Which is bullshit because it is ignorant of concepts like the Pareto principle. You know capitalism is working when the majority of wealth is owned by the elite minority. Because it means the exceptional people who contribute the most to society are the ones who are going to the top. If the wealth is more or less equally distributed then roughly 80/20 it would mean that competence isn't what's earning people money, and things need to change. More equal meaning people are being given chances they don't deserve, and less equal meaning corruption amongst the elite is happening. This principle applies to anything that produces something. Capitalism is meant to incentivise and maximise contribution to society from those that are able to do so, marxism wants that to happen, but does not incentivise it. Why the fuck should people who can carry their weight, but don't, get a free ride? But more importantly, why should I bother to pull my weight fully if I won't be rewarded more for it? Anyway, that is what connects identity politics, marxism and postmodernism. The mixture of seemingly conflicting ideas IS EXACTLY WHAT POSTMODERNISM IS. The denial of absolute truth, and a patchwork quilt of ideas with a complete lack of cohesion. You can see this in postmodern art and design, you can see it in postmodern architecture, and you can see it in postmodern philosophy. You're right, postmodernism doesn't stand for much, because it basically means 'whatever you feel is right, is right', perhaps that's a gross over generalisation, but it's not too far from the truth either. Some of that school of thought has merit. Like the assertion that people have different experiences and so see the world differently, and that multiple perspectives can be and generally are very useful. You are choosing to focus on one element of postmodernism, and Jordan Peterson is doing the same. What makes what you're doing so different to what you are saying he is doing?  The difference as far as I can see is that Jordan Peterson is talking about one of the most influential postmodern thinkers whose ideas are actually related to the current political conversations that are being had. Social justice, political correctness, and so by extension identity politics. Michel Foucault's ideas do have an influence here, even if you are making the assertion that they may be bastardised.  Within every group of thinkers, there are smaller sub-groups of differing thought, and it goes right down to the individuals themselves. (Which is one of Jordan Peterson's ideas.) He argues with specific ideas that are within post-modernism, as well as marxism with a new twist (hence neomarxism). He is talking about a group of people with similar ideas, and given them a label that appropriately describes them. They are often very hypocritical people anyway, so it would be appropriate for the label to contain a hint of hypocrisy even if I did agree with what you are saying. He is NOT talking about all of the left as a whole. He is talking about a subset of the far-left (and he almost always says far left) He is a liberal (he describes himself as a 'classical British liberal' specifically), I am a liberal also. I don't like the social justice PC movement. I think it is precisely anti liberal. So does Jordan Peterson. That is why I agree with him politically. But I mainly like him for his ideas on responsibility and meaning. You may say that this is simple shit that everybody should know, well yeah, the beauty of it is that it's something you instinctively just know is right. But it really _doesn't_ get talked about enough. Instead you just hear people banging on about rights all the time. They are important, don't get me wrong, but your rights are my responsibility and vice versa. Because you don't have the right if I and everybody else don't accept the responsibility in some way. Be it how I treat you as a person, or the taxes I pay that fund the systems you may or may not indulge in. Rights also aren't what give you happiness and meaning in life. Which is why the constant talk of rights but not responsibility has led to a generation of people feeling lost, depressed and anxious.   Also, I can't believe you spent 30 minutes to basically just say 'postmodern neomarxism isn't a real thing and it's dumb'. Even if that _is_ the case, that's pedantic as fuck. Argue with his point, not the words he used to make the point."

I believe that if we could get Jordan into that tub with you, he'd come around.  Sending this to all my friends that are Jordan Peterson fan-boys"
"Peterson gets misrepresented alot because people aren't familiar with that level of discussion.  People analyzing him make so many mistakes, like trying to match up a statistical fact directly to a specific individual, or confusing thought experiments with advocacy of a position, or misunderstanding the reasons for being brutally honest about what is true (i.e. practically everybody thinks that Peterson wants things to be the true way that they are, when he's actually trying to get people to understand how things are more accurately so that they could take effective action to actually make the societal improvements that they want)  I don't really have a horse in this race, but it's pretty fun to watch him argue against dumb ideas.  Reminds me of 2008 Richard Dawkins slam-dunking on religious weirdos that wanted to prevent schools from teaching evolution.  It's like intellectual boxing matches to determine the next 5-10 years of our culture"
"You're amazing contra points and you saved me from being just another angry white guy who doesn't understand the nuance of social issues!"
"Hello, I really like your videos so far after just discovering your account. I will say though that the one point of contention I have with both you and Peterson is your statement regarding the college experience. I didn’t get a classic “liberal arts” undergrad degree but I didn’t ever experience this heavy handed brainwashing that capitalism and patriarchy is the root of all evil, and my degree was on sustainability, where most of the professors were old hippies. I guess maybe that is the message of some professors and even entire majors, but I see this as a straw man used to say academia as a whole is a leftist cult. I don’t know, could just be my perception, but I feel like most people don’t actually experience that overall message during a 4 year degree."

My father-in-law loves Peterson, and I can't spend enough time listening to his stuff long enough to build a solid argument about why he's wrong, aside from knowing that every single thing he says is surface level truthiness, but every expert in the fields he talks about pretty much says he's wrong.  Also, love the closing music."
"I heard this video gives some interesting critique to Jordan Peterson. Could you please do another 5 min Video about him without all the comedic clutter? I'm not a native speaker and I just can't follow your points because of that."
"Stilistisch interessant. Mir aber zu Barock"
"A great clarification of where at least I stand regarding hierarchies is that I don't have a problem with hierarchies. I have a problem with non-consensual hierarchies among adult human beings. That would include hierarchies that are implicitly non-consensual though on the surface they might be considered consensual--when we ignore that such hierarchies are 'chosen' by participants who face social, economic or other consequences for not consenting. If we never entered into hierarchical agreements, a lot of things wouldn't get done, so its only natural that we agree to let the most appropriate person lead. We enter such agreements because they're mutually beneficial to those involved. Even the exception I make, that of the parent/guardian and child relationship is mutually beneficial, at least ideally. If parents fail their end of the bargain, the children may obey out of fear, but eventually they discover they've been failed---or they don't because they break themselves in their inability to handle the resultant trauma. A feature of consensual hierarchy is that every participant recognizes the hierarchy as a means to an end. It's a way to get a job done. When participants become dependent on the hierarchy as a matter of personal identity, then we've got issues, and the hierarchy can no longer remain consensual for long, unless somebody is willing to do some work on themselves and disentangle the identity and the hierarchy."

"Nailed it. Peterson is another in a long line apologists for selfishness. Or shellfishness in his case."
"Brilliant work articulating the subtle things that make me uneasy about JP. Thank you.   Also, a minor but important thing: he doesn't say that liberals are *trying* to destabilize civilization; he says that that *might happen despite* their genuinely noble intentions. Yeah, he sounds weirdly angry when he says it-- and sometimes makes sweeping statements about 'them'-- but he repeatedly acknowledges the humane impulses behind much of their ideas and behaviors."
"I hope that when Jordan Peterson talks from now kn he sounds exactly like he did in your bathroom"
"25:10 Requesting a pronoun is not forbidden and JP is not against it. He is against the idea that it should be illegal to say the wrong pronoun."

"WhAt ArE YoU, SomE KiNd of EnLigHtenD cEntrIst??1!?!1  all jokes aside, i'm halfway through the video, and i enjoy the somewhat neutral stance you're approaching the subject with. Your videos are really well done and it seems like you really have a solid grip on what you're talking about. That being said, I am a pretty big fan of JP and your characterization of 'post-modern Neo-marxist' as being sort of oxymoron-ish is kind of the point. Peterson's biggest point is that Marxism is inherently untenable with society and human nature as a whole, so many Marxists will simply draw upon Postmodern theory to prop up their arguments when they fall short. The same goes with postmodernists drawing upon marxist theory as well, although not as much IMO. I also disagree strongly with your definition of identity politics, and Peterson admits that identity politics is NOT strictly postmodern, or a 'left' thing. All the white supremacists and alt-right folks base their entire 'political theory' on identity politics.  Yes, I'm a fan of JP, his ideas have really helped me think about the way things are going in the world and i am 'right leaning,' but he's not a god. It does bother me when I see people idolizing the guy, and taking everything he says for solid fact.  You should see if you can get on the Rogan podcast or maybe on Dave Rubin with or without Peterson (yeah i know I sound like a fanboy, I kind of am). There are a lot of people out there that would love to hear your opinion. You seem like a really smart person and you have a solid following online. Great work!!"
"I love Peterson because i view him as, like you said, some kind of life coach, and i in fact am a confused young male who needs a daddy :( The problem with Peterson is that he never offers solution, therefore is useless as a politician. Thats what everyone (including he himself) gets wrong. He is not one. He is a pshychologist, not a politician. He “just” explains stuff, helps us understand the world a little more. The problem is when he starts acting like a politician, altough he is treated like that or at least held responsible by some crazy interviewers too, so its kinda complicated. Anyways, i loved your video and im nearly dying of laughter when i picture how uncomfortable would it be for JP to watch through that bathtub scene :D"

"The right don't all disagree with social and economic progress for disempowered or poor people. Some disagree that state-sponsored intervention can do this consistently and successfully and without stepping on those people's liberty. You might want to watch some of Deidre McClosky. To argue that people who are against welfare policies for the poor are also for keeping people poor is to argue in bad faith. Some people, myself included, think that welfare policies perpetuate poverty in the long run and because we are  concerned to bring people out of poverty, we want to get rid of things that create poverty. This means for me a balancing act between reducing state welfare policies while at the same time not creating short-term suffering for those people already on welfare programs. Its a difficult and long-term goal. This is why I don't like many on the right who think we can just get rid of it all right now, and be damned with the poor. That would create way too much suffering."
"If something is a social construct then it exists, but it also means that its infinitely-malleable. Postmodernism is about finding where discourse empowers people and then showing that the power is constructed and is not natural or necessary., showing that there is no central logos, no binaries. Its a contradiction to say that something was socially constructed and that it doesn't exist."
"As an atheist convert, I got myself sucked into a liberal echo chamber. To escape, I watched a shit ton of Gavin Mcinnes and Ben Shapiro and went to the other extreme.

"When my leftwing sister sent this YT video link to me and asked i watched the whole thing as a christmas present i assumed this was going to be another insane left wing person dancing around JP's statements while screeching 'NAZI!' and 'Sexist pig!'  I dont agree with a lot of JP's ideas especially when he goes on tangents about fields of study he has no qualifications on such as economics and philosophy,not everything you disagree with is a Marxist trap. However i agree with his stance on free speech,i shouldn't have to call someone a pronoune by threat of imprisonment any more than a poor person shouldn't have to call a rich person 'Sir' or 'My ledge', if society changes what's acceptable  to address someone as then society should enforce it not the gov./military/police. I.E. if i call a person 'he' and they ask to be called 'she' and i say 'no thanks dude' and that person is my waiter (for instance) then you probably know exactly how that will end for me. That is how speech should be policed.  I'm 4 minutes in and i can already tell that this video was made by an adult, thank you for that. Also i rather like your style,you might just have a new sub!"
"IdPol is still cancerously idealistic."
"So Jordan Peterson has always been someone I find difficult to listen to because I am not Christian and I think the use of religious iconography always weakens an argument BUT I do think when you get down to real issues, his defense of the individual over the collective is where so much defense comes from. Parsing people into groups based on intersectional lines exists to some extent in both Marxist and postmodern doctrines. I view myself as libertarian and anti SJW because I believe in myself as an individual, I believe I have value for being what I am and don't believe its right to be placed in the shackles of the patriarchy. Just like I don't think you should be viewed as only a trans person, there is more to you than that, you're an individual and thats really the core of the two ideals. Collectivism in all its forms can be defined as evil, in this he is correct."
"Informative and funny.   Youththththts!"
"I believe that post-modern Neo-Marxism was his attempt to categorise this group of extreme leftists that genuinely do hate men, particularly white men and wish to enforce through legislation their version of a new world order. However, I think the problem is that these individuals are angry extremists that don't all agree on one set of ideas or philosophy. The only thing that binds them is their hatred of white men and desire for authoritarianism. So it's difficult to label them."
"I wish Jordan Peterson had more interviews with people like you. He has some good points and some bad ones, but he only gets into intellectual fist fights with people half his weight. This shit was on point, I’d love to see you two talk."

"you well articulated how even  a person with good intentions can unknowingly cause rabid extremists to feel like their cause is validated.  JP and pewdiepie, both imo are good people. Their views are rational and I'd say almost left leaning. However their mockery of the crazy intolerant extreme left seems to attract the equally extreme right and those idiots associate jp/pew as one among them. This is the reason pewdiepie's comments section can be so toxic, and he rightfully called them out in one of his recent videos.  BTW what I didn't like was how you kept referring to yourself as left and him as right. I do not believe a person's beliefs can be simply binary between left and right, unless they are in the very extreme"
"you're a pretty smart dude"
"ok natalie"
"“Postmodernism” originated in architecture, as a style that emphasized a contradiction to modernism, and reignited a revival of classical architecture in a contemporary interpretation.  Basically the exact opposite way Jordan Peterson describes it."
"'I think a lot of ppl like listening to JP talk about the western tradition but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.' Alright, and to be fair to the JP fans that's probably b/c some of it's difficult to read ('inaccessible') it's like Shakespeare, so dense and hard to understand that you could really only absorb it under the guidance of a college class and nowadays classes fucking cost money. I'm assuming, the reading level could vary. That just makes JP even more angering, he's mental poison when he should be an actual educator."
"Thank you!  I think..."
"Reading the comments here vs reading the comments on JP's own videos is very eye-opening. Here, there is no discussion, only ridicule. No evidence, only funny one-liners. It feels as if what JP says is a bit misrepresented here than in those discussions...  Just to clarify, I myself do not agree with him on some things, and totally agree with this video on some criticism, the point is that JP seems to radiate good intellectual discussions."
"I came to this video in a defensive crouch.  I was totally prepared to hate it, but I have to say that this was a much more nuanced and level-headed take than I was expecting.  I found some genuine food for thought.  Plus you're quite funny.  So props, I guess."
"I thought that mannequin was a *rEaL gUy*"
"I don't think he at any point has said he believes that postmodernists/neo-marxists are out to destroy the west. I believe his argument is that they do it from a place of compassion, but that the compassion & effort is misguided. Considering this seems to be the crux of your argument, maybe you need to listen to more and re-evaluate your argument. Good video though. It's nice seeing someone trying to deconstruct an argument, rather than just getting angry and insulting people."

"Very stupid arguments. Circling around what is true definition of modernism, postmodernism. What is considered western and look! this ideas which considered non-western come from the west geographically! OMG I Win argument! It is very stupid. This doesn't contradicts any idea. It contradicts only some definition. And discussion is not about definitions."
"What natural hierarchies are in humans?"
"Nietzsche influenced Nazism, but his philosophy wasn't compatible with Nazism. There have been numerous examples of philosophies being misused to fit political agendas. Postmodernism is uniquely incoherent as a unified worldview, as there are plenty of disagreements within it, but one thing stands out - the necessity to eliminate grand narratives leads to a fundamental dissolution of boundaries. Of course, there are many differing factions within the left which represent different sides of the postmodern-Marxist (dare I say) spectrum, and you're correct in saying Peterson doesn't employ enough nuance to identify them separately and correctly, however, when the fundamental philosophical dissolution of boundaries which postmodernism engages in becomes politicised, it leads to a void and vapid idea of equality. That idea can be, and often is, codified in Marxist terms. It's much like the argument from tolerance in moral relativism - we should be tolerant towards other cultures because morality is relative (while assuming tolerance is a universal moral virtue). The history of ideas is rife with ideas feeding off the worst of each other, although they fundamentally contradict each other."

"degenerate"
"I’ve never really understood why we Villainize capitalism. I understand that capitalism gives advantage to the wealthy and leaves the poor to suffer under the oppression of the wealthy, but capitalism allows for growth and change of social position. Marxism, and all of the governmental variations of it, are all naturally oppressive, something that they are meant to stop. The only reason people become equal in these regimes is because everyone is poor and starving.       My own political stance is generally very confused because both the left and right are so incredibly consumed with opposition that neither seem to have any focus on further development of the construct of modern society. When the election becomes more of a big joke than any true display of political intelligence or general regard for the well being-of the the general people, is it then a useless system that simply cycles an endless shitstorm of confusion. Why are we so consumed by opposition! Why can’t we just agree as a species?"

"Repeating back to him and expecting him to explain his shit doesn't make leftists afraid to confront his ideas. Leftists DO acknowledge and honestly confront his ideas, Peterson fans just decide they don't like the tone leftists take ('stop being so emotional') and use that to claim victory in the argument instead of continuing the conversation. 'Or does he? It's hard to tell what he thinks' YEAH, that's probably what I hate most about him and ppl like him, they say shit and they try not to own it so they can accuse you of putting words in their mouths."

"https://youtu.be/4LqZdkkBDas?t=1369 Yes - this is a conservative argument - simple or even obscure, hierarchies are inevitable, so _be careful with meddling especially in a revolutionary way_  the one You have to cope with today could be a better one that the one You think You will build on the charred remains of the today. Please note that Peterson is kind of patriarchy denier. He his opinion the dominant hierarchy in the Western world is a hierarchy of competence. I agree."
"https://youtu.be/4LqZdkkBDas?t=1258 Yeah, that is another problem with reasoning with the left - there has to be an innuendo, with a 'should' taste to it. Or can it be only stating the fact that those biological differences will preserve some cultural situations and no social engineering can change that? Eg. man are more equipped to be violent offenders so to the end of time there will be more man in prison than woman?"
"https://youtu.be/4LqZdkkBDas?t=1217 The main reason to put You all sweet degenerates ;) into one basket is the fact that left want to impose change on society by the use of law without reaching the public consensus. And yes - this is what Stalin would do."
"https://youtu.be/4LqZdkkBDas?t=1027 Well - what (mainly) marxism and postmodernism have in common is: essence of man is an ensemble of social relations (Six Thesis on Feuerbach) and postmodernists - being suspicious about language - are still social constructivists in stating that things could be different if we were using different language. Jordan Peterson in his use of Biblical stories suggest that it is not the case. He is a positivist like Marx but still opposes his big project as a fantasy. Postmodernists claim that they do not have a big project but are they entirely politically un-biased (as they should be if they want to preserve they 'ironic' approach)? I don't think so. And they do seem to treat philosophical constructs like they had the same error hidden inside them - sometimes Being or God and sometimes the concept of (t/T)ruth. It is interesting that contemporary left thinkers are at the same time lacanists and marxists (Zizek). You should notice that conservatives like myself think this is mainly because they let themselves be driven by emotions and not a firm grip of reality. XD Please grill me now ;) xoxo"

In fact he spoke about Marx with regard because Marx himself uttered antisemitc things and of course didn't like tose jewish bankers.  Contra Points try not to use straw man arguments.  Love Your ironic style, but Your argument can be efficient without attributing a swastika to  resentment for cultural marxism. Remember: being progressive is not axiomatically good. It is just an attitude toward reality and change. Please understand that people who see themselves as conservatives may be derive their postition from a moral stand as progressives do."

"Hey, I love your vids and I am working on some content about Jordan Peterson who it seems has totally stolen Anders Breivik's (the neo Nazi terrorist) theory of repackaged cultural Marxism and re repackaged it."
"This is actually pretty serious. Jordan is pushing an ideology full of beliefs about Marxism based on a radicalized ideology, making his one also. I am working on becoming a counter terrorist and that is how I ran across the not-so-mere coincidences in the claims both men make. There are uncanny resemblances all over Jordan's public talks to Breivik's 'theory' which I am including in the label 'ideology'. Jordan is posturing postmodern neo Marxism as simply an intellectual theory."
"It is literally a conspiracy theory originally contrived by a terrorist."
"There are even two different assertions Jordan makes in his Prager U video that are on the same page of the Breivik manifesto. One of them Breivik credits to Judge Robert Bork, but Jordan appears to just be ripping it off, and it definitely belongs to Bork."
"I don't want you to be scared to talk about this. Resilience is necessary for people to deal with terror but in this situation we have to disenthrall people from  his ideology for what it is unapologetically."
"Jordan wants to give the appearance that his theory is based at least roughly on his research, Maps of Meaning."
"The problem with this is well, he's full of shit."
"The counterterrorism community would really love for his claims to be realistic, but they aren't. And there is no formula for figuring out what makes an individual become radical, radicalized, a violent extremist, or a terrorist. The community recognizes political (violent) extremism can be state issued legally or illegally. And that is really the fatal flaw in Jordan's supposition; that we aren't currently living in a state of looking the other way for a violent State, but that the Marxists, if they are allowed any power, will create such an environment."
"He wants to believe that extremist rhetoric and radicalized ideology are psychologically structured to some degree rather than socially constructed, but so is literally everything people have ever culturally done, and it doesn't work like a probable set where if there are some of one type the rest must be the other if there are only two types of members."
"There are several other issues."
"He became fascinated with the Nazis at some point in his early to mid career. Yet he thinks he is studying them via psychological methods which he never did. He has never interviewed any Nazis for his research or conducted any experiments with them."
"I think he has spent a large part of the majority of his career trying to relate to Nazis."
"I know this is like a punch in the gut."
"But Jordan must be stopped."
"I don't have a popular channel or Twitter."

"Her voice sounds like Jordan Peterson when he speaks. Uncanny!"
"While this person's explanation is not as stupid as an average anti-Peterson BS, she still did not get it. First, she assumes that Peterson believes that the 'left' is run by a coherent philosophy, whereas he clearly states that it's run by mindless ideology that only masquerades as a coherent school of thought. The insidious nature of this ideology is not in its logical consistency, but in its eclectic and intellectual employment of the ideas on the one hand, and its propensity to use authority to impose its worldview and destroy its opposition. Second, the term Marxist postmodernism, albeit not my personal favorite, describes the merge of the Marxist idea of the history being a product of the conflict between the have and the have-nots and the society being the mechanism of the control over of the former over the latter on the one hand and the postmodern skepticism of the Western (modern) basis for our civilization on the other."
"I love you, CP. But, I'm pretty sure you know what JP means when he conflates 'Postmodernism' with 'Marxism' - (& thank you for dating the 'birth' of 'Postmodernism' at 1945 - and not at 1966 with Venturi's 'Complexity & Contradiction in Architecture' etc. - whatever -- PM is always being dated in the 60s or 80s - personally, I choose to date it to the Summer of 1886 when Nietzsche wrote in his notebook that 'there are no facts, only interpretations' - that is a choice, I'm sure we can take it as far back as Heraclitus & his river ) ------ but JP admits that he does not know what 'Postmodernism' is - he traces it back to OUR (America's) appropriation of Derrida, Foucault, & Lacan  - and how the academic terrain has been flattened for the purpose of equalizing education -- the doctrine is that all information is equally valuable (horizontal), and that a hierarchy (of any kind) is an operation of bias (vertical). This is what JP means -- 'Postmodernism' fractalizes information, & 'marxism' distributes it 'equally' - one is material, and one is mechanical."
"Thanks to you now I know I’m a postmodernist xD"
"Oh my god, I love your videos!  I'm a fan of Peterson, but I reconsider a lot of things that I blindly believed while watching this video.  I can't say that I've changed some of my perspectives, but this video brought some portions of critical thinking to my plate.  Thank you a lot for what you're doing!"
"Ha! I am now subscribed to you and Peterson. The YouTube algorithm doesn't seem to take it well, it started recommending Tetris videos. #popthefilterbubble"
"That girl really put me off my stride after watching a lot of well-behaved, suited up guys like Peterson, Sam Harris etc... Such a different world :D In my opinion, the most important thing about Peterson (and the reason I like him) is his ultimate commitment to the validity of scientific insight in any debate about facts. Anyone who does not agree with that is an ideologist and therefore should be ignored, this cannot be put up for debate. That does not mean that Peterson is right in everything he says (the Judeo-Christian value thing is particularly laughable, hail the slave traders...) and I as an agnostic German social democrat am politically and philosophically not particularly close to Peterson. But he always was the voice of reason against the radical types she also criticised at the beginning, to see a calm rebuttal of these extremists by someone on the left lifts my spirits. I thought my rational, beautiful left was disintegrating because of these idiots. Keep up the voice of reason, it is badly needed. Still, I think identity politics is a bad idea and we should try to work together and ignore race, gender etc. instead of staking up hatred against white males oppressing people. Not least because I am a white male, we're really not so bad ;) Best from Germany!"
"And all you need to take on Peterson's shite is to read Marx, cos he sure as hell hasnt."
"The European Left do talk about the meaning of life and Plato etc. its the North American 'left'(centrist liberals) who have issues with talking about anything outside of fucking identity politics."
"If cultural Marxism is just a conspiracy theory what the hell was the Frankfurt school. Just cuz a similar term was used in nazi germany it was referring to quite different things. Cultural bolshevism was referring to jewish intellectuals trying to destroy western civilization. Cultural marxism of the Frankfurt school variant was an attempt to reach a balance between communism and capitalism. They used marxists theories of oppression and expanded that to race, gender, sexual orientation and other identities. It has devolved over the years into more than asking for equal rights. Political correctness, third wave feminism and the modern left's enshrinement of sexual body dismorphia. And one last thing everyone hates to agree with the nazis but there were right about one single thing, marxism is bad."
"U mention how the left mischaracterize peterson but right b4 that u say he thinks protectings trans people leads to stalinism. No some people dont believe in mandated speech, for it is a form of tyranny by itself."
"I love you lady!"
"You don't care. Or you do care and you pretend not to.   Makes it hard to take you seriously."
"12:24 “I’m gonna divide Modernism into two periods because I feel like it.” Brilliant. <3"
"Hello, fist of all, love your stuff Contrapoints. I think you're awesome. Howeverr, i felt the sentence at the start about JP 'sounding the alarm against protecting transgender people' was way too vague and unspecific and to be honest it seemed like a deliberate strawman. Specifically, he raised alarm about the legal enforcement of certain pronouns. i feel there's a big difference! and being unspecific and using strawmans only weakens the overall argument. x"

"Wow... This is just the second video I watched from you and I am just speechless. You are such a well-spoken and well-read person and I can't... The amount of knowledge in this video satisfied me for a whole year. Thank you for making content that is so engaging and entertaining yet informative and educational. You're an amazing role model for a young gal like me!"
"Haven’t “Marxists” (aka The Proletariat) always been the bogeypeople of the wealthy and elite? I mean isn’t anyone who decides to own their own “capital” be it intellectual, spiritual, political and material the enemy of those who seek to exercise some form of control over their own existence. How is JP different from any other authoritarian?"
"Alfons Mucha ❤"
"lol too weird"
"'I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves.'  Cue the ridiculous mood music!!"
"Cathy newman had two choices, to either argue against the obviously true or guess what he meant? What is she a functionally retarded 12 year old? She can't ask probative questions or ask that he clarify what something means in a practical sense? She can't use an example like 'so when we say women are X percentage of tech engineers, and you say there are biological differences, what are you actually implying is happening?'. No, she has an impossible choice where she has to argue for whats demonstrably false, or assert intentions he never espoused. Nice critique btw."
"The bit where u get sexual with Peterson makes me uncomfortable"
"Blown away."
"My brother got me his book...I don’t know what to feel"
"Bunch of freaks. LMAO Peterson is completely right. Hedonistic BS is going to fuck you up... Apologies... It already did LOL"
"So... about that milk fetish thing?  Edit: omg yes bi nails are best nails"
"You are such an extremely talented filmmaker, content creator, and artist! You are reinventing digital media and you are not given enough credit. Just wanted to stop by and share my admiration <3"
"Yes, people should be able to be referred to however they wish. That's very progressive and individualistic. But for that to be compelled by law? That's the entire point. It's pernicious."
"Great deconstruction on postmodernism. From what I've seen and read, Peterson hasn't attempted to justify hierarchies of sorts, but claimed them as a necessary consequence of aiming for anything in life. It's more of an observation. A somewhat liberal answer to this is equality of outcome... But that fixes one problem and creates another."
"Lost it when you did the pcp bit.   Too good"
"Natalie, you are wonderful, beautiful and so inspiring. please make more of these longer videos. I love everything about this direction, so high quality, entertaining, and compelling. <3"
"About a year or two ago I watched his multi-part series thing all about Pinocchio. At the time, I thought it was pretty interesting. Then I forgot who did it, remembering only that he was some Canadian professor. Then I started seeing all the crazy stuff he was saying, and didn't connect that it was the same guy. I thought he made some pretty good points about Pinocchio. He should stick to stuff like that."
"I am *obsessed* with you"
"Post modern neo marxism is applied through the idea that there are oppressed minority groups (workers) rather than class warfare. All your nonsensical jumbled explanations while very detail oriented and a good historical lesson misses the point entirely. It's almost as though you don't understand what you're talking about."
"I liked​ the video BUT you didn't mention that his complain wasn't about not using to use the pronoun  trans wanted, it's that Canada's government made it mandatory, and the complain is that government shouldn't​ ban language"
"It was a channel 4 interview with cathy newman, not bbc"
"Also, his biology is wrong. Interspecific competition is quite rare in nature.  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160512100708.htm  Oh, and Peterson is totally a fascist. He's racist, right wing, and authoritarian. That's all it takes..."
"Whatever you say, William."
"This is so so sooo good. I need you in an interview with him."
"Honestly? Slay (lobster) Queen!!"
"Oh, this gunna be good. Also, congrats on the +1 million views!"
"Based and redpilled"
"As a Neosoy Cuckcist Lobstertarian I must protest this! Daddy Peterson is being horrifically misrepresented."
"You talk just too fast for 2x speed to be comfortable but still slow enough that I can't comfortably watch at 1x speed. Damn you for making me split the difference at 1.5x like a pussy."
"You should tell the post-modernist Marxists that they shouldn't exist then,  not those who observe them. Paradoxical relationships happen all the time."
"Fantastic video. Peterson could learn a lot from you, both in and out of the bathtub."
"Omg, thank you so much.  I've been completely bewildered by the inadequate definitions of post-modernism and neo-marxism and everything else that I couldn't even follow the nonsense people spout most times.  This helped a lot."
"love JP, read his books. He thinks deep, it takes time to understand him"
"I feel like the only young people who don't like capitalism just didn't do stem in college and can't get a job. That includes philosophy ahem."
"Even a college freshman could argue against his lobster analogy.  Parallel evolution is how two widely different species can come across the same “solution” to an environmental selector.  Neither necessitate such a solution under their specific circumstances.    An example of such is the physical “eye.”.   And they are organized (on a cellular level) and express themselves in widely different manners across species."
"I'm a self confessed depressed and stupid loser who sees some damn good advice in Peterson. I would have liked to watch this whole video and hear how exactly you disagree with his political views. But your over reliance on gross out sexual and drug use humor has repulsed me. I just thought I'd let you know it's a little too over the top for some viewers, and the sudden switches back and forth from bits to serious points is quite jarring. For once it seems a 'leftist' (if I am getting the right impression of you) can have a discussion without screeching, but this time it is soaked in smugness and debauchery."
"i came here to watch a video about jordan peterson but i was interrupted by 5 minutes of dennis prager explaining to me why saying happy holidays is comparable to armed warfare against america"
"...but complaining about patriarchies and oppression rather evidently is the purpose of your life, does that make you one of those white men you alluded to?"
"I come here for opposing opinions  but woooo boy This comment section is a war zone of people so painfully wrong on both fucking sides"
"This is a good channel. I needed to know that people disliked the right, as I do."
"It would be interesting to see Dave begrudgingly have to entertain viewpoints he's been intentionally silencing, muting, blocking..."
"Fail. If you had done the most cursory research you would have seen this lecture where Peterson explains why he uses the terms 'Neo-Marxist' and 'Post Modernist. Your criticism of him is debunked  in the first 2 minutes. Next. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flNuf9gQkgY"
"7:45 jordan peterson is a fuck but I don't think you really understood Dostoevsky or Camus"
"vsauce?"
"Nothing to do with the subject, but watching your vids makes me realize how empowering self-deprecative humor can be. X)"
"I know you probably caught it, but Peterson's argument that 'there will always be continuity between animal and human hierarchies' is meaningless. As humans obviously *are* animals, any sort of action or institution undertaken by us is contiguous with anything another animal does. There's no insight or capital T Truth in Peterson's statement. I don't really know anything about the guy, but I can't help but think how dumb he sounds."
"the fact that your 'type' is Jordan Peterson is making me unsubscribe rn..."
"You’re intelligent, funny, beautiful and with a good taste for set design. My school is broke just like me, but I wish that one day you’ll be giving a lecture at the critical studies lessons at my school. Or maybe just somewhere in the Netherlands, so I can enjoy this in real life. I want to drink and dance with you. I want you to talk for three hours straight and meet my boyfriend. I think he’ll fall in love with you, but that’ll be worth it. I know he would be happy."
"Hahahaha you crazy girl!"
"I'm dying to know what Peterson thought of this when he saw it..."
"This was fun.  A lot of your 'logic' is absolute dogshit and it's a tragedy that people are swayed by your 'arguments', but the delivery was very entertaining.  Cheers"
"Pretty sure it’s leftists trying to regulate speech. Yea that’s not fascist at all."
"off topic but if you want an awesome 18th century queen, Friedrich von Steuben. guy rolls up in a sleigh, wearing a massive fur coat with 2 twinks in toe, and two mini dogs. and didn't speak any English. and trains the american army in the revolutionary war. along with making them set up kitchens."
"This grossly misrepresented everything that Jordan Peterson has said and done. Just one minute and it's already lying. Jordan Peterson have said over and over again he's not against trans rights or trans protection he was protesting enforced speech."
"Very interesting and very aesthetical too. Thanks!"
"Is this is a transperson?"
"Great video, Queen! I am curious though, do you agree with the Canadian laws that Peterson criticises? I think you were being a little cheeky at the end by implying that Peterson has a problem with 'people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs', when his issue is clearly with those pronouns being enforced by the state. It's cheeky because if you'd watched a number of his videos and read some of his writings this distinction is obvious. I'm not a fan of many of his characterisations (not to mention his religious overtones) but compelled speech by the state is certainly a totalitarian impulse."
"te amo"
"Marx ism demands that the people control the means of production.  The rest of it is just jibber."

"Thank you for an amazing video! I feel so much more enlightened already. All praise ContraPoints!"
"First video of yours I've watched. Got yourself a new fan. A great synopsis and refutation of some of his more ridiculous claims."
"I'm beginning to think your smelling salts contains no ammonium carbonate."
"Loved that you aknowledged rorty instead of derrida when talking about posmodernism. I’m all for hating the french because why not, they are usually annoying. but while doing so we should try not to give them that much credit for anything in particular because you know, chovinism."
"Was that the stupid fucking playstation guy from IGN at the end?"
"Good video. I enjoyed it a lot. Can you do one about how people on the left like to characterize everyone who just wants to learn about complicated topics as 'conservative'? De-platforming and seemingly against open and honest debate. Are these just the radical left? I'm a liberal who has very little in common with conservatives but finds the screamy hard left as not something that will effectively improve the rights and understanding of transgender individuals."
"That PCP bit was gold lol I love you contra"
"I like the way you approach the problem with a refreshing calmness and with use of actual thought that's been processed to understand what's going on, not by screaming and showing your emotions all around, like most people criticizing JP do.  Props to you for that.  Now : Few things to add from what you said. 1. The title of the book '12 rules for life' is meant to emphase the fact that you need to practice it in order to have the fulfilling life you want. But they aren't rules that you are obliged to follow. I know the B16 law that's been passed in Canada, I've never heard any law's regarding Peterson's advice. He doesn't force people to 'follow his rules'. You can't make an analogy with the 12 advices from his book with a written law that might punish you if you don't obey. If it's a fair mistake, glad I could help. If not, you are manipulating your audience.  2. There are way more 'valid points' that you've accepted from his discussions, but I'm not going to list them here, unless you ask me to. By listening JP from interviews or lectures, you'll understand all the valid points he's actually making. 3. I agree with your point that people fighting for LGBT rights, gender equality, etc being targeted is bad. But a) You should blame people representing those groups saying utter bullshit for this. JP pointing out their fallacies is not something to blame. The backlash they might recieve comes from a population tired to deal with bullshit that people speaking in the name of  groups, races, ethnicities tend to publicly say. JP isn't the problem, he targets people with fallacies, not the group that's being represented. You are in the wrong when you say he aims everyone when he criticized the thought (that might be sahred with others) of one person he genuinely disagrees with. b) Pointing out fallacies from someone, indepedently of his appartenance of a minority or not is a good thing. We don't want to be in a society that's so scared to point out what's wrong that everyone is allowed to do whatever they want. Being part of a minority should not prevent you from being exposed when wrong or lying. 4. You can't take an entire population and say 'here's what they do'. Because not everyone from the left is in the same spectrum, there'are people with more extreme ideologies than others, and there are tons of different opinions (Hence 'left' or 'far left'). This is also the case for the right (Hence 'right or 'far right'). People are getting more and more offended by pretty much everything. It's become so natural that obviously people will take advantage from this and use the 'offended' word in order to get what they want, in order to screw around or 'take over' the power. 5. Daring to say 'it's rather a small rule' when you ask the entire population of the planet to change their usual language in order to fit your preference and your ideology is pure nonsense. I mean, how dare you pretend like it's no big deal ? You think something is wrong, you convince people it's wrong, you don't force people to accept it whether they agree or not. That's not how it works and it's purely evil to ask such a thing. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I've never seen atheist people doing movements to induce laws banning religion. Why ? Because what people think and judges to be right is non of your business. You know what ? There are people in this world that think trans person shouldn't be alive (I want to precise I'm not one of them). Some day they might come and forcefully create school made for trans people to modify them because those people think it's a disease that must be changes. It's just a small rule isn't it ? It touches less than 2% of the entire population. Would you agree then ? And if not, would it be a problem if, even though you don't agree, you're forced to accept it ? It's just wrong. Now it might be a little disproportionate compared to pronouns but it's basically the same. And what you rquire people to do include 100% of the population. Again, how dare you ? And for real, if having your own goddamn pronoun is what's gonna make you feel accepted in this world, you're just a fuckin moron and we shouldn't even pay attention to your cries. 6. It's not a bad thing to ask ourselves what's good and what's bad from our previous societies in order to progress. What's wrong is to pouint fingers at male, specially when they are young, and saying it's their fault if people like you are in a bad situation. It's not a consequences of the male dominating woman. It's a consequence of cooperation in a world very hard to live in, to survive. Good to point a problem and to propose solution. Very bad to point a certain group and saying everything is wrong because of them. And even worse, not proposing solutions, only complaining. 7.Identity politics is a way for politician to gain votes. It's not a good thing when it's used to divide good people of good will. Identity politics might be good when we use the identity of a group that wants the best (in possible means) for everyone. Now we know well that people form all groups vary and there isn't one single group or one single race that's all in for the best for everyone (in a possible way). So that's where identity group fails or is wrong. If we use identity politics to create a group of goodwill people, then it might actually work for the best. To bad human nature isn't of goodwill. 8. By saying we need to know what JP thinks, you're the sheep that needs a shepherd. I don't need to know anyone's background when I hear something I genuinely agree to. That's where your logic fails in my opinion. You wish you could put him into a specific category, yet you pretend your movement wants to take away those frontiers. Isn't that somehow hypocritical ? It's actually a good thing that he wants to not be pinned. Because that's where everyone can listen to him with as less as possible presumptions. 9. A lot of people do think hierarchies are a social construct made by man to enslave woman. Even people he's been talking with arguments this premise. So that leads me to believe you're not as informed as you pretend to be. Or you're so much biased that you fail to realize that people from 'your group' does not think exactly like you. And that all your perspective on a subject are agreed by this said group. It is a big mistake. A ton of people denies natural hierarchies, are you for real ? The hierarchies you talk are called corruption. And as far as I'm concerned every one except the ones that benefits from it would want to erase that. 10. I think it's quite funny you call his view childish because he says evil leftist are out to destroy the west. It's actually all the people getting offended over words and people thinking that men are out there waiting for you to be alone to destroy you by the means of patriarchal structure. I mean for christ's sake get your head out of your ass. And as we've seen he's 100% correct to say that there are dangers forcing people by law to use a certain language. There's no debate on that.   You obviously seem to live well with your disphoria which is awesome, and you seem like a cool person. But you can't force me into thinking you're not a man because you've decided you weren't one. You might feel like a woman. You might pretend like you are a woman. But you actually have no idea how a woman actually feels like. Because you are a man. And no woman could ever understand you, because no woman's ever been a man that feels like a woman. Yayyy you, you're special !!! And you'll always be a man, no matter how far medicine goes. You were born with XY chromosomes, you'll die with XY chromosomes. Might be harsh to grasp on, you might disagree, and that's okay, because no one forces you to accept it! But on the counterpart don't ask people to accept things they do not agree with :) All the best to you"

"Drinking game: take a shot every time you hear a straw man argument in this video"
"What do you call twisted, low IQ, poisonous,  treacherous filth,  attacking western society with a complete lack of understanding and a hundred straw-men.    Contrapoints, of course. A dumb SJW attacking a major Canadian intellectual...   TRAGIC. Go mutilate, corrupt and indoctrinate some more children Contra,  You are better at that."
"Thank you for not just painting Peterson as just the villain of the left or assuming that people only watch him because they are confused young males (the Peter Coffin approach). You weren't just trying to take him down be legitimately criticize and discuss his views."

"Dear ContraPoints,  This is the first video that I've watched from you, and I have to commend you on the insane amount of research you must have done to write the script, as well as for the humour that you managed to insert into such a serious video.  I have a few grips with your points, and I don't know whether you read the comment section, but if you do, I would like them cleared up or argued against.  First of all, you mentioned right at the beginning that Dr Peterson was fighting against something that would make the lives of transgender people easier. I assume that this was his opposition to Bill C-16? If so, then I would like you to clarify how exactly compelled speech would make lives of transgender people easier and/or better. Further, I know that this argument has been peddled too much, but I find that it is legitimate to say that compelling someone to address someone else by a specific pronoun, with threat of legal ramifications if they don't, to be stifling general freedom, and specifically freedom of speech and expression.   Secondly, you mentioned Identity Politics. I felt that your definition, or lack thereof, was dishonest. Identity Politics, as I view it, and as many other people view it as well, is the idea that a person's individual identity is less important or relevant than their shared group identity (whether or not they actively identify as said group). So, for instance, the idea that being white or black, straight or gay, etc. should automatically align you ideologically, or otherwise group you, whether good or bad, with other people who share those characteristics. In this sense, I disagree with you very much on this issue.  Next,  regarding the Cathy Newman Channel 4 interview, I feel like that's being dishonest to Jordan Peterson as well. You can, for sure, make a claim that he slyly makes those undeniably factual statements in an effort to 'bait out' either an argument to that answer, or a 'So what you're saying is...'. It's very easy to see it that way. However, a very simple solution is just to say 'How is that relevant to the question/topic?'. If Jordan Peterson says 'Men and women have inherent biological differences.', you say 'Ok, tell me how that relates to what we're talking about'. I don't know how much research you've actually done, but in my experience, when people do this, Peterson immediately answers the question. Obviously you can't travel in time, so the GQ Interview wasn't in your research repetoire, but that's a great example of it. Also, if you watch enough of his interviews/debates with Sam Harris (though it does get a bit muddy there) or Dave Rubin, you'll see it too. I don't think this is a fault for Peterson, but for the interviewer. I also have to stress that I don't think he does it on purpose, but that he just assumes that the other side will understand the assumption he is making. Of course, there's no way to prove that either way, so it just brings back the fact that this as a whole is a weak argument.  Now, there are a lot of places where I do actually agree with you (well, pretty much the rest of the video, almost). Especially with 'postmodern neo-Marxism'! For the longest time I just thought I was dumb because I couldn't figure out what that actually was, when in actuality it's just has an imagined meaning...   Anyways, I really hope you'll respond. If not you, then someone else can feel free to respond and let me know why I'm right/wrong.  Thanks!"
"This is the fanciest echochamber for sophistical ideas I've ever seen. You must be chuffed having your d sucked so hard by so many unthinking NPCs."

"As always, a complete masterpiece <3"
"If someone’s entire ideology is that evil Marxists are out to destroy the west then they are a facist."
"Hey hey HEY DONT HATE ON THE SCOTS C’MON!"
"Great, now I’m angry and aroused"
"I would doubt weather Jordan Peterson isn’t a facist when he was featured on prater university, an essentially facist organisation."
"Another problem with him is that he interprets the fuck out of everything he reads. When he says 'they follow postmodern/neo-marxist philosophy' he means 'they follow my very idiosyncratic and heavily interpreted reading of postmodern/neo-marxist philosophy'. He never makes it clear that his readings are very personal and idiosyncratic so he's either doing it on purpose and being dishonest or he just doesn't notice or perhaps doesn't think he's doing it at all. It's a shame that some people will take his word for it and never do the reading for themselves.   I remember him saying that Nietzsche predicted the deaths that came from the rule of the Stalin in the USSR. This came from an extremely interpreted reading and he never made this clear."
"Goood saaaaaave theeeeeeeeeee quuuuueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen"
"I think you're overlooking the (often indirect) influence of Kant on late modernism. A lot of the figures you mention there are products of the German university culture, and so they are well aware of the sorts of restrictions Hume would have offered on what we can learn from observation. I know this is not a careful university lecture, but I guess I'm just offering my reaction to the absence of that particular Prussian misogynist who I have dedicated the last 5 years of my life to studying (who generally tends to get neglected in a certain way by English-speakers generally, like he's the black sheep of the family looming over everything, but you won't mention him cause he's so dark and mysterious ... and misogynistic)"

I'd like to see citations of peer reviewed scholarly articles JP based his assertion that reproductive strategies (during mating season) of some crustaceans <Hierarchies in lobsters> are actually comparable to permanently imposed human hierarchies? Or even deeper, if reproductive strategies in crustaceans strengthen the species. How our systemic imposed human hierarchies are better for our species? How Professor Peterson, how does that work???

"music is irritating"
"Have you tried to debate him? Your points are strong."
"This was a *lot* of big words ._. I don't know how much i understood but I think I relate with postmodernism the most o.O"
"thank you for explaining the words peterson uses because half the time i cant understand what hes even saying! its kinda hard to gain anything from what someone says when you have to pull out a dictionary every two seconds. its interesting to see that when dissected, those words carry very little actual (coherent) meaning."
"Is contrapoint a woman or a transgender? I dont care either way i just wana know."
"Is contrapoint a woman or a transgender? I dont care either way i just wana know."
"Wow, extremely well done! Chappeau.  It's a pleasure to watch. Thank you. I still disagree with a lot of what you said about J.P.  I think you're strawmaning him most of the time.  But I'll keep tuning in."
"Think he might have a point about trans people. For example, i was watching rocky horror picture show and then next thing i know, im melting down any and all scrap metal in my back yard"
"Good video. Peterson never critiqued “the left” - he calls himself left/liberal. His issue is with a specific subset - a group this video also criticize. His claim is that this subset is taking over the left and academia."
"I really really enjoyed everything you said here, as a person who has very loosely followed Jordan Peterson's content (mostly the classroom stuff about living a better life where you face your past, future, emotions, etc.) and enjoyed his general advice and narrative to the youth of today. I do find he has some views on certain things that make less sense and should really be examined first before adopting them as our own, which a lot of people are doing. So I really completely agree with you.  However, I think the sexual bits of this video undermine how well this video will come across. I was a little uncomfortable with that, but I know you're playing a role and caricaturizing the situation and making content for entertainment purposes. And it's your right to present your case however you'd like (within reason of course) :P  Anyways good stuff, thanks for this!"
"STRANGERS WITH CANDY!!!!!!!  Subscribed."
"I do like Listening to Peterson and anything I see talking against him seems unfair or misplaced  but this is the only video I’ve come across that takes a well rounded far from dogmatic stab at him. He definitely does have his own ideology that he calls for eg just invalidating Marxist thinking completely writing it off without much merit... You just gained a follower, really entertaining too.Fair play!"
"sooo good! :-D"
"Am I the only one who feels like Jordan Peterson never actually says anything? All of his speeches are 95% fluff and don’t actually communicate anything of substance. If I click on a Peterson video it’s always like 15 min long and there’s only 20 sec of him actually talking about the subject in the title"
"I dont agree with everything you are saying, but I really respect the way you put them in such a logical way! 😁😁 You are awesome!"
"You are so funny and so insightful! New favorite channel"
"U got the thing about the lobsters totally wrong but whatever."
"Maybe one day contrapoints will let me put on a suit, get in a bath with her and pour milk on my face... I need to hold onto this dream."

"You're missing the main point, he made a commentary on how incoherent these two philosophies are and that idpol/feminists are using these incoherent two structures that contradict. He even said that in one of his lectures. I'm not sure how you missed that, that is the main point. He knows they're contradictory. That's the point."
"I just discovered your channel today.   So far, so excellent.  What IMO is Peterson's problem is:  “If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.”  He can't!  I don't at all see him as 'public intellectual' (same with Shapiro, the other video I watched of yours).  They're bullshit artist for people who can't understand their convoluted message; you message while being fun in it's presentation is cogent."
"Thanks for this video! God, as personally annoying as I find Jordan Peterson, I wish he actually had a coherent ideology that he sticks to so it's easier to properly point out how stupid his arguments are."

'Class struggle' has simply been replaced by racial/gender 'minority struggle'... and yes, not just the media and the universities are riding this cultural wave... even the corporate HR are all about then minority race quotas and racial diversity. That's what is being pointed out. Like in Marxism, people are not seen as individuals, but as part of a group. And we already know that the Left is not coherent and always squabbling... that's what coined the phrase 'the left eats itself'. And the lobster argument is (when done right) not there to justify hierarchy, it is there to point out that natural hierachies may exist and that we do not know whether overturning these is the morally right thing to do. Nothing more, nothing less. But yeah, fuck the 'Judeo-Christian' value-argument, religious mumbo-jumbo."

"Coming back to this video again after actually looking into Jordan Peterson, I think I can explain how identity politics can ultimately be both modernist and post-modern. In short it can be summed up as 'Anyone can identify as anything they want BECAUSE everything is a social construct anyway.'  Many people seem to be trying to use the increase of labels (gender pronouns, for example), precisely to destabilize existing categories  (into seemingly nothing). I agree it's a contradiction, and seems incredibly hypocritical. But I'm not under the impression that it's  two different groups of feminists saying gender is a social construct and clinging to the identity of woman. It seems more like they just switch between the two depending on the context of what they're talking about, which might be legitimate, but is confusing and I hazard to say, misleading at least.   I also don't think that Jordan Peterson is being intentionally vague or contradictory about his own beliefs. I think there are some things he just doesn't know and doesn't want to pretend he does, BUT he seems to want to spread awareness of issues he feels he has observed, which isn't always conclusive, because honest assessment of life events isn't really ever conclusive. I don't totally agree with everything he says or implies, but honestly I don't think he does either, which is where the vagueness probably originates, and I don't think that's a necessarily bad thing."
"Peterson is an incredibly insecure, paranoid, gynophobe who cleverly disguises his deep paranoid castration anxiety under layers of scholarly rationalist arguments."
"I lost it at 'so much for the tolerant jacobins'"
"I want to start off by saying this was a SUPERB video. Hilarious, intelligent, and detail-oriented. Phenomenal job!  Two things that I had an issue with though:  (1) Arguing semantics ('Post-Modern Neo-Marxism' might contradict and not mesh together) may have been a poor choice. Peterson argues that this term means that the 'class/wealth' dynamic of traditional Marxism was replaced/transformed into a 'power' dynamic because Marxism proved to be an utter failure during the 20th century (Soviet Union/Mao's China). The common terms and narrative had to change in order for Marxism to exist and continue to perpetuate (although it would change to point that this term was no longer sufficient to describe itself, thus the change in term above).  I think that transition to power gets brought up by Peterson because Foucault (and post-modernists like him) insist that there is no meaning or value in the world, the only thing that is REAL is the power of those in control (they control the historical narrative) and the people who lack control of power. I somewhat agree on your point though: Is this a civilization ruining problem? I don't think our society would ever let it get to that point. We're seeing the contradictory nature of extreme leftist politics more and more every day (patriarchal Islam, LGBTQ+, and feminism all peacefully coinciding under one neat blanket? Is intersectionality able to overcome generations of prejudice?) so it's only a matter of time before the leftist political ideology shifts back towards the center.  Sorry, I digress.   (2) This comment section. Some are acting as if the title of this video is, 'Dr. Peterson Gets PWNED!!!', when in reality this is just a hilarious video that had some great insight and posed interesting questions on Peterson's diction and overarching doomsday narrative. Everyone relax, please, and see some of Peterson's videos for yourselves and make your own sound judgement.   It's 3:22AM. I'm tired and I'm going to go to bed. Stop making such good videos for the love of Zeus. I'm trying to get some sleep."
"Holy shit here's how you fuck him up. He makes a statement that's technically correct but has implications, you say this statement.  'Yes, I recognize that the thing you're saying is correct. How does that relate to this argument?'  He either says how it relates and fucks himself over, he says the same thing again in attempt to avoid the statement and fucks himself over, or says that it doesn't relate and looks like an idiot."
"When analyzing the theory of post-modern Marxism it sounds like it would be a positive influence on society. However when we see it put into practice what surfaces includes laws on mandatory speech, protesters that are not willing to enter a dialog instead preferring violence, along with a loss of individuality as you are labelled and pre-judged as a part of a group. In general a break down of freedom of ideas and speech. I believe Dr Peterson also understands that there are many different hierarchies within society, I think the lobster example was an answer to those who believe that the only reason for hierarchies is due to a 'capitalistic patriarchal' system. It was a demonstration that hierarchies are older than political ideologies and says nothing on the number of them."

"2:03 btw that wasn’t a BBC interview it was a Channel 4 (News) segment. Big difference; the BBC is funded by license-payers, Channel 4 runs commercials. I’m afraid I can’t think of an American equivalent except maybe confusing NBC and PBS."
"you know, as a JBP fanboy, I feel the need to say that I loved this video lol. And I think it's so important for you to have a voice on this and I love your sense of humour with it. I can say that I believe peterson's message is 'do right by yourself, do right by your family and do right by your community' and that's how we fix what's wrong with society. And it is NOT the role of government to compel behaviour of any kind. when you punish wrongspeak you make people afraid to talk. and when it revolves around the LBGTQ community it becomes people being afraid to talk to that community. Which just further stigmatizes that community. The road to hell was paved with good intentions. But I think you raise a very good point that the things Peterson targets is academia and HR, etc, and these areas tend to represent vulnerable people. It's important to make a clear distinction between opposing an ideology and opposing people. I think the vast majority of us want us things to genuinely be better for people. But we can't throw the baby out with the bath water. The more I think about this stuff the more I truly feel having real face to face conversations will be how we get out of this polarization. Because we're all unique in our own way and that really is what makes us special. But you can't see that uniqueness when it forms into big groups. So, let's keep talking! good video!"
"Your videos take the Cal Chuchesta formula to the next level"
"I really liked this video, though it seemed to focus more on the semantics of the term 'postmodern neo-marxism' than on the implications of the term.  I can't help but agree with Jordan Peterson that anyone who wishes to curtail free speech (for whatever reason) poses a threat to democracy. Both fascists and the extreme left fall under this category. That's why he compares SJWs to Mao. It's a bit extreme, but I can see where he's coming from. Whether it's fitting to call them neo-marxists is a different question, and ultimately an irrelevant one, if you ask me."

"As someone with very Marxist economic beliefs and very liberal/individualist social beliefs I find myself agreeing with and falling out with people on both sides. Though generally I side with the Marxists because I interpret collectivism not as homogenalisation but as merely mutual respect and co-operation, saying that anyone who thinks it's inherently totalitarian lacks some understanding on the matter or is just a tankie."
"Yeah, you've done more research than Jordan Peterson. Give us a F'in break."
"enjoyed this very much, good analysis and doing it with a sense of humour is a massive plus.  - only one minor niggle - on the 'SJW v libertarian position,  people choosing their own pronouns = cool individualism' - JP's whole jump to fame was in being against the Canadian ruling that people MUST use the 'appropriate' pronouns, as being on the rails towards Stalinism, but individuals must of course be free to choose their own,  - and as such he had a good point."
"Oh man! I'm a high school social studies teacher and I hear about this guy from my students! I then started asking friends about him and found out that I had been cavorting with lobsters for quite some time. This guy came out of nowhere and poisons the well so hard it blindsides well meaning mentor figures. I can't complain. I remember being a teenage edge-lord and I suppose my penance is to deal with other 16 year olds like me is fitting, but the Internet has provided so many places for them to be awful people! The main draw for my students is entertainment value. Thanks for providing informative videos that have great entertainment so that they will be open to more enlightened ideas that the alt-right Deepok Chopra provides."

"I IMMEDIATELY doubt people when they claim to have some kind of superior knowledge about anything 'post-modern' I study art history and I have major issues with people claiming to be a part of a post--modern era.... it's absolutely absurd right down to the very name of it... being against modernism or being past modernism... but... without... modernism... are you now reverting to primitivism?? It's so fuzzy for anyone to try to explain but you lay it out so wonderfully."

"You really have a thing for JP"
"The Lobser Queen song at the end sounds almost Krafterk like. Like the intro to Autobahn. Very nuanced video on JP's oversimplified worldview."
"I agree that most basically 'postmodern neo-Marxism' is just a buzzword used to make up a scary-sounding enemy, but it's also not as non-sensical as this video makes it out to be. Here (I think) is what Peterson means by the term: by 'postmodern' he means 'social constructivist' and by 'neo-Marxist' he means 'radical egalitarian' (this is 'neo' because it is about 'equality of outcome' among social groups like black people and gay people, not about Marxist class struggle much at all. Think the Oscar nomination controversy). He opposes to this view what he thinks of as a scientific worldview that accepts a certain amount of hierarchal inequality as both natural and inevitable and thinks differences are not socially constructed (yet he bases this talk in some weird pseudo-existentialist talk about the chaos and suffering inherent in life, that he says we best combat with personal responsibility and individualism and that he associates with the Bible). I think he hooks so many people because of the way he mixes the political critique with the pseudo-existentialism, so that the first part seems up-to-date and pressing, and the second part feels old and profound, and together they feel like a full worldview. But (to give my own opinion) the problem is that each separately is pretty weak: his political critique is a lot of over-simplifying and caricaturing everything as secretly totalitarian and his existentialism is, well, much weaker than that of the great existentialist philosophers."
"New to the channel. I'll be sure to watch alot more of your videos. You're very insightful and very funny. The Jordan Peterson 'Daddy' dummy killed me. I agree that Peterson can be hard to pin down. I don't believe he thinks that current Trans activists are totalitarian in and of themselves, but that the implication of speech laws to can lead to thought crime."

"He's a hack. Postmodernism clashes with Marxism. His self help is banal and rehashed from hundreds before him. Lookup Campbell his works though much less rightward reactionary have many of the same ideas about foundational mythology. Instead of cleaning your rooms hit the books or stick to psychology bucko."
"Despite having a nearly half hour long video, you still over simplify his views. When talking about how he defines 'postmodern neo-marxism' you don't reference his own explanation of what he mean when he says it. It's not simply a combination of postmodernism and marxism, it's an altered marxism that replaces the Individual's economic status of the classic marxist critic,  with Collective economic or social status. Instead of saying that any person who is doing better than their neighbors is guilty of corruption, they say that all strait, white, men are guilty of corruption, because, on average, they are doing better than other groups."

"For anyone wondering, he says post-modern neomarxism because post-modernism leads to the belief that there are no universal value systems and if you still want equality while believing this then the only way to achieve it is through utilizing institutional power to equalize the outcomes for all people."
"After watching through the whole video I feel like there was no point in it. It is merely expository in a way that makes it no different than reading wikipedia. I expected strong arguments against Peterson."
"“Identity politics” is laughable. Politicians who use identity markers to identify with their constituents use identity politics. Just because for the first times in history it doesn’t revolve solely around white people, doesn’t mean it’s this new gimmicky phenomena politicians discovered. “Blue collar” “flyover states” “middle America” “red blooded Americans” all identify with CERTAIN Americans and have been ingrained in the American political lexicon FOREVER. Just because those same tactics are used to identify minorities now doesn’t mean it hasn’t been used forever."
"Man.... where the hell can you get PCP now a days?"
"You literally just made me understand the term postmodern for the first actual time."

"You are deceptively funny I really like that but its so obvious that u gather much of your information about JP from reaction videos and other commentary."

"You could just recite points laid out in Mister Metokur's video about him where he tears him a new asshole."
"Hi there. I just started watching your channel and enjoy your show. Very creative and fun. In response to your analysis of JP's positions on the issues you cover, I think that you are missing a 'lived experience' that JP and I share.  The culture of academia is IMO extremely ideologically captured by an SJW political worldview.   While I agree with you that his labeling this phenomenon as “postmodernism” is hopelessly simplistic, it does serve him as a meaningful counterpoint to his modernist position, and so it works for him as a placeholder."
""
"Where I find myself agreeing with Peterson is that in my own experience getting a BA, an MA and a PhD in the social sciences, I have found that over time the academy has become progressively more politically entrenched in an anti-capitalist, anti-reason and anti-male, reactionary worldview.  A worldview that silences dissent to dogmatic ideological orthodoxy (as you yourself have experienced IIRC).  Having recently negotiated this culture in pursuit of my PhD, I ultimately decided to NOT finish out my career as an academic, and to go back to clinical work because I believe that as JP himself notes, it is not acceptable in many academic circles to consider evolutionary theory as a consideration in an analysis of human behavior.  Instead, I found myself being pressured by my professors and my fellow students to hold a view that socialization ALONE was a causal factor in gender identity, gender norms, moral reasoning etc.  Ideological purity was demanded of me."
""
"So I left.  Lucky for me I had a career to fall back on.  I can only imagine the pressure on people like me who are not so blessed."
""
"I can only assume that JP’s position against this culture of what he calls “postmodernism” is at least partially born out of his own frustration working in this culture and seeing it degenerate farther and farther down an ideological rabbit-hole, I imagine that he got to the point that he decided to speak up about it.  Frankly I admire his courage."

"Anyway, I enjoy your cogent analysis, and Look forward to enjoying many more of your videos!  Have a great day!"
"you say 'the left doesn't tell people what to do...we tell them what not to do...' hahaha ya right! PC culture is exactly telling people what to do ...what words you will allow us to say, what costumes we can wear...Same way religions do by the way. Not much difference."

"You got great arguments, and are articulate.   But really, you did a way too big strawman at 21:10 with the lobster argument..   Seriously he was making a reference to biological structures conserved in evolution. You misrepresented him so much that I just stopped watching your video. And I ll probably never come back to this channel as this just throws enormous doubts about the truth of the rest of your content and if you are genuine or manipulating.  You accused of him having a political agenda. But I feel you are way too sensitive for the gays and transgender s interest, and are pushing this 'agenda' in favor especially of the LGBT. And I suspect it is that sensitivity that pushes your effort to 'counter his points', and not actual disagreements on logical points."
"Is the individual a woman or a man, why this is in my suggestions? Is it due to the porn? I'm very confused. Also why I am writing this coment?

One day soon i'll start going back to the gym just to identify myself more with something. You will become a meme soon."
"Second video I watch, really loved it. Two in a row."

How are you going to convince anyone they are wrong unless you do your best to look at Jordan ideas and why they speak to people. The only thing you're doing if you're weakening his arguments is that you convince people already convinced of your beliefs."

"Nice video."
"Firstly, JPB has already addressed the point you made about the term 'post-modern Marxists' many times. Don't bother looking too hard, I will help you. The point is that this is not his term and the philosophical contradiction that you describe is as befuddling to him as it is to you. It is a nonsensical logically vacuous alliance, and yet this is exactly the kind cognitive dissonance required, a kind of double think if you will, in order to simultaneously believe that it is impossible to know anything and no values are inherently better than any other values (a prerequisite to much of the blind and beneficence tolerance of far left cultural relativism and explains how feminists can defend genital mutilation and women being property in the religion of Islam), but still believe that everything in the west is competing power groups with white cisgendered heterosexual men (the bourgeoisie) oppressing everyone else who lacks privilege (the proletariat) and the goal of every human being must be to commit the Bolsheviki revolution against the white men in order to destroy the matrix of domination and achieve equity between all groups on all dimensions or else your a racist bigot who does not deserve a platform or moral consideration. These beliefs are ACTUALLY philosophically inconsistent, so that is a magnificent observation, but telling us this tells us nothing we did not already know. It is the only way to describe someone who simultaneously will say things like 'patriarchy is keeping down all minorities and must be smashed' and 'everything is a social constitution and there is no universal human truths.' you can say this is straw man, but you have to say it to the pundents on T.V and my crazy feminist professors (99% of all my professors). The term for this strange view which seems to deny all western progress and the value of enlightenment thinking, logic, reason, science, and so on the post-modern grounds in an effort to dismantle the patriarchy and achieve a Marxist revolution of identity political groups. Feminists do disagree on everything which is one of the reasons why it makes it so difficult to engage with them substantively because you are constantly accused of straw-man. Most feminist views are philosophically inconsistent with one another so you have to work mighty hard to avoid pissing off all the people who want to call you a biggot AND having a philosophically consistent position. Also you need to be aware that you missed the point of the lobster again. The Marxist answer to flatten hierarchies will not work for a creature that has had competence hierarchies genetically selected into them over generations. But the idea that we are supposed to live like lobsters is a really disingenuous reading, it significance the evolutionary salience and relevance of competence hierarchies (the older and more constant the thing the more salient in its effect on genes obviously) and a lobster is really really old. Some people DO try and put unequal hierarchies at the feet of capitalism and that is fatally wrong. it is a problem of cooperation, productivity, and goals. There is a great diversity of academic opinions on the left (and thank you very much for the fascinating break down the quarrels between these groups, i find for example the no platforming of Judith butter to be an interesting overlap presumably between our camps), but the social movement that has resulted is amalgamation of them in an inconsistent fashion and is implementing totalitarian compelled speech acts like in Stalinist Russian, Maoist china, and durring the french revolution, and I remain unconvinced by your un-thoughtful joking, that issue requires serious redress, because ideologues are writing social constructionism into the law while advocating for Marxists group revolution. What the fuck do you call them? you can call them progressives, but that hides their real face. I came here to comment hoping to have found leftists who actually care about reason and debate and discourse. Please help me to see what I am missing here."

"Peterson is absolutely a fascist. Fascism is the open terroristic rule of the most reactionary element of finance capitalists, not merely an ideological position. The US and Canada have been characterized by fascism since their beginning, based on genocide and slavery, and Peterson's implicit support of that arrangement makes him a fascist. The name Contrapoints makes sense since you're about as left wing as the Contras."
"muh oppression."
"Your second video with 1 Million+ Views. Way to go Nat. ❤"
"great stuff.   I have been trying to lock down counter arguments to jordan p.     I think the biggest failing so far of the left has been the lack of effort going into trying to understand , decode what he is saying and why it resonates with a huge section of disaffected young (and older) men.     It reminds me of a film i saw once where journalists never read any books.   Just the titles, the back of the book and whatever everyone else said about the book.     Most of the left response has been 'shhh! now you racist, sexist nazi'   then using an air horn to stop him speaking.  Thank you for putting some actual effort into understanding what he says even if he is deliberately vague about implications."
"'Jordan Petersen is not a fascist.' I'm sorry, you lost me with that one. Oh right, he's a Post Modernist Neo National. What was I thinking? Here's a question: Is Petersen aware of the affect he has on the susceptible young men that listen to him or not? Take his book for example: I picked it up and thought 'So this is Petersen's wonderful guide to life. What kind of supporters did they use for blurbs on the back as a gauge of the audience? The National Review discussing daddy issues? Wow, no sign of an agenda ANYWHERE!' Note: Sarcasm."
"'infamous BBC interview' ahahaha"
"Second 1 million"
"I like Peterson and agree with a lot of or even most of his statments. I also watched quite alot of his YT videos and i dont have the impression that he is in any kind against the LGBTQ community. The strong aversive reaction of his against calling trans people by their respectiv pronoun was, only regarded to the obligation by law to do so and the resulting implications. Its a huge difference to agree (as a society) to do something or  to be forced by law to do something"
"This is the second video that I've watched from you and I find your viewpoint to be very smart and interesting. In full disclosure I am a big fan of Jordan Peterson and one thing you must know about him is that he doesn't have time to go through a postmodernist neo-marxist 101 in every lecture or talk that he does he expects his audience has already informed themselves about the basic ideas. He also doesn't have time and in reality can't go through every single progressive individual and make a case as to whether they are trying to dismantle Western values in the such. But take it from someone who was probably watched a hundred hours of Jordan Peterson when he does q and A's there are people who have asked him to clarify and she does so but I realize that you Contra do not have the time as many do not to watch as many hours to find each case. but good video from someone who is probably on the other end of the political and odealogical spectrum as you. I'm glad I'm stepping out to hear opposing viewpoints."
"I think you’ve missed the point of Peterson’s book. He’s not telling you what to do, he’s suggesting which actions are the most conducive if you have the goal of wanting to be happy  You’re obviously very smart, so I have a hard time believing that you didn’t recognise that"
"I found your channel, thanks to The New Yorker.  Watching your videos, you've made me feel better about putting money I should be spending on bills into my favorite source of news and opinions.  Probably one of the best channels I've been to.  Subscribed.  Also...  I followed Peterson for too long before I realized self help was apparently fascism's gateway drug..."

"This video is so satisfying! I've watched so many people (economic leftists, social leftists, feminists, SJW's) struggle with articulating the reasons for their distaste of Peterson. But you described his purposeful vagueness so perfectly. Vague statements + clear implications = impossible to argue without refutation. Love it! Subbed."

"Of course the largest sect of buddhism is greek influenced and one of the three great defenders of the faith was a greek king. Hercules was Buddha's bodyguard. Since, greeks were the first to depict Buddha that is why he wears a toga. I want to see a movie about the 50,000 greek buddhists who made the pilgrimmage to Sri Lanka. That would amaze and wow people who have this weird idea that people don't move around and then have some of the greeks learn from the persians and hindi and bring that stuff back to greece."

"I love this video!  I am not knowledgeable enough to wholly judge the objectiveness of the content, but did relate to some of the video's analysis with respect to Mr. Peterson, e.g. weird definition of the west, and ambiguity of answers.  If nothing else this video was really funny, clever, and well put together- if not educational (which I think it would be to anyone at least in some degree).  Look forward to more!  Cheers :)"
"*ONE MILLION VIEWS BOIS AND GRILS!!!!!*"
"B4 I even finish this video, I think it only fair to point out that JP's initial issue with the C16 bill had nothing to do with protecting trans rights, but was about the concept of compelled speech, as he's stated a infinitum.  I posted the statement below on another JP video.  What do you think of the premise, and what might be a better solution to protect the lives and psych health of trans people, especially considering the DSM lists transgenderism as 'gender dysphoria', and enabling psych-disorders is not necessarily a healthy practice:   Beyond the compelled speech, junk science, and psych-disorder enabling arguments, another reason not to use multiple gender pronouns (at least in public) is that it may actually put trans people in more danger.  Many trans people, specifically male to female, do not want to be identified as other than the gender they transition to precisely because they do not want be subjected to hostility or violence.  Using these new pronouns identifies trans people as 'other ' to the general public, and does nothing to convince violent hateful people to accept them as 'normal'.  Like the old 'forced outing' movement (I never agreed with), it's not an effective strategy for protection of trans people or prosecution of anti-trans violence...not a smart strategy at all."
"Derrida is not that hard; you could clearly read a short intro or summary of some kind and understand the major tenets of his writings. I'm in grad school, so basically the way Derrida usually comes up is to deconstruct false dichotomies. If someone tells you there are only men and women, or only liberals and conservatives, or only republicans and democrats, these are false dichotomies: you can quickly think of a 'third option.' Intersex people exist, people can have both 'liberal' and conservative beliefs, green party. Conservative arguments often start by trying to ignore or deny these differences. So it's super useful to notice rhetorical strategies that rely on dichotomies, like the one you have identified here: in Peterson's worldview, there is 'the West' vs 'postmodern neomarxism.' As you noted, whatever Peterson imagines 'postmodern neomarxism' to be, it must be a part of the western philosophical tradition. So to oppose them against each other, as if they were clearly defined opposites is nonsensical.   Also, note however that it is Peterson's goal to make you believe that this opposition is natural and has always existed. Of course it's obvious that 'the West' and 'postmodern neomarxism' must be at odds, that they naturally are aligned against each other. This Derrida called essentialism, which is where postmodern and activist feminisms actually agree: the goal of any feminist is to show that male domination is not a 'natural' state--it is imposed on us by patriarchy, which wants us to think that the domination of men over women is 'natural' and has always been that way. Thus Peterson will argue as if 'the West' and 'postmodern neomarxism' are clearly defined, self-contained, always existent categories that are naturally opposed to each other--we have to pick one or the other (no critical thought is necessary; the choice should be obvious!). Whenever someone wants you to pick one or the other, as if those are the only possible choices, breaking down those categories is a way of looking for another option (is what Derrida and deconstruction would suggest)."

"Excellent video! One point I loved that you started to get at, but that you didn't drive home, is that things we see in nature and traits/characteristics we derive from our evolution shouldn't be seen as 'moral.' Those don't exist on moral spectrums. In nature, there is no 'right' and 'wrong.' If we agree to the notion that human beings function at a higher cognitive and emotional capacity than animals, then the argument 'well that's how it is in nature' is nonsensical at best. We shouldn't derive our morality from nature, but rather form our own morality based on cultural evolution. And of course, Peterson/Shaprio/the 'intellectual' right have their entire worldviews based upon the idea that the Judeo-Christian God exists and there is a morality, a 'right' and 'wrong' (as you noted by saying he is a modernist). So where does that morality come from? You can spin that whole argument against them pretty easy because it's so flawed. Peterson likes to take natural observations and use them as justification for obviously immoral beliefs."
"hey natalie, i'm not sure where you stand exactly politically (you seem a bit disconnected entirely or just looking at things from an observer POV - though that may entirely be a part of a character i made up in my head due to your skits) but in general marxist movements are broadening. a large reason for this is because using a marxist lens honestly leads you to things like intersectionality and what people call 'identity politics' - which most marxists (maybe we SHOULD be called neomarxists, though most socialists who aren't obsessing over theory probably haven't read someone like gramsci) now employ happily and are more than content to argue with USSR-style socialists. not that the USSR didn't to some decree practice liberation; they just clearly didn't go far enough and were too hierarchical for a free flow of ideas to allow this to fully happen in the first place. i think you'll find from most marxists and socialists today that the prevailing belief is that intersectionality and identity politics are necessary because simply taking control of the state does not remove ingrained societal behaviors and institutions, which is pretty clear to anyone who actually uses a marxist lens to view these issues. it's true marxists were historically lacking in this regard. the beauty of marxism is that it is by its very nature capable of adaptable and evolving as more information comes out and more people contribute to it.   people like kimberle crenshaw who employ things like critical theory, and specifically critical race theory to develop the theory of intersectionality have also historically gone hand in hand with marxist thinkers and proponents of these concepts such as angela davis (marxist, intersectionist, member of the Communist Party USA). this is not a coincidence. critical theory arose in a context in which even calling yourself communist or marxist or using marxism (with that name specifically) was taboo at best and absolutely actionably punishable at worst. which happened fairly often. as a result, you get a critical theory that is VERY close to the theories that fuel marxism. marxism was historically focused on the class war - and that is absolutely still relevant today - but using the very same dialectic marx came to that conclusion many modern marxists and even some classical marxists used previously can also lead to critical theory. the main difference being critical theory isn't focused on class war, it simply uses the same dialectic to examine other issues critically. it seems fairly obvious that the two would become closely intertwined at some point.  there is probably a good case for the word 'neomarxist' to be used to described the growing amount of people and movements who dub themselves 'marxists', if only to differentiate themselves from classical marxism which was primarily used to attack capitalism. i don't think this is wholly necessary, mostly because marxism has always been an evolving view and nearly every single aspect of critical theory, intersectionality, or really any examination of power and social structure can be tied back into some kind of class struggle and examination.  i'm curious as to your thoughts on this and whether this has reflected what you have seen of modern marxism/the broader anticapitalist left in recent times. i'm not sure how you engage politically or if you even engage with them to see how it's changed and especially how it's used outside of academia, which we can all see is stuffy and backwards in some respects, for being owned by hardcore marxists they're awfully conservative in practice"
"It’s so nice to see what consider proper centrism. I’ve always enjoyed Peterson but like you don’t agree with all his points, and the same goes for the points of the extreme left. I understand both arguments but have never fully identified with either side and consider myself a centrist. There doesn’t seem to be much centrist content on YouTube and it’s refreshing to see content such as yours that addresses both sides even handedly. Bravo x"
"'Tolerant Jacobins.' That is some might smart humor, right there."

"The worst thing about this video is how insulting you are toward anyone who might actually care about history, philosophy or ideology.  The implication is that you are a bad person if you actually want to engage with ideas.

"These People all ready have the same rights as another person simply by beating a citizen of that country. As an American a trans individual has the same rights and freedoms as me. Sure in the private sector that may have a more difficult time in certain areas, like employment etc... but so what?   The argument really comes down to whether you believe in negative rights or positive rights. Giving the government the power to decide what rights one group (any arbitrary characteristics a people share)  gets, allows that same government the power to take away that right. Look at gay marriage... we gave the government the power to actually limit the constitutional right to form personal contracts with one another... that’s crazy. You can’t force a society to change through the federal government, the federal government has to be changed by society  and if not you get shit like Jim Crow which we are still living with today.   Name me one constitutional freedom not also shared by trans people, or any minority group, and I will be for changing it. But it seems more to me that they wish to change society by forcing through legislation that limits the rights of others for them just being uncomfortable in society...  and we live in the third largest country, in size, in the world... move to another jurisdiction if you feel prejudiced against. That’s all of our right as a citizen.   I’m glad I watched this video, I would have liked it to have had a more serious tone but I am not your demographic I would imagine, but I think you’re misscatagorizin Peterson’s POV on trans and other groups. He does fear that society in large is being changed, I seriously believe your remark of “it’s a small minority” is mistaken especially given that a 2006 study conducted found that 18% of college professors were Marxist and 25% of social science professors were Marxist, but to paint the guy as a transphobe is ridiculous, to me, he has said many times that his issue is over the compelled speech laws, not the pronouns in fact he’s said he would have had no problem calling someone by their prefers pronoun, and has, but for not being told by the government he should do it or be charged with a hate crime.  No one has a problem with progressivism, shit we are all fucking liberals, it’s the pace at which progressives want that is insane and goes back to my statement earlier- governments shouldn’t change society, society should change the government."
"I ❤️ U SO SO SO MUCH FOR THIS"
"Jordan Peterson is a psychologist. He raises questions people find offensive because he wants to understand the root of why it's offensive and he likes discussing it. People just take his psychology as way more political than it is. Sometimes he does say things that are not quite clear but so does everyone.   Also Peterson has never been against pronouns. He is against government policy that restricts freedom of speech. It's a fair argument but has been straw man-d to death saying that he's against the trans community. No. He's against restriction of freedom of speech. This same controversy comes up over and over again when it comes to hate speech law.  Its not that people love saying hateful or offensive things. It's that they are asking very valid ethical questions. Should we take away people's freedom to say one thing if society deems it offensive or disrespectful?  The problem these days is people get outraged because they assume about a persons characters as soon as they say something instead of deeply considering their argument or pondering thoughts.  I consider myself progressive. I do not consider myself leftist. Just as a conservative wouldn't call themselves alt-right.  But as someone who is more progressive I value those deep psychological discussions about people and society. We shouldn't pretend that equality exists and so it should be okay to really talk about things like gender differences and how that might influence peoples behavior. It's fascinating and it breaks down walls more than it divides people IMO. I don't care much for the idiot alt-right incels who seem to love this guy. I think they're just as silly for liking jordan as the leftists are for hating him. They just translate everything he says into their bullshit framework of society they have in their head. I don't think he has any extreme political motives other than promoting the idea that governments shouldn't have power over certain rights and freedoms. His main one being freedom of speech. I think it's honorable and needs to be said - It's just unfortunate how the alt-right jumped on his band-wagon and has made it seem like he's regressive."

"omg love your vids and- really strange to say-  love reading the YouTube comments too *pinches self"
"I don't think you understood what Peterson meant by 'postmodern neomarxism', he uses the term for the collectivist ideology of the Anglo-Saxon socialists, who are still following the fundamental point of marxism: that group identity is paramount and that opression of one group by another is the main characteristic of society and that overcoming this opression is the goal we should aim for. By the way, the modern alright has little to do with real fascism. Mussolini's ideology was also very similar to classical Marxism, since he was a dissident of the socialist party (I regard fascism and socialism as two variants of the same fundamental thing, the main difference between the two is that fascists are generally smarter (Alexander Dugin is a good example of a modern fascist).  By the way, Peterson has already stated many times his ideological position: he is a liberal. He is not a conservative, nor a fascist nor a socialist.   Finally, Stalin was a socialist, just like you are, as well as a lot of people in identity politics. Hence the connection he noticed between LGBT activism and Stalin. Stalin was basically the person that achieved the closest implementation of the socialist ideal, of course, tens of millions of death are a natural consequence of implementing socialism given it involves the demolition of the institutional infrastructure that maintains human civilization. Identity politics is not remotely going to get near achieving what Stalin did (thank god) but it's based on the same ideological principles."

"'universal theories about the world'...  Does universal imply non-contingent, or does theories imply contingent? Ironism seems reasonable, and sounds like a Tony Stark fan club which I could be down with.  Not sure what 'radical doubt' means though. Anyways, I'm in the 'Science, it works bitches!' camp.  Does that make me a modernist?  That would be ok despite some of the real shitty ideas (along with some pretty great ones in fairness) associated with it.  The whole gig is about progressively being less wrong after all.  BTW: Philosophy has way too much wanking over 'deep problems' which are normally solved by just recognizing the question makes no fucking sense.  Oh, and Peterson is another Deepak Chopra.   The dude is either really confused or just doesn't give a shit whether what he says is actually true or not.  Can't muster much respect for that nonsense."
"This is pure gold! The New Yorker brought me here and I'm really enjoying this channel.  Peterson is a fraud, and I have the strong feeling that he just don't know much about Marxism. The main line of argument of Peterson against Marx and Marxism is his accusation of 'collectivism' and degrading the dignity of the individual. But he's also wrong on that. That applies, of course, to regimes that claimed to be 'Marxist' like Stalin's Soviet Union or Mao's China, but certainly not to Marx himself and many in the intellectual Marxist tradition (often quite critical with actually existing communist regimes). This famous passage in 'The German Ideology' makes absolutely clear that the ultimate goal of Marx was the freedom of the individual (of all individuals, not just a few, and maybe that's what rattles Peterson):"
""
"'For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic. This fixation of social activity, this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us, growing out of our control, thwarting our expectations, bringing to naught our calculations, is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now.'"
"Peterson thinks teen girls are a bigger threat to Democracy than open fascists, mass murderers and torturers. Enough said."
"I like your editing and lighting! just the whole production"
"Came here for a contradictory point of view for JP's position. Problem with people subscribing to JP is that they treat his words like gospel. I like listening to him because as the lady in the video said, there is some merit to it. But surely I need to know more about the transgender people and their ideals to form any opinion on it. This video was surely helpful. Thanks boss."
"Really well done and perfectly articulated criticism that needs to be said. I love Peterson's insights into psychology, mythology, narrative, etc. But the constant return to that phrase has the unfortunate byproduct of de-legitimizing the competency of the left (and rhetorically it comes across is in totality, when he does himself hold classically liberal values), which is now needed more than ever if it is, to use his words, 'the only real force and bulwark we have against inequality.' I just hope now that he has the kind of resources anyone would dream for that he pivots to a goal of bridging the divide, because he's obviously completely brilliant. He also said that when the activists attacked him that he 'took it personally,' and man, it appears that he took it very personally. So I'll bring it back around by bringing up an ancient tribe known as the Toltecs, and their so called 'religion' was based around 4 agreements, now somewhat popularized in the self help market as well. One if them is to take nothing personally. And that meme could stand to flood through all of 'the west' and do nothing but good along the way. Bravo. And also, who has all of the actual political power? This sure does help them out a lot, and I see more signs of a path towards tyranny there (along with Timothy Snyder, the historian who is an expert on Tyranny) than I do walking around with signs and catchy chants."

"For me, Peterson has managed to put words on where our society (especially scandinavia, i live there) is heading, which, i've had a hard time to do before, i knew something was wrong and i knew i was upset about the PC and radical feminist mindset. But he brought more than i could've thought, and made me able to feel more control of my life through his 12 Rules book. Love JP 💙"
"Just a minor nit to pick. Being compelled by law to keep arbitrary pronouns straight is not liberty. Being able to request that someone uses certain pronouns is. You can have freedom FROM something, be it persecution and war or discrimination and abuse, but you can't have the freedom to demand something positive. Then it becomes a right. I would refer to a trans person by the pronoun of the gender they are transitioning to out of respect, courtesy and simplicity, but making it so that it is criminally negligent to misspeak wouldn't really make trans people very popular, would it? Jordan Peterson doesn't really argue that you shouldn't call a trans woman she and her, he argues that you shouldn't be required by law to call this person zij/ze/zijn/zichzelf and that person jhey/jhem/jheir/jheirself, and if you mix it up it's a hate crime and a felony. Jordan Peterson is also of the radical opinion that you should be able to say things that upset people, and that restricting your freedom of speech is very dangerous. There are things he says that I don't quite agree with, of course, and it might be a limitation of your humorous format, but I think that in several cases you are somewhat disingenuous in your portrayal of Peterson's points. The infamous lobster-debacle really revolves around there being measurable differences in serotonin levels in lobsters depending on their dominance and authority in hierarchical structures, and how those differences are mirrored in humanity. People have since blown this point way out of proportion, and Peterson doubles down on it since it's good science."
"GOD SAVE THE LOBSTER QUEEN"
"This is an exceptional video for a leftist trans person.. but there are many mistakes.. namely the definition of idpol, what JP means by the underpinnings of cultural Marxism, and the whole lobster spiel of course..   I’m almost tempted to enter the yt scene just to expound on this.. not sure you’ll see this though so I’ll just stop here for now."
"'So much for the tolerant Jacobins' has got to be one of your best quotes imo"
"You single-handedly slayed the pettiness that is JP, my queen! 🙇🙇🙇"
"'So much for the tolerant Jacobins!'  -- quote of the day."
"I just want to say thanks for these videos.  You have the best thought out, most considerate, entertaining, and watchable leftist content on YouTube.  Please run for president."
"literally"
"I'm a fan of Peterson but I'm so glad somebody's criticizing him and keeping him in check. Laughed my ass off at this video as well subb'd"
"Chapo"
"Well great, now I am no longer sure if I'm a Marxist or a post-modernist. Peterson must hate me."
"So... it straight up starts with a lie (01:25)? But OK, I'll bite and watch more."
"Great mansplaining"
"I have watched 2 or 3 of Jordan Peterson lecture clips before I start to see how toxic his fanbase is."
"Heard of you on the el chapo podcast. Thanks for being a powerful voice on the left."
"This is actually fantastic. As somebody who enjoys Peterson's talks, this is a solid and intelligent critique of his points. I really hope Daddy sees this and engages with it, it'd be very enjoyable to watch."
"Magnificence. Pure magnificence."
"12 Rules for Life(Scrotie McBoogerballs)"
"Thanks you SO MUCH for this clever, detailed and well-researched perspective.  I've been following JP for about a year now, mainly because his 12 rules were very helpful for my brother when he was going through a tough time and needed to get his act together.  However I always thought a lot of his political arguments were weak and contrived, but it was difficult to verbalize exactly what it was.  Especially when the point of reference to his work is usually that Cathy Newman interview.  I appreciate the way you've broken down the conflicts in his philosophy, since he is intentionally slippery in expressing his viewpoints on this (as well as his 'belief in God' which is a different conversation entirely).  I had no idea who you were until I heard you on Chapo Trap house Today, but very impressed with your work in this video.  Gracias."
"You are a delightfully perfect lobster suffle."
"Made my day. Thank you! That Derrida comment... I was battling with Derrida a few years ago, and my dad went... you know, in stead, read this thing here by Rorty. Never went back."
"Postmodern Neo-Marxism isn't a coherent philosophy, it's a labeling for a social movement that values both philosophies at the same time. For example, you seem to glorify both Marx and the postmodernists as being intellectual powerhouses, and you're writing for an audience in which these two perspectives on the world are allied. From the perspective of a liberal, postmodern neo-marxist refers to a group of people that you can actually identify in the real world, whether or not they have an articulated unifying philosophy."
"Why the fuck are you obsessed with milk?"
"“Don’t exploit the workers, do not do blackface” 💀"
"I cannot wrap my head around how Peterson is a public speaker with that voice of his. I can’t watch him or Shapiro because of their shrill voices."
"When Peterson talks about postmodern neo-marxism, he is not talking about people,  he is talking about underlying principles in philosophy. You can't refute that by saying he is talking about a hodge podge of people so it doesn't make sense.  You need to address those underlying principles.  The postmodernist position of relative morality and truth that is shaped and biased based on lived experiences is at the root of argumentation by neo-marxism.  The way Jordan Peterson talks about Neo-marxism, it is another term for intersectionality and critical theory.  Sure... you are not interpreting his ideas uncharitably... but you are also not addressing his ideas at all.  You just say 'I am not sure what he is talking about, but clearly he has lumped a bunch of people into a category that I can't find a connection between so he must be a lunatic'.  You seem afraid to argue this one.  Or you are being willfully deceptive."
"Checking out your video after your interview on Chapo"
"As a Jordan Peterson fan, I must say: What a great video!! everyone should watch this!"
"Grrr it's pronounced like 'to me' , Camus : Kɑ: mɨ  without u or s sound"
"The content is good!"
"“So much for the tolerant Jacobins” is still probably my favorite unexpected joke I’ve ever heard"
"What is your opinion on Martha Nussbaum?"
"I blindly worship you, my Queen."
"Daddy Peterson"
"God Save the Lobster Queen!!"
"sooo off topic but I can’t help but mention I LOVE that wallpaper"
"Does TERF lady have a name?"
"Peterson is a moral relativist, though. He thinks that because it is good for him to be in a hierarchy where he has power, that this is morally good. He might not explicitly say it, but the distance is paper thin. And of course, he might know not to say it out loud because that makes it easier to excise a cockroach."
"When dealing with Jordan Peterson, the easiest way to get him to stfu is probably to take him into a laboratory with real scientists. One scientist is tasked with finding the genes responsible for the colour of a mouse's fur, and Peterson must do this as well.  Now, the scientist is going to win.  Scientist then goes on to tell Peterson to stfu trying to argue for the existence of genetic predispositions for God or any particular trait to do with political positions of power. And the scientist is more credible, because he is producing more results in front of a real fucking audience.  Done. Peterson's argument completely refuted, credibility questioned, and now he has to argue from the perspective of his feelings. Is that a nice thing to do? Who cares about being nice? After all, isn't that just sentimentality? What about doing the right thing? Oh no, ohhhhhh no what have you do-"
"9:49 THE POSTER IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE MUSCLE MAN WITH THE WOMAN! IT'S A FEMININE DICK! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH"
"Oh no it's them again, I'm not ready for this."
"I wonder if it ever occurred to Jordan Peterson that it's just as inevitable for civilizations to rebel against hierarchies as it is for hierarchies to form in the first place"
"I'm like 99% sure that your definition of identity politics is wrong. Identify politics is the formation of identity groups and the relationships between those groups."
"I'm so glad you make your videos."
"Also, it's funny how you say that marxism and postmodernism can't be together, which ACTAULLY is PETERSONS Point! He asks himself, how the fuck did they get together so  successfully?? So yeah, that's not a point against him, he knows that it is contradictory, he called them out on that. You simply can't use that against him.."
"U are funny, and adress him more or less fairly, at least u intent to be fair, that's good enough. But I really think u should take whats happening at the universities more seriously. If university isn't serious, then why do we consider it one of the most important institutions of our culture? Why did women march and protest to study, if studying isn't that important and doesn't shape our world at all?  U see it's obvious that this stuff is important, what happens in universities translates in to the real world with politics. Many of the concepts used in 'gender law' are based on unscientific grievance-studies. In my country, Argentina, (yeah this shit is world wide) the 'mental health law', is predicated on the hypothesis that mental disorders are social constructs. So the State sends a group of 'professionals' to control if the patients u admit in to the hospital, are rightly admitted, and they will keep the controls for the whole treatment every 3 months. This ended up in the increase of homeless people, but anyway, the real problem is that the state is telling scientists, and health professionals what they must think, which hypothesis are or aren't right. That's not right. That is terrible.  So u may argue that psychiatry really messes up sometimes, but if we are fair here, and I talk from the perspective of a psychology and Medicine student, most malpractice happens around other fields of medicine.  So why not control them too? why not control the surgeons, or the cardiologists? is it worse to wrongly diagnose a patient with suicidal risk, than a patient with tuberculosis, which has a year long treatment? Well, this selective state-orwellian-control happens because the biological sciences aren't as infested in the universities with the postmodernists as the humanities are, among which we have psychology.  So yes, my point is: what happens in the universities, matters a lot."
"'A bowl of creamy tomato soup' in the Patreon list makes me happy, VERY happy. Also, with respect to JP we are watching a man in the throws of a midlife crisis."
"I actually am that kind of postmodernist that tovarisch Peterson is talking about. I find the way  society is now unacceptable and i want to see it burn to the ground. If something better emerges from the destruction, so much the better, if it won't - well, we didn't really lose anything of value. A lot of people on the Internet are afraid of oncoming destruction of 'the West' and they are right to do so. It is burning down and there really is no stopping it. What is coming is a globalist society that is going to sweep everything, destroying the old. And it was 'the West' that started all that when it impregnated 'the East' (and everywhere else on the planet) with itself. Now the child is born. It devoured 'the East' and now it's coming back to devour 'the West'. All hail the devouring child! Down with nations! Down with gender! Down with social roles! Down with religion! Down with tradition! Down with labels! Burn! Burn! BURN! Ahahahahaha!"
"I absolutely love the lighting of your videos It might be fun to try to replicate it in my art"
"you know Dave came his pants when she said his name at the end."
"“So much for the tolerant Jacobins.” 😂"
"I adore your references to Divine 💖"
"Peterson is a nut job especially when he talks about spirituality and drugs.  You and he need a group session talking about reality and how to stop trying to escape it."
"Channel is amazin! :D Keep it up, proud of u <3  I think Peterson mentions judeo-christian values and 'the west' all the time simply because postmodernists claim there is no such thing as western culture and even promote self loathing. Postmodernists also tend to deem most if not all religions harmful or disregard them as pure superstition. This is atleast true from my own experience growing up in highly postmodernist Sweden. I will grant you (and the 'postmodernists') the point that 'the west' is conceptually somewhat exclusionary. I would assume, however, that this is the exact reason Peterson usually uses the term judeo-christian values instead. Point is, it is not Jordan who is separating postmodernism from the west, it is the postmodernists themselves."
"fucking love this channel"
"2:05 doesn’t Cathy Newman work for channel 4 news, not the bbc?"
"I'm a very centrist person with a Christian background. Of course I gravitated towards Peterson. But I also know he isn't perfect. Thank you for such a brilliantly researched analysis! Very eye opening. Different perspectives are necessary to encourage intellectual thinking. I mostly appreciate how civil you were with your counter points. We need more civil discussion."
"Just found your channel. You're inspiring. Thank you for doing research."
"Dear Contrapoints, I just had an epiphany. The reason why I turned into such a sexist, racist, western chauvinist, bigot right-winger, literally Hitler over the last couple of years is not because I hold all of these ideas on the right so particularly dear. If Contrapoints were every left-winger, debate would be invigorating and productive and most of all logical. The reason why I fight the anti-leftist fight is because I feel the clutches of a (social) dictatorship.   This is probably (more or less) how any marginalized group has been feeling within western society since the dawn of enlightenment. It´s just new to me. Over the last 40 years or so all kinds of originally non-alligned currents on the left started to see their historical chance. It was the first time that our society was susceptible to these ideas that were already (partially) up to 150 years in the making and everyone jumped on the moving train. Panicky with a couple of generations of oppression still fresh in their collective memory they felt that they needed to shove their ideas down peoples throats as long as they had a chance. Conservative western society, well fed, bored with media overexposure, took it and didn´t complain with the confidence of a (still) dominant father who indulges the hierarchal ambitions of an angry teenage son. What happened next is what always happens when a new kid becomes boss, they overdo it. Old, confident systems have the luxury of being liberal, revolutions always turn into dictatorships first. What we experience now is the winners desire to utterly kill the defeated opponent, so he may never rise again. This method however doesn´t always succeed ( though it did actually succeed more times than not in history). Many rather left-wing or centrist minded people just had a few points of disagreement with the new system, perhaps they wanted to debate these, perhaps they just wanted to be left alone. But the new system kicked in their doors, forced them to submit and declared them personae non grata. This will wake up even the most well fed John Doe. A very large chunk of western society just got  disenfranchised. No one asked them whether they wanted those changes and if any one dared to utter discontent they got immediately ostracized. The left split the West in half, they assigned everyone to a side. Debate was off the table. Logic, reason, all unimportant in the face of superior force, do as we demand because we say (feel) so. Naturally people on the 'bad side' now fled into the internet echoe chambers, aka 'safe spaces' that were just waiting there for them like the funnel of a lurking spider. Of course then the people on the left, for the first time seeing their boogeyman for real (the one they til now didn´t even really believe in and only used as a tool to socially kill opponents), doubled down on the attempted disenfranchisement. In turn the new 'bad guys' dove even deeper into the murky waters. In turn the left-wing mainstream pushed even harder and so on and so on. All of this because of a very rushed power transfer, because of the insecurity of the victor. The left might very well end up inadvertently destroying its own success (if not much more in the wake of it) . If the left would have been as rational and at eye level as Contrapoints, literally millions of people on my side would have never fled the mainstream."
"Oh. My. God: THOSE NAILS!!!"
"Wow, I learn more from this channel  than I learn at school. Congrats!"
"Shall we point out that one of the Patrons is a bowl of creamy tomato soup. I love it"
"I love this channel!!!!"
"I wonder how many of his new fans really even care that much about the 12 rules stuff versus all of his 'anti-SJW' stuff.  I mean yeah a lot of new fans are buying his books and all but it's not clear to me that this is what drew them to him.  I think they're just happy someone is going after the 'SJWs' on an academic level."
"As a Peterson fan and a kind of anti-sjw, I enjoyed your video a lot. I went from almost sjw to sjw hater and now I think I'm achieving some sort of balance. I still think identity politics are stupid though. Anyways, thanks for your insights, your humor and light-heartedness. It's very much appreciated!"
"Well 'it' tried"
"I don't know if I'm scared or intrigued"
"#Contrapoints your video about incels (who was raising her head every time I opened YouTube. Happy she did.) brought me here. You should seriously consider interviewing JP. High time we stopped getting trapped into being confused by popular jargons. Awesome content. And presentation. And humour. Glad to have found you 😊"
"If a guy who works in a discipline that was maligned by religion for as long as it exists tries to tell me that the basis for western civilization is the judeo-christian paradigm then I am immediately identifying cognitive dissonance at the root of the argument."
"Isn't Peterson also a climate change denier? That's one thing to not take him seriously."
"While I respect the effort and comedy of this video, I think Jordan Peterson's idea about 'post-modern neo-marxism' is simpler than what you are thinking. The post-modern probably refers to 2015 and beyond, citing the lefts drive to throw out traditional liberalism for progressivism. The neo-Marxist part probably refers to the action they take to change this and make people equal by outcome or equity, except referencing oppressed groups of race, sex, and other identities (hence the 'neo' part). So the first part is the context and the second part is the action. Also, it is implied to everyone that the left's overall beliefs contradict themselves."
"PCP jokes are the best."

"It’s not that we have not heard them because I grew up 22 years in Christianity. It’s that there are hypocritical examples all around that made such simple life rules seem utterly meaningless and what should have gave me meaning had a total opposite draining effect of my life instead of fulfilling it  Amazing channel"
"Isn't telling people what NOT to do, the same as telling them what to do?   Truly it is.   I have watched Peterson and he does have a different perspective on life, but he isn't against others having their freedom-he is against those who want to push a chaotic state into society.  I do see where he comes from.   Trust me, I have wanted to speak with him too as an otherkin-(Elvenkin to be more clear). I hope one day he is able to have more rational discussions with those who are of a different lifestyle than him to understand people more, coming from their perspectives.  He is a bit conservative and isn't as free spirited as us. Have compassion."
"Thank you SO MUCH for deconstructing all of this. I’m very gray politically, and I thought for sure my gray peers would see how fucking creepy and manipulative this guy’s statements were... but instead so many were agreeing - even some seemingly left leaning ppl. People I looked up to promoting this guy, essentially telling me I should hate my life and be sad. Thought I was going crazy for being the only one sensing something “off” about him."
"I don't know what it's like over there, but here in Sweden, all the left does is telling people how to behave, what to think, what to do, who to hate (and they don't spare the hate) etc.   Great video!"
"Woooooosh"
"I like your commenting dtyle, but your understanding of post-modernism and Peterson is greatly flawed  to me. Here’s one significant thing to me: you’ve articulated that postmodernism deconstructs everything, but you’ve overlooked one thing that it leaves behind and makes sacred: power. Power is the thing that today’s postmodernism does not deny, and that explains the construction of all other systems. Peterson maintains that identity politics and marxism are ways of exercising power over others."
"DFW & 'other white guys who talk about lobsters' made my day. Can DFW actually be promoted among Peterson's fans in this way?"

"Second video I've watched on your channel, and I can't get enough. Honestly, you kind of remind me a lot of my girlfriend (Who also happens to be transgender) who has a very similar sense of humor to you. You have a really interesting channel, and so far, I really can't get enough."
"Mais um inscrito depois desse!"
"This was so interesting, but you did a straw-man when you said he dismisses the entire modern left, and decided to interpret his term 'Post-modern neo Marxism' as a nonsensical contradiction instead of a logical conclusion based on his idea Foucaultism/Derridaism.   I don't know how accurate he was in his interpretation of those 2 fellas cause I didn't read 'em, but I think he thinks that their argument is 'All accomplishment is the product of the unequal distribution of power', (you can see the parallel to Marx), and his concern is a political shift towards Marxist ideology will result in the kind of turmoil that it did last time that happened.   In the aesthetics video that one character said you need to be accepted into your role by society, and cannot force people to respect your view of yourself. I think he would agree with that, and further that argument by saying: 'If you managed to do that the results would be catastrophic'.   So as well thought out as this is, you're not arguing with the nuanced person that is Jordan Peterson, your arguing with the fictionalized political pundit that left loves to hate. I understand why, it's cause his words rouse unintelligent racists and resentful men to strike back at the reasonable left and radical left alike. I don't know what the solution is, but your distillation of this man is not completely accurate, it's self serving."

"For a JBP fan, this comment section is very helpful. Most of the comments are serious and clever criticism. I want to get rid of the deadwood."

"*'Protecting transgender people under the law will lead to Stalinism'*  Strawman. Blatantly so.  Because trying to dictate the speech of a country's citizenry as to what gender pronouns they use for transgender people (as opposed to say, incitement to violence against transgenders or to incite economic discrimination against them for eg.) does NOT equate to _'protecting'_ transgenders.   And while a government trying to do that may not be as bad as say Stalinist USSR, with gulags and mass graves, notice that one of the stones that paved the way to that state of affairs was indeed thought policing and speech policing.   Is it smart to be wary of that particular slippery slope? Yes. It is."
"I don't really know why I like your videos. In fact, I find them creepy as hell, you being as pessimist as you are about human condition doesn't help either. But you seem to be so reasonable and sarcastic that end enjoying your videos"
"Love this so much. I like Peterson and can see ways in which his work can be constructive and useful for people who are losing the battle of life to meaninglessness, and has introduced the uninitiated to great traditions of philosophy, art, and science, but I also thought it would be quite easy to challenge some of his ideas and assumptions on their own merit rather than by contrived character assassination, and have been baffled by the seeming lack of desire or ability to do so. This was great work and gave me multiple lols in a library. Liked, subscribed, telling my friends!"

"lady Fopington is my everything <3 <3 <3"
"Hmm... You said 'on the left we don't talk about the meaning of life' but I don't see any valid point in that argument..."
"You started off this video by misrepresenting Peterson's stance on the Canadian pronoun law. You claim he is against protection of trans people, but he is in fact against forced use of specific language and he has expressed his fear that forcing everyone by law to use a specific language in certain situations will lead to further use of compelled speech. You should avoid this kind of misrepresentation."
"Will we be reintroduced to Lady Lobster in future episodes?"

"daddy"
"It’s amazing how a little disinterest can strip away political dogma and reveal the ideological vacuum beneath. I really appreciate this video. It seemed like a sound and fair look at this man’s ideology. I’m a centrist who strongly supports individual and civil rights (including LGBT+ rights) but finds most political ideals cross-spectrum to be problem-filled and essentially concerned with personal power-grabbing, so I like the way you look at even your own ideals without treating them as sacred. Too many people worship their ideals instead of examining them.  I’m definitely subscribing."
"there's not enough false equivalence fallacy to go around for other people to use apparently because JP has been hogging it. also his mental state is very feminine if you ask me. he loves seeing patterns when there's little to none. he severely reminds me of Kurt Weiss and the tragedy of intellectuals in which one would allow religion to stifle independent thoughts. he can't even argue a lot of his ideas without the Judeo-christian value babble. i used to think his ridiculous idea that 'Western civilization is predicated upon Judeo-Christian values' is born indirectly from his premise that only actions indicate beliefs but the more i listen to him the more i'm persuaded to believe it could also be the other way around. i mean it's not just once or twice that he has molded evidence to fit his worldviews. i mean anyone with a little awareness would've  realized how ridiculous it is to posit that computer users believe in quantum mechanics but then again no serious debater would actually redefine languages, and he has never said 'for the lack of a better term' whenever he does his redefining routine."
"This is like Bill Nye, I love it !!"
"I like how you don´t give a shit. Take my upvote!"
"There should never be laws dictating what you can or cannot say, especially on college campuses."
"I <3 this! The biggest hole in JP’s argument is that the world is not currently going down a corporately-sponsored wormhole in economic space and that there is any danger of Marxist revolution achieving anything more than gender non-specific signs on toilets and pedestrian crossings. Ineffectualism is the worst trait of the radical Left who really are powerless to stop deforestation, fracking and social spending cutbacks without actually working within the system of moderate politics and alternative energy production. Sharpen your nails bitches! And start handing out ‘how to vote’ cards..."

"Okay one thing that is important to know about Peterson that she doesn't mention at all is that Peterson is purposely misleading when he speaks about the new Canadian laws.  Peterson tells people that the laws are telling people that they have to learn the new gender terms and use them when dealing with gay or trans folks.  This is wrong.  All the new Canadian laws do is allow people to identify the gender of their choice on government forms and ID's.  Imagine your a trans woman who was born a man getting pulled over with a driver's licence stating you are a male but u appear very female.  The cop will find that suspicious and will investigate.  But with an ID stating your transitioning she seems less suspicious.  Only in government applications and processes will these laws affect anything.  Regular Joe the plumber doesn't have to learn cis, masc, top, bottom, pre or post op or any of that.  Just government forms"
"Peterson does make the 'Postmodern neo-Marxism = Cultural Marxism'. It's kind of creepy to hear him explain why Hitler's anti-Semitism was perfectly natural.   And I can't think why Peterson dumps on inter-sectionality? Hell, inter-sectionality makes perfect sense because feminists, lesbians and women of colour all have something in common. And why does he insist on this 'without god everyone's a murderer' and why is it so bad to ask that we all be treated as equals? Fuck, he's a fascist.  J.P. is a good psychologist. I wish he stuck to psychology and left politics alone, at least, don't be a fucking poster boy for PragerU."
"Definitely enjoyed your approach to the subject, and I like your use of color!   There's a disconnect between your definition of identity politics and Peterson's. Peterson describes identity politics as the tactic in which ones' sexual, racial or gender identity is used as a political qualification(hence the phrase 'check your privilege'). This definition arises from intersectionality and its concept of the western hierarchy, or referred to commonly as 'The Patriarchy'. This is a conspiracy theory, and even considered so by traditional feminists, check out the Factual Feminist video that has been done on this very subject.  As for the Cathy Newman interview: when speaking about women being under-represented in government he is alluding to the different interests that men and women inherently possess when choosing careers. This does not account for all, but most of the under-representation that you are speaking of. The overwhelming majority of people in the United States have the OPPORTUNITY to choose a career that they want to pursue. Complaining about under-representation in government without having candidates that support the interests of the majority of people is not saying anything at all, you get ELECTED not appointed. Less women actually want to be involved in politics than men do, this has been proven time and time again. When given the opportunity to choose to work towards degrees of political science and study law women choose different careers. The fact of the matter is that this can change, it is up to women who want to be involved in politics to get involved. This is what Peterson was implying, not that women shouldn't be involved in politics and what not."

"This videos are basically an opportunity for the Left to talk to its own echo chamber. Not gonna lie that the Right does the same thing, but you're not better just because you're bashing them in a position they're unlikely to respond to."

"On the plus side, he’s going to die soon because of that asinine all beef diet"
"I mean, his explanation of post-modern marxism is quite reasonable and holds up."
"Just a few things.  1) it wasn't a BBC interview, it was a channel 4 interview. Channel 4 is more left wing than the BBC, they often partner with the Guardian. 2) his basic insights are good because they haven't been heard that much before (I hadn't heard his ideas before, really) and it's a good that he helps people. 3) post modern neo-marxism is a stand in for sort of that Marxist view that infects things.  4) you can compare anyone to anyone, as long as you make a fair comparison. Just being a gender rights activist doesn't mean you necessarily dont act like Mao. 5) it's not with the purpose of destroying the West, or starting a totalitarian state, but the things they want will lead to a sort of totalitarian state by accident, but trying to do right. For example, aiming for a total equality of outcome, while sounding nice, would only be achieved really and totally through forcing people to do certain jobs. And that looks like Stalinism. 6) so, the Marxism works with post modernism, that there is no meaning, no overall meaning for life, while also thinking that millions of people are oppressed. 7) the problem is that with identity politics end up excluding others and perpetuating the same things they want to fight against. 8) JP thinks that there is wiggle room, but there are certain things concerning men and women that will probably not change. 9) it's not that the Marxist stuff is an outside threat, rather it identifies things that make up the west and wants to get rid of them."
"*Klappar händerna* I agree with some of your points, even if I sympathize with a select few of Petersons points and that gender studies have oversimplified and corrupted the distinction between sex/gender (in stark contrst to why the terms were introduced in academia for in the first place). I love the take on his abuse of that nonsensical term he uses all the time. It's typical of most right wing agitators really, especially north american ones. 'Edgyphilosophy101-Marxism' is a buzzword that is basically used as post coldwar redbaiting, started with Pat Buchannan of all people."
"what am i watching"
"I like the fact that so many of these right wing ‘intellectuals’ can only cite the ancient criticism of postmodernism which is effectively ‘I don’t like what it says about the world pls stop’. I thought facts don’t care about your feelings?"
"Honestly, I'm surprised by how dumb this video is. I though contrapoints was intelligent but apparently not. Unsub."
"honestly contrapoints, as a transfemme person i gotta say, i absolutely love your videos but every time you talk about gender I get whiplash. not because you're incoherent, not because you're wrong, but just because you're so /wild/. and HORNY. and i love it. your stuff is wonderful and please keep it up, love you!"
"So tired of this lie repeated ad infinitum and again here that no one on the left 'engages' with Jordan Peterson's ideas. It's a huge lie and needs to be abandoned. People on the left need to stop throwing each other under the bus.... oh, and people on the left do talk about 'the meaning of life'.... you know Camus was on the left. Wtf."
"Contrapoints is the embodiment of what an incel thinks a woman is, even though I think she may be a man."
"Very recently in an interview with GQ London he makes a comment about learning that the people he had been so vociferously arguing against don't exist in the numbers he had originally thought. At this point he seems to be focusing more on the arguments regarding universities, workplace, and life structure. I generally like his ideas but he does seem to get a little intense in regards to the 'post modern neo-marxist' topic. It seemed like an over- reaction but he did kind of come up in a situation where he saw a lot of it. He is an interesting fellow..."

"Any time I hear  support for Judeo Christian values my early warning radar goes up.  The idea that you need the support of some mythical divine being to backstop the fundamental idea of fairness and kindness just blows my mind.  Equally mind blowing is the fact that adults would pay money to hear some professor tell us that mythical principles of lobster governance  have something deep  to the human experience.    it makes for a good TED Talk if that's the type of thing you're into, but it is all poppycock."
"Peterson has some excellent points, but others I don't agree with.  Having your own brain and not labeling people en masse is the key.  Too bad that doesn't seem fashionable at the moment."
"Hey Contra! I’m a new subscriber and admittedly I do not subscribe to very many liberal or left-leaning YouTube channels. I find you refreshing, funny, and really engaging! Just finished watching your incel vid and that made me lol! I do want to address the lobster thing. Jordan Peterson’s use of lobsters is a bit convoluted but in his book he is suggesting that lobsters and humans share serotonin-based nervous systems, and that in lobsters, their serotonin levels increase the more they move up in their lobster hierarchies, with higher levels of aggression induced by higher levels of serotonin. He believes that we need to adopt the aggressiveness of lobsters and be prepared to face the challenges of upward mobility, rather than shy away from these challenges and to fear pain. Except in his vid with Newman he is also trying to show that hierarchies are not entirely social constructions, as they are deeply connected to our biological impulses toward order/power. (Cont)"

"He’s a fucking piece of shit."
"I disagree with the definition of identity politics... i think the definition you gave describes all of the left. What distinguishes identity politics specifically is the idea that identity is foremost in the struggle and determines the validity of ideas, in its extreme form 'you can't say anything about X-ism unless you are X.'"
"You make a lot of good points but I've heard a fair bit from Jordan Peterson too. He explained that if a student were to ask him to use a certain pronoun for them, he would. He disagreed strongly with the idea of legally enforcing it, so that using a non-preferred pronoun would be on the same level as harassment or verbal assault. Some more... intense people suggest that using incorrect pronouns should be considered a hate crime (though they are definitely a small minority) and it could be that he has seen the radical shifts in the political space in other western areas influenced by vocal, more extreme groups. I have some concerns in that area myself after the European Human Rights Court was reported to have ruled that a woman saying that the prophet Mohammed was a pedophile was no considered free speech. (there was a bit more to the story but that's the tldr)"
"This allowed me to articulate fully the various problems I have with Jordan Peterson and his ideas. Before I would say something along the lines of, “It’s not that I think he’s a bad person or that his self-help ideas aren’t helpful, but I think he’s unfair when he talks about social issues and he doesn’t see himself as being incendiary (intentional or not).” And then when asked why I’d be like “well with how he talks about differences between men and women and how he tells Joe Rogan that he doesn’t understand why everyone was out to get him bc in his mind that Trans Rights Bill was a trap and that willful ignorance or whatever it is only further incenses his followers.” And then I would be further questioned and beat back with ‘whataboutism’ that I didn’t have the tools to fully articulate or explain back with.   This helps bridge that and show how he’s not necessarily fascist but his intentional parallelism does foster said beliefs."
"'Hello dave'. Hahaha."
"wow that was a fucking ride wow, absolutely unique funny and enlightening content"
"Jordan would destroy you in a debate you hack"
"Great video! I really appreciate this type of criticism, I'm a huge fan of Jordan Peterson and have been listening to him for a little over 3 1/2 months now and I can agree with a lot of your points and enjoy the insight and perspective you've given. I really enjoy your style of being extremely informed but also being entertaining and funny. You said you did a lot of research on what he talks about and it really shows considering you hit all of the points that he generally gives during his lectures and writing. Thanks ContraPoints! Hope your hard work pays off!"

"You keep saying 'on the left', do you think Jordan Peterson is on the right? I guess I've always thought of him as more of a centrist. I'm on the left (but closer to the centre) and I agree with a lot of what Jordan Peterson has to say. Definitely not his religious nonsense though."
"Actually, more to my last point - I would love to see a conversation between you and Peterson (or at least his response to your video)"

"it rubs the lotion on its skin!"
"WOW! just wow! the depth of your  knowledge combined with the beauty of your artistic video is really mind boggling."
"I had to look up your pre photos and was hit with that same disappointment when you find out that really hot guy is gay  :( But it now makes since why you are attractive as a female because you just got them kinda genes. Love the powder wig btw :)"
"To me it seems that both modernism and post-modernism had it wrong; the grand narrative structures of the 19th and 20th centuries are naive and simplistic and fail to explain a large amount of the human condition, but just because the problem is hard doesn't mean that it's impossible. Maybe we just can't figure it out yet."
"I watch JP since a year. i am a very big fan of him, and can say best JP critic i saw so far.  I have spent a few hours in the past watching and reading critics of him and all were very very flawed, and the motivations of the writers/speakers very very questionable.  This one was good and with many additional thought routes for me i will think about.  Its the 1st good critic i saw."

"I got a CRTV.com ad at the start of this video..."
"I think you are really missing most of Peterson's points and focusing too much on small details rather than his overall thesis. He is proposing that neo-Marxist type ideologies (And all that matters is how HE defines neo-Marxist, which is simply a vague sort of victim-complex) are dangerous to the foundational ideas of western democracy. The (broad and varied) ideologies that we see today from the left mirror the types of Marxist ideologies of the late 19th and early 20th century.  Namely, a focus on class identification and advocation of class restructuring. These ideas, in and of themselves, are not bad or evil but they often lead to disastrous consequences. It is these same types of ideologies and fixations on dismantling class structure that led to socialist revolts in the early 20th century. These revolts cause power struggles and, almost always,  mass atrocities. Essentially, progressives are getting ahead of themselves and trying to mess with complex and poorly understood systems due to their sense of 'social justice'. JP simply advocates being wary of this type of social movement and, instead of focusing on classism, focus on individualism and liberty."

"Lobster queen NOOOOOO XO"
"Bad video to watch drunk.   Lol"
"omg this is a load of shit i started laughing my head off after the 1st line"
"As someone who identifies with Peterson's teachings, this was a pretty nutty video. I was shocked how reasonable and intelligent this video is; I learnt about some aspects of philosophy that I was missing. Whilst I don't see this video as the quintessential rebuttel to Peterson's world-view as some other commenters do,  I greatly appreciate the quality of the hosts analysis.  I remember years of discourse with my brother regarding evolution vs creationism. At one point he showed me a video showing the 'scientific explanation' of the Grand Canyon as the result of the biblical flood. There was enough scientific nomenclature that it required a competence in geology and a myriad of other disciplines to refute. He found relief in the video, and a visceral attachment to it as the apparent intellectualism on display was a synthesis of science and religion: irrefutable logic bolstering his spirituality.   Now, I make no connection between faux-science and the hosts assertions; that would be disingenuous. What I do find corollary is that having a eloquent, well read and seemingly smarter-than-us proponent giving counterpoints to a perspective that we already inherently disagree with can give an audience the feeling that the thinking has been done for them, that grappling with these intimidatingly complex issues has already been done, and the solutions have already been found. The danger is that active critical thinking ceases. This can be applied just as readily to Peterson as it can this channel, no doubt about that.   I'm finding the more I digest the arguments and counter arguments of the current zeitgeist, the more I am required to think and re-evaluate my preconceived notions. This is my takeaway from this video.   Now to dig through some of the other ContraPoints videos, cause this is some good shit, whatever your bias."
"It wasn't a BBC interview it was a Channel 4 interview."
"Compelled speech with the penalty of being jailed for non compliance is a western idea? Maybe so far west it came from the east...like say the USSR or PRC.  Peterson is still a post modernist and has no objective foundation for truth or morals just like everyone else. He has a jail cell with a window basically as he sees the disaster the post modern post truth capitalist funded marxists are brining on the west. He has no antidote, just morphine to make the death of the west a little more comfortable."
"As I keep watching your videos, i love your knowledge and your ways to pass on. Also the music! My congratulations to Zöe!"
"PCP!!"
"Maybe Mr. Peterson is bored."
"So I'm a rather conservative gal (who is also a JBP fan)  but I think you brought up some very interesting points that I hadn't considered before. Nice video."
"CLOCK ME ARMADEUS"
"OK listen, I am a person who generally agrees with most of what Jordan Peterson says and what most anti-SJW's say. I came here because I heard that you had a lot of good counterpoints to what he and other anti-SJW's say and I wanted to hear an alternating opinion. I have not however heard you make very many points in this video, just a lot acting, comedy, and sarcasm. If you really wanted to convince people that certain ideas that Jordan or other anti-SJW's have are wrong you might want to try doing so in a far more concise and formal manner. Make your 'ContraPoins' quickly articulately explain what supports them and why they are they are good points. Most people who watch your video are going to get turned off in the first few seconds by all of your comedy and dramatic flair, as it appears that you really have nothing to say and are only projecting emotion. I have watched your video for 11 minutes and the only point that I have been able to derive from it thus far that Jordan's criticisms of the post modernists is similar to what the Nazis used to say about the communists. OK, well, that may be true, but just because the Nazis said something doesn't mean that what they said was wrong. Communism did kill far more people in the world than the Nazis did, and that still continues to this day. You also keep misrepresenting things that Jordan has said; postmodernism is the idea that truth is relative, and objective truth doesn't exist. Following from this are ideas that gender is a social construct, making people feel uncomfortable should be criminalized, IE women who 'feel' like they were assaulted were assaulted because they felt like it, etc. etc. This is why HR departments will fire any man because of a mere accusation and waste huge amounts of time on sensitivity training. This is the connection between post modernism and hr departments. I will continue to look through youtube for alternative opinions to 'the influencer network' but you I won't take seriously. Try to make videos more like Three Arrows if you want me to do that."

"Postmodern neo-Marxism in Peterson's parlance is the combination of 'deconstruct the existing norms as meaningless and do what I say' (~postmodernism) and 'engage in class-wars of identity politics where your group is wrong and fascist and my group is obviously right and woke' (neo-Marxist) attitudes common in vocal SJW circles and one that is influencing the general public and corporations for fear of backlash and violence. You know - the cultural fascism so in vogue in modern social media.   Surprising it's not clear to someone who've seen and read Peterson for hours, as she has described it."

"I honestly don't get why anyone considers him a good public speaker. I must be alone in this, but I swear every time I try and listen to him talk about anything I get lost; not because I'm just too stupid to understand, but because he speaks in such obtuse terms, and in such a faux-intellectual way that it just sounds like he's having a stroke. His interview with Cathy Newman is a great exception to this as he was very eloquent there, but in his lectures he sounds like he just hit a pipe and watched a Joe Rogan podcast and is tryna tell me about it. Telling me to go read a whole book because you don't understand a concept enough to explain to me is not sufficient Jordan"
"I think you're a genius."
"Misogyny is on the rise, world-wide. The cult around Jordan Peterson, The Proud Boys, MRA (Men`s Rights Activists), Incels etc. are only a tiny fragment of it. This is the other side of the 'cult of male supremacy' that is gaining more and more support. Anti-feminists are against the equality of men and women. This needs more awareness. Instead, the mainstream media fawns over Jordan Peterson who 'helps' young men by telling them that they are superior to women, who are by 'nature' made to be mothers an nothing but. The mainstream media still sees misogyny as permissible. And there lies the problem!"

"Wow. After watching your video, I realize that Dr. Peterson has a lot of issues in regards to using too many logical fallacies and not wanting to hear the other side. I also don't like that he makes people guess what he means."
"I like a lot of Jordan Peterson's stuff, but he is not right about everything. He's wrong about transgender people. There's nothing wrong with respecting pronouns. I don't think he should go to jail or lose his job over it, but criticizing his ideas about pronouns is not evil or being against freedom of speech."

Manners and cultural etiquette is seriously under threat. Targets gender equality? Yeah Peterson targets the sexists who are trying to legislate 'equality'...

"My criticism is the right knows what he's talking about and whenever he has a conversation with someone from the left they're trigger happy and fall into those traps. People on the right for the most part don't think women are inferior to men but that they're different, the left tends to think different implies weaker. It's almost like both sides speak in different languages.   There's this thing I've noticed. My right wing friends on facebook when talking about the left are dismissive saying they're snowflakes that all they care about is virtue signalling and feelings ignoring facts and refusing to have conversations.   Meanwhile my left wing friends are sharing posts saying (and this is paraphrasing) 'Just try owning nazis, fascists, the right wings instead of trying to have a conversation. It's not to convince them they're stubborn and won't change their minds, worry about having a good argument so that other people will side with you' or comparing hearing both sides to something stupid like 'don't eat food that's just what big food wants you to think.' (These were shared not by idiots but by people who are going to school to be neurosurgeons and the like.  Then you've got people like the Golden One who say 'Be polite, respectful, and educated. Let them tear themselves down while we just look glorious' And the left still wonders why national socialism is on the rise. It's because you won't talk to people with different opinions for fear of having a worse one. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if national socialism became mainstream if this keeps up.  TL;DR The right is arrogant and stubborn but the left is too afraid of conversation and the hidden meaning of people's words and ns people are the most reasonable looking people. You all suck."

"I'm the person who likes listening to Contra, Peterson, Shapiro -- because I like challenging my own viewpoints, and not one of them entirely captures my worldview.  Some I disagree with more than others, but each have something in common...  Each of them gives the 'otherside' of an argument it's due, in one way or another.  Shapiro may be firm in his opinions, and present them frankly, but he is never really uncivil -- he isn't hateful or rude, nor does he generally resort to insult.  That doesn't mean some of his ideas aren't intolerably dumb.  But, if you check out his show, he's very often contradicting his 'base' and routinely tries to hold his own side accountable (which is very tough to do with Trump around).  Peterson tries to give the 'devil his due' -- e.g.to the issue of inequality, while arguing against 'equality of outcome', he also points out that inequality is a deep problem that, should we fail to address, can destabilize things quite badly.  Plus, he's pretty eccentric, so you take some of it with a grain of salt.  (Oh, and he's from Canada -- I realise in the U.S., things are quite different, but any major Canadian city really is as wacky and far left as he makes it sound).  Contra does a great job of not only being reasonable, and presenting strong arguments -- she's also really, really funny!  That is such a welcome relief from the real 'screeching snowflake' types (because let's face it, there are plenty of them out there, hence the overused trope).  Also, please try to get all of these IDW types to come on your show -- I want to see how you'd light them!  Keep up the great work Contra!"
"Who is that picture of in the far right of the frame? The woman posing in a bikini?"
"i think you get one main distinction wrong.   It's not about postmodern neo-Marxism aiming to destory society, but rather a system that addopts marxism is destined to fall.   I would sum up my thoughts like this: The main danger comes from the fact that marxist ideas are 'easy to learn' and you are able to reap short term benefits from it, but you sacrife short term gain for long time benefit."

"It is actually not that difficult to be a postmodern neo-Marxist. The economic power battle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat may be a grand narrative but it is a description of a power differential between two groups across time therefore it can be in keeping with a postmodern interpretation of Marxism and can land you with a clear conscience effort to remove the red fear of Marxism in the west."
"Peterson's philosophy (the parts I have listened to) has some good points, try and be productive and helpful; and bad points, black and white thinking and placing certian groups in a position of supremacy over others. Although, if you watch closely, I think he has to do the fascie bits to get the rest of the message out.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uGCWT2wvUI"

While you condemn the transphobics views of JP, and especially is comparisons between transactivism and maoism, and transphobia generally in your videos. But defined gender by biology rather than personal feelings, or social constructs, is an erasure of trans folks. So, it's obviously wrong and transphobic. And it's obviously contradictory to hear this two opposites ideas defended by the same person in the same video ! oO #WontBeErased"

"I really like you and I love the sound of your voice, but you are not very easy to follow. I get lost often, it's all too fast for me, too intellectual. Idk why I had the need to say this. I will still try to watch your vids and stay subscribed to your channel. I wish you all the best."
"that video was Divine!"
"The thing about Peterson is that he tries to refute Thing A by arguing Thing B and makes no fucking point whatsoever. Then it's up to your poor soul to decode WHAT he actually means, and if you interpret it as something bad he dodges it by claiming he said no such thing. OF COURSE NOT, YOU'RE TOO COWARD TO MAKE ANY GODDAMN ACTUAL LOGICAL INFERENCE EITHER GOOD OR BAD OR NEUTRAL OR ALIEN."

"how can i like and dislike this video don't think it represents 'jp' accurately, but it looked like it was going somewhere interesting for a while anyway - the key to understanding jp is that he is a therapist with an entirely left-wing, feminist agenda in terms of outcome, yet with significant empathy for criminals and impotent conservatives.  he sees them as valid, with a place in the world, yet lacking the cultivation and inclusion they need to be positive instead of destructive i did like your attempt to analyse and critique 'jp' - although it looks like many people are doing this, virtually none of them are.  however, you just tapered off, and stopped making sense. he's literally the opposite of fascist or mra, and in terms of practical outcomes, he is the most successful feminist of this generation don't get hung up on his concern about social constructivist neo-marxists; it's an extension of a personal vendetta from his university.  it's his ego being upset by the attacks from people whom he should be in dialogue with - and it's clear that there is a war against him, so i don't think we should be surprised by his reaction.  he has lightened up on that, though"

"mmm the mood lighting is delightful. also wow! fantastic channel :) new sub"
"Heard some shit kid no one likes talking about lobsters and I asked him about it.  Before he ran away crying about pepe memes and trump he told me to check out akira the don, I've gotta say it's the same pathetic vibe lol  It's funny how those worried most about strength and virtue are the polar opposite of what those values entail."
"Ugh, thank you for all of your videos. The topics you talk about are so important and I really appreciate your use of you know... actual logic. <3"
"This was really funny. But you clearly miss the points completely in several areas. But it’s whatever, fun video."
"Ya know, I'm a girl that got sucked into the righty, anti-feminist parts of the internet (I love video games and thus I got sucked up into gamergate and feminist frequency kerfuffle) but I've been trying to get out of the echo chamber I got stuck in. Your channel has been a great lean into the other side I've needed. You break things down and seem to thought your own way through a lot of ideas I've heard only telephoned across tumblr. But most importantly you're very entertaining, brovo and thank you  Also you look a lot like Emily Blunt"
"I'm not gonna kiss your hand you weirdo!"
"Subbed so hard I broke my mouse :("
"I have never learned so much in a YT video. Thank you ContraPoints"
"Whenever Dr Peterson mentions post neo Marxism simply insert group identify politics. This is what he is referring to and why he draws connections between progressive activists of today and the far left of the last century. They both share a moral crusade for a distinct identity group which if you are not a member of and have disagreement with, you become the problem. In the last century that usually meant death or imprisonment, today it means you are a supporter of the patriarchy and must be censored or ostracized, with a good bit of public ridicule thrown in for good measure.   Great video, it made me laugh and think. There are certain arguments here made that are valid to make but can be challenged. But I'm hungry and I'm going to cook lunch instead."
"i like you, but i disagree with you here :)"

"'Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Will Make You Dislike Them' Never have children if this is a mentally you have because omg you will never let your child do anything"
"one thing that immediately stood out to me (full disclosure, on a a lot of things i agree with Peterson) is how you introduce Jordan Peterson. He id not sound an alarm on how protecting transgender people would lead to Stalinism, he sounded an alarm on a law  that was trying to impose compelled speech, and how such laws ( compelled speech imposing) are a common practice in totalitarian regimes.  eg.: USSR (the third Reich is just as good of an example)"
"Craaaab people craaaab people taste like crab look like a vague psychologist. ..... ...i tried to make a joke with the crab people from south park bc lobsters are like long crabs idfk. Anyways i didn't even know this guy exists but here i am watching a video on bc i love your videos. So like, you make some gorgeous videos to get me to watch a video of some guy i never heard of. Yes. Queen."
"Funny how many conservatives say they promote individualism, when they all spout the same second hand rhetoric."
"Love your aesthetic!  I think the presentation of Peterson's arguments here don't go deep enough. Peterson goes into things with a high degree of nuance in his lectures and writings that isn't presented in the debates or news interviews, or in this video. At the level of analysis presented here, it's likely inevitable to unintentionally strawman him.  For example, you make the assertion that the lobster argument can be used to justify virtually any hierarchy that currently exists (your lobster mask bit was hilarious, btw XD, not sarcastic). That's true, but only because you are not making the same lobster argument that Peterson does. His assertion (right or wrong) is that postmodernists believe that hierarchies are a social construct of the western patriarchy, and that the existence of natural hierarchies that go back many million years in our evolutionary line is merely a strong counter to the postmodern assertion, not a justification for anything. He even explicitly says in several interviews that the lobster argument is not a justification for what we have. He goes on to say that discrimination against individuals for immutable traits is unjust and should be fought at every turn. However, if you take the lobster argument as it stands alone, it's easy to mock it."
"I like watching this because its literally the opposite of Fox News"
"When people resist being pinned down to a specific position in an argument it allows them to switch what they are arguing for over the course of the exchange.  I wouldn't say Jordan Peterson is guilty of this, but I just felt I needed to complain about it because I see it done so often.  Also my favorite part of this video is that part where you critique Peterson's annoying rhetorical strategy.  Bravo."
"Hey can I call you 'mommy'?"
"Everyone thinks my sister is a lesbian, but she's actually just a pianist"
"I think what Jordan Peterson is getting at is that the transgender community has an ideology that keeps it monolithic, which is sort of mob rule. He was not comparing progressivism to Mao, but the warped version of it that the very far left in the West has seemed to turn into lately. Peterson is actually a centrist, and he and Bill Maher got along very well. Bill Maher _hates_ conservatives."
"“Hello Dave.” lmao"
"My new favourite channel! You’re amazing!"
"wonderful video, please do the trashing of The West xx"
"Can you remake the academia video :3"
"I think what Peterson is trying to do is point out the biological necessity of our various gender roles, and why they keep society in order. I don't agree with EVERYTHING he says, but people ought to really think about it. I mean, for most of our evolution, things were a certain way, and now humanity is trying to be ridiculous and go against nature and natural law. Of course every time humans have done this, it leads to disaster."

"This is the only correct opinion on Jordan Peterson"
"Your first point is a complete straw man and wrong.  His concern was about compelled speech not the 'protection' of trans rights.  He even makes a valid point:  What makes you think compelled speech would even help 'protect' trans people?"
"Have to say, I usually disagree with most youtubers who identify as left leaning, despite also being left leaning, but this video did a great job painting what's wrong with some of Jordan Petersons teachings , rather than blind hate, or high emotions.  It's also one of the highest quality videos I've seen in a long time, the set changes and skits were all very refreshing, and the comedy was great.  Youve Got my sub, after watching this and your incels  video"
"Second video I watch, let me say, YOUR FREAKING HILARIOUS!

"actually, there are also some ''sjw ideologies'' exist within non western societies formed in different ways but back then we don't call them 'sj', rather we deemed that as a norm or something natural. We almost lost that sj-like norm when we got colonized and were forced to submit to 'true western values' aka western imperialism + alt right ideologies (because if we don't, we'll die).  Hence why decolonization will help us shed those values and be able to develop those good traditional ways in par with modern progress, something that the alt right heavily dislike and deemed it as some another 'sj propaganda'."

The part where you shush the Jordan Peterson dummy and then have implied sex with it (?? or something?) made me feel uncomfortable. I mean, imagine a man on YouTube doing that to a woman dummy... I don’t think a lot of people would respond well to that, even if it was a dummy of a woman in power.  But maybe I’m just being an overly sensitive snowflake. It’s quite possible. Just needed to get that off my chest. Continue on, dear youtuber!"
"This is easily the best takedown of Peterson I've seen. Cause it uses y'know...logic."

"I cannot tell is this is Satire or not. And that is what points to this being new tier of art or not."
"Lmao @ that ending. 27:83 Great vid, I feel like Peterson's train is leaving the station, but persistent and unabashed engagement with these ideas is necessary. We have to steel ourselves from the drones of fanboys and influenced young men that are ideologically ill equipped to see what they're getting themselves into. Glad I subscribed.  p.s.- My wife loves your nails."

"Don't act like JP is not aware of the conflict between the ideas of postmodernism and marxism. You can check this 3 minute answer he gave in March 2018 about postmodernism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V32WHDuy-Do&t=124m11s  For a detailed answer please check this 43m talk uploaded in July 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLoG9zBvvLQ   The reasoning behind the term is that the postmodern neo-marxist themselves are taking ideas from both movements to justify their goals, while simultaneously ignoring the inherent conflict. They are using postmodernism to prove that capitalism is just one of many economic ideas, which are equally valid (in economic sense), so that socialism is an alternative, which can lead to the same scientific and economic progress. They are also benefitting from the postmodern ideas by using them to deconstruct the society in homogeneous groups, which can be defined as oppressed. The oppressed characteristic of the group allows them to use the same rhetoric as the marxists and to view group relations as struggle for power between oppressor and oppressed (similar to the marxist view of power struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie) ."
"Clock me, Amadeus."
"your identity politics definition seems a bit biased. identity politics in itself is just people forming groups on the lines of their identity, whatever that means to them. contemporary leftist identity politics establishes the idea that identity is first and foremost(!) racial, sexual and economic. (there's right wing identity politics too) there's nothing bad about organising around social causes but this righteous activism can turn into being an angry mob and tribalism. JP's noemarxism - imo - refers to this misplaced leftwing activism. it is 'neo' cause it is new, the struggle now isn't between the worker and the capitalist but the sjw's and the patriarchy. JP's worry is that just because the initial idea is benign - much like marx's idea was - it doesn't mean it can't get out of hand, hence the comparison between maoists and trans right activists. I do agree with you about JP's evasiveness and implied biblethumping but as far as something to talk about it is an important subject to have a public discourse about, but some people on the left - and those people who are afraid of them - are making this discourse very hard or even impossible and that's why I think JP has such a huge pull. if it wasn't taboo to talk about these subjects from a neutral standpoint, JP would be a nobody."

"A Neoliberal analysis of what is being promoted by Corporations as new just policy can be seen in few ways.   The corporations and their PR media handlers are constructing and in some cases rolling out these statements and policies for their purely self interested capitalist agendas.   There's a political agenda behind these  talking points that is meant to condition the population on both sides to maintain the current established power arrangement.   Or the medium is simply just the message and short unresolvable controversy gets more clicks.   My own opinion on all these issues which the Conservatives seems to understand quite well is if you want to enact change you have actually build a lasting system of communication and realistic law reforms.   There's also another conspiracy theory angle which is the Deep State is actually in the business divide and conquer to maintain their own jobs and all the unproductive systems our taxes maintain. This is why we hardly ever see any real criticism of law and budget reform on either side in the media. Especially when these are literally what legitimize the unjust practices of the establishment. When you actually look at the laws we have on the books and the internal policies guiding prison to child welfare they are unholy in their design."
"Loved the video.  But the answer to her critique that there can't be such a thing like postmodern neo-marxism because some early postmodernists disliked marxism. I agree, on the surface they seem to contradict.   But the question I am left with is:  Where does identity politics come from then?  As she says in the video, identity politics come from postmodernism. Right?  But identity politics is just as 'grand narrative' as marxism is. It sees everything through a lense of about oppressor and oppressed, identity groups in eternal class conflict.  Wait, doesn't that sounds almost like marxism, except on, like, identities?  'Conspiracy theories' would say that the idea of identity politics is just a slight variant of marxism. But even if it wasn't, it still is a grand narrative that everyone agrees is postmodern! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics#History  And there are two examples in the short history there, of people mixing identity politics with marxist class analysis. How can that be possible when they are incompatible?  So, surely it must at least be possible. The love-child of the two in Universities over a few decades is as familiar as toast: social justice, or political correctness.  Most social justice activist both believe in postmodern philosophical ideas like social constructionism, and are strong believers in identity politics.  It's not like there's some weird conspiracy theory to claim 'social justice' exists. It's like the most standard term in both academia and HR nowadays.  Click here to see more than 200 'Social justice jobs' in the San Jose area. Yay. https://www.indeed.com/q-Social-Justice-l-San-Jose,-CA-jobs.html  Social justice and identity politics has clear roots to both marxism and postmodernism. Of the two, the postmodern influence is most clear cut. Social constructionism and relativism are just straight up core postmodern ideas, and has retained their original form in modern social justice. The politics of identity is not an innovation from postmodernism, and does on the surface seem to conflict with 'grand narrative' thing. But the grand narrative thing never was a core idea of postmodernism anyway. Why does everyone think this? I honestly think it just happens to be because it says so in the first sentence on Wikipedia on the article about postmodernism.  The core idea of postmodernism is that everything is made of language, and that things we think are true are actually just socially constructed, somewhat arbitrary arbiters of power relationships. (That's why these totalitarians desperately need to police our language by the way). That socially constructed identities are in a perpetual power-motivated conflict fits just fine with that, and adds a whole lot of energy to the philosophy.  How can you combine neo-marxism with postmodern thought? Answer: identity politics."

"Why did this guy dress up this far before Halloween!"
"Peterson  just seems to be so far up his own ass he is turned inside out"
"Seeing a genuine, intelligent person such as Jordan B. Peterson get so mis-represented and taken out of context. This is a route to madness....I would look further into his conversations with others and his lectures. He really is someone we need in this world. I couldn’t take your points seriously in this video because the way you went about it wasn’t very mature"
"As someone who admires Peterson's work and tends to agree with a lot of his ideas, I genuinely enjoyed this video. Your critique on his use of the 'postmodern neo-Marxism' label made a lot of sense and made me reevaluate my beliefs a little bit. Thanks for contributing to civil, intelligent discussion (and making me laugh in the process)."
"I think Peterson is skeptical of the emotional disposition that tries to tear down any kind of objective right or wrong, the mechanism that creates hierarchy and designates some people closer to truth, beauty, all the good stuff, on any given category. This emotional disposition naturally gravitates toward philosophies that seek to tear down those hierarchies and standards by first invalidating the very notion that one perspective is superior or more true than another, then designate the prevailing perspective as oppressive."
"love the pink flamingoes reference"
"Not 'Every hierarchy is the product of western patriarchy' but : Every hierarchy (=power structure) is the product of human psychopaths - narcissists and opportunists, regardless of their gender and regardless of  the political movement, left or right, they choose to surf on. Power does not corrupt, power attracts the inherently corrupt. The means of silencing  others are the same on the right as on the left and these means are vicious and seek to hurt and destroy. The only reason I can see for including a 'way of speaking or using language' into law is with the aim to silence people by law. Make it punishable by law the way one thinks and expresses themselves. Now that sounds a lot like politics of Mao or Stalin, does it not ?  It starts small, but it will never be enough. The psychopaths - narcissists and opportunists are already smelling blood and are already excited by the havoc they can cause in peoples lives.  I agree with Jordan Peterson that everyone should be weary of that. And Jordan Peterson was made a fine example of that on how the 'left' used every power and leverage they had to try to destroy him. The PC-community has really tried to destroy his lifes work by trying by getting him fired from his university and stripping him of his tenure. A first step is taken in the West - one of the few places where freedom of thought and speech were (past tense) a given - to make it punishable by law to speak or think in a certain way. We are on the slippery slope, we have to try to turn this around. It will not be easy.  - Keep up the good work ContraPoints, you are a much needed voice to keep conversation and debate going to prevent us from trying to destroy one another. Love from Belgium."

"What Prof. Peterson argument is that bill C16 wasn't a request for preferred pronouns, It was a mandate. The fact that the govt is involved means that there is eventually a gun behind it. Agent violates C16, Govt fines Agent, Agent refuses fine, govt sends people with guns to bring in Agent, Agent resists, Govt kills Agent. Yes the fringes on a slippery slope fallacy, but history has proven his point, when the govt starts telling people what to say then they start telling them what to think, then what to do, next thing you know all the people that don't agree are being loaded into train cars.  Western Civilization is founded on the concept of individual liberty and property rights. You are responsible for yourself and what's yours is yours. I think you were a bit literal on the term Western philosophy, that term is colloquially closer to Western values, I love that word so go ahead and judge me for using it.  I have only seen a couple of your videos, your video about incels I found bother entertaining and informative, and was really hoping for a better argument against Peterson's points, not just a critique of his choice of words to describe the modern left. A lot of people hate this guy and I can't find anyone that can really prove what he is saying is wrong where as he backs up his claims with hard evidence."
"Wow, I just discovered you through youtube recommendations, and this is truly outstanding content. Not only is it entertaining, but, as far as I can tell with my basic philosophical knowledge, well informed and articulated. Keep on with the incredible work!"
"Peterson is 'reactionary'. His views on the role of women are paleo-conservative and rooted in his (Catholic) religious believes. He is not a man of progress. His 'teachings' are about turning back the clock on many modern social achievements. No wonder that he likes to talk about mythology from 'archaic' times. Whenever I hear that he 'helps young men' I am puzzled about people`s ignorance! 'Helping' one group ('boys') by (threatening to) take away rights from another, less privileged group ('girls', women) who fought hard and long (they had to literally wait millennia to get to a more or less equal position with men) is dangerous. I go so far to call it 'fascist' in nature.   For me, Peterson is not a 'public intellectual' but a demagogue, a whiny wanna-be Göbbels. And his followers? Hopefully too young to be as misogynistic as they seem. (Maybe they learn and grow out of it.)"
"17:00 Wait a minute. Marx didn't think that the bourgeoisie and proletariat were 'stable' categories of analysis. He was a Hegelian. The whole point of a dialectic is that it's unstable, because thesis and antithesis create logical contradictions that demand resolution. The fundamental contradictions of the logic of capitalist society demand that it will eventually fall. The only thing that Marx thought transcended history was the role of labor in the creation of value. And how can you possibly hold that identity politics (at least as the term is used here) is not postmodern? Queer Theory, Feminism and Post-colonial theory &c suppose that epistemology is based, more or less, by relationship to power."

"What does it mean to say that our construction of 'the very idea of the west' is: racist, exclusionary, supremacist and justifying of imperialism?  Surely not that the very act of using it, 'The West,' is itself, racist et al? If this were true, I would think it true of everything. That is, everything we can use in language given that culture and cultural sin are pervasive in life, and thus in language. Basically, because our system is arbitrary every thing is defined in terms of everything. All words mean being human, basically. Seems like a lot to participate in, ethically.   But now I'm far off.  Unless she means that the idea of the west 'as it is played out in reality' involves, anticipates, plans for the domination of colored people and all those other bad things.  I feel like I can 'take' or 'use' notions tinged with violence in a way that doesn't involve those aspects of it. War, for instance. Well, i suppose anything could be used as anything metaphorically. I don't understand language."

"I think 'postmodern' in this context is meant to refer to the left's more disjointed dadaist stances, contradictory rationales, etc. Say what you want, but the conservatives are ORGANIZED, and have their wants and plans of actions (however erroneous they may be) in order and easily stated.   The fact that liberalism has its home in the university doesn't help either, and it should be noted that marxism and postmodernism aren't likely to be encountered outside of those settings. I can attest that my coworkers aren't that interested in discussing the finer points of my home-boy Kirkegaard, despite my efforts..   Soooooooooooooooooooooo happy to hear people talk about Hume.

Uncritically consumed everything like you're supposed to!  Not a single critical thought in the whole video. No self awareness at all. Just trying to be belittle and be all smug? Is that the whole point? Oh no, someone didn't agree with you? Much tears very many fear *flail arms ominously while nothing happened to no one and it was the worse thing ever **#politics* We can’t all be colorful self-aggrandizing, idiosyncratic ideology-speech pattern parrot with our heads in the cloud looking down and shitting on people. A fully functioning democratic society require pluralism in its prusuations, school of thought and information. You didn't know that?  Just running around flailing your arms over fucking WHAT?! His ideas might not be to your liking but they're completely innocuous and there wasn't a single valid point or argument - not one! Not even close.  How about a little more focus on criticize content and questioning ideas and little less alluding to dumb shit that had nothing to do with his beliefs or ANYTHING you could connect to. Nothing. Trash.  Seems like I do care. Had one more fuck to give to this sort of waste of time. There you go. Welcome.  Love you much."
"I would get degenerate with Natalie"
"First off: I love your channel and your sense of humour. But I keep pausing this video more and more because of things I disagree with. You too often take things Peterson says and then slap him with a semantic analysis of what you think his words should mean. Which really doesn't help furthering the point. 'Marxism can't be anti-western, because that is where it's from'. That's just invalidating what he is trying to say, rather than engaging with his argument. Maybe it isn't clear enough what he is trying to say and do. One of Peterson's main points (as far as I understand them) are, that there is an ideology that divides people into different categories, based on a race, sex and sexuality and (like in Marxism) wants to lift those that are deemed to have the least power up to rule (based on an interpretation of social constructivism). He thinks though, that this neither means that those who are really the least powerful will gain power, nor that it is a good idea to attempt this (because lobsters. And because ideology doesn't follow how the world is, but how it thinks it should be).  He thinks it is dangerous to leave an ideology unchecked and undebated and sees proof of the tyranny of this particular ideology in the approach of how it implements it's vision: By making laws, that punishes those who do not believe in it, understand it or want to criticize it. The fear here is, that it will lead to a situation where ideas cannot be debated anymore, because those who have a different opinion are under threat of being criminalized. His personal fear as someone who puts truth first being, that facts will be put aside so the narrative (of oppression) can live on. A bit like what Republicans are doing with global warming and their economic ideology. There is more but this is just a comment section, so ... Really loved your dissemination of his rhetoric. Spot on!"
"'By where they most resembleth, the lobster' this video is just great!"
"Wrote a piece about why Jordan Peterson isn't a shaman https://nickwpreston.com/2018/10/10/in-defence-of-postmodern-furries/"
"I recently watched Jordan Peterson's dialogue with Sam Harris, which is the bulk of my exposure to Peterson.  What struck me is that he kept insisting that Harris wasn't really an atheist because he didn't rape and murder and whatnot.  It's the first time I've ever seen someone make a No True Scotsman fallacy about being evil.  But more than that, modern people are sitting on a mountain of empirical evidence that non-religious people do not rape and murder as religious people have been claiming since time immemorial.  He wants to reject that evidence and insist that these people are really religious.  People with a scientific worldview don't reject evidence in favor of their pre-conceptions.  People's habit of doing that is a common criticism of science.  Whatever else Peterson may or may not be, he most certainly is not a scientist."

"please speak normally"
"I'm pretty sure Jordan Peterson is centre-left in his political leanings. So he claims. He said that Justice Kavanaugh should step down because he's incited division. Words he did not live by when he caused controversy by refusing to accept government-mandated speech. The good thing about him is he causes people to reason about their opinions."
"I actually went to high school with his daughter. I didn't know her very well, but this is what I find so amusing about that: this high school in question was a very liberal arts school in Toronto."

"I love listening to Conservative pundits like Jordan. I think I'll add your channel to my list as well."
"Okay, I was falling in love with you at the start of the video. Then, you mentioned SWC and now, you must be my wife."
"I love how many of these videos take us to the bathtub lol"
"So i agree with a lot of your ideas. I definitely believe that using propour pronouns is helpful for trans people trying to transistion but the video that boosted petersons image was peterson argueing with trans right activist who were pushing for laws to be put into place to make it ILLEGAL to NOT use pronouns.  I think that was a big provider to his anti 'sjw' attitude."
"07:01  'On the left, we don't tell people what to do'...  Correct. Instead, you tell them what to THINK."
"jordan peterson is a retarded canadian that retarded right wing americans look up too.  he's like scott from south park that everyone hates in canada and dumbasses look up to like a smart intellectual  in america. hence why he has to go to america for his talking points since they vibe well down there."
"fucking racist also Scottish. I never get sick of hypocrisy jokes!"
"I'm a pomo and I argue against neo-marxism. Would argue against Peterson bs too. Had you asked me 2 months ago, I would've argued against identity politics too... certainly I will argue in parallel to Bauman when it comes to notions of community which I consider a means of social control and along the lines of Sen and Tannenbaum that identity politics restrict the labels that people can choose to identify with and thus are a means of oppression. Now, I can see the value of labels and concepts of community but that does not detract that they are used by the political elite to control the population. But hey, that's what I was writing my PhD on before I dropped out after passing my viva because the examiners wanted me to switch my argument from identity politics to notions of community responsibility and governance aka Rose, so I am hardly going to condense 120k words into a YouTube comment to support my argument. I am still waiting for you to introduce the masses to Baudrillard.   But more importantly didn't lobsters predate notions of judeo-christianity?  Oh, that's right God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th... how silly of me. I mean how can you forget that God created Adam both male and female, told them (gender pronoun for an intersex person!), to go forth and reproduce before creating Eve in the next chapter... in other words telling mankind to go and fuck themselves. ... and in Peterson's defense, I think we've done a pretty good job at it too!"
"Is it weird that I've had Bisexual nails at many points in my life before seeing this?"
"Lindsey sends her regards! what a wonderfull suggest on her part. thanks for this channel"
"Before I watch the video, I want to say hi! Jordan Peterson fan here. I'm excited to listen to reasonable discourse challenging my existing ideas. You have the floor and you look fabulous. I'll check back in after the video.  *edit: OK I'm back. Phew, there is a lot to unpack there. If I addressed all the points I'd be writing a novel. You made some good points. I particularly liked your point about social hierarchys. I hadn't considered that counter point before (which is exactly why I watch stuff I know I'm going to disagree with).  I feel like we actually agree on way more than we disagree on. It might be that when JP is attacking 'the left' he's actually railing against the extreme left ideology instead of straw manning the people like yourself who don't exactly share those exact same ideas.  Either way. Well done, you're intelligent and articulate and it would be a pleasure to discuss these ideas further in person. Alas there are only so many hours in the day.   Keep up the great work and good luck on your journey."

"You're brilliant. Smarter than Jordan Petersen."
"I think the reason identity politics is seen as postmodernist, is because intersectionality taken to its extreme implies that there is no objective truth about oppression, only lived experiences."
"Agree with a lot of what you've said - many are things I've identified about him myself - but towards the end just got a bit exasperated with your analysis, a lot of the contradictions you point out are the very ones Jordan Peterson is attempting to resolve"
"I follow a well balanced intellectual diet of 70% Jordan Peterson (romantic western individualism and serious life-overcoming) and 30% Alan Watts (Free flowing eastern life acceptance and humorous absurdity). That's what's working for me."
"As someone who is extremely skeptical about labels, especially in regards to identity and other abstract social and intellectual concepts, post-modernist is the perfect label for me."
"Nice story, nice lipstick - subscribed. Horrible breathless jump cuts - unsubscribed."
"How can anyone listen to your voice?"
"1:31 wrong. Jordan peterson did not say 'protecting' Trans people under Canadian human rights law would lead to stalinism' he said that enforcing everyone to say what a group wants others to say will go down to the road to totalitarianism...so you either left that out on purpose or have horrible sources...like liberal alex jones kinda sources..."
"I mean, i am kinda against any infringement of free speech. Regardless of what it is."
"My dear, where did you come from. Bright, funny and such a smarty-pants"
"Fuck me don’t try to be smart and roast Peterson when he is much smarter and will do much more for America. Also, he is 99.9% correct with what he says."
"He was scheduled to talk at my sisters school and then it was cancelled and he posted a youtube video about how they were taking away his free speech 😂"
"wait was that the Golden one @ 12:13 ? lol :D"

"JP said himself the two are incompatible. But he then states that there are plenty of people on the left who take the two and run with it anyway. Neo-Marxists that shill out Post-Modern ideological drifts. It's a caricature we can see in politicians, artists, writers, heck my favorite example is architects who put their ugly buildings right next to or on top of classical architecture, and say it compliments it.

"This is one of your best videos, it's just interesting. Let me tell you where do I find myself as an intelligent white straight non-American male. Honestly, I don't care, I don't care about any of this American nonsense. You are right when you say that existentialist philosophical questions are more interesting to discuss, yes they are, Dostoevsky is worth discussing, it's delightful to do so, it's almost a spiritual experience. But American identity politics is not. It's terrible, it's cancerous, it's irrational, I don't see how anyone who takes pride in their rationality could genuinely be interested in it. I'm fine with calling you whatever pronoun you prefer, I'm glad to do so, I'm happy calling you a woman if you so desire. The problem of this identity politics to me is when it starts to leak into sensible parts of our society, as I have read in American articles, things like school physiologists telling young boys, like 7, 10 years old, that they are gay or that they are transgender and all this complete lunacy. This is too far disgusting to bare, it reeks a demented agenda being forced into young children who are naive and vulnerable. This is completely unacceptable, and for things like this I'm glad in my country we don't have and we don't want your 'identity politics'. I remember when LGBT rights was about accepting people for what they are and their choices. Well 'you' (meaning identity politics activists) devolved into some victim-centrist, irrational, disreputable, emotionally charged movement and this doesn't help you to further your LGBT rights, it works against you in the eyes of most people."

"You don't understand who Peterson is."
"The lobster argument sounds an awful lot like an argument I had with a white supremacist once. He said that in animal packs, the strongest males rule over the weaker ones, Therefore, slavery should still be allowed and the stronger race would rule over the weaker ones. Wonder what Dr. Peterson would say about that. It would be interesting to hear the mental gymnastics he would need to go through to dismiss that argument while keeping to his lobster argument."

"Oh, so no little post script apology to Scotland? Come on, Natalie. Yes, Hume was a racist and mid-level fuckwit but it's been a cycle of abuse over here for a while - the only way to fight English imperialism is to imitate it well, according to some uncreative people. I say that because whilst rebellion hasn't gone down well historically for the Scots after a certain point in history, an aristocratic arse like Hume could have used his position to stand up for the proletariat rather than on their backs. Even though some of us are into that kind of thing, most Scots I know would be more than happy to be completely independent of England *and* their continuing attitude of colonialism. The independence vote of a few years ago was a Trump level political anomaly. Pardon me if I sound like I'm just sticking my oar in. Ever since I moved to Scotland, I've been determined to spread awareness of what the country's actually like beyond *scotch* and *sean connery* and *hogwarts but not really because it could be in any beautiful wilderness, the witch co-opted us, and I still love Harry Potter*. The UK is a super weird arrangement to still exist. It almost unilaterally benefits England over Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They love our oil reserves, or selling them anyway. Is it racism when you don't hate the people, just the long held political inclinations of government after government that fucks over the country you live in?"

"JBP's Postmodern neo-Marxism (notice 'neo') is the idea that since Marxist Communism has failed when placed in all countries that adopts it Marxisms morphed onto adopting Postmodern philosophy to deconstruct western assumptions about society. Because no one can ever know what is true and words are inadequate to find meaning. Then the neo-Marxist part comes in to declare that equity outcomes (no longer based on socio-economic position) have to be in place for gender (50%men/50%women in STEM industries), race (Affirmative Action reducing Asian representation, increasing black and hispanic representaiton in colleges)  and sometimes gender expression (non-LGBTQIA+ actors cannot represent LGBTQIA+ characters in film) because tradition and convention don't matter anyway. They don't see the negative ramifications of doing away with all categories and imposing their own (men and women are the same in everything). They do it for shits and giggles as a new experiment. Btw the more egalitarian the society the larger the difference in industry outcomes. Scandanavian countries have larger gender disparities in industries meaning more women go for working and caring with people face-to-face and more men hold jobs that require spatial reasoning.   JBP is not conflating the entirety of the left and postmodern neo-Marxist politics. If you've seen more of his videos and ACTUALLY took him seriously you'd find clips of him talking about the position of the left and the right. The right-wing advocates for the maintenance of the hierarchy (because if you have any values and have a goal, everyone has different levels of skill, some people are smarter, stronger etc. than others). While the Left-Wing is there for advocate for the dispossessed group at the bottom of the heirarchy because they will destroy the heirarchy/society through revolution (they got nothing to lose). Peterson also places the role of checking hierarchies for corruption (upward mobility only through power) on the left-wing.  So NO, JBP does not think the entirety of the left is Postmodern neo-Marxism.  Also in regards to hierarchies JBP introduces the square rule that the square number of your employees produce approximately half of the value in your organisation/company. 100 employees, approximately 10 of them do approximately 50%.  JBP also introduces the Pareto distribution. Where in all form of produce i.e. music, video games, traditional art, only a small percentage are valued highly. There were many more musicians that we don't hear about in classical music (any music) because most of them weren't as good as the classic composers. And even within those composers only a fraction of their works are listened to by the general public.  In a trading system (capitalism) this universal manifests in the 1% population having 50% of the wealth.   In regards to the gender pronouns, JBP has repeatedly stated that the transgender part of the issue is not what he's concerned with. Personally he'd be wiling to address trans-people by their prefered pronoun. It is the fact that GOVERNMENT have control over what you MUST say. (Most governments in history always turn out to be arseholes). It is harmless now but it sets a new precedent about what government can prosecute you for. Because now you can go to jail for what the government dictates you MUST say. 1984 much?"

I feel like both sides of the identity politics debate spend a lot of time grouping the others inaccurately ('You're a communist' / 'You're a fascist') and they never get to the actual grit of where they disagree. This is the first video I've found that really tries to understand Peterson at the same time as questioning his theories, because in most cases it becomes 'he's alt right' or 'he's a bigot' rather than pointing out some of the bigger flaws in his work. Thank you"

Also, the Bible and Christianity are good, and you are a man, a HE."

"This is the mental illness that produces Democrats. Of course, this man is the extreme."
"This has finally given a sense of satisfaction as to Peterson. All the pro and con I've taken in before still left anxiety.

"I'm centre left, more or less, and I surprisingly agree with a lot of what Jordan says. He just goes about it wrong and is an utter jerk."

It's good to see more and more videos like this debunking these right wing hacks"
"Bravo! That was really awesome. I'm a big fan JP and it's great to see a rebuttal towards him, thank you for that. I'd love to see a talk between you two with a middle person to keep topics on track to avoid the possible confusion of twist and turns applied in a sophist fashion.  Keep on rocking, much love for you, your intellect, and your humor. Looking forward to opening my perspective further with more of your talks."

"I don't believe that 'the very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty over collective dogma should be on board with', when that pronouns are being imposed by law of the state, over individual freedom of speech of the people. Someone who values individual liberty shouldn't concern so much on basing their identity on whether their prefered pronouns can be imposed or not on other individuals. But apart from that, I really liked this video, I've been looking for well elaborated criticism on Peterson for a while now (since I've started to like his perspectives a bit too much, and I don't like having 'unquestioned influences' on my mindscape). Love the aesthetics too. Subbed!"

"Postmodernism is not a synonym of skepticism, not exactly. It's the practice of breaking down currently held ideas, endlessly. It's reductionist to the point of ludicrousness. It is not an overreaction or scaremongering to call this kind of heedless reactionary faux-skepticism of every little thing by people with the academic acumen of 1st year drama students into very harsh question. I've spent enough years dealing with postmodernism as an art student to know it's main driving population are in no way qualified or intelligent enough to question what they so readily do, or espouse what maladjusted conclusions they hacked together. Or, at least they don't deserve to have their halfwitted musings taken seriously. But they are. That's the problem.  Postmodernism is skepticism without intellectual standards. One of the most quintessential postmodern phrases I've ever heard in media was the infamous 'everything is sexist, everything is racist, and you have to point it all out' from professional moron and screeching harpy Anita Sarkesian. If I had to give the most typical example of what postmodernism is, this quote would be it. Postmodernism is questioning something to the point of absolute contrivance. It sees problems where none exist, and fabricates conclusions based on previous, equally poorly thought out conclusions. Postmodernism is contrarian, anti-current state of affairs. It's the bratty teen of movements that thinks it's more clever than it is. This is why it's toxic. This is why Peterson very correctly cautions against it as something highly corrosive to society. It is a useless movement, championed and utilized almost exclusively by useless people. It has no value, the only elements it has unique claim to are negative, the rest exist independently as basic concepts, like skepticism. It is at the heart of every negative element to a wide range of modern movements. Take feminism for instance, whose theories are deeply routed in postmodernist philosophy. It's why so much of feminist theories are complete and utter wank. Gender studies, social sciences, all engage in postmodernism, and all have postmodernisms telltale failings.  Postmodernism is an academic armory for the stupid and the narcissistic to equip themselves with bad philosophy disguised as genuine academically sound theories akin to the sciences in terms of veracity.  If you look long and hard enough, you will inevitably find the problems you so desperately want there to be. The siren song of postmodernism."
"Hey, I just realized that 'God save the Queen' is Foppington's theme  Yes Natalie, I *am* watching your videos more than once... Just FYI, I have a master's degree, so be careful  I mean, it's in library science, but still...  So, in your opinion, are we at the point where rhetoric has surpassed ethics?"
"You are making me thirsty."
"Good points in general. One itty bitty objection: Advocating for pronouns is individualist and so on, and is perfectly acceptable to Daddy JP, the issue comes where it's enforced topdown. I'm sure you know this, just kinda misrepresent the issue 25 mins in. Otherwise keep on keeping on, queen."
"While I'm not a huge fan of your skits and such, I really love your arguments. However, I know that htat's just my personal taste and the side skits don't detract from the basic argument. This video shows that you have put thought into your arguments as well as have the intellectual backing to refute JP. I would be interested to hear your thoughts on other similar subjects or even see you have a debate with one of the more famous 'skeptics'."

"'No comment.'   - Jordan Peterson"
"i just came back here and literally mouthed the opening lines from memory  'My lords, and ladies and those who lieth betwixt.'"
"I enjoyed the video but I can't say i agree with the cultural marxism points. There are plenty of reasons to criticize capitalism but speaking of its drawbacks shouldn't mean you rely on marxism/communism this absolutely reeks of intellectual laziness.     JP explains why he thinks cultural bolchevism is wrong so your counter argument should be why it isn't. There are plenty of real life examples that anyone with a modicum of general knowledge won't require a list in a youtube comment section to know what i'm talking about. If there are  neo marxists in the educational system it would sound foolish to assume that this belief won't be shared in other domains.  Intersectional feminism/modern sjws is absolutely post modernist because of its views on RELATIVISM. It is marxist because of its reductionist use of a FALSE DICHOTOMY: oppressor and oppressed.   Post modernism is a general ideological tendency so while it can be opposed to marxism it is not fundamentally opposed as you suggest. You cannot oppose modernism to post modernism as they are a chronological evolution of schools of thought following each other."
"I really like you, but I feel like you are unintentionally misrepresenting what Peterson has said, especially on post-modernism and neo-marxism. This concerns me more because this will likely be the only real exposure your audience has to what he thinks.  1. Peterson has explicitly and specifically directed his disdain at 'radical' leftists, not all leftist. Suggesting otherwise is disingenuous. This isn't in abstract terms, either. He has outlined, specifically, why he thinks the left and the right are both equal necessities in proliferating a long-term functional society. Again, this is more for your audience than it is for you, but the way he outlines it is that a function of the right (not the sole function, but a fundamentally important one), is to create hierarchical structure. The left's function as a result is to advocate for the displaced inequities that will inevitably arise from such a structure. He argues that a hierarchy is not only necessary for a functional society, but biologically inevitable. That's partially where the lobsters come from.  The biggest thing to note here, and why I think you misrepresent him, is that he acknowledges that inequality will happen, that the left's necessary function is to correct it, and that he is in favor of this function. This is where the very explicit distinction between he left and 'radical left' starts for him. You emphatically make it appear as if he is so far right that he must see all of the left as radical when this is very clearly not the case.  The reason he claims to focus so particularly on the radical left vs the radical right is because of definition. According to him, and this is something I agree with, the radical right is extremely easy to categorize and it's easy to know what to do with them from an academic perspective. If someone is racist, sexist, bigoted, etc, their clearly extremist and don't get to be taken seriously in intellectual discussion. This is literally what he's said. Can someone on the left be radical then? Yes. How? Well that isn't as easy to define. That's where the focus comes from. He sees both as a problem, but we know how to deal with one where as we can't even agree on the categorization of the other. Both are harmful, and I think that any rational person can agree that an extremist of any creed will more likely than not err on the side of destruction, but one isn't even identifiable, and is therefore in need of attention in a time where it is not happening to his satisfaction. The labeling them as postmodern marxists is his attempt at labeling them. It's not that all leftists are postmodern neo-marxists - is that leftists extremists are. That's the box he chooses to put them in.  2. Peterson is aware of the absurd and contradictory merging of post-modernism and neo-marxism. With this, you either missed the lecture where he's clarified this, which I think is completely understandable because there are hundreds of hours or material out there and I've only seen him tackle this once, or you are again being very disingenuous in suggesting that he is somehow that so shallow and incompetent that he'd say something like that in error. The point of the merge is that it is absurd as a function. The point he makes is that post-modernism actually does reveal a truth about the world - there are infinite amount of interpretations of the world and that does pose an existential problem. In the case of what he categorizes as the radical left, which politically is communism in the same way that fascism is politically the radical right, he argues that they are using marxism as the answer of meaning that post-modernism introducing when suggesting that no interpretation can ever be 'the most valid one.' That it is incoherent is precisely why it is not the moderate left, but the extremist left. The suggestion by him is that these extremists are not concerned with the validity and coherency of their philosophy, because it is their disingenuous veil to whatever nefarious ends they may want to achieve.  It's an ideological insult. You don't expect an extremist to have coherent, consistent, or even sincere philosophies about anything because they are driven by far more simple desires. You don't look at a Neo-nazi with the expectation that they are on coherent philosophical ground, do you? I'd guess not. Again, this is for the audience that hasn't heard him speak on these things.  ---  I don't think you are completely unfair, and decent is fair. Criticism is fair. Disagreement is fair. Misrepresenting what someone is saying isn't though, and it's absolutely beneath you. I think there are other examples of unfairness, but I think I've said enough here to at least pique the curiosity of those who got an inaccurate impression of the kinds of things he has said. I implore anyone to watch his actual arguments particularly on the controversial bill he opposed and how much of that has anything to do with transphobia. He thinks it's Orwellian, and he thinks it is exploiting the vulnerable to do it, which is something he sees as nefarious. If you think his fears are unsubstantiated, that's one thing. You think he is irrationally afraid of what you perceive to be an improbable outcome. That isn't evil or deceitful though. And the points he makes supporting his fears are not absurd or unsubstantiated. One of the points he makes is that the bill has exploits that would make is possible for the RIGHT to encroach on the rights of transgendered people because of how it defines such people. That is an explicit concern that he has explicitly and repeatedly stated. Let that sink in. One, documented reason why he opposed that bill is because the conservatives might use it to exploit the trans community. The idea that he is on the far right, but that he would be afraid that the WHOLE right wing might encroach on the rights and freedom of transpeople because of this bill is ridiculous.  It's fair to disagree with him but, you know, chill a bit. He isn't stupid and he isn't manifesting minority-phobic tendencies.."

I tried to appeal but im a male cisgender so  they wouldnt listen even if i could prove it mathematically.  Its pretty radical and for obviuos reasons not a lot of people attenf to this courses but the professor in question has administrative power in the university. You see where im getting at?

"I think a major reason why discussing the need for a higher purpose in life in leftist circles takes a backseat is that for people involved in activism, a politicized existence *is* what gives them a higher purpose. When you're a privileged straight white boy, it obviously becomes more salient to ask yourself what the point is in going to work. Although I do still think that it's necessary to think about what is supposed to get you out of bed once you've solved all the problems in the world.

"GUYS I GOT A JORDAN PETERSON PRAGERU AD BEFORE THIS VIDEO"
"I generally don't like Jordan Peterson's arguments on many topics but I really think one must be intentionally wearing a blindfold to discredit Jordan's arguments on the basis that the groups he describes either don't exist or are not having exactly the arguments he presents counter-arguments to. I know I've personally seen what he's describing where I live in Canada and hell, even teachers I've had in college and university graded me on this ideological stupidity he argues against.  I also think one can reasonably make a definition work when applying the words : postmodern neo-marxist. The label doesn't specifically state ''postmodern marxist'' which would technically be a contradiction. The label could reasonably describe a postmodernist who applies only his rhetoric to capitalist beliefs and therefore tends to favor marxist beliefs or redefinitions of them commonly found in social science academics. This definition would not only fit what we can generally observe in these circles of academics who favor either left or extreme-left ideologies but would also seem rather fitting for what Peterson describes. We should also keep in mind that the people Peterson is trying to describe here aren't generally coherent in their ideologies so this label summarizes that pretty well.  Finally, at 21:30, this lobsters/hierarchy argument is definitely a strawman. The argument was not that hierarchies are good because they happen naturally, the argument is that they objectively exist without the need for us to create them because we can observe them in nature. He was trying to make a counter-argument to the argument that hierarchy is a social construct. What Cathy Newman did was indeed also a strawman when she said that Peterson argued we should therefore follow the social structure of lobsters. She is the only one to blame for this mistake, Peterson could not have been clearer with what he said.  Look, Jordan Peterson is not a reference for good arguments on many subjects, religion, biology and history would be great examples, but one can only shoot himself in the foot when countering bad versions of what he says or ignoring the context of what he generally speaks about. It only serves to make the people who follow him rightfully angry when in fact, they should be looking at real examples of his stupidity instead."

"There is actually quite a bit of overlap between self-proclaimed Postmodernists and Marxists. Both of them view reality in context of power struggles and deny objectivity."
"Oh, crap. I'm a neo-post-modern post-neo-Marxist. I've been trying to figure it out for decades, and now, suddenly, epiphany! I mean that there is no contradiction between an understanding of capitalism as a system of economics that has manifested itself in class struggle and exploitation of the vulnerable (including those who are oppressed due to marginalization as a result of social and cultural prejudices), -- which has resulted in a division of the exploited from one another through the maintenance of a political system (designed to prevent rapid social and economic change via structural obstacles to minority representation and a favouring of the incumbent) being the most profitable for those with the greatest wealth, -- with the idea that, while that description may on the surface appear to explain the particular phenomena of interest today and may be useful as a model when divising policy to combat various social ills, it is still a human construct, does not take into account the myriad ways that all social activity is prone to unintended consequences (such as the race to the bottom) so one need not posit the existence of a grand theory involving the conspiratorial action of some shadowy elite such as the patriarchy in order to recognize that the sum total of socioeconomic actions leads to a result that might as well be the patriarchy (even if it isn't, in fact, the patriarchy), and such theory is therefore neither complex enough nor complete enough to be anywhere close to reality, figuratively speaking, insomuch as all such theories are deeply flawed, and we should therefore always be willing to alter or eradicate or reconstruct those parts of theory when they don't seem to apply. In other words, as Socrates would have it: the first rule of Philosophy Club is that 'We must question all the rules of Philosophy Club.' Or something.  Just wanted to see if I could get all that in, in one sentence. Alas, I'm seriously out of practice and seem to have lost all my semi-colons. Fortunately, no one will read it anyway. But the video was awesome, as always, and at least now I know what I am. NPMPNM."

Sargon may see Peterson in one light and describe him factually through the lens of that light and you see Peterson in another light and so describe him factually colored by that light. That is to say so long as you are willing to weaken your now set ideas about him, i.e. the way you perceive him now you have watched him/ listened to him for a long time, if you ever got in the room with him you could actually make some progress in really getting more out of him. In clarifying what he means when he says certain things, what his beliefs are on certain topics such as his version of the phrase postmodern-Neomarxism, and trying to convince him of your own position.  You are the most well put together commentator I have seen on the left. I feel like the right goes to easy on him despite the fact that I like him."

"I appreciate this video.  You give credit where it is due, and pose constructive criticism, laden with humor. Along the spectrum between vicious critics and considerate skeptics, what I gather to be the most consistent response to JP is something to the effect of a critique on the various terms he uses, rather than on the content of the picture he consistently paints with them.  Throughout the video you suggest that his position on a given issue is difficult to determine, and I have not found that to be the case, though neither claim offers much. While he does use the term 'post-modern neomarxist' to characterize the authoritarian left,  he doesn't appear to claim that it is comprised of an ideologically unified team,  but rather a philosophically incoherent mob laying the foundation for a kind of authoritarian hell whether they know it or not,  in which case the somewhat self-contradictory term 'postmodern neo-marxist' is appropriate.   His reference to lobster hierarchies as an example of the inevitability of hierarchical structures is by no means an attempt to justify the continuity of every hierarchy, or condone injustice,  but rather to demonstrate how the common assertion that the 'patriarchal' element of western civilization was devised according to the ill-intent and design of oppressors, is fundamentally insubstantial.  He never appears to make the simple claim that 'its been done for millions of years,  so it must be fundamentally good.'  He consistently uses it as a means of undermining the claim that the patriarchal structure within western civilization is fundamentally oppressive.  In most cases he leaves it to us to fill in the obvious follow up:  structures must be constantly revised, so they do not become unjust. An effort to which he seems utterly devoted. JP has repeatedly made it sufficiently clear that people requesting the usage of specific pronouns is not the issue.  The issue is compelled speech. Legislature making it illegal to refrain from adapting speech in accordance with sociopolitical ideologies we may or may not agree with. The fact that it has anything to do with the trans community is by chance.  The motion is fundamentally authoritarian, and utterly opposed to individualism,  as it prioritize the preferences of a group over those of every individual.  If an individual requests that everyone else modify their own speech to match the identity to which they subjectively claim adherence to, that is one thing. But if this individual would have it made illegal to refrain from modifying speech according to this subjective claim,  that is tyranny.  You cannot make the claim that such motions are aligned with the western concept of individual liberty, and suggest that they should be mandated at the same time.  A law stating that failure to use certain pronouns is a punishable offence is born of collectivist dogma, the assertion that individuals retain the right to refuse such modifications of speech is born of individual liberty.  It is true that Western thought cannot be reduced to judeo-christian values.  It is diverse both in origin and manifestation, as you say.  But the foundation upon which all of this diversity has developed is judeo-christian in nature, and has served as the control against which all developments have been compared. It runs like veins throughout the entire system, and plays no small part in the collective assumptions about reality that we do share despite differing philosophical models.  Judeo-Christian thought remains a strong reference point, and we all pretty much understand it. It has manifested in abundance throughout western culture, so at the very least we have all had ample opportunity to learn about it. This is why he often uses judeo-christian material to illustrate his points. Additionally, I would suggest that unlike alt-right reactionary politics,  Jordan Peterson's politics seem to present themselves along the lines of...lets say preventative politics, in that he is not simple reacting to something he doesn't like,  but warning against the inevitable result of motions well underway.   I apologize for the lengthy nature of this comment.  I really do appreciate all that you put into your video,  and I especially appreciate the creative elements woven throughout. Perhaps I could offer much more, but I don't intend to preach, or jam something down your throat.  I figured I would offer something more than the typical one liner response, and I hope it is apparent that I offer this with respect and admiration."

"You won me over when you compared the Marquis De Sade to Divine's character in Pink Flamingos. :)"
"I'm a fan of Jordan Peterson. I find myself agreeing with a lot of his points, as a centrist liberal (more or less), but what frustrates me about him and his ilk is the lack of accountability on the side of conservativism/the right who listen to these dudes and not once get their feet held to the fire. It's hypocrisy in its purist form, and the insistence of telling people what they ought to do with their life to bring about a prosperous society is a form of tyranny itself. For someone who espouses personal responsibility so much, I find it ironic that a lot of his rhetoric pussy foots around pointing out the personal shortfailings of his main base. He is daddy tho. 👅"
"'his true concern being buddhism when it comes to the boundaries of traditional intellectual thinking' JP has been a rock in my craw that I thought was going to get sweet if I kept at it.  Perhaps I need to reevaluate.  I think he is kind of dangerous in his ambiguity."
"Was loving you until you made the pronoun thing seem like no big deal.  I live in Canada and I can go TO JAIL if I don't use a person's preferred pronoun.  My government is telling me how I must speak and what language I must use.  That's a big deal and I think you know that."

"what kind of magical being are you?? Your videos are incredibly aesthetically appealing, have great use of lighting and mise en scene, you're funny, intelligent, your scripts have depth and breadth, you make jokes both in scripting and in editing, AND you're fashionable?? How can all the talent exist in one brain..."
"Postmodernists never try to deconstruct the identities of women, transexuals, 'people of colour' or whatever. The only identity they set out to deconstruct is the identities and culture of white, heterosexual men."
"And who's idea was it to infiltrate universities with marxist professors 'teaching' completely useless lessons to the students about how capitalism is supposedly 'bad'? (despite the fact that capitalism created all that wealth that built the universities and other various seats of learning in the first place)  Here's a radical idea: MAYBE capitalism isn't so bad as you socialist fucks like to think? MAYBE it's your fucked up ideology (that has killed millions more people than Adolf Hitler) that needs to go and not being promoted in academia?  Maybe..."
"he forgot to mention, that peterson is an expert on extremism."
"'progressive' politics are inherently totalitarian and evil. There's no debate to be had about it."

"i hear you say daddy a lot. that's cool, but then you said, they're such a bunch of daddies. is that some jargon of which i am unaware? if so, please explain"
"'i learned it at the aa meetings i refused to go to' lol"
"Superb."
"Lol! :D ...You rock ContraPoints! Best production values on YT, and great sarcastic wit!  I just have to say though, deconstructed, Peterson's pseudo-intellectual BS and whiny Sam Harris level sophistry ('you're misrepresenting me'), is nothing more than the same right-wing men's movement ideology from seventies and eighties repackaged to appeal to Incels and the Alt-Right. It's just the same old anti-feminist, anti-civil-rights reactionary response to the 1960's.    Peterson thinks he's so clever, but he's counting on his mumbo-jumbo psycho-babble to confuse people, when it's so easy to deconstruct his sorry arse when you ignore all that rubbish. He gives the game away in the title of the book--Antidote to Chaos--and in the foreword--Chaos = Feminine--i.e.--he's straight up saying 'Antidote to Feminism' translated: 'I hate women.'   How is this not obvious to everyone?"
"I bet Alex Jones stumbled upon these videos and then decided to go full T-porn"

"Awesome!!!! <3 <3"
"The lobster queen is dead. Long live the lobster queen!"
"I only found out who Jordan Petersen is because people were talking about him in the comments of Professor Brothers videos by Neely Comics. Because he sounds exactly like the Professor Brothers, but with less charisma."
"You don't like Scottish people? B-but I sub-subscribed to y-you!"
"Not sure how I feel about this"
"I love your videos' format, and you're hella creative, but this is... VERY shallow criticism. OR you're being deliberatly obtuse. Don't get me wrong this was super entertaining to watch on the theatrical comedy factor alone, but the content itself just came off lazy.  In the end it's just a funny strawman.   You did make more of an effort than the average critc tho, so there is that."
"'I learnt it at the AA meetings I refuse to go too' lost it, liked it, subbed it."

"9:22 *mom walks in* “what are you watching?” Me: *closes tab* “Porn. I’m watching porn.”"
"You're distrubing, I like it."
"I quite like Peterson, I think he's a good psychologist, not sure if I agree with everything he says but I do like him. None the less this video had some pretty good critiques. Much love :)"
"When de Sade tells you to 'eat shit and die' he isn't telling you off, he's describing his fetish. Or one of them."
"Cultural marxism is not some grand conspiracy theory. It is shorthand for the reframing of absolutely everything in culture into the Marxist framework of oppressed and oppressor. This framing has been taken to absurd lengths on left."
"Everyone close your eyes when jordan peterson talks      And imagine kermit talking"
"21:00  Wouldn’t the better alternative be to further the dialogue by asking questions? I don’t see how arguing against his statement or assuming what he’s saying are the only two options. I thought the point of Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman’s meeting was for her to interview him, not a debate?   Maybe I don’t understand the goal of the news organization Cathy Newman was working under, or the nature of an interview — but I’m under the impression the major flaw with the interview was the fact she argued against him and made assumptions instead of asking questions and inquiring further.   I could be wrong, or risking a woosh moment. Totally plausible. Lol"
"long live the queen"
"post-modernism, neo-marxism. Two different phrases. Still, kinda true on some points. Such as that modernism being concerned with reality and marxism being pure mysticism."
"You are an inspiration."
"So much thanks to you for making this wonderful video love you💕"
"I just discovered your channel, I'm totally in awe and in LOVE. I'm so glad someone like you exists and shares her thoughts with the world! #smart #fierce #free"
"JP stands against compelled speech, not transgender activism. I think he talks about west vs east like communism in ussr, china and north korea vs what was the basis of modern western culture. U do not represent the vocal radical left, which JP stands against. Regrettably u don't represent thr majority of the left. Noice vid anyway."
"This is the best YouTube video I've seen in 83 years"
"FYI the Cathy Newman interview is from Channel 4, and your 'daddy' jokes are the only ones that make me laugh 😂😂"
"Holy God. You nailed it. Well done!"
"I think that Jordan Peterson is attempting to be as absolutely honest and non-discriminatory as possible, as far as declaring that discrimination based on a born-trait is a terrible thing. AT the same time, he is attempting to stop the newest wave of victimization-culture, whereby a person's FEELINGS that they have been discriminated against or hurt in any way, is enough proof that the perpetrator is a bad person. I went to college in the U.S.A. in the 90's and I would still stick up for the KKK's right to a protest on campus, as much as anyone else's, even though I personally despise them. That's how a democracy works. We teach them that they are wrong by showing them a better way, and with our votes.   These little college bastards nowadays, won't go to class if their teacher triggered one person with 'micro-aggressions'. He's calling bullshit, and bullshit it is. It's a terrible precedent, and it's as exclusive as any other clan.  There are some other things that he says that I don't necessarily agree with, but some people have trouble getting that he doesn't hold any particular feeling because of some random ideology.  He attempts to say in public, EXACTLY the thought-processes that he has gone through to reach any conclusion, and that can be boring to some and seem robotic to others. We have a proud tradition in the U.S.A. of making fun of anyone who comes off as robotic (i.e. logical and not emotional as fudge at every turn)"

"Absolutely lost it at Freud being labeled Daddy."
"The Problem with 'the left' (lol jk) is there is so little in terms of intelligent rebuttals being promoted, people are constantly talked down too; issues are dumbed-down and compacted into sort repeatable phrases. I dont 100% agree with you (or Jordan Peterson) but at least you make a well thought out and enlightening counter argument; Jordan Peterson contributed some of his success to there being a real thirst for intelligent debate and responsibility, I think you both provide..."
"Wow.. Kinda spaced on the video (the big words too big for my brain) but loved it. And you hit the magical 10% hater mark in the likes ! The comment section must be horror show.. I feel really sorry for you right now. Karl Urban says 'choke on this' in the Dredd movie and that's pretty bad ass. I'm going to the next video now. LOVE YOU! THANK YOU!"
"What do I want from you? To never stop being amazing."
"His/her/its voice is insufferable"
"Holy shit. I fucking love this. Why have I been avoiding checking out this channel?"
"Why the fuck was this recommended to me? go home you tube you're drunk. Just contact rogan, set up a debate with JP. You have a fair amount of subs and views he'd do it."
"Very, very disappointing to see this channel take handouts from the anti-Scottish illuminati.  I may consider unsubscribing once I've cleaned my bedroom. 12:57"

"Relating to the 'AA meetings I don't attend' comment pretty hard. GG, fam."
"My good sir. Thou art my favorite non-binary citizen on this fair site of 2nd person subterranean conveyance, your oddly constructed ludicrousness is quite amusing. Also for me the actualization of the socialist ideal is for me a purpose in life partially due to my religious views which is to say when I think of the teachings of Christ for example how one should not covet material possessions (also how the early church organised in a way that allocated resources according to need and the married couple that tried to profit from selling their land literally dropped dead on the spot after lying about it) and how the meek will inherit the earth, I think to myself how I might do right by both my faith and my fellow man and I have come to realise that if there is no longer a class system to oppress the workers then society will be as rewarding to the less ambitious, the more compassionate and the disabled as it is to the ruthless, sociopathic types that do well in business today,and so the meek will inherit the earth, thus by realising the goal of a predominantly secular ideology the  proclamations of a religious figure become actualized. Although of course I understand that if I am to accomplish this through reform then the process will out strip my life time by far however I only have to set the ball rolling and I might yet leave my species better than I found it and as my goal is ultimately the realistion of that reality (by which I mean that some part of my species is greatly improved by my life being lived as I assume all humans do) I seek to create or help produce at the least a social democracy or socialist democracy which is free of influence of capitalist corruption so that politicians might serve the populace as they always should have done. In this lies the irony and possibly the contradiction of my existence: that my Marxist sympathies are innately tied to my Judeo-Christian values. Sod the right wingers who say the right suits Christian teachings."
"You made an attempt but got a lot wrong. It just comes down to your perspective of what the truth is - I'd rather see you debate someone, than to see you try get their points but end up guessing."
"You're fun to watch. Need to watch more of your videos. Which one should I go for first? Let me see... Oh no, I'm already triggered by your video titles! I feel hardcore today so I'm going to watch 'How I Became a Feminist SJW'. Since I hate feminists and SJWs, that's guaranteed to go well."
"I have been a Jordan Peterson fan (still am:) and I found myself listening more and more to youtubers that identify with the right, more conservative (I'm not even American), anti-feminist opinions. I think it's the whole youtube algorithm. Anyway, I reaaaaally wanted to hear some sense from the other side, especially someone who could disenchant his (JP's) persona for me (I tend to idolize people, so when it happens I know I need an antidotum). You are EXACTLY what I needed. I absolutley love your videos. Thank you so much! If I had a bank account in dollars, I would become your Patron! I'll find some way. The thing is I'm 34 and just starting to stand on my own feet, after being an alcoholic nuisance (this is where JP helped immensely!!), so for now I have very limited financial options, but once the ball starts rolling, I swear, one of the things I'll do is become your patron. Ok, maybe not swear, anyway that's the way I feel right now. And it actually motivates me to do more with my life, to be able to support, help grow the things I enjoy! I like you, I like peterson. I think you're both right (as in correct) just talking out of different experience. You should go on Rogan! Aaaand, I would love to hear what you think about Camille Paglia! Mucho blessings! Na zdrowie!"
"You're as amazing as Lindsay Ellis promised! I'm a big fan of the good Dr., but I find your criticisms very reasonable and well put. Plus you are something of a comedic genius. I look forward to watching more of your content."
"lmao look at this dude"
"good grief...blah, blah, blah..."
"You have a clipper, I assume you blaze, you could also just smoke, BUT I WILL ASSUME YOU BLAZE!"
"I find it particularly interesting how hard you try to strife away from marxism and Stalinism while your fans greet each other with 'comrade'. As someone who's been born in communism and lived trough socialism I shudder to that.  Also thought you were one of the sane SJWs (God knows those don't exist, but a girl can dream right) and then I saw you support abominations (intellectual abominations that is) like Riley Dennis and such so I have to be like 'no thank you'."
"No hes not against progressive politics hes against PC culture and post modernism."

"I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!!!!  THANK YOU FOR BEING BOTH ENTERTAINING AND THOROUGH IN YOUR RESEARCH AND KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECTS!!!  Idk why it’s in all caps I just got excited!  Also, you look gorgeous as always!  Keep on keepin on!"
"I had half a mind to write something or talk on a video about how much of 'social justice warrior-ism' including aspects of Marxism is congruent with liberal western enlightenment ideas.  And therein lies my problem.  Well done.  Very well done.  Extensively done with suitable levels of deconstruction. Gifted."
"Even though I don't agree with a lot of what you've said here, you bring some really interesting points, and I think that's the whole idea right? great channel btw."
"Subscribed!🧠❤️"
"As a fan of Peterson I think you're completely right.   I think he does too, albeit secretly. He does say he would use whatever pronouns he was asked to use too (although only once to my knowledge). I think he maintains the illusion because it thrusts him into the mainstream, gets him more attention.  I think his main gripe with C16 is that it puts the government into a position to make laws on language.  Which is ironic really. Someone so focused on hierarchy and so against 'post-neo-marxism' really doesn't want the government to have that power  I think he thinks (jeez convoluted much) that making it a legality can be abused by dishonest people. But even so, that's not a valid argument against protecting trans or non-binary people. I think if he had an equally viable protection plan it would definitely make him more amicable for the left. But he doesn't, besides the universal law of 'don't be an asshat'. I think he thinks (to my convoluted comprehension) government falls into the archetypal domain of male duality, the protective father and the controlling tyrant, he believes it's like your dad saying not to cuss. We know how that works (well, other people do at least). The dad gets more controlling as the 'innocent' becomes more rebellious. Basically we get a more tyrannical government and the people become sly in opposing these rules. It drives the sexists underground, makes them more conniving and more dangerous. Tl;Dr, idiots will be idiots. Idiots are real.   Either way, my interpretation of Peterson's interpretation aside.  Thanks for your videos, only just found them! They've got a great balance of fun and food for thought. I really appreciate all the effort you've put into them, it shows."
"FUCK, my mom just walked into my room while I watched the bathroom scene."

"I absolutely adore your videos not just for the hot takes but because there's no where else on YouTube I can find this much dedication to production quality. The lighting??? The sound design??? The performances??? the THEATRICS???"
"The criticism that he is manipulative or fraudulent is based on a shallow misinterpretation of what he says, which is caused by only watching about 15 minutes of his numerous, often hours-long talks that his fans ACTUALLY listen to all the way through.     Jordan lies out PRECISELY how he connects Postmodernism to neo-Marxism in this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfH8IG7Awk0&t=156s"
"Very funny, really, but Jordan lies out PRECISELY how he connects Postmodernism to neo-Marxism in this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfH8IG7Awk0&t=156s  It's worth the watch if you're interested in the topic or in critiquing anything Peterson has to say about the topic.   Essentially, he recognizes that they are not technically compatible (because postmodernism rejects 'grand narratives' and neo Marxism is a 'grand narrative') but humans are capable of ignoring all kinds of cognitive dissonance.   Basically, the neo Marxists use the tactics of postmodernism to deconstruct their opponents' goals and values and dismiss them, while ignoring the implications such principles have on their own values and goals.    They ignore this logical incoherence and they use postmodernism, again, to excuse this incoherence, because even logic itself is rejected by postmodernist theory.   It's kind of like having your cake and eating it too.     But don't take my word for it, watch the video."
"wow! amazing content, thank you. the way you characterized in-fighting on the left is spot-on"
"What do you think of his argument that it was never about the particulars of trans pronouns, but the governmental mandate that forces the use of them?"
"D A D D Y"
"lol bill C-16 protecting trans people? right.... no it would make things worse for trans people. in fact many trans people spoke up about that"
"You two should have a conversation."
"Please stop. I don't quite have a boner but it's getting there and I don't want to know what happens when it does."
"Peterson is seriously making the naturalistic fallacy with that lobster argument, I’m an undergrad and even I know that."
"Great video. You made several good points justly criticizing Peterson, in particular the philosophical incoherence of his term of 'postmodern Marxism.' That's why I overall prefer the term 'identity marxism,' which implies the transposition of economic Marxism into the field of cultural identity, and the associated identification of the oppressor and oppressed groups with males and females, whites and blacks, etc. Unfortunately, you did not respond to Peterson's criticism of such-understood identity Marxism, namely, that it oversimplifies social reality, identifies certain groups as natural enemies (or natural-born oppressors) and thus leads to increased hatred and social divisions, and could ultimately lead (the same way as economic Marxism did) to political violence."
"A perfect example"
"The amount of Chopin on this channel is god damn fantastic. Keep that shit up you PCP addict you!"
"Peterson has some valid points that are worth hearing, but people place way more stock in what he says than they should. They treat him like he knows everything, when really hes been catapulted into the spotlight and forced to speak on things that arent really part of his expertise, just so he can maintain relevence OwO"
"I think everyone deserves respect but the government should not and cannot force people to call people what they want to be called, and the government can’t force people to be polite. The government shouldn’t have that power."
"Got my first Trump political ad watching this."
"So, is there anybody you don't dislike? That seems common in the vocal, visible category of people who don't want to be treated as a category but do actually advocate categories if they're honest. (Which? Take your pick.) I think. I'm not that intelligent; just observant. Oh wait! There are people you like, but they're not well known and therefore not respected much (Judith who?) Well, I guess it is segregated categories after all then! Take that [in actuality insincere] HR departments!"
"14:29 Was this repeated because of the way he pronounced Foucault? I hope not, because that atrocity might give people accent-cancer. ' _Michelle_ Faux-coo?'  Btw, I always wonder why Marxism is seen almost as a cuss word, when all I got from his most infamous book was 'How to run the HR Dept. in your new factory'.  Edit - I hadn't heard this lobster argument. The interviewer lost a huge chance there to challenge his logic by arguing that ants, bees and termites - as well as many other insects, organize in matriarchal imperialistic structures where males are just short-lived sex slaves, who usually die horrible deaths. Since insects outnumber all other species combined with the exception of bacteria, should we also follow the innevitable course of biological structures in that sense? Or is that less convenient for him?"

"JP never said he wouldn't use a persons preferred pronoun if they asked him. Its about mutual respect. I see a lot of people talking about how transgender individuals are rare to come across due to their being a smaller percentage of the population. Sorry but government by its nature is there to make policies for the greater good. Basically in Canada theyre trying to outlaw being an asshole.  Well if you ask me to refer to you a certain way, I have the right to say no. And in doing so I'm being disrespectful, and an asshole. For sure. But if we just start jailing people for being dicks, there's going to be no one left lol.  If you don't have the strength of character to stick up for yourself that's not societies problem. You should maybe look into why people calling you something should bother you so.  I moved to Georgia from the North and due to my haircut and anti social behavior my neighbor called me a racist faggot. (I'm a cisgender heterosexual married man.)  So what did I do? Nothing. Because I didn't care. Because I have enough to worry about without letting some stranger hurt my feelings. Because I was taught sticks and stones may break my bones blah blah blah. But... Its true. Words are wind."

"ContraPoints... Two ideas being incompatible has never stopped people from combining them....... Your entire analysis falls apart here. You should've done better. Also, what about examples of the feuds between neo-Marxists and SJW's? I'm really curious, but also sceptical about the extent of this 'feud'."
"So... Post-modernism is a idiology based in privaliged ignorance then?"
"You're a true hero Contrapoints. Thanks for posting such insightful, wonderfully intelligent AND intelligible videos. I've nothing but respect for you and I'm so happy you're doing this"
"Cathy failed at the interview because she failed as an interviewer. Instead of actually interviewing him and asking about his position, forcing him to clarify, go into details... she engaged with him as if its a debate 'So you're saying!', 'So you're saying!', 'So you're saying!'. She should have asked curiously: 'What are you implying?' 'Do you see any problems with your statement?'"
"I like aspects of Peterson and I came into this expecting to disagree with you, but you were pretty fair tbh. I think you misrepresented him in a couple ways, but this video did make me laugh quite a bit. We don't all have to hate each other because we like or dislike different people."
"The seem like a complete psycho... I like it"

"Lobster Queen: LOL!  The defenders of feudalism and slavery also used the 'natural' argument to defend those institutions. John Stuart Mill (the same hero of free speech absolutists) observed that 'natural' means 'customary'. (Oh, yeah, among some spiders, the female eats the male after sex; hence the term 'black widow'. Would Peterson advocate for that?)  The West: I have noticed that SJW (TM) stuff is Western; in fact, that has caused issues concerning ex-Muslims criticizing Islam, and what happens when intersectionalities among non-Westerners are replicated in immigrant communities: sometimes activists in those communities get associated with Western racists. (Miryam Namzie once got no-platformed when Islamists objected to her.)   I even noticed references to Western privilege and how most privilege checklists reference Western realities.   Plato: even he criticized gender roles, pointing out that differences between men and women were irrelevant to the roles they play in society. (However, his views were very cis-centric.)"
"I wonder if the reason Peterson (and Right Wing talk radio hosts) think the Left is a monolith is due to the Outgroup Homogenity Effect, in which outgroup members are assumed to be the same. (After all, for them, 'the Left' is an out-group.  I also wonder if they get their ideas from Twitter, and a hodgepodge of what various Leftist sectors say, slap it together, and they present 'Leftenstein' to the world: the postmodern neo-Marxist Identity Politics everyone knows and loves; the terror of the Right."

"There was no consensus between 18th c. philosophy (known under the collective noun 'Enlightenment'). Kant has an immanent criticism of Hume's empiricism and an immanent critique of Rousseau's ethics and there's a post-critical philosophy critique of Kantian philosophy by Hegel (you don't have to go to the determinist de Sade for a critique of Enlightenment, Enlightenment is self-critical or it is not Enlightenment ) .  And let us not move into the 19th c. and the towering figure of Hegel. You missed critical philosophy and its profound legacy  in your spicy and utterly watchable presentation. Also, no contemporary Adornoean critiques of post-modern philosophy (Peterson a modernist? Please don't make me laugh while I'm drinking my Campari. Peterson is not capable of engaging with what he demonises, unlike, say, the Frankfurt School). You are also too generous to Peterson, you tactfully 'forgot' to mention that he knows fuck all about philosophy (ancient, modern and post-modern alike). Look how ignorantly he collapses massively different philosophies, Frankfurt School (and within that the differences between its members and the differences between 1st and 2nd generation Frankfurt School philosophers) and French Existentialism, and the differences between French Existentialism (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty) and Foucault and Derrida (and the differences between the last two) who conceived of themselves as primarily critics of French Existentialism. And let us not talk of the massive differences between one Marxist school of thought and another.  The only thing that is clear about  Peterson is that he hasn't even read the Wikipedia page of those philosophers he attacks.   Yours truly does not find Weber or Voltaire or Rousseau boring, you of course are free to choose what thrills you; however, it remains historically ture that most of the people you find 'boring' held far more radical (and dangerous for the status quo) thoughts and arguments in their time than anything a post-modern thinker thinks or argues today. Please don't go down the path of a similar abstraction from history that a ridiculous and sad figure like Peterson does, you are much too intelligent and learned (not to say absolutely riveting to watch) for that."
"I think the reason for your disagreements with JP is that you are not realizing he is talking about what he believes are the best ways to live, as that being the first and most important question to answer, which is not precisely the same as simply telling people how to live. But if you do not think that it matters to discover the best way to live and to then live it, then you wont understand his reasoning for talking about these ideas so much. I think the reason he believes it's important to live the best way you are capable is because he believes, based on the history and psychology he has learnt, that that is the way to write a history with the least amount of unnecessary suffering. This is since he also believes the fundamental reasoning behind the actions which write history are at the level of the ideas possessed by those acting it out,. Therefore I also think that maybe if you are not the type of person who thinks a lot about ideas and there effects, then you are likely to miss the relevance of this type of work and agree with the type of criticisms in this well crafted video."
"As an intent listener of JBP, I think this is serious and interesting critique! Peterson should respond to stuff like this, and disregard the hit pieces (which he largely does). Bravo, though I will say that accusing JBP of strawmanning before accusing him of promoting a 'childishly simple world view' is kind of hypocritical. His world view is anything but simple, which is to a large degree why he is easily misunderstood by anyone who hasn't spent hours and hours listening to him speak."
"so arrogant"
"Peterson fan here* Excellent video! Entertaining, intelligent, knowledgeable. I enjoyed it and learned some things.  I've watched hundreds of hours of JBP, and I'll give you that it takes a while to understand him because he doesn't often say what he personally thinks, and when he does it usually vague and comes with the caveat that all things, even more freedom for everyone, has unintended, and often negative, consequences. That said, He has said he's for equality and the rights of the marginalized, just not at the expense of anyone else. He calls trans people the pronouns they prefer, if they ask. He's for women's rights. He's for progress, he acknowledges that things need changed, and on both sides. He's against racism, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, globalism, and most any -ism. He's a classical Liberal. What he's on about is the destruction of useful hierarchies(an entire can of worms in itself), predicated on competence via both Marxism and Post-modernism. From the perspective of anyone not on the Left(I don't mean liberalism, I mean Leftism), it appears as though the Marxists and Post-modernists have enough in common to drive a political movement as a single unit, and that's what is being considered Leftism, or Post-modern Neo-marxism(my perspective, and maybe in part JBP's). They way both sides present themselves is almost indistinguishable. I can accept that on closer inspection there's two factions moving in relatively the same direction, yet its still a direction I'm entirely against going in, especially since we've already been down that road and know where it leads. He doesn't deny that Marxism and Post-modernism are products of The West,  but that they're antithetical to what The West is.  What do HR staff and activists have to do with this? Well, activists have an almost identical dogma to the Marxism that lead to Stalin and Mao, and which HR people erroneously build into policy trying to make things more equitable. I.E. unconscious bias training which even the guys who created it said was bullshit and useless.  So props for having even a smidgen of a grasp on Dr. Peterson, most Leftists can't manage even that. I'd actually be very interested in the two of you having a real conversation."

"As a major JP fan, all I wish to say is – Bravo. While I think Jordan Peterson is mostly right in his critique of the modern left and I don't fully agree with everything you say, you're actually the first one Iv'e seen that has managed to balance out his critique with some common sense. My prejudice against trans people remains strong in that I still think that trans people are some of the greatest truth speakers / seers in our society. As long as they can avoid clouding their minds with ideological fast food."

"LMAO, this was almost on the point. a.l.m.o.s.t. unfortunately for everybody gloating in the comments, one needs to do bit more reading to understand that saying 'we on the left only complain about society oppression'  plus 'the patriarchy part' is precisely why you are perceived as postmodern neo-Marxist. On top of the given definition above, Marxism argues that conflict, social injustice and class struggle arises in capitalist societies due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed proletariat—a class of wage labourers employed by the bourgeoisie to produce goods and services or 'oppressed group' —and the bourgeoisie—the ruling class that owns the means of production and extract their wealth through appropriation of the surplus product (profit) produced by the proletariat, or simply 'oppressors'.  Oppressors–oppressed distinction or dominant-dominated opposition is a political concept which Marx made very, very popular (and they 'love' it in North Korea and Venezuela nowadays) and it's considered a fundamental element of Marxist analysis. So when you blame 'patriarchy' or 'white angry man'  for 'social injustice' and the 'struggle' you are experiencing within the society, you are using Marxist analysis by defining yourself as a 'oppressed group' and everybody that fit into 'white angry man' - 'group of oppressors'. So, yes, it's neo (new) form of Marxism where instead of focusing solely on economic hierarchy, you are focusing on social hierarchy (first by doing poor job of misidentifying your own society as patriarchy). You are very welcome :D"

"Okay but he isn’t anti transgender people he’s for the freedom of speech laws in Canada making it illegal to misgender someone, and also the Channel 4 interview u put in the video was so edited that it’s sad. He’s explaining why the mainstream “pay gap” is so prevalent. Women choose lower paying jobs over all for a multitude of reasons, including the fact that women are “weaker” on average than men, as well as women tend to place more importance on the family element of their life and less on their career."
"That clip at the end pretty much sums up my position. I don’t disagree with a lot of what ContraPoints is saying. To frame an example I would say the complexity of the perceptual framework used in arguments in a political context, a very two sided context, is nearly impossible to avoid outside two very well educated and level headed individuals. I think *maybe* what Jordan Peterson is doing  is taking the side of “western reason” which we can define more as North Atlantic reason for lack of a better description other than geographical. By doing this he has asserted his place in the battle which appears to be divided in two, which ISN’T wholly untrue. This is not to say the ContraPoints is wrong, she (?im going to use this pronoun until I am corrected, I’m new to this folks) obviously isn’t in an academic context, but in politics the tendency to rally support from the public to attack one side followed then a reactionary public rally from the other side is inevitable as outlined by Schattschneider (Thanks Polisci 101). By exposing the values of various people under the guise of a whole, he can get enough public power to stop the other side. Here’s where the problem of perception comes in. Peterson is not wrong, a lot of those who have some of what he calls “postmodernist neomarxist” views hold many of not most of the other views he associates with all of them. It seems to be a problem of lack of nuance in ideals that is made by the tribalism humans are attuned to. Eventually the ideals he is advocating against could become ingrained in a political party, giving them the power to enact their ideals. The same is true of what we might see on the opposite coin of his ideas of the postmodern neomarxist (altright?), which also ultimately might lead to horrible outcomes. Both sides are scared of the others outcome, which amplified the other side. Both JP and CP are calling for a similar solution, the decoupling of social issues from a single political entity. Unfortunately while JP seems to fears that these political entities are going to destroy the north Atlantic western world, CP seems to see the issues of identity from an academic lens which is focused and controlled and fails to see how most people lump into two categories by nature. Well that’s my take on it at least. I’m no philosopher, and I could be wrong in my interpretation or my analysis."
"I like to believe that the lobster queen anthem already existed and this video was made so she could include it."
"I’m not a left-winger or a progressive by any stretch of the imagination but I enjoy your videos because they’re very well articulated and offer a reasonable and concise viewpoint that challenges mine (most of the time).  JP is a good dude but he’s definitely feeding into the doomsday philosophy he is telling everyone to avoid. I think he’s getting men to open up about mental health which is nice but i’m also not convinced there’s a bloody marxist behind every sociology department either"
"Jordan Peterson notoriety began when he opposed Canada's bill C16 which made it CRIMINAL if you did not address a trans person by their preferred pronoun.  This is by no means a hate of trans people as Jordan himself has stated countless times that if asked by a trans person to be called any preferred pronouns he would consider that by its individual merit.  However, the opposition to the bill by Jordan Pertersom was not to disrespect the trans community  but fight government legislation on speech.  Government, as stated by JP, is using the trans community under the guise of sympathy to force speech restriction.  It is cracking the door open for any future intervention(s) on speach."
"Cathy Newman is not a leftist, she is a centrist who leans to the right. She generally performs badly I think. I don't know if you caught the 'Transgender Debate' a few months ago on Channel Four with Munroe Bergdorf, Caitlyn Jenner, Germaine Greer and some other TERF, and some other trans/nbeis, and I think there was a young Asian woman journalist to tick the POC box, but she did it very badly.   I made a point of watching this video tonight because Jordan Peterson was asked to give his very useful opinions on a Radio Four programme about morality hosted by Jonathan Sachs, a man who used to be the Chief Rabbi in the UK, but is now a Chief campaigner to stop the Labour Party having an actual left wing leader, mainly because of his support for the Palestinians, which Jonathan Sachs would like to make illegal and officially anti Semitic. He was saying some rather muddled stuff about how the problem with morality was that people were losing their identities by being part of these groups and putting words like 'Feminist' and 'non- binary' in their twitter bios and giving up their morality to these groups.  PS, wasn't that Queen's God Save the Queen you played there? Makes up for the lack of a picture of Queen in this video."

"As someone who fell for JP's fear-mongering (before reading C-16 for myself) and who used to be uncomfortable around trans people (mostly due to lack of contact; never met one until recently, and he was very nice btw), your video was a godsend.

The usage of academic resources and philosophers was quite enlightening. But, herein is the issue I see: I could grasp your argument. Many well-trained intellectuals could. How the fuck does a coal miner in Western Virginia, or someone flipping burgers at Mcds, or your average flyover redneck get this? Put more succinctly, is there any way you could distill this entire video down to the level of a five year old? If not, that right there is why Dr. Peterson's rhetoric is heard. Not that it is right, but that it is simple to understand *and* two-dimensional."

A law where if you say the wrong thing, you can be jailed.

If you want to take that connotation out of 'identity politics', I would say 'tribalism' 24:22 Jordan Peterson's definition of 'the west' is straight Nietzschean, and so it follows that the enemy of 'the west' is not the encroachment of 'the east' but the nihilism given birth to by 'the west' as a natural consequence of its own ideals undermining its spiritual roots using logic before it has had time to adapt a new relationship with 'morality' or 'being' or 'purpose' what have you..."

"There’s some good points made by Contrapoints but the ‘gotcha’ moment she clearly builds towards, which is that postmodernism and neo-Marxism have such opposing views that it’s not possible to be a ‘postmodern neo-Marxist’ falls flat.  It’s entirely possible to hold conflicting views. We’ve even got a term for it - ‘cognitive dissonance’.  Some people argue against notions like capitalism, patriarchy etc and they deconstruct such notions using postmodernism arguments.   Such people then put forward their alternative to the ‘evils’ of capitalism which just happens to be from the Marxist line of thinking e.g communism, socialism.   Peterson refers to this as a ‘sleight of hand’. I think some people do this knowingly, some unknowingly but ‘postmodern neo-Marxist’ is definitely something that clearly manifests itself regardless.  I’ve spoken to several people that would consider themselves Marxists and they romanticise postmodernism and hold up the likes of Foucault as great thinkers of their time.  Why? Well I’ve already made it clear above."
"This is so AWESOME! Love the commentary, the costuming, and touches of comedy. :D  WTG, ContraPoints! <3"
"A bunch of hopefully respectful and not too rambling arguments agaisn't you from someone who has multiple necks and still no beard(s(?)). 1. I'd argue this isn't (purely) a localized problem, its echoes can be found all the way in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, where people are legitimately fired for having the wrong opinions. 2. Although, granted, there's a chance that by dismantling collective politics for equality can wound those most vulnerable in our society, he is offering an alternative set of guides that allow you to, with far more precision and agency, solve your own problems. He isn't targeting civil rights, LGBT+ acceptance or gender equality itself, but rather the means by which those are being attempted; legal instead of cultural, collective instead of individual. This is pretty critical to understand if you're trying to argue agaisn't Peterson. He isn't agaisn't the rights of e.g. LGBT+ members, but rather disagrees with what specifically are those rights (Can you ethically make the claim that someone has the right to a legal mandate for compelled speech in their favour?) and how they're accomplished (instead of working as a collective, work as an individual). Don't make the confusion that he's saying that people shouldn't work together to advance their goals, but rather that you shouldn't chain your identity to a collective or become a slave to one - in other words, consider the collective to be a subordinate to the individual as a tool of problem solving and analysis. 3. To the people in the comments talking about identity politics being inevitable; No. What matters is principles, not identity. John Rawls' veil of ignorance argument goes pretty well here. Only take the factors that are really necessary into account when making decisions, this involving shaping law and culture. If you're a woman or a man isn't the direct, most relevant question to ask when you're trying to become e.g. a soldier, the question is can you perform the tasks a soldier has to effectively.  4. His argument isn't that the left is trying to sink us into a totalitarian nightmare (or even is a unified force), it's that both sides (extremes) of the left-right political spectrum can do that, and right now (intentionally or not) the left is pushing ideas that seem to be leading in that direction."

Just cause it's made in a western country doesn't mean it's compatable with the west. Marxism and Postmodernism seek to REBUILD western civilization, and therefore to rebuild anything you must DESTROY it first. All these ideologies want to destory western society. Therefore it's incompatable with the west.      Also he's not against 'civil rights' what a complete strawman.

"I would tear your ass up you look so sexy so smart"
"Thank you! We've always had more left-leaning people. They're as much part of our tradition as anything else."
"Labels."
"Stalin and Mao were not Mass murderers. Great video tho"
"Do you like facesitting?"
"Attach those suction cups to the wall please"
"See, for me, Um more of a 'throw the whole damn society out' kinda person, but so long as society does divide these groups and oppress some more than others I fully support pushing women, PoC, and ❤degenerates❤ up into positions of power, I don't think it's until we have a more diverse power complex that things can begin to change and breakdown, with things like gender and race becoming blurred and more nonsensical than they already are as time moves forward and a black or woman president, for example, is no longer notable at all."
"Ur as boring as J Peterson himself."
"Nooooooo! The Lobster Queen cannot be dead!!"
"JP has been very clear on gender pronouns. He has no issue with calling individuals by the gender pronoun they prefer. He objects only to being coerced to do so by law.  'Reason, power, truth. These are the kinds of topics I simply don't care about.'  You weren't wrong."
"I  buy neither the Hype nor the Hate Surrounding Jordan Bernt Peterson.  He's literally just a dude. I had to see what all the noise was about so I went along and listened to him. He's neither Jesus nor Hitler. Moving past the hyperbolic preconceptions that surround his reputation, you can get to the meat of what stirs up talks surrounding his ideas and keeps them swirling.  Now the thing that put Peterson's Mark on the Map was his refusal to use a person's preferred Pronouns under DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT. He's since stated that he's willing to speak amicably and use preferred pronouns in conversation as it's respectful and natural to how people should interact in a casual setting. In Canada however the government has run up a bill that could make refusing to use a person's preferred pronouns a form of hate crime. THAT'S where it started. That's the original controversy that set this unassuming  canuck rocketing through the cultural conscience of the collective hetero cis-male social sphere-  Involvement of Government Force in Casual Social Interaction. People being subject to fines and imprisonment for SPEECH.  He conflates Neo-Marxism with Postmodernism not because of how they converge by definition but the emergent connection they have in Social Movements of the Left that Advocate for advancement of the interests of minority groups and women through increasing Government Action on those fronts. That's where you find the fuel for the reactionaries."
"Natalie you are a goddamn national treasure <3"
"As a fan of Jordan Peterson I quite liked your approach to this video. I definitely would like to see more videos."
"You’re wonderful. Love the videos!!"
"I've grown out of my Peterson fandom, and appreciate your criticism. But Peterson does define postmodern neo-marxism and his usage of it, often. It's nice to know that he kind of pulled it out of thin air (thank you for that), but given his definition and his usage, his arguments make more sense."
"Don't want to talk about reason and truth? Sounds about right."
"Nobody should ever mock or humiliate contrapoints seriously this woman deserves your respect and dignity not your hatred. I want everyone to LOVE Contrapoints because she is a beautiful amazing woman"
"To be fair to JP, he's not 'telling you how to raise your children' he stated to make sure you raise your children in a way that they don't behave such that you resent them. If you resent your children your family unit is weakened and it reduces their quality of life drastically and affects the opportunities in their future. This doesn't mean the same thing to everyone, some people are cool with their kids running around stores being disruptive, most aren't. It just means that you need to take the time to make your children into what you believe makes a good, conscientious person. I think that's a pretty good message."
"Your delivery is very attractive. However, at the end of the day it's just pretty sophistry."
"your videos are amazing, honestly even if you walk away completely pissed and annoyed by your points its so well crafted you probably won't."
"Fanboygirling! Love sent to that mind of yours"
"At least you’re trying to understand why you have no true comprehension of an intellectual idea. Next time why don’t you do as much research as Peterson, oh wait you’re not going to because you don’t care enough."
"Wow, what a gross, horrible person..."
"So do they just sell Jordan Peterson masks or is that a thing you made?  Either way- wat?"
"blabla so much rubbbiiisshh......."
"There is nothing like this channel on YouTube; This is gold. This is the only channel I wish to unreservedly support. Roll on payday!"
"I've listened to a lot of what Peterson says, and I agree with a lot of it. I'd even say he's taught me a decent amount... but this video was flat out amazing.  Well thought out, and obviously researched points. You give sources to what you're saying and give conclusions that lesser educated people will understand (you don't go TOO deep that people can't understand).  This is exactly what someone against Peterson should be doing, and you NAILED it! Well done, I look forward to listening to you more.  Subbed."
"This was truly postmodern - disrespectful, disorienting, but funny. But the question is: Do you have the guts to interview the real Peterson? Or does Peterson have it?"
"i repeatedly watch this.  It's like disneyland for my head. I am thrilled by the photo of my twenty-something idol, rachel mclish, on the wall."
"just came here from Tim Pool's vid — thumbed up but not sure whether I'd wanna sub, but anyhow you should propose a YouTube conversation with Peterson, I'd watch that"

"28 min and 19 seconds of my life flushed down the toilet"
"ContraPoints is wrong jp is on the left he never moved. I am in the center I never moved. But the far left now thinks he is far right and well I am a alt right nazi. We never moved in our thinking. That is what he is fighting against. Ask yourself how would you feel if a real far alt right got into power and demanded what how you say could talk? Would you not want someone like JP fighting for you? Cause if you like it or not he will fight against that far right bullshit to."
"Fuck! This video is so good!"
"You are really creative and smart Very inspirational✨"
"Was binging your old videos. What happened to your voice surgery just a flip. But the fem has definitely been turned up."
"I just love that JP, a supposed lover of logic and science, is a literal climate change denier. Says it all really."
"Around 7:00 you bring up a point I wanted to address, because I really don't think you've accurately depicted the reality of what progressives are asking of the world.  You say something along the lines of 'we don't tell you what to do or say, we just tell you what not to do' and to that I say you're... not wrong, but you're masking the reality behind clever ability to twist words to sound nicer than they are. Jordan speaking out against the laws that force people to use others' preferred pronouns are a definitive example of speech being forced, but you can always twist that into 'we're just saying NOT to disrespect us'. You can do this with just about anything. You can twist the enforcement of any command from 'do X' to 'don't do Y'. It's really not a valid defense of your side.  Anyway, not to be too negative, I think Peterson does deserve some criticism and I'm always glad to see someone taking a more reasoned approach that actually addresses the arguments being made. As you pointed out, the left doesn't like to do this and I really hope that can change. As a gay furry I should be totally on board with the left's stance of making any identity valid, and in principle I am, but with their general lack of criticism directed inward and a tendency to reject critique from the center/right, I feel like their views, goals and tactics are missing the mark.   I really don't agree that enshrining people's preferred pronouns into law is a good idea. You should have the right to be rude and disrespectful. Someone accepting your identity is not a right, nor is it necessary for them to do so in order to continue having that identity. But what do I know, I'm a fool who thinks gender should be abolished, taken as the joke that it is rather than expanded."
"Jordan Peterson's is right about most thing's but that book is trash."
"This was very entertaining thank you, quality work. I also love your use of Zoe Blade, her music is top tier."
"how do you block a channel?"
"Were you really serious when you said that you are conscious of all your drives? I'm wondering, because clearly I am myself not fully consious of all my drives. Often I do things because I just feel like I want to do them, and sometimes it might take a lot of thinking to figure out why exactly I want to do them.  Or, I feel like something is annoying, but I don't immediately know why I find it annoying."
"I always kinda suspected Jordan Peterson was bullshitting everyone when he regelated all his suffering to neo-marxism without ever going into detail. No one who interviews him or has him on podcasts questions it, nor his own followers. Everyone just gushes over his pseudo-intellectual drivel.  In a way I understand that it is just easier to villify the left when you categorize them under mere commies. But if that is your basis for the cult you unintentionally created...how is it different than any other hate group?  Jordan Peterson in the meanwhile just collects his paychecks on Patreon from these uneducated fools. Making the biggest stand against the obligatory use of pronouns when the odds of ever meeting a transgender person is very low and the odds that this person also demands the use of these pronouns is every smaller.  Literally giving an inch will lead to Stalin."
">bill was about 'protecting trans people' it is not the states job to protect anyones feelings. the fact that transgenderism is so strongly correlated with general severe mental illness (esp. suicide) is not cause to use the state to enforce social acceptance of transgenderism. if anything the exact opposite is what is called for. >reactionary political agenda that's a lie, or rather, it's assuming a very uselessly narrow slip of time to be considered 'the present'/modernity. >cultural marxism can't be true because it was coined by the nazis blind authoritarianism >these issues are all very local, not at all a part of eg. Civil Rights Act type legislation again a matter of how we want to define the 'irreproachable past' >on the left we don't tell people what to do, just what not do... except for all the things we also tell you to do cut the bullshit >your self-help philosophy guidelines-for-a-better-life 'rules' are the same as our violently enforced rules (and actual laws) cut the bullshit >the left is vacuous/nihilistic and does nothing but whine yeah no shit >personally i'm perfectly happy being the untermensch no, you're just past the event horizon of terminal mental illness >contradicts+abandons previous point by admitting college is just marxist indoctrination, while insisting 'transgender rights' is still somehow different >devolves into sketch comedy >Once again using the issue of cultural marxism as a bogeyman.  OK I'm done at this point. Cultural Marxism is real. It is what you are. Whether the ancient conspiracy theory was true all along or has simply been at long last manifested into reality (ie. broken clock finally being right) is immaterial at this point. It is the proper term for what you all are. People continuing to shy away from it just because of the association to the Nazis (and always making some new case-specific term for it eg. JPs 'postmodern neo-marxism') is the error, not recognizing it for what it is.  >But Nazis believed it and therefore it is not true.  This total logical default is why you are undeserving of respectful consideration."
"oh my gosh the lobster example just gave me war flashbacks to high school when my white male geography teacher took a whole class period to show us a (honestly enjoyable) short film about a dystopian society where everyone is 'equal', like in the sense that if you're more talented then others you would be hindered in some way to fix the balance of things, THEN he turned to us all after it was done and was like 'but this is what people are asking for when they say they want equality' and everyone else was like oo damn he right and I was about 1 second from losing my god damn mind"

"You were harsh on Cathy Newman. She works for Channel 4, not the BBC."
"Goddamnit I love you. I'm so glad I found you lol"
"'Learned in the AA meetings I refused to attend.' Funniest line ever. Meanwhile, I love that you define the conflicted nonsense of Peterson's philosophy. I find him utterly unreadable, which is why I have to find people who can wade through his awful prose to get to the point. I believe he is at heart deeply misogynist, and for that I can't take him very seriously. Brava for another great video."
"Nice video. An interesting primer and critique of 'Petersonism'. (I'd heard of him, but being a white male myself I've got better things to do than listen to another middle-aged white male.) My interpretation of what he means by postmodern neo-marxism is coming from the idea that postmodernist things - such as PM-music or PM-architecture - take ideas from different styles/models/disciplines, often in isolation from the original intended context. This can lead to them being incoherent and superficial (much like my argument). Therefore postmodern neo-marxism could mean 'marxism (not really)'."
"You are as cute as a button."
"Well, that was refreshing."
"Peterson has his faults, like any famous psychologist.  He specifically states that if he is wrong about someone's gender identity being genuine, he will accept the consequences. It's compelled speech by threat of sanction that he disagrees with, not being asked to respect transgenders. Also, I love the way you presented this video. It's smart and hilarious!"
"Breddy gud. The only thing I'd like to bring up is that the reason he was against bill c-16. It's because you could be fined or jailed for offensive speech (refusing to use preferred pronouns.) Obviously this goes against basic universal human rights and freedoms when it comes to speech. As far as him thinking women and 'marginalized groups' should go back to being invisible, I think it is more that the current 'advocacy groups' tend to be prejudiced themselves without any risk of consequence from within their own organizations. I've mentioned him say that a serious issue that should be advocated for on behalf of women is to boost their self esteem and prepare them to be combative to achieve their goals, as women are one sixth as likely to ask for a raise as men. I am still shocked by that figure, and I am always encouraging my girlfriend not to be afraid to ask for more money if she is doing a great job at work. (she always does, she's the best employee the retail store she works at has.)"
"For you to have to demean someone in this way just means, that more prayers are needed for this country. I am sorry that you are so unhappy. You should take your flamboyant talents and go to Vegas, the true sin city. You do have a talent but you use it it the wrong way, such a waste. I'm sorry that you choose this path in life."
"Your videos are so good and different than like any other person who speaks on topics like this. The lighting, jokes, etc helps to make a video like this extremely enjoyable to watch"
"Strangers with Candy was awesome"
"I don't know why you waste your time."
"You're a reactive political agenda."
"When you make fun of your subject, you hurt your argument. And you have a valid argument. I consider myself very left leaning and want equality, but Peterson's key arguments are air tight atm. They'll need to be debunked in the same language that he uses."
"Gosh, I love you! These vids are so, so good!"

"I know this is pretty irrelevant to the context of the video as a whole, but wasn't that infamous interview on Channel 4 and not on the BBC?"
"Peterson is a perfect example of why some people should just stay in their small town and drink themselves to death."
"I needed a trigger warning for all the times you say daddy. Because it turns me on. Everytime."
"While I appreciate that you put a lot of effort and research into this video and have some interesting perspectives, you did still misrepresent JP. For example, you mention about how an individual asking for their individual pronouns is   very Liberal and individualistic, and use this as an argument saying that JP is wrong to oppose this and he is in essence contradicting himself. Except he never said that. He has never had an issue with individuals asking for their own pronouns, and has said many times that he would refer to a transwoman as female etc and has done in the past. His objection was to legislating and creating compelled speech. Because while asking for your own pronouns may be individual and Liberal, so is refusing to use those pronouns. The difference here which JP was opposing was FORCING people to use those pronouns under the threat of fines, being fired, violence and jail. That, my dear ContraPoints, is wholly illiberal."

"Vanity, Vanity ....All is Vanity.....  What has been is what will be,     and what has been done is what will be done,     and there is nothing new under the sun.  Is there a thing of which it is said,     “See, this is new”? It has been already     in the ages before us. There is no remembrance of former things,[d]     nor will there be any remembrance of later things[e] yet to be     among those who come after.  'Romanticism regards hierarchy as a repressive social function. But man is biologically a hierarchical animal. When one hierarchy is removed, another automatically springs up to take its place. The great irony of Romanticism is that a movement predicated on freedom will compulsively reenslave itself to imaginative orders even more fixed.  Nature, hailed by Rousseau and Wordsworth as benevolent mother, is a dangerous guest. The ancient cult-followers of Dionysus knew that subordination to nature is a crucifixion and dismemberment. Human identity is obliterated in the Dionysian conversion of matter and energy, a theme of Euripides' Bacche. Romanticism, like the Rousseauist Swinging Sixties, misunderstands the Dionysian as the pleasure principle. Worshipping nature and seeking political and sexual freedom, Romanticism ends in imaginative entrapment of every kind. Perfect freedom is intolerable and therefore impossible.'

"1.Bill C-16 has nothing to do with protecting trans people, especially since Canada isn't a trans-phobic society. Bill C-16 is a compelled speech law under a guise of protecting trans people. He opposed a compelled speech law, first one of the kind in English common law. I don't care if you're trans or cis, you don't get to order me what to say nor does the state, and free speech includes the right to offend people. Especially if the offense is not using stupid, artificial, made up pronouns like zhe and zher and regressive leftist crap like that. If I feel like it, I should also have the right to be a proper cunt and call you a man, you should be adult and thick skinned enough not to have to run to a nanny state to send me to jail over being a rude cunt.  2. Most of the people who do follow Peterson's work aren't young men, YouTube is simply a medium used more by (young) men than women, so that's why there's this perception that most people who appreciate his work are men. That and a hit piece a day peddling this misconception. At his public lectures the crowds are pretty even, or at worst 60 to 40 in favour of men. That's a far cry from the statement that 'most of Peterson's fans are (young) men'. Also, believe it or not, many of us aren't that young either. I'm 39, have been following his work since 2012. Tim Lott, who appreciates Jordan's work greatly, is a man, but hardly a young one...etc  3.Define 'Progressive politics'? I'm progressive on social issues, but if 'progressive politics' is just a misnomer you use to describe regressive leftism and cultural Marxism (the victim oppressor narrative politics), SJW crap, if you will, well these are authoritarian and totalitarian, if you cannot see that you have suspended critical thinking, so you can keep your indoctrination. You don't have to be indoctrinated into identity politics just because you're a trans woman, you can still be a sovereign thinking individual. A proponent of free speech.Trans community isn't a cult or a club, and it's not really a community either. You don't all live in the same suburb, you literally aren't a community, but a bunch of individual people who might not have anything in common other than that you're all trans women or trans men.   4.Jordan doesn't speak against rights of trans people, gender equality, or civil rights. He's a classical liberal and the only place you could have gotten that he's against rights for trans people, gender equality, or civil rights is the aforementioned hit piece a day produced about him. He is for equality of opportunity but against equality of outcome, you know, cos he's neither a fascist nor a a communist. Classic liberal.  5.The absurd intersectionality of regressive leftist ideology doesn't prove cultural Marxism and Postmodernism are at odds. Cultural Marxism is postmodernist since it refuses moral absolutes and teaches cultural relativism and that there are infinite truths and realities, which means there is no truth or reality. There are only equally valid interpretations.  6.When you said you watched hours upon hours of Jordan's work you were clearly speaking in hyperbole otherwise you'd never say Jordan Peterson would want women, sexual or gender minorities to go back to silence and invisibility. But I want equal rights to straight people, I don't want safe spaces from straight people or to tell them they now have no rights because they're straight (or white or men), or any of the SJW nonsense. It's not hard to tell what Jordan's work is about, you've just only barely scratched the surface.   7.Of course, there is no one unifying concept on the left, again it's called intersectionality. Identity politics is dogma, PC culture is nothing more but a way to stop people from questioning the leftist dogma.  20:30 - 21:10 This is just utter nonsense and not based in reality at all. I have no idea where this is coming from, but it's from you not Jordan  You are clearly a very intelligent woman with her heart in the right place, keep on researching Jordan's work and come to (intellectual) dark (web) side Contra, we've got cookies. :)  Cheers."
"there's a major misunderstanding in contrapoints' take on JP's coined 'postmodern neo-marxism'. the 'language police' strain of the left deconstructs (a la postmodernism) identity entirely so as to leave decisions of sex/gender or race totally up to the individual, since it's all a hallucinatory construction anyway. these individuals also see alleged biological determinants to be a tool of a nebulous patriarchy to assert power over it's victims. then many among this niche group call for the state's regulation of verbiage around those specialty people groups, so they may be protected from racism, oppression, sexism, all the classic marxist accusations. this process fits the bill for both :postmodernism: and -neomarxism-."
"Omg I’m copying the bisexual manicure...like I wanna be glamorous but also gotta be ready to finger someone"
"This is so well explained. I always trip over myself when I am trying to explain Peterson's inconsistencies and weirdness to folks... Also post-modernism.

"I’m a JBP fan and this is probably the first time I heard someone counter his ideas with valid points. 🤗 Really glad I found this channel even though I don’t agree with everything u just said about Dr. Peterson 🙃"
"I came to this video, after being linked to the video on incels, and watching both that and this. My main takeaway, I mean as a creative I'm all 'damn that production and the choices with characters' etc, but my main takeaway is just holy crap this sort of work takes just so much research to put together. The amount of reading and watching required to write the script for that video and this must stretch in to the days and weeks. Respect for the effort that went in to making this."
"Well, this shit sucks like this bitch sucks dick: flippantly."

I think this is the second or third video of yours I've watched in the last couple of days, and I'm pretty sure I already love you."
"The common thread between post modernism and marxism that you missed is that both philosophies view the arc of history as being governed by who wields the most power (a power struggle). That is the idea that Jordan Peterson takes the most issue with because it is itself an extremely binary way to view the world."
"'Everyone has identity politics because everyone has an identity. The only difference is that, for members of the group that occupies a dominant position in society, we don’t call it that. Everyone advocates for their own interests, but we only call that “identity politics” to the extent it diverges from the assumed white, male (heterosexual, Christian, etc.,…) mainstream.' - Adam Lee"

"So. I just found you randomly. I love your content. You present things in a well informed, responsible, yet comedic manner.  I've strayed away from a lot of Youtubers regarding this stuff as of recently, but my god, you are a charming person.  SUBBED <3"
"I get what you are trying to say, or at least I think I do, but I disagree that Jordan Peterson see's the entire left as the same threat. He doesn't seem to have a problem with treating these people fairly, he has a problem with the ones who seek to take control of power. I think he see's all of the powers as problematic."
"I'm having the best time binging your videos. Subscribed :D"

"You can't just skim over this conflation between (especially on-campus-) LGBT programs, and state LGBT programs, and civil rights (ir positive rights provided by the state) with socal progress like they are interchangeable. It's begging the question to just treat these forms of positive top-down interference with progress. You need to first show that'st he case, and you need to address the serious issues they present, especially when it comes to free association.  And people think post-modernism is related to SJWs because SJWs reject objective reality in favor of the subjective 'truth.'  The point is, when you start considering the individual you'll see why all these separate categories for leftist ideas are missing the point the right is making. It's not 'progress' just because it's helps minorities. You could easily say that anyone who wants the individual to be left alone is similarity put into one giant group. Don't you see the irony here? If people don't want to use the state to create equality of outcome, they must not want equality of outcome?  And if people aren't willing to divide the world up into identity groups who already come with a story you also need to accept, then you must not want to help those individuals on an individual basis?"

"Violet chachki is that you???"
"Ha! Brilliant video. But.. If I may, I have a point to make regarding Peterson's pronoun beef and his use of Mao...   Imagine... If I decide that my name is going to be Tarquin, from this day forward, I will have to ask that other people will stop calling me Graham and start to use my preferred name.   Most reasonable people will comply with my request but there may be some resistance. That could be born out of apathy, a lack of respect from some people, stubbornness from others and perhaps basic forgetfulness.   If people do choose to be a dick about it, then that is up to them... Their behaviour serves to demonstrate what kind of people they are... The situation is tolerable... nobody dies.  On the other hand...  if I were inclined to.... I could choose to be a dick about the whole thing instead. I could make it so that I can use this request for compliance to exercise some form of control over others, (lots of people are motivated and geared to behave in this way... it isn't far fetched!)   I could insist that people are always 100% compliant with my request on the grounds that any failure to comply causes me significant distress.   Then, if I wanted to, (and I have met many people who would)... I could keep shifting the goalposts so that people around me are subtly forced into a state of insecurity whenever I am around.   I could enforce my demand by becoming disruptive whenever people were not compliant. Essentially I am making an emotional comfort blanket out of my ability to make other people do what I want them to do.   This is just one of many types of gaslighting available to those of a sociopathic persuasion.  It is basically toddler behaviour (or narcissistic sociopath MO) and where it occurs, it does not stop until people refuse to keep meeting those demands...  I would hope that if I behaved in this way that people would not tolerate it for long, not for their benefit but because when that happens it would be an important life lesson and a step towards me becoming a more fully functioning person with greater potential for developing compassion.   Now imagine that I was playing head games and instead of just becoming personally disruptive when faced with non compliant people, I actually had it written into law that I must always be obeyed.   Imagine that... IT IS HERE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR TYRANNY EXISTS...   Now imagine that not one person spoke out against my plan or questioned it's usefulness or even subjected it to the type of debate that is standard practice in a parliamentary democracy.  this is where Dr Peterson found himself... No law has ever existed that compelled speech in the way that the proposed Canadian law does. Not only is it worrying that it was ever tabled, the fact it's universally supported and that to speak out against it is not tolerated... in a democracy... THAT is fucking outrageous and is the reason that Dr P's allusions to Mao are not at all out of place given the details of that specific situation and the lack of foresight or even adherence to best practices within the actual government.... Thank God that Dr P saw it and has been willing to put his neck on the line in order to highlight it. It might be too late, but at least it has not gone unchallenged. You said that post modernism was basically scepticism. If you believe that then you might yet see the value in Peterson's efforts."
"As a pretty left-leaning person, I don't agree with a lot of what Peterson says but you seem to be approaching these topics with your mind already set on a very defined opinion and world view and thus interpret a lot of things very condescendingly. Even in your 'what I like ughhuhuh' you pretty much end up shittalking him."
"Peterson does what every alt right personality does: Takes the most extreme and stupid people and ideas from the Left and acts like it's the mainstream. The fact is most Liberals HATE modern day SJWs and Feminists. They don't think Black Lives Matter should be called Black Lives Matter because they're aware of how divisive that sounds and how focused it is on race, when in fact police brutality is an issue all Americans face. They reject the modern Feminists as shown in the Red Pill documentary, the Feminists who actually DO hate men and blame the Patriarchy for everything.   The fact is these leftists are a loud, outspoken minority. Most Liberals want to get past Identity Politics all together...because IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO! To place one group over another is wrong, no matter which way things were in the past. It's better to make sweeping changes that help EVERYONE, rather than focus on divisive policies focused on a minority of people. It's better to pass free college for qualifying students, rather than argue for Affirmative Action. It's better to have a negative income tax, rather than argue for reparations. I could go on and on here. I think real Liberals understand that Identity Politics is a dead end both morally and politically (more and more people are identifying as Independents).   So to summarize: Peterson goes after the low hanging fruit, just like most other personalities on the Alt-Right. It's popular because he's RIGHT about these extremely fringe people and their terrible ideas and misplaced morals. That's the hook. After he catches your attention, he then grandfathers in his own messed up Christian Anarcho Capitalist ideology and peddles it to people who think he's so amazing for not being politically correct and speaking out against these SJWs and Feminazis.   Here's a hint: He's not special. He's playing you. There are TONS of Liberals making the same criticisms of the fringe Left that Peterson does...but they aren't going to then try to convince you Jesus died for your Sins and Anarcho-Capitalism is the best way to arrange society. Sam Harris is the PERFECT counter to Peterson because he also realizes the problems with SJWs, but he uses Atheism and Rationality to get to a place of true understanding, which is why he advocates for things like Capitalism with a strong welfare state, free of religion (basically the opposite of Peterson here). BTW, almost NO ONE on the Left is a Communist. Less Leftists in America are Communist than Right Wingers are Neo-Nazi! Don't fall for his hook - there are plenty of Liberals speaking out against these SJWs and Feminazis as well. There are plenty of Liberals who reject censorship and deplatforming. You don't need to go to the Alt Right or to people like Peterson to join this fight."
"Pause at 13:34. Enjoy 😎."

"A sincere question, is that contras “natural” voice? Or is it a kind of mimick of a more feminine voice? Her voice isn’t particularly bad, it just doesn’t sound natural.  I used to date a 6’1 Serbian lady who’s voice was deeper than contras faux-lady voice. So I wonder if it’s an adaptation to seem more feminine or if this is her actual voice. Would be weird to feel the need to change my voice for any reason, for what? You’re whole life?"
"God I love this channel!"

"I'm a JPeterson fan (enough to be a patron) and I really like your style.  It's refreshing to see such a sarcastic, yet civil, criticism of Peterson, especially those nebulous 'postmodernist neo-marxists.'  You hit the nail on the head that most critics don't address his ideas, and instead just label him as a transphobe / mysoginist / 'angry white man.'  Which makes them look dull and dimwitted."

"I think there's a misunderstanding with what Peterson is saying. I'm not sure that he thinks there's a very coordinated effort to take down western society by the post-modern neo-marxists. I think what he's saying is that the ideology itself will take down western society if it gains enough power and that it is currently gaining power."

So what does she want to say when she's saying 'other white guys who talk about lobsters,' (7'49) Please ? I really want to understand"
"You bring up some very valid points but still fail in the fact that what jorden peterson is advocating for the individual and free will implying patriarchy is not a thing of social issues but psychological and scientific reasons. Which there is evidence to support that it is without much evidence to support that it is social bigots and racists causing social deficits."
"It'd be great to see a live discourse between these two"
"Have him on the show"
"My issue with Peterson is that I don't understand the strong reaction toward him from either direction. To the people who hate him, I don't understand what he is saying that is making you so emotional, and to the people who think he's a god, have you ever read a book? He's not exceptional to me in any way. Just your average prof with mainly centrist, right-leaning views."
"Friend, you have done such a good job of emphasizing to me (a person who falls somewhere between quite-left-centrist and moderate-liberal) that I've still fallen for a fair few fascist/far right dog whistles in terms of how I feel about the far left. Thank you for helping me think critically about my own opinions, and how they've been impacted by the rhetoric of others. I've been binging your videos all day."
"I have a crush."
"God save the lobster queen"

"How is cultural marxism a nazi conspiracy theory... what?"
"20:25 Indeed JayPee can be tricky like that.It's a common strategy for these guys....make a completely true and inoffensive statement like 'men and women are different biologically' but in the context of * a discussion of the problem of economic inequality* so that the clear implication is that he is *responding to* that problem by explaining it away as such.   This provides the benefit of a cover of inoffensive logic and matter-of-factness to his words. So his naive followers question WHY WHY WHY do you crazy Leftists think JP is a fascist when he has NEVER said anything sexist of racist, WHY????? when it's really quite obvious to the rest of us: the sexism and racism is merely implicit but absolutely undeniable. He denies human rights by context not by direct verbiage. By denying that there IS currently still any racism or sexism, he closes the door on those still suffering from *clear and verifiable* racism and sexism daily- thereby making him- yes, a fascist."
"At least this person has a sense of humour and tries to be a little creative."

"I'm a utilitarian Marxist: I believe that all that is truly worth investigation is self-evident anyway. The only type of intellectual investigation that is morally worthy is that which further elucidates Truth (i.e. what is self evident)"
"The problem with these 'alt-light' guys is that they (hoiffyingly blindly) scorn and criticize us 'social justice types' for our asserting our racial or gender or sexual identities so intensely, while they continue- breathtakingly blindly- asserting SOLELY a very specific type of masculine dominance as right and proper. (That hegemony by its very nature on multiple levels, of course oppresses those other identities all while pretending it's 'natural'- that's where for ex the evopsych comes in)   Human beings =/=lobsters.  Modern women have flamethrowers =/= you can't fuck with us anymore."
"i really feel that JAyPee 'Lobster' JerryCurl *Is* a fascist. i think you're underestimating his self awareness of what he's doing for money (check his patrreon doations, he's a rich genius at the expense of bring the 'backlash'. You're naive."
"JayPee JerryCurl the Canadian Frog is an empty shit who just parrots SMART PEOPLE and makes LoADS of money off lost young men. The reason he is dangerous is not only that he is so ostentatiously disinenuous but that he purposely LEAVES OUT MULTICULTURALIST AND FEMINIST REALITIES by floating from evopsych's biological realities to ancient european culture to the technological advances of 'western culture' all while never really discussing any of it. So the great edifices of old were all built by who? You guessed it- MEN. WHITE MEN. Like his audience. There is nothing else except this, and this utterly wipes out the contributions and experiences of women and non-whites throughout history.   Personally, I dont' agree with the whole 'life isnt enough thing' - in my opinion, that is what unhappy mentally ill people experience.Not me, sorry- dont experience this, never found this to be true and don't believe this."
"I just realized Peterson is the Persig of this decade"
"Right on. Thoughtful and hilarious."
"Can I be your room mate?"
"Good video, very good video, but arguments are not good enough. Which is not suprising , because this dude talks and writes a lot. And he tends to eleborate one aspect of his argument extensively, so sometimes there is not enough room to explain other aspects of the argument and, therefore, the argument as a whole IS NOT EXPLAINED in one video (and it is already 90 minutes long). I suppose, it's not the issue in his books (especially in the first one), but I haven't read them. So I had to watch A LOT to understand his complete arguments. And of course many people would not do that (and it seems you haven't watched enough) because ...mmmm... why spending time on this dude anyway. So, one problem in your video is that when you are talking about petersonian 'neo-marxism' thing, you actually start to describe just marxism. And in actual marxism there are indeed these 'strictly defined groups' that struggle for power (and yes, these 'strictly defined' things contradict postmodern relativism as you pointed out). But in neo-marxism these ... 'groups' are not strictly defined - they are just markered as having power (oppressors) or not having power (oppressed). So they are not 'substantional' groups, they are not really entities but functions or positions that one group or another can occupy and act out (if you've read Derrida you can remember the same idea about grand narratives having substantial center - God is in the center of worldview, or Human is, or Logic is... - and then in Derrida's postmodern view non of these thing is the center, they just occupy the position of center and act as a function of center in one or another person's mind or in on particular literary work; so the center is still there - but only as a position or as a function). So, these groups struggling for power are no longer 'strictly defined', they can be anything - and this is much more postmodern-friendly than original marxism (you can see this in Critical theory neo-marxist guys), therefore, the contradiction you pointed out becomes invalid if you pay more attention to words ('neo-'...). Another problem is about 'peterson defending all hierarchies'. He is not. He said it many times that hierarchies tend towards tyranny, they just become too steep - and that is a malfuctioning on their part. And that is a good job for the Left to notice it and work with it. You said that no one says that all hierarchies are bullshit - well, a lot of loony activists and professors with zero citatiions of their works do. There is a lot more but fuck it. No one is going to read this anyway."
"Steamiest intellectual video on YouTube"
"love u"
"Why...why do all the sceptics wear top hats??"
"A few things: 1) Yes, postmodern neomarxism is a self-contradiction. But it doesn't follow that no-one holds that position. The self contradiction is just a reason they are wrong to. 2) On marxism etc. being 'western'. An idea can be geographically of western origin without being poltically western. I think you are equivocating those two into 'western'.  3) Allowing individuals to define their own pronouns etc. is indeed a liberal western value- Peterson supports this. Enforcing that people respect those by law is not a liberal western value, it's authoritarian- Peterson doesn't support this."
"25:04 I respect everybody and their pronouns just fine, if I want to talk to somebody I'll call them whatever they want, but it's still not okay to legislate this stuff. There are plenty of people who simply struggle to see the world for what it really is, and legislation restricting the use of language will absolutely be misused by those with ill intentions and result in unjust punishment. This should be a message of respect and tolerance, rather than negative reinforcement under threat of jail time.  26:02 Sounds like a fun guy o___o"
"This might be the ONLY video online that is critical of Peterson and not showered with hatred and dislikes. Says a lot of the quality - great job!"
"Incredibly well done critique. Discovered your channel today, it's a treasure."
"What do you call a movement which follows the philosophy of post-modern neo Marxism with the unintended consequence of destroying civilisation and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare without being called a fascist?"
"This is it bitch.   I'm subscribing."
"Libertarians might indeed use your precious pronouns if 1) you asked nicely, one on one, as the subject comes up; 2) the government didn't step in with legislation that FORCES people to talk that way, under penalty. Peterson came to prominence because he opposed the legislative push, not the social change per se."
"I think leftists and altrighters should take a brake from hating each other for one day and get together to just shit on Jordan Peterson , Ben Shapiro And Candace Owens.   I really think that would be good for our country and help ease the political tension.    We may be mortals enemies but at least we can hate the same people."
"'So to a lot of people, Jordan Peterson's ideas seem new and emergent.' To use a Jordan Petersonism -- 'WRONG! That's exactly wrong!'   Peterson doesn't preach these ideas are new and emergent. The fact he's referencing the bible suggests these truths are very old and fundamental truths about how to be in the world to manifest the most good or least suffering.   What he does suggest is that post modernists have devalued these traditional beliefs and attacked them which might do irreparable harm to society.   'If it's not a conspiracy theory about post modern plotting to destroy the West, then what is postmodern neo-marxism?' For a start, it is a left-to-right leaning professorship ratio of 27:1 that ridicules conservative ideas, is actively trying to suppress conservative viewpoints and requires all first year students and most majors to take mandatory courses on 'privilege', 'systems of oppression' and the supposed default toxicity of men ('Learn how not to rape' courses).  You know, all the things you go on to say are valid complaints several seconds after you asked 'What is it?' at about 6:25.    Wow, then at 7:35, you pretty much admit all the left talks about is how society oppressed this, oppresses that and how oppressed everyone is and the level of intersection among the oppressed (intersectionality).  It seems you know exactly some of the things that comprise post modern neo-marxism and then deny it's existence in the next breath.  'Ohhhhkay....then...' is all I have to say to that.  I'm 8 minutes into the video almost and all you've said is you agree with the majority of his stuff, your bedroom preferences and that you don't know what the issue or problem is, while listing many issues and problems.....calling those issues and problems a conspiracy theory in one breath, denying their existence in the next and listing all of them right after. Cognitive dissonance much?   'We spend four years undergraduates why capitalism and then say well you're educated now! Goodbye! Good luck getting a job under capitalism!'  This is part of the postmodern neo-marxism. Creating a generation of communist, socialist anti-capitalist believers within a capitalist society that teaches everyone anyone who has success is oppressing others and only got there thru cheating and unleashing this awful bunch of indoctrinated people into a capitalist society.    You have anti-fa which are facists generated by this culture attacking their political opponents, looting shots, burning and committing acts of violence.  Teaching people it's morally right to attack those physically who disagree with your viewpoint. Good luck when you create even two or three more generations of this. What do you think the future of that society is?"

You can see right through him. He really stands for nothing. He is very confused and he can NEVER answer a direct questions. That means he's a very small and week human.  I feel sorry for him.  Also, JORDAN PETERSON STOP using my Jesus Christ!!! He does not agree with you on any level.   Because you are a LIAR!!!!!  You are a lier because you yourself don't believe your own diarrhea that spews out of your mouth!!!  Shame on you!!!!!!!"

"Jordan Peterson is a heavy weight undefeated boxing champion taking on featherweight boxers who just turned 18. Both him and Ben Shapiro work hard to defeat the 'left' when who they are attacking are the nonsensical uneducated idiots who just read a news headline then declare themselves #woke. Whenever Peterson ends up in a situation where his true intent is at risk of being nailed down, he squirms (Joe Rogan and Sam Harris interviews). I'm a Peterson (and Shapiro) fan, and I agree 97.254% with your critique of him. Where I disagree is in the ambiguity of Peterson's true motives or what he really is saying, after a while you learn how to translate his nebulous talk, and can understand what he intends (by cross referencing similar statements and conversations he has had, which is annoying at best). Also I think he is a horrible public speaker, I will fight you on that one.  Edit: After reading some comments. JP isn't angry about the use of new pronouns, he is angry that governments will enforce the use of new pronouns. If you give governments the power to censor or enforce any type of speech you are setting a dangerous precedent. The cost of free speech is hearing things you don't want to, and is totally worth being able to say what you want. I'd rather have someone tell me I'm an asshole and give me the finger, than be locked away for X amount of years trying not to drop a bar of soap."

"I appreciate the diligent work and conversation put into this video.  What I'm thinking right now is there sure is more than enough finger pointing going around to serve as fuel for the other side's animosity fire. Maybe the best we can hope for, is to stay out of each other's way. I'm just thinking out loud.   Maybe, as humans, we've always been this suspicious of each other's motives. The difference is that now, we have technology to communicate this type of suspicion more efficiently. Everyone in the world can't trust every other person in the world. When it comes down to it, humans tend to trust certain people more than other people. Even if two people hold the exact same principles, they may be offended by the way the other person displays those principles.   If you've ever gotten into a fight with someone, which everyone has, you can see how much work it takes to repair the relationship and restore 'good will.'  Now, imagine that after the fight, you had other people (media) telling you how the other side was out to get you. Why would you believe it? Because they speak the 'same language.' They think like you do, so they know which values to promote. Those aren't the same values promoted by the 'other.' So, it's easy to convince you that the 'other' has no values or nothing important to say.   It's easy for a negative feedback loop to start. 1) As retaliation, the other side puts you down. 2) As retaliation, you put the other side down. 3) repeat for infinity. No one's goals ever align exactly. But, it's difficult to compromise if you believe that the other side will only take advantage of you. The social contract is broken.   Is it possible to break that cycle? Is it possible where people who seek 'order' can get along with people who seek 'exploration?' (chaos sounded too negative).   There are people out there who would prefer to wage war than to make peace, so to speak. And they exist on both sides of the divide between order and chaos. I agree with JP about the need for both order and chaos. Within both realms there is good and evil, so to speak. Good chaos, bad chaos, good order, bad order...  If you are up to no good, it's not as obvious to me that you are. So, even though we think very differently, I am trying to help make things better by looking at intentions instead of tribal 'in-group-markers.' Thanks for allowing that to happen.   If you ask real nice, I'll tell you what covfefe means. I can even introduce you to pepe."

"There's an argument I like to use 'against' post modernism. If truth is a social construct, than it's true that truth is a social construct, and the truth that truth is a social construct is a social construct. This doesn't defeat postmodernism, but it does give it's proponents a big old pair of bull horns they have to grab. They must either argue that they don't support their own opinion, or that all human society I'd doomed to bellum omnium contra omnes."

"I'm a bisexual woman who identifies as a man.  I'm also Christian.  And on the subject of these types of values:  Not killing people who are innocent is a Judeo-Christian value.  Not stealing is another.  Rejecting pederasty and any abuse of children is another.  You talk about Judeo-Christian values as if they are evil.   I sincerely hope you don't endorse pedophilia, pederasty, and killing indiscriminately.    I have studied the Bible for decades, and I already know what the thoughtless responses from people will be.  It will surely depress me.  Just remember, don't try learning about what the Bible is about from other atheists because you all study the Bible with extreme bias and to warp and discredit it.  I myself have studied many religions for years each, letting those religions speak for themselves instead of warping them to fit what I already believe about them.  Christianity deserves an unbiased study if one wishes to speak frankly about it.    Judeo-Christian morals are important.   I'm so tired of atheists saying things like, 'Jesus hates homosexuals,' when Jesus was the one to hang out with hookers and homosexuals and lepers and the reviled and downtrodden and give them nothing but healing and kindness.  And that's just one extreme misinterpretation of the Bible people usually have just so they can fabricate reasons to hate the Book.  People just LOVE to hate and feel superior."

His followers are fans of his self help book, have made him into a guru, avoid looking at anything that criticizes Peterson, and being recovering misogynists enjoy his bigoted dog whistling of code terms like 'Western Culture' for white men and 'Post Modern Marxism' for everything that criticizes the status quo of their privileges, or 'women who made me feel bad about myself'."

And a neo-marxist if you think that the world is just a battlefield for groups trying to gain power. Neo in the way that it's not working people against rich people, but minorities(or other identity group) vs everyone else. Those two concepts can be together right? If I'm wrong please feel free to reply :)"

"Here is my big problem with this. JP doesn't actually use sound psychology most of the time. He talks about consciousness like you have control over it, and you can use it to steer your actions.  That presupposes that your consciousness is an external input... not an output. What does that mean? Well, the most compelling investigations about consciousness and our sense of self I have seen, which to my understanding are the accepted theories in the discipline of psychology... All suggest that your consciousness is not what drives your actions... Rather your actions happen, and then your consciousness weaves a narrative trying to interpret why you chose those actions. That happens after the fact, but it feels like before, giving you the illusion of control over your actions. There is plenty of experiments that back up this phenomenon.   Your consciousness knows about as much about your internal workings as does a stranger that follows you around watching everything you do all the time. That is a fair bit, but even still that stranger doesn't know what you are thinking... not really... nor do they have the ability to change your decisions.  At the end of the day, your consciousness is like a baby in the passenger seat with a plastic steering wheel. It thinks that moving the wheel around has an impact, as it seems like every time it moves the wheel something happens... but in reality, everything was already happening and the baby has no effect on the end result.  If your consciousness could be interpreted as anything... it could be thought of as how your brain feeds the output indirectly back into the input.  So in short, the fact that JP never talks about this and instead talks about you having self-determination through your conscious mind... is just... disingenuous given that he calls himself a professor of psychology. Either he doesn't know what he is talking about, or he willfully ignores what science points to about our consciousness... neither is good."

"I loved this video and how you pointed out that we can't really know what JP thinks about certain issues. I feel that's been the biggest problem with how we talk about these far right and far left individuals. Conversations between two people of different idealogoies turn into finger pointing matches and nobody ever asks the simple question of 'why'. 'Why do you think that way' 'why is that relevent'. No one takes the time to pick apart the other sides arguement and they instead just say 'no, you're wrong'."

"Jordan said often postmodern neomarxim is nonsensical (excatly like you described it). But he thinks because the cognitive dissonance caused by 'postmodernism leads to nihilism' und the needs of humans for a cause ..we get this postm. Neo.M. mess."
"Ive never heard of Jordan Petersen before this and well all I can say, though a lot of these terms and statements went somewhat over my head, is that Peterson just pulls a lot of stuff out of legitimate places and out of his butt. He seems reasonable enough but when you really analyze and think about what he's saying, like what Contra did here, it just well crumbles. That's basically what I'm getting from it..."
"I think the issue you miss in your criticism of postmodern neo-Marxism that Jordan Peterson argues against, is that people use postmodern reasoning to break identity groups down infinitely, and then use Marxism to justify a forceful rebalancing of an ever growing number of identity groups predicated on who is oppressed more. Most of the people who advocate for these things don't embrace these philosophies wholesale, but pick and choose the parts that are convenient for them. (Which is fine.)"

"I'm not criticizing you, CP. I'm criticizing JP. 6:36 the very fact that large portions of society hate highly sensitive people says a lot about society's overall mindset (note well I didn't even bother to use 'overly'). Perhaps they are 'overly' sensitive for a good reason - the same way GLBT were 'overly' sensitive 30 and 40 years ago, and blacks a generation before that. It boils down to this: LOTS of people love to display social dominance over 'inferiors', 'disgracefuls', etc. - namely by spewing condescension, contempt, ridicule, or otherwise disrespect toward them, even though the targets did no bad to other people.  If we purged that trait from society, we'd solve 3/4 of the world's problems in a single stroke."

"Peterson isn't a fascist. He's just old school classic conservative. He's a more educated Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck."
"I think that mannequin would've called you Mommy."
"Jordan Peterson has said that Postmodernism and Neo-Marxism don't work together and that to truly be one you can't be the other. Also, I'm just saying that by western philosophy he's talking about what has become mainstream."
"I think you're wrong about how Peterson argues. The mistake here is giving him more credit than is due. If you and I had a conversation there would be very little that either of us would say which wouldn't have another layer of meaning. Because that's how people normally talk to each other. Human conversation is typically full of implications, inferences, euphemism, and water testing statements. But he just doesn't operate like that. He's like an adding machine. He can only work off his per-programed constants. You return the sum of what you input. If all you input are solutions; All you will return is errors. That's why it's frustrating. Because people try to have a conversation with him but all he has is a readout of problems solved for."
"I don't remember Foppington... (flips through history textbook frantically)"
"This was very entertaining to watch (you're hilarious!).  It would be good to see a conversation between you and Peterson.  I'm a Peterson fan myself, and on the one hand I think you might have misunderstood some of his points, but on the other I appreciate that sometimes he could stand to explain his ideas better.  It's good to see well-constructed points on the opposite side of the debate, because it's the only way we're going to get anywhere.  And I appreciate you pointing out that he's not a fascist, since it's a gross misinterpretation and isn't going to help anything.  Ultimately, we're all looking for solutions to complicated issues and we have to be willing to have these debates rather than shut them down."

"Christianity, the other “Western values” that Peterson claims to be defending, has deep anti-authority values.  Believers are told to accept mortal authority because this world barely matters - not to respect or endorse it, merely to endure it because, like Christ, we all have a cross to bear.  The dogmatic power mongers in the church don’t like the idea that Christ alone is King, not them and not their sad little hierarchy of lobsters and definitely not that Emperor Guy.  Not placing trust in Mortal Princes goes back to the Old Testament, and it’s a theme repeated clearly when Pilate acts like a moronic demagogue as well as the assembled “Chief Priests and Scribes” who are more interested in their mortal authority than the Word of God.  Peterson is not advocating for Christ’s life and teachings or the values that Paul explains in the later New Testament."
"The trans issue is a trojan horse for a totalitarian, Marxist agenda. How many actual trans people are there in Canada or in the US. If I had to guess I'd say that it's less than 1 percent of the total population. So this insanely small group of people warrant that laws be put into place to accommodate them and their bizarre, antisocial lifestyle? Laws that affect everyone and could have negative effects on the freedom of the entire population? Not only are laws being put into place but their degenerate fetishistic lifestyle is being promoted to children as a healthy alternative lifestyle despite evidence suggesting that trans people are largely mentally ill and have an extremely high suicide rate? I find it hard to believe that trans people are 'in danger'. And even if they were attacked or harassed, we have these things called laws that deter such behavior and punish it. Just because you have gender dysphoria doesn't mean you get special laws.     I think it's stupid to believe that if a man is naturally effeminate and not masculine in the stereotypical way that he needs to put on a dress and chop his penis off. This is a very shallow and childish view of gender, gender roles and what it means to be a man or woman. There are different kinds of masculinity. Some men are feminine. It doesn't make them any less of a man. This type of man shouldn't need to feel like he needs to put on a dress and pretend to be a woman to be himself. It's weird and ridiculous. And just because a woman is a little more masculine or domineering it doesn't mean that she needs to become a 'man' and chop her tits off. This is insanity and anyone with an ounce of sanity can see how perverse, unhealthy, unnatural and bizarre it is."

"I got linked to your Incel video by a guy friend and loved it. Now I'm just watching other videos - and I have to say I deeply admire your video essays, what you articulate, and so on. I know this is probably outside the realm of what you could have covered, and like you said you were going to set aside the whole 'global/cultural marxism' thing....but, well.... It's so hard for me as a Jewish woman to get past that. I guess of note 1.) 'Judeo-Christian' is a term deeply disliked by Jewish people - it was popularized entirely after the Holocaust in part to minimize Christian/Church participation in the Holocaust and in institutional antisemitism in general, and in part to pointedly exclude Islam from comparison. (On a doctrine sort of level, Islam is closer to Judaism than Christianity is in a lot of ways.) Basically I'm glad you had 'judeo-christian values' in quotes because well...there's almost never any *Judaism* involved and it's all explicitly Christian, and it's more honestly conservative christianity.   And 2.) I know you said you were setting it aside, but when you reach Jordan Peterson's discussion of 'The West,' and argue Marxism is part of the west, and they might as well argue against Buddhism, that basically elides the point why referencing 'cultural marxism,' or 'cultural-bolshevism' are white supremacist dogwhistles. The simple fact of implying 'Marxism' is trying to 'destroy the West' is an absolutely pointed chain of logic. Although Marx didn't practice Judaism he was Ethnically Jewish --> white supremacists believe Jewish people are a 'poison' to the West/Whiteness and are not true westerners --> Marx was a Jew --> therefore they believe Marxism is non-western and trying to destroy the West. Buddhism holds no special interest for people like Peterson because their fear is 'infiltration' of the West and 'poisoning the well' of it - and the people they believe do that are Jewish because they think they can more easily 'see' who is Buddhist. Buddhism isn't a problem because it can't 'sneak up,' and Buddhists do not have the same kind of canards describing them as particularly conniving or manipulative. So many antisemitic canards are based on global power/control/banks, but also 'marxism' and 'cosmopolitanism,' and yes, 'liberal intellectualism.' Buddhists are not the concern of people trying to 'save the west' because they don't have centuries of bigotry saying Buddhists are likely to promote racial-mixing or that Buddhists 'wander' endlessly and are trying to bring about the destruction of Christianity.   I love the videos, I think you're smart and engaging and I've subscribed. But I also worry because it feels like *no one* is willing to discuss antisemitism seriously. Does Jordan realize that's what he's doing, in placing 'Marxism' as opposite to 'The West'? Maybe. Maybe not. But the fact of the matter is that is exactly what that means -- whether or not people realize they're promoting a white supremacist conspiracy theory that Jewish people are going to destroy western civilization matters less to me than the fact that no one is examining that's what people are saying and very few non-Jewish people seem to recognize it or be alarmed by it. I listen to so many thoughtful critics and thinkers and pretty much none of them ever acknowledge how many conspiracies are steeped in antisemitism at the root, or how many of those theories have been softened and disseminated by wildly popular public speakers like Peterson for people to absorb and believe in whether or not they realize where it's coming from (antisemitism). I just wish anyone would talk about it. But most people just set it aside."
"At first I thought Jordan Peterson was really impressive but as the years went by the hype has kind of worn off for me lol"

"Saw the like ratio and was scared to look at the comments, thinking they might be anti-petersons hopping on some sort of bandwagon.  Pleasantly surprised to see the top comments from Peterson fans appreciating the (buzzword) *nuanced* take on his philosophies.  I don't know why I was so surprised, when all of Contra's videos I've seen are well-researched and give credit where credit is due. Good on'ya"

"Good analysis! JP talks a lot of shit about a lot of subjects, he definitely needs calling out in some areas. That said, he does have his good points.   I don't think you're being entirely fair on the 'Marxist-Postmodernist' point though. Deciding that it is a totally meaningless term doesn't really make sense.   I understand it to mean taking the Marxist view of history (everyone is either a victim or an oppressor) and attaching it to post-modern ideas of deconstruction. That really doesn't seem totally incompatible to me. Really, he's talking about cultural Marxism as opposed to economic Marxism."

"Everytime I hear Peterson say 'the postmodern neo-marxists' I cringe a little mainly for the reasons that you point out. If there is a something that Peterson should clear up, it is his language. Now, he does have a few points that make him seem somewhat of a conservative, right wing ideologue, even though he claims he does not have a political agenda. However, for the most part I see Peterson as a natural reaction against what for lack of a better word I will call the Social Justice Warrior Cry Baby class. I wonder how you really feel about them because you, me and everyone else watching this knows what I am talking about and that is exactly who Peterson refers to when he incorrectly utters postmodern neo-marxists.  I am undoubtedly on the left but one of the best points he makes is framed by asking the question: Is the left, or rather, is some faction of the left taking things too far? He does, from time to time, talk about a sensible left so he does not completely believe that all of us are part of one monolithic leftist structure because but we, in the more legitimate left (in my opinion) have to talk about these people and call them out on their bullshit. But I do recognize Peterson generally lumps us all together in the same box.  Another point you could have talked about is the free speech issue. I do 100% agree that this is a right that should never be messed with in the way that certain western societies are doing. For example, Mark Meechan was charged with the crime of making a joke about his pug making a nazi salute as a joke and has to pay a fee. Anyone with half a brain who would watch this video would immediately realize that this was not hate speech - it was only a joke. This is serious and could set a precedent. And speaking of hate speech - Are we so insecure in the foundations of our society that we must call for violence against those who do? As much as I would like to bash all those Charlottesville tiki torch -wielding assholes faces in, I have to stop and let them speak their mind as long as they don't resort to violence themselves (which I know one of them did). This is what free speech means. If we start making exceptions then... well, you know where I'm going with this.  I will acknowledge that one other main problem I have with JP is that he thinks that the communist projects of the Soviet Union and China are the perfect interpretation and expression of Marxist economic theory. As far as I know (and correct me if I'm wrong - for real, please do. I have read a part of Capital but not the whole thing) Capitalism is supposed to collapse under its own weight and the proletariat were supposed to take over the means of productions but neither State accomplished this. Both in the USSR and Communist China the Bolsheviks and Mao's led States seized and distributed the means of production as they saw fit so not at all the revolution they were promised. To be fair, i do not  believe in the communist utopia - I think is pure fantasy and we never even got close because capitalism turned out to be a much more efficient and adaptable economic machine than Marx ever thought. But what IS very much valid in Marxist theory, is his critique of capitalism, how he breaks down value and his overall dissection of economics to its most elementary parts - this is important.  I get the impression that JP is not all that well read in the things he criticizes. This is something that he should definitely work on but as a final point I will praise him for his emphasis in mythology. I think it is something largely forgotten by most modern intellectuals. It is not for nothing that Fritz Nietzsche was able to craft such an impressive body of work - he saw the effectiveness of speaking the language of mythology (especially of the pre-socratics) and let that seep into his own style.  In conclusion, I think that JP is a positive voice in the socio-political discourse of the first world in particular despite having some problems. I think we'll all look back at these crazed, over-sensitive who can't even take a joke SJWs one day and think: 'what the fuck were those people thinking?'  Sorry for the length of my rambling. I am done now."
"Something that really shows JP’s snowflakes side; Pankaj Mishra pointing out similarities between his philosophizing and that of Fascists, and JP’s measured, rational response (calling Mishra a “prick,” and proposing to slap him). If you read about the history and intellectual evolution of Fascism (say, Alexander Reid Ross’s “Against the Fascist Creep), you see that Fascists love the kind of ephemeral, metaphysical stuff (whether it’s exactly the same, I don’t know) that JP works with: stuff about “deeper” truths lodged in human consciousness, beyond time, space and the material world, and such. “Natural” aristocracies, etc."

Five years from now, chances are, he'll be forgotten or marginalized by the same type of people that admire and defend him now.  However, someone new will arise to take that spotlight in some manner, and so on after that individual.   Prof. Peterson isn't such a bad person, but, like many fanbases, a segment of his followers come off as ignorant, untested in life, obnoxious, and judgmental to those not in their online clique."
"This was very illuminating. I liked Matt Dillahunty's characterization of Jordan Peterson as 'the Deepak Chopra of incels.'"

"Nice video. Full of sophistry though. The author pretends that critical race theory has no basis in postmodernism and that current social justice movement has no roots in Frankfurt school, which were neo-marxist by their own account. A bit dishonest to say the least, but nobody cares and nobody will read this comment. People come here for confirmation bias and that wish will be granted by this video."
"What have you shot in to your face that's making your eyes disappear?! It's lobster brain juice isn't it? Isn't it!? Admit it!

"'postmodern neo-Marxism' as a boogeyman confuses the hell out of me. Even if it's possible that Natalie misinterpreted what Peterson means by these terms, I don't see a definition of those terms that is reconcilable, and especially not one that can actually coherently apply to everyone to whom he applies it. no, Peterson fans, I am not going to watch his videos to get a clearer idea. the Kermit-ness of his voice is just too distracting, and his speech rhythm is nails on chalkboard for reasons I can't articulate.   so, uh, if there's any JP fans out there who would like to provide a SUCCINCT definition of terms for what he says when he says postmodernism and neo-Marxism, I'd be appreciative. In the mean time, I'm going to continue to wonder how the right is incapable of observing the divisions in the left with any degree of clarity. We all just keep getting lumped together, treated as one evil mass. The Left, such as it is, is an atomized mess to an even greater degree than the right."

Thanks for the quality video! :)"
"A massive thunderbolt struck the moment I turned this on! I beholdeth the power of trans women!"
"25:05 This is almost right, and possibly my biggest issue with the video. While it is true that complete individualism in a society would allow for people to employ any pronouns and identity they want, trying to impose that identity and that subjective reality on other people is inherently collectivist and authoritarian, because you are compelling people to say and believe something that they might disagree with, or possibly doesn't line up with other's subjective realities"

"Wait, you're doing the exact same thing as Cathy McCarthy did to him in that interview. I'm a little mixed, is this whole video a satirical statement on how people with liberal or leftists ideas tend to interpret Peterson's ideas or are you being serious?   In case you're being serious: You've literally come up with ideas he has never spoken about and claim that he has said them in a manner that you imply he actually has said that, word to word. You cherry pick things he's written or said, so that they sound stupid out of context. You also treat him as if he doesn't support equal rights for everyone, including fetishists and LGTB.

"Jordan Peterson = fake scholar. Everything about his psychology is vacuous. Don't get me wrong, if you're a 16 yr old boy who's never been laid then I can see the appeal. Meanwhile, back in the big boy world. Has Peterson ever really contributed anything to the field?"
"I've never been happier. I've literally never been happier."
"You've made a few odd arguments in rebuttal. For example: Peterson's argument is not that people shouldn't be allowed to prefer a certain gender pronoun, as you insist near the end of your video, which would undermine his stance on individualism; rather, his argument is that people should not be forced to use such pronouns even though one may prefer it. It's very much a reaction to a law proposed in Canada. The reason he acts like such a thing is so real and not a conspiracy theory, as you seem to imply, is because some of these things are very much a real thing for him.   I think you got a lot right about Peterson, but you still misrepresented that argument among others."
"Whole video: missing the point. Lmao but very funny. Not exactly informative or anything though!"
"Exceptionally well done. A fine video-essay. Now for the criticisms.   Post-modernism and Marxism may as well be at odds. However, that doesn't mean one can't simply use both of these concepts to create a new idea. Each side can cherry pick 'acceptable' ideas from these ideologies to make an amalgam that is in accordance to their beliefs. What Peterson says is irrelevant at this point, I am talking about your assertions in the video.   Assuming that this video is made to appeal not only those who are on the left but everyone on the political-philosophical spectrum, you talk as if we agree on every policy surrounding socio-economics, civil rights, civil discourse, justice etc. I mean how am I going to take you seriously if you assume that any kind of perversion to cultural norm deserves a civil rights activism. Just from looking at suicide rates among transgender people it appears to bring more harm than the individual freedom it is supposed to provide. One thing that made Peterson famous was he stood up against governmental intervention on speech to make room for 'freedom'? for trans people. Take welfare or Medicare for instance, I completely and utterly oppose such governmental programs that are supposed to bring social good. Looking at the trends all the way back to 1920s, every policy that is promoted to bring social good ended up harming the populace not benefiting them. State housing, rent control, federal reserve, stamps... I can go on and on. It basically comes down to mindless do-goodism vs letting individuals be. I am unsure as to how educated you are on economics but if you received any education whatsoever you would agree that any freedom government sets out to provide, inevitably vanishes from the realm of possibilities.   While you're right about Peterson's generalisation of the left as one big destructive entity, when he is specific he is also right. Commonly referred as sjws do exhibit behaviour akin to Stalinism. Political correctness was invented by those people and now it's being championed by, very much locally I would say, many on the left.   Finally, I hope this doesn't sound too personal but doesn't it bother you to appear as someone who doesn't take himself seriously? I mean you make it look like it's for the sake of the video and for comical purposes only but you take every opportunity to discredit, belittle yourself. I mean your exit remarks on a video that's 20 minutes long is 'I don't care anyway.' ?"
"As someone who appreciates Jordan Peterson, I thoroughly enjoyed this video. Very funny and deeply researched"
"At 22.15 'The hierarchies we are interested in are those of gender, race and economics.'  Spoiler alert : There will be never ending hierarchies in each of those that will frustrate you and seem unfair. People will be convinced of an egalitarian result among those hierarchies you are interested in and wonder why their legislation, pitchfork mobs, continuous messaging and technologies still can't fix it. Good luck ContraPoint, enjoy your bath!"
"I am so glad you left the academia. Because your channel is top notch! 👏"
"70% of video is saying that water is wet, you are describing various political views, and philosophies and are explaining them but by doing to I cannot see how it is negative towards him, also many points are repeated in other form, you can 'critique' everything by doing that. You say that he is focusing on basics of what people already know, well not everyone knows this, and not the importance of it. by saying 'Make the bed' he is saying to focus on some things, and then into other and other. Also he is a fucking clinical psychiatrist and was for around 20 years, i think he kinda knows his stuff. Im sure he knows more then person from video above."

"ty much for putting out some reasonable criticism on Peterson. personally a fan, but everyone has flaws and haven't seen much legitimate arguments against the guy"
"ContraPoints, please address the issue that initiated Peterson's rise to fame:  Does the State have the right to compel speech, with threat of fines (not to mention loss of one's job at the public university) for failure to comply?  Should the use of the new pronouns be enforced by the full police power of the State?  Should Peterson's refusal to submit to the new legal principle of compelled speech be interpreted as lack of respect for LGBT people, or should it be interpreted on the narrow focus of a refusal to accept  the legal principle that speech can be compelled by the police power of the State?  Peterson would say that the Canadian legislators were not thinking clearly, that their minds were muddled by the herd mentality of liberal politics.  What is wrong with demanding clear thinking?"

"Peterson is a hack"
"Hey great job on this video, not that I agree with all of your criticisms, but they all come from a fair and genuine place. I'm glad to have found this actually rational critique on him especially after the media instantly polarized, either building the greatest Nazi themed strawman the world's ever seen or praising him endlessly for the most basic of his ideas.  I do feel you've interpreted him to be a bit more malicious and absolutist than he is, if you would care to hear my response. You've made a few of his points on the radicalization of education sound a bit more conspiratorial than they are, and with that he didn't exactly make the straight comparison of trans activists to totalitarians. It's some of their driving philosophy that's totalitarian, namely the pushing of compelled speech, not their personality or motives. I also can't see how anything he's put forward could be misdirected towards hate for homosexuals or women unless they REALLY misinterpreted him. For the most part his followers are pretty accommodating, with hyper radicalization on either side being what we're against (not any group of people defined by anything but philosophy.)  Anyways now that I've had the chance to say what I wanted I feel like I should compliment you again, because really I harbour no ill will towards you even though my response may make it seem that way. This video was great and I love your humour, keep it goin daddy :P"

"The thing is, while I don't fully agree with JP, I do see that rhe rapid change of education is not a good one. Too much care is taken to make sure the kids aren't hurt. The curriculum has become so much smaller and is focussing more on issues I believe are not for the school to teach. I believe school is for maths and language, not for the understanding of sex and gender. This is for the parents to teach."

"I'm late to the party, straight up necro threading. I enjoy your videos, big fan.  Thumbs up for referring to homosexuals, transgender, ect as❤degenerates❤ that's fucking funny.   To the point.  More often then not I find myself disagreeing with Peterson. He is often disengeniuos  and distorted from reality. But from a 'steelman' POV. It should be noted that his rise to fame started, not because he was refusing to use preferred pronouns  but the fact that is was being made a crime to not use them. Very important distinction.  Compelled language is a thing, not as much in the US as it is in Canada and parts of Europe, but it is coming. It needs to be faught. Winning the battle of ideas comes not from forcing compliance but from.letting the other side spew their BS and pointing out what it is.  That's why I like your channel, and sargon, and armored sceptic, and Rubin. Because you encourage dialog and point out what's wrong.  Keep up the good work."

"even though i dont agree with you, i have to say that this was a really good video.Points were made really clear, examples and reasoning were spot on and every technical aspects were flawless. i would say that the cocky attitude at the beginning was annoying and cheap and the 'funny bits' were cringe, in my opinion you should just drop the 'funny bits', you have enough carisma to sustain this tongue and cheek personality"

"WELL since you asked what i want from you is to actually research the man you claim to have researched i mean i found more than 30 things that you said that had more holes in them than the black hole theory! I want you to objectively research this person you say 'doesn't' want to use pronouns please do some homework here. I makes it very cringe worthy when i hear someone as unique and funny as you say some stupid uniformed crap. THE MAN HAS OVER 500 HOURS OF LECTURES ONLINE YET NO ONE CAN QUOTE HIM IN CONTEXT WITH A SMOKING GUN. It would help me out if you would really watch him and listen to him and as you yourself stated not make characterchure(s) or straw-men i wish you would follow this advice and really look into this man and see what he says and not be blinded by how others say he is. He doesnt hate trans nor gay so please know that and learn WHY he doesnt want compelled speech laws that would hurt everyone."
"16. did i just hear that??? 'Marxism is western-ism?' WOW you uh have problems 'Marxism is enlightenment philosophy' ??? WHERE CAN I BUY YOUR WEED?"
"leaves 4 minutes left to state the other side starts talking about it, and then says oh we don't have time 'Eye roll'"
"15. OMFG Jordan Peterson DID NOT SAY HIERACHYS ARE 'JUST'!!!!!!!!!! HE SAID WE HAVE  HIERARCHYS BECAUSE THEY NATURALLY FORM. HE STATED THEY HAPPEN NATURALLY HE ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT WE NEED THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT TO POINT OUT WHEN THEY GO TO FAR AND KEEP THEM IN CHECK PLEASE FOR FUCKS SAKE KEEP THE STRAW-MEN TO A MINIMUM THE FUCKING FIELD IS FULL ALREADY!"
"14. you want to abolish Hierarchy's for race, gender, and economics lets see here. A. Being racist is in fact illegal but lets just say you want to make sure that race is not being discrimated against......Well why do we have blacks only college? women only college? aren't these technically sexist and racist? I mean if you dont think so then flip it and say mens only or whites only see how racist and sexist it sounds then? if you see it only through one lens and keep an eye closed you dont see the whole picture. 'any racism or sexism is RACIST AND SEXIST. B. Well how about quotas are you saying people of color or women cant make it without them? thats pretty fing sexist and racist to me? i think quotas sound pretty bad.... how about scholarships that are only allowed for one sex or race? thats pretty sexist or racist.....yet these were not made by the alt right idiots these were made by racist sexist lefties. SO YOU THINK their should be equality in the workplace great me as well. so DO we make both men and woman work the same hours? do we pay janitors the same as doctors? Well why not I mean the idiots that report on the wage pay gap dont take hours worked, job, and education into account so should we just pay everyone minimum wage? good luck keeping doctors and lawyers then..... ITS ILLEGAL TO PAY WOMEN AND OTHER RACES LESS THAN ANYONE ELSE. if it were legal why are companies not hiring more women then if they could if fact pay them less???? TELL ME do women and men work the same hours, take the same holidays and both give birth or raise families? BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO END THE GAP OF PAY THESE THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED."
"13. HAVE YOU REALLY LISTENED TO EVERYONE SPEAK?????  Me personally I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL PEOPLE SAY IT IS CONSTRUCT. hell i found several articals googling this so even if the conversations Ive had don't count or the things ive heard said in videos well google this crap and tell me you didnt find it please."
"12. YOU DIDNT REALLY articulate your self very well here so let me help you out here. A. JBP is talking about the belief that some people have about hierarchic structures are just social constructs and some people actually belief this 'Eye roll' B. JBP then goes on to point out THEY ARE IN FACT BIOLOGICAL AND A NATURAL EVENT THAT OCCURS AND HE USES LOBSTERS AS AN EXAMPLE. you failed misrably to either refute his claim or to even give an example of where its wrong, a counter argument or even a full statement in opposition to it. you just say checkmate and FYI he didn't say that or imply it so please stop putting words in his mouth."
"11. geese you just keep spitting out BS. JBP would say true things and then imply controversial things? lol what part of the CathyNewman interview are you really going to try and defend? you made a strawman about him making a strawman so you could imply the strawman you said he made was a trap that either would be set off so he could use it to say you misrepresented him? THIS IS SOME STRAMAN-CEPTION. MAN I CANT HOLD ALL THESE characterchure(s)"
"10. he compares activists to mass murders lol oh look its a wild characterchure(s) poke'ball go! I choose you 'actual fact'  JBP doesnt mind you fighting for rights. He just doesnt want people to kill everyone on the way to their goals."
"9. 'HE uses PMNMarxism to catergorize the entire left as bent on the destruction of westernCIV..... why do you keep putting words in his mouth??? Considering how you started this vid with people keep making characterchure(s) of him you seem to like making characterchure(s) of him."
"8. 'Their are arguments about identity politics in leftist academia and JBP doesn't know or either doesn't care' um A. dont put words in his mouth please. B. Considering HE :3 IS IN LEFT ACADEMIA THAT WOULD AND SHOULD SHOW YOU HE DOES KNOW. C. Considering HE IS IN THE DISCUSSION THAT SHOULD LET YOU KNOW HE DOES CARE AND DOES KNOW."
"7 THAT definition for identity politics you have 'i do not think it means what you think it means' LOL please read more into identity politics than what YOU want it to mean and use it for. IT IS USED BY THE LEFT AND RIGHT to play games with IM THE WINNER CAUSE I SAY as the starter. grouping together individuals in the belief that it will make them more free is the antithesis of what identity politics is and does. EVERYONE IS AN INDIVIDUAL. groups us all together or saying this persons opinion is more important because of their gender/race/background is a pretty bad. JUSTICE? Really now? no i think that something that hates on genders and race should be excluded from the discussion and identity politics does just that. Equality? lol equality of outcomes but most certainly not equality of opportunity. HOW IT IS USED AND WHO USES IT CHANGES 'IDENTITY POLITICS DRASTICALLY'."
"6. 'Peterson includes the entirety of the modern left in post modernism neo Marxism' lets not put words in his mouth please."
"5. DRAWS you in with preludes and leads you to a pretty weird place..... um earlier you said people make what was it??? oh yeah characterchure(s) thats the word."
"4. 'ANGRY TRANS ARE TELLING ME WHAT WORDS TO USE AND I DONT LIKE IT' Please dont put words in his mouth. also not everyone that Is trans hates him he receives thanks from many that DO NOT WANT TO BE GROUPED WITH EVERYONE ELSE. ALSO not everyone that claims to be trans is in fact trans. you can find many a person that just wants the protection and oppression that comes with being different and they claim to be trans with they just want to be edgy SO NO @not all trans"
"3. I dont remember Dr. J.B.P. comparing TRANS-GENDER-ISM TO STALIN. I DO however remember quite clearly he said the utterances of the RADICAL left and please don't include #all trans in your view of progressive or radical please. He said what they call for you know making it a law to decide what you can and cant say is a bad idea. Why is it a bad idea you ask? well aside from those that have already been punished for jokes and or posting videos of people like Peterson in their classroom being punished or being threatened with LEGAL ACTION. The other thing is that THE CURRENT NUMBER OF GENDERS IS OVER 2 MILLION.....SO MAKING IT A LAW TO IF YOU MISGENDER SOMEONE A CRIME IS RATHER STUPID. BECAUSE IF I identify as an attack Helicopter and you accidental call me a car by mistake or because you forget MAKING THIS a LEGAL PUNISHABLE OFFENSE speaks poorly of the left. When the crazies in the right controlled everything  it was pretty shitty. NOW when the crazies in the left control everything its getting pretty shitty as well. So maybe the sane people on both sides and us towards the center can sit down and get some things worked out without screwing over either side."
"2. didn't you say that people have just been making characterchure(s)  of him and then you just say his life coaching is just a Trojan horse for political agendas? ummm yeah..... really need to reread your accurate assessment from earlier where people misrepresent him..."
"1. the law wouldn't protect transgender it would be wielded as a weapon against anyone that 'disagrees with anything said by them' CASE IN POINT Lindsey Shepard the lady that was OPPOSED TO Peterson tried to post a video of him in her class and LEGAL action was threatened against her WITH THIS LAW for merely showing a video of Peterson ."
"Jesus, shut up and take my money. I don’t know what you’re selling but empty my wallet already..."
"I've never heard of Peterson before, and now that I have, I kinda wish I hadn't. :/"
"This was interesting, please keep making videos."
"I don't know where this fits into Peterson's hierarchy argument, but it's worth noting: lobsters are functionally immortal. As in, they have to be killed for them to die, otherwise they will keep living, growing and gaining in fertility. Just thought I'd put that out there."
"In fact, Marxism does have traces of messianism (Judeo-Chr.) in its advocacy of the proletariat as savior/redeemer of the history of humanity.  I see this as Peterson's main critique to the Neo-Marxism in which he groups all (or most) of the minorities political and philosophical advocates: there's this tendency to 'sanctify' or 'enshrine' the minorities as 'redeemers' of the western world. In fact, the individuals that compose minorities are just humans as everyone else, with the same basic urges, likes and dislikes, desires, etc. E.g.: In Mexico there's a leftist posture in which all that has to do with indigenous traditions/communities, etc., is seen as marvelous, better than our (filthy, diluted city dwellers) way of life. Which is just nonsense, because indigenous communities have troubles peculiar to themselves and also similar to ours.  That said, when he talks he does sound like speaking of an organization conspiring against the world."

"Oh look, a transvestite indulging in his sex fetish: mimicking a flamboyant, sexually suggestive woman. And what's this? Oh, a bunch of retards who think that that sexually deviant behavior = psychologically compelled transgenderism."
"I steongly agree on him with one point: 'No one has any reason to respect someone's opinions if they aren't living in perfect accordance with their values.' Get your own life in order first and foremost. You can't help someone else or tell them what to do if you are living in a state of crisis yourself."

"I think what's going on w/ Peterson & using pronouns boils down to criminalization. He's said in interviews that he's been politely asked to use them before & has. His issue is in the forcing of others to say it or face jail time.  No one, to my knowledge, has ever been jailed for calling a man a woman or vice versa. It's generally considered a social faux pas, they apologize & people move on. No one would criminalize it, for that very reason. Most people never mean offense in saying it wrong in my experience (I am a girl & have been called sir more than once). I do, unintentionally, look not very feminine. I've always just shrugged it off & the few times I do bother to correct someone they apologize.  I would assume Peterson doesn't have anything against people asserting individuality; moreso, it's the how of it being implemented that's the issue & I get that."
"Who's the guy at the end talking to Dave Rubin?"
"Very funny but for such a long video, it's kind of anti-climatic. Your criticisms of alt-right/alt-lite seem to be more about snappy witticisms than engagement. Kind of a smart version of Milo Yiannoplis for the left.   I think we would agree that these right-wingers are largely pseudo-intellectual lightweights that create false narratives about morality, history and just humanity in general, but as you said, we're not presenting much of anything better on the left.   To briefly point to David Hume or Plato's Republic isn't being fair intellectually, it's roughly equivalent to name dropping. Brief sketches about their ideology, influence, etc. isn't the same as actually engaging with those ideas, whether pro or con. Reducing them to pederasts or 'feels over reals' is just bizarre coming from someone who seems to advocate broader thinking on seemingly taboo subjects.  These videos just comes off as very funny exercises in being dismissive to knuckle-dragging ape men who think they are philosopher kings, which is fine in of itself, but they're also giving a very reductionist education on figures throughout history, if we can call that educational at all."

"Identity politics isn't 'advocacy for rights, equality, justice, visibility for particular groups, e.g. women, PoC, degenerates'. Identity politics is any political ideology that has identity at its core. This includes: racial supremacy (based on the identity of race), Theocracy (based on the identity of religion), Marxism (based on th identity of class) etc. It is an umbrella term encompassing many different worldviews. Just wanted to point that out."
"i love it"
"So your main points are: 1) Humans aren't capable of holding views or ideas that seem compatible when shallowly understood but which are actually contradictory, and thus can't be animated by aspects of both postmodern ideology and Marxist ideology at the same time. 2) Even though everyone understands exactly what Peterson is talking about through the common parlance when he says 'the West' or 'the Western philosophical tradition,' i.e. what he views as the culmination or key aspects of genuine moral progress that humanity has finally been able to partially institutionalize in one particular part of the world as a result of thousands of years of horrifically brutal trial and error and glacial dialectic—free enterprise, individualism, and the religious or philosophical views that most commonly sustain them—it's silly for him to invoke 'the West' because terrible ideas and philosophies also originated in that part of the world and are just as 'Western,' even though they later took root in, were acted out to their gravest consequences by, and were re-popularized throughout the world in spite of those consequences by, distinctly non-western populations.  3*) Despite putting several hours into writing, filming, editing, and scoring a 30-minute video about Jordan Peterson, featuring several solid minutes of you carefully complimenting him to build up trust with fans and fence-sitters before engaging in the exercise of condescendingly explaining a surgically prepared take on intro to philosophy that's perfectly arranged to passive aggressively intimate to anyone who doesn't know better in terms of their general understanding of philosophy or of his actual material that his worldview is alternatingly simplistic, childish, disingenuous, and conspiratorial, you really don't care about him at all and just made the video because you like mood-lighting and set design."
"thank god for this really interesting and balanced video. my dad is really into his books and i've been genuinely concerned about it since hearing some clips of one of his books while he drove me somewhere. it was stuff about lobsters and it was really early in the morning so i thought i was in the middle of some fever dream and then heard about his positions on trans activism"

"This is the most articulate argument in critical dialog with JP I have seen! ... having watched a lot of him I feel like he is playing the long game with the conservative audience.. really..

"I realise that in the first half you claim that peterson is against trans activists compelling speech due to it being equal to stalinism but i'm pretty sure his actual argument is that it is a gateway to stalinism. Introducing compelled speech would lead to the easier implementation of more compelled speech due to the precedent set and that is what he is opposed to, not what trans people want to be called.  I also realised that the way you word things are a little strange such as 'collectively following to destroy' which would't be a true representation. A better representation would be 'collectively following which leads to the destruction' which would be a much more accurate argument to counter. A combination of misrepresentation of arguments and really cringy humour stops  me from finishing this video or watching other videos but i hope you better understand and represent the arguments of your opponents because at this point you're arguing a strawman of peterson, albeit one that is significantly closer to the ones that the MSM portray."

For all the criticisms you mentioned, Peterson would actually agree with you because you confuse Peterson with his fans and oversimplify his views with the same attitude that you characterize his attitude towards the Left (He doesn't actually hate the Left, he says it's necessary but hates the Far-Left). Ironically you admire Judith Butler who herself is famous for word salads.  Now I won't deny that he gets carried away with some of his characterizations of the Left, but you should level fair criticism, especially when that's what you said you will do. But, by admission you're just a youtuber who doesn't indulge in these discussions, so I can understand."
"ContraPoints is a beacon of sustained and intelligent discussion in a dark void of soundbites and received wisdom.  Now...can you please do a video on the pit of poison vipers that is Leftbook?"
"Thank you for deconstructing J Petersons fallacies , you do it with humour and intellect . I personally don't have the patience to deal with this smart arse charlatan with his abstract connections and outright lies . He is a spiny lobster archetype ,unpleasant to handle but tasty in a pot of boiling water ."
"Ah Peterson - people either love him or hate him :D  Nice video, the rift between left and right and SJW content makes me sometimes wonder about what’s thought in North American universities..."
"First video of yours I’ve ever seen and omg it was a trip I loved it. How have I not seen ur vids before ???"
"'i personally hate taking orders outside the bedroom' come to me, soulmate :D"
"Her question about people getting caught in the fight  https://youtu.be/15IWB9-r07M"
"I liked Peterson's criticism of the education system. Maybe it's was a bit pandering to my bias of disatisfaction with my education, but maybe there's a point there. Mostly I'm just commenting for the YouTube algorithm. Peace!"
"new subscriber, this was enlightening lol! I new there was something about Jordan Peterson that annoyed me, but I just couldn't put my finger on it! xD"
"14:08 LMFAO!!!"
"8:10 My undergraduate experience was different from yours. I majored in economics in a consistently right-wing city (Colorado Springs). So I was taught that capitalism works because people always act according to their true preferences. No matter how bad the system looks, it is still what we chose."
"This was excellent and a lot of fun. I would love to see a discussion between you and Jordan Peterson. He would eat you alive, of course, though from what I can gather you wouldn't mind that at all. ;) But it would at least be intellectually challenging and worthwhile, unlike every other single combative interview of Peterson I've seen up to this point, and I think it would force him to clarify some of his generalizations in a way that would be beneficial. So, despite the various straw men, good job. Entertaining and thought-provoking stuff. I gave it a like, despite my philosophical disagreements."
"6:16 'A certain mediocre corner of academia' - Peterson's been at the University of Toronto too long. *airhorns* (JK, I know it's one of the best schools in Canada, before anyone gets their bougie Toronto panties in a twist.)"
"Self help books = basic common sense that people CAN and SHOULD figure out on their own but there they are throwing money at people to give them BASIC life advice that should come from within."
"This video left me confused, philosophically and sexually."
"surprisingly insightful and wonderfully humorous!!  thank you, dear trans-bitch."
"Jordan Peterson is the Bible, deliberate contradictions so anyone can make any argument from the incoherency. I love and will send you to hell. Peterson's tactict is to imply mountains of misogny, don't wear make up!, and end with a direct statement of he supports women. This is why the fanboy trope of misrepresentation will be bottomless. He spreads hate indirectly while stating directly hes not a hater. Except with the political left, which he just outright hates."
"Another sign gender-specific pronouns are a specifically western movement? Many eastern languages don't HAVE gender-specific pronouns, or at least ones that are noticeably distinct (in Chinese, 'him' and 'her' are written slightly differently, but have the same pronunciation, and the 'him' character is a universal symbol anyway)"

"1. Nah, he just doesn’t appreciate the Government compelling speech via legislation. 2. Are you trying to say that many progressives don’t have an affinity for marxism? 3. He’s saying laws in a secular, sovereign state should pertain to individuals instead of subjective groups. 4. Could you elaborate on the unjust heirarchies? 5. Is attempting to vote in a socialist not tearing down the west?"
"3:43 Excuse you. I'll have you know that we millenials drink like champions."
"I just found this channel and I love you"
"Hey ContraPoints, great video! One thing tho  @14:35, It's spelled Foucault (I'm legitimately not sure if the misspelling was ironic tho since you're talking about Sargon mispronouncing Foucault's name, so whatever I don't even know why I'm writing this comment anymore)"
"Can.. I.. be your new room mate?"
"As a left wing trans-woman i have to say i do not find Jordan Peterson's position on pronouns to be transphobic."

"You’re amazing"
"This was really interesting and I appreciate your distinction of Postmodernism and Marxism but really I just wanted to complimet your pink flamingos reference"
"Postmodernism: the belief that all value is relative and there is no such thing as absolute value. There, that was easy."
"Liked for the wig."
"Suggesting that women be sold as commodities to angry young men so that they don't shoot up a mall renders him no better than a rich, erudite incel--so not a fascist, no, but almost as insidious."
"Unwatchable."
"The best job I've seen on this topic. If your interested you'll see that JP gets his bad ideas from Steven Hicks, an Ayn Rand loving postmodern critic."
"9:10 hottest thing I’ve ever seen 💦"
"Identity Ptx =/= Postmodernism is explained really well here - putting in words what i've been trying to when talking to peterson fans"
"Honestly, I disagree vehemently with you about the gender and trans stuff, but man I love your style. I find your videos hilarious, tongue-in-cheek, wonderfully parodying and, honestly, quite interesting. This one especially is particularly well done! You certainly know how to do your research, and I commend you on your creativity!"
"Wait, wait, wait. The lobster thing... Jordan Peterson *is* a prophet! For Jibbers Crabst!  https://pm1.narvii.com/6223/c7a0f87db7c4e7982fcc7846a3f081e84a2b8709_hq.jpg"
"love our good good boys <3"
"Sorry minor point but the Cathy Newman interview was on Channel 4 News not BBC. There's a big difference if you live in the UK. Sorry, carry on..."
"That feel when you find a channel that you should of been watching years ago."
"The Left only talks about things that appear to be social issues but are really just people NOT taking responsibility for their lives. So I guess I wouldn't say they don't tell people how to live their lives as much as I would say that the Left believes that people should ONLY be allowed to live their lives under certain rules that encourage people to consistently blame outside forces for social issues.  This obviously will never end, especially if like me, you're a black male."
"the pink flamingos reference for marquis de sade is perfectly fitting"
"I figure the best comedy scene here has to be:  'Is that all womanhood means to you? (pause) Mm-hmm!'"
"I love you, I will always love you <3"
"Bravo! Fucking great video, bb.  <3"
"I am 2 minutes in, and so excited to continue. I have enjoyed Peterson's lectures since spring in 2016, and they really helped me glean a lot of insights which helped me move my personal development forward and drastically improved my life.  I got caught up in his anxiety over C-16, and I still believed in him until very recently. The things I hear from him now are flabbergasting and so unlike the professor I looked up to before. I really don't know if he truly believes the things he says, or if he is simply repeating hateful stuff to get more money from awful, sick people. Either alternative is terrible. Any gradient in between is terrible. It's all terrible.  Let us proceed..."
"He does use the term cultural marxist's."
"THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A RIDE!!!!!!!!!!! Omg this is too good! You definitely deserve all that amount of patreons and needs way more views and likes. The amount of effort on this video gave me anxiety because its so so sooooo good. Love from Brazil <3"

"Calling Freud Daddy is the ultimate power move"
"very interesting, ' I learned a lot today', no seriously I did. Unfortunately, I think your average 'JP Fanboy'  probably won't comprehend much of what you say and will stop after one minute."
"I've been listening to 1791L like a lot and I needed something like this to balance that out. Really good video so far. Although, I still feel like JP does a lot more normal and probably useful stuff than he does wild stuff, but he gets a hell of a lot more attention for his wild stuff. My little brother actually grilled me when I was making fun of him cuz I could basically only reference the buzzy shit he did in interviews and a basic synopsis of his top selling book. Listening to his lectures I got bored but realized the ridicule he gets is disproportional to his actual body of work."
"Ugh what a disgusting and gross creature on so many levels"
"9:17 - Yeah, I'm into Milkboarding too."
"see how he subtly pointed out that this 'youtuber person' was trans? 27:55"
"very clever and very funny and i came here to say the opposite . good luck to you 👍"
"I think the confusion between critics of postmodern neo-Marxism and Cultural Marxism conspiracy theorists is because they are both critical of the hugely influential Frankfurt School of post-Marxist philosophy and it's members (such as Herbert Marcuse, who openly advocated for government censorship of opinions that he disagreed with).   The main difference is that critics of postmodern neo-Marxism look at the Frankfurt school and think 'These guys were hugely influential to modern academia; maybe we should critique their toxic brand of post-Marxism seeing as it's now being taken as gospel at many universities,' while Cultural Marxist Conspiracy Theorists look at them and think 'These guys were hugely influential to modern academia; it must be those Evul Jooz trying to take over the world again'."

"If I would find myself in the same AA meeting with her, I would be so happy."
"Small correction: the Cathy Newman interview was on channel 4 not the BBC. Apart from that I have to say great video! This is the first of your videos that I've come across and I found it thoroughly entertaining and engaging ☺ keep up the good work!"
"jordan peterson's voice really bothers me. it's not even the worst thing about him but it's the one thing i can't get over."
"This is how the left can beat the fash, with dank memes"
"You're fucking brilliant. I'm living for this video. <3"
"Like the Chopin"
"Peterson, etc, including the more extreme, alt-rt mouthpieces, are just the reaction to an increasing rejection of capitalism: The establishment financing people willing to mobilize others to oppose those who oppose the system. They are the modern equivalent of the Pinkertons, strike-breakers, and baton-wielding police of the 1930's. (Or the Freikorps in Germany). It's a good sign, actually: It means they're scared."
"Really interesting video. However you seem to have one thing wrong, and correct me if I'm wrong about this. JP isn't advocating for people not to have right, he's saying maybe we should have a discussion about what those rights are, do they affect other people's rights, and maybe we should ask if these rights fundamentally change the way our society works. For example at 7:05 you say we only tell people what not to do, instead of what you should do. Then in the next line you say that the new bill c-16 is going to tell people that they have to say a trans person's pronouns. You then compare this to JP giving advice. The difference is you can ignore JP, but you can't ignore the law once its enforced. Anyway other than that good video. I've been getting sidetracked down one side of these debates, and might start watching your videos to see the counter p.....counter......contra points.......I see what you did there."
"I bought two copies of 12 rules when my brother started sharing about Peterson - it seemed like something we each could benefit from. We each only got through about 8 rules before neither of us could deal with how much he liked the smell of his own shit. I wish I could still get a refund."
"I have some niggles. 1. Identity Politics. The definition of identity politics I'm most familiar has nothing to do with promoting equality itself. In fact, the idea is that identity politics is in stark contrast to pursuits of equality, because identity politics focuses on the conflict between their identitarian group and other groupings of people. In this way, the classical SJW is just as focused on identity politics as the classical neo-nazi.  Based on what I've seen of Jordan Peterson, this is the definition of identity politics he is using. And also it's a fairly common interpretation of the term. 2. The lobster thing. Your interpretation of his point is interesting. He explains it so clearly. It's not that lobsters have this hierarchy, therefore all hierarchies are good. The whole point is that hierarchy's can come into being without some racist/sexist agenda. The whole point is that hierarchies are often established naturally. It seems you're putting words in his mouth when you say that he is 'justifying' the hierarchy. He isn't saying anything of why it's good or bad. The whole argument is how and why it exists, not if it should. I feel fairly confident in this interpretation because he specifically refers to the leftist idea of how and why it exists. He specifically refutes the idea that his argument is that we should 'organize our society like the lobsters,' which kinda implies he doesn't think it's the best way to organize a society... doesn't it? 3. Corporate HR isn't Postmodern Neo-Marxist. Obviously. But the argument seems to be that they are becoming more influenced by people who ascribe to that sort of ideology. A corporation being anti-capitalist is absurd, but the same can't be said for politicians, workers, and consumers that the corporation has some incentive to please. Many corporations are good at remaining apolitical, many aren't. Every corporation has workers and clients to please, though.   I have another one, that being that it's very clear he doesn't think trans rights equals Marxism. His complaint about that trans rights bill was very specific. It's all about the compelled speech. Being legally obligated to use certain words. He has never complained about any other part of that bill that I'm aware of. This is a more minor thing as it was mentioned in brief.  But then I also have one major problem. That being that Postmodernism and Marxism don't agree, therefore Postmodern neo-Marxism can't exist. It makes sense. But the term isn't Postmodern Marxism, is it? It's Postmodern NEO-Marxism. Neo-Marxist ideology incorporates philosophies that are better at playing nice with Postmodernism, though Neo-Marxism isn't necessarily Postmodernist. If it was 'Postmodernist Neo-Marxism' would be a tautology. Anyway, Postmodern Neo-Marxism isn't the oxymoron that Postmodern Marxism is."
"Great video. But as someone who watches a fair bit of Peterson, it's important to note that Peterson has repeatedly acknowledged the logical incoherence of postmodern neomarxism. It's part of his diagnosis of the anti western attack on the logos."

"I feel like if people used less 'floaty' language like this video points out there would be a lot fewer political arguments."
"Thank you so much!I was lookin for a video taking apart this 'marxist-postmodernist-SJW' BS. Those three ideologies are so far removed from each other that they literally deny the grounds upon which the ideology of the other stands. The Alt-right ideology is, depending on the part of the alt right, either closer to marxism or SJWs than they are to most other ideologies."

"i feel like ive stepped into a fever dream and i cant stop screamig! subscribed!"
"Modern post modernism is basically the thesis that nothing is true and nothing is real, thus Marxism. Peterson's thesis is that post modernists are generally full of shit. The best criticism of Peterson is that his thesis is too obvious.  PS: Marxism is idiotic outdated nonsense. It's the astrology of economics. Thanks for helping to demonstrate that point."
"Damnit. I`ve got a buddy who`s in to Jordan Peterson. Wish I could do something to change his mind."
"Really informative thanks @contrapoints"
"This is high quality content. I am impressed by this channel. I do not remember how i found the channel, but i wish i would've found it sooner."
"Your videos are so aesthetically pleasing."
"JP just sounds so angry. Why is he angry though? Is he underpaid? unemployed? homeless? NOPE he's angry because someone asked him to use a different pronoun. If that's not a triggered snowflake I don't know what is!"
"'So much for the tolerant Jacobins' might be the funniest joke of all time."

"Additionally, I've heard from more than one person in the SJW camp that 'The Enlightenment is obsolete.' which is an utterance I find deeply terrifying, especially as they've not come up with anything to replace it other than 'Do what I say.'. Yeah, a bunch of European white guys (for the most part, there was a European woman here and there) came up with it. That doesn't mean it's bad."
"Your characterization of leftists who can't stop squabbling with each other is accurate. But your statement that there is no unifying force flies against my experience of the Internet in the past couple of years. Our current media, for example, typically reports stories from a fairly unified slant. Practically every media outlet of note has written articles about Jordan Peterson that wildly mischaracterize one idea or another of his in an extremely negative fashion. Variants of the Cathy Newman interview have been repeated over and over again.  There has to be a reason this is happening. And it happens to other people who make it into the public light with an idea someone has decided is bad. One of the biggest reasons I've disconnected myself from that side of things is because I can't trust what gets said anymore. There is so much disinformation, and it's spread so wildly.  One of the reasons I've begun watching your videos is that you're one of the very few people who respond at least semi-intelligently (often very intelligently) to things people I generally agree with say. Hardly anybody else does that, and instead walls them off into some little corner where it's justified to possibly physically assault them, or at least make sure they're never heard at a public event. Basically, to treat them like they were Richard Spencer (though, in fact, they don't treat Richard Spencer that way most of the time and instead protest outside his events en masse, which seems like an excellent response to me)."
"Lovely. Thanks for this."

The most successful species in evolution also use mutual aid, read Kropotkins Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution. Also when I read Anarchist philosophers, I genuinely feel it's the most positive philosophy I've ever read. I wish you would touch up a bit up on the them as well as the other side will purposely leave them totally out of the discussion as usual throughout history."
"I'm confused where am I"
"Art thou bi"
"I haven't watched the video yet, but you've taken Dr. Peterson out of context, straw-manned him and failed to comprehend his brilliance."
"A highly intellectual argument packaged using lighthearted theatrics... I think you should get your professorship in the arts for this video"
"It is amusing to see people fight over control of things that are beyond anyone's control. You fight as if winning an argument could actually determine human nature. You fight as if you were gods with the winner getting to decide 'and this is how things are going to be'. You fight over who gets the change the world as if you can change reality. Part of the problem is that you confuse society with reality."
"I have a hard time taking Christian intellectuals seriously. I’m aware this is just a reaction to my religious upbringing, but ugh... Jordan Peterson makes my toes curl. Not in a sexy way."
"you talked about terfs, now it would be cool if you talked about regs"
"Okay, I'm fully prepared for anyone to call me a 'JP drone' or whatever the fuck, but this video strawman's him left right and center.  I don't feel like writing a massive YouTube comment nitpicking every 30 seconds of the video, but saying shit like 'JP tells you how to raise your kids' by citing a chapter where he literally tells parents to stop their 4 year olds go ape shit in public airports is a complete mischaracterization of him.  Also, he doesn't criticize ''''the left''''.  He criticizes leftists and radical liberals, which is not the 'entire left'.  This isn't some kind of little known fact, either.  He was on the Rubin report the other day with Eric Weinstein.  He also makes it very clear that he considers SJW's to be a vocal minority.  If you think JP is this far off the mark when it comes to the danger of SJW's in our society, I'd be happy to invite you onto my campus at Trent University in Canada where I am taught that 'categorization is a tool of institutional male power' in a language philosophy class."
"Wtf is this. It's so good"
"Contrapoints highlight with accuracy where Peterson got it wrong in relation to neo-marxism and postmodernism, but Contrapoints got it wrong with accuracy in missing to highlight where Peterson got it right in relation to the shared heritage between a kind of postmodernism and a kind of neo-marxism.

"I have a personal beef with Mr. Peterson based on where I grew up.   I'm a privileged white guy who grew up in small (and very white) town Alberta. I wasn't the subject of prejudice, but the specter of it always haunts small town Alberta. You can always kind of just feel it.   The thing is, the really hideous vampires that feed on the atmosphere of prejudice are given their supply of food by people like Peterson, intentionally or not. Guys out in fucking Toronto or Ottawa that have media access/political access & live the life of the super rich, well away from the problems they create in the prairies. Every time Peterson has had to come face to face with one of the white supremacists he's mobilized & inspired, he just laughs awkwardly and moves on from the encounter. He has the luxury of doing that and exercises that luxury, leaving lower class folks to deal with the mobilized vampires while he warms his ass with the proceeds of selling them motivational books back home in a secluded mansion.   Of course, it isn't just Peterson doing this - there's a long chain of Tory politicians & talking heads that all do the same (go fuck yourself, Rex Murphy). These people wouldn't spend a single extra minute preaching their garbage if they actually had to live where the vampires roam & take their families out for dinner / entertainment in those same places. But they don't have to, so ha ha ha, 'Jewish question', lol. Let's take a more serious engagement and move on so I can make my chartered flight back home."

"The first of your videos I've seen, no doubt popping up in my feed due to the Jordan Peterson connection and I've got such a crush on you already! It's so good to see and hear Peterson critically and intelligently addressed with such wonderful humour. I can't resist watching more of your videos now. Thankyou."
"I like a lot of ideas which Peterson speaks about, but I also loved this video. The certainty with which Peterson speaks of some things (usually concerning politics) is often disconcerting (thought I suspect he does so with good intentions), so it was great to see you explain another point of view here. Your calm explanations feel to me like just the kind of thing needed to depolarize our society right now. Earned my subscription today :)"

"I normally refrain from commenting on videos, but as a Jordan Peterson fan, a leftist in terms of political views, and someone who is deeply interested in both philosophy and psychology, let me just say... that. Was. Incredibly. Well. Done. Probably the best video-essay I’ve seen, eloquent, and nothing short of empowering for people on both sides of the fence when it comes to these subjects. Tricky to pull off so incredibly well. AWESOME WORK! NEW FAN!"

"'I need new roommates'  Wait, is this new? Did we know that everyone in the ContraPoints universe are roommates? What are the lore implications of this?"
"Cool vid. First one that explains cracks in Peterson's philosophies. It's really nice to know that the 'radical' left are at each others throats, trying to perfect the 'language'... 'How can there be 'feminism' if females are a social construct'... Duh. So straight forward, yet somehow missed consistently. Well done."
"It's great to see a non 'woke' politics junkie on Youtube who supports the left and isn't steeping in unbearable ad hominem cliches. Even though I love JBP this video and its content were great.  It's also nice to see someone who disagrees with the standard shit who also has a decent sense of humour."

"Great video overall, but that beginning was seriously extra cool.Of course, I'm a huge fan of the 81th century deviants."
"As a fan of Peterson, whatever that means, I really appreciate this video. I subscribed several years ago but this is the first video I’ve watched in the last couple of them, and I’m glad I did. Conversations are always chronologically reactive to what was said before, so their argumentational and rhetorical emphasis is always bound to a context that becomes opaque after a while, especially in an atemporal platform such as the internet. Finding truth through conversation is thus always a game of slightly confused intellectual tennis in a multidimensional field, so it’s good to see good players with varying views on that field."

If you are ever around Asheville find me... I like coffee...teehee. THANK YOU!"
"I seems to me that Peterson is talking about people using the toolsets derived from postmodernism and Marxism to advance political agendas and that he uses 'Post Modern Neo Marxism' as a way to talk about popular movements that use these tools to promote group identity, and collectivist movements.    A lecture on the classical definition of these terms seems misplaced in response.   Peterson is talking about what methods people are using to gain power over people,  and where these methods come from and how they are supported.

"I'm running light on sleep today so if it pleases your grace I'll harvest a comment I made on Reddit when I had a full 8 hours and a cup of coffee under my belt to reply.  'I'm a psychology major and frankly I'm mortified that Dr.Peterson is currently the most prominent face of Psych.  It is ingrained in us in class that we are not to judge others ways of life but to help them improve over all quality of life, whatever that means to them, so long as they are happy and healthy. Treatment and diagnosis can sometimes be unorthodox but what's important are the results. Dr.Peterson lays his biases bare in nearly all his public appearances and that is antithetical to the field.  Any points we might actually agree upon are lost in the landslide of regurgitated rhetoric, pejoratives and cognitive dissonance.' I should add, that they appear bare to me at least, but then again I fancy my self good at seeing the thoughts behind actions, in my arrogance.  I agree with you, it is in fact quite difficult to have a dialog on an issue with some members of the left due to ideas taken to an absolute. I've lost friends and acquaintances in the last couple years due to rebuffing demands to hate someone 'middle of the road' when my core tells me that those are the people best to engage openly in an issue in hopes of winning them over.  Though you have expressed a somewhat neutral stance on this issue, I still appreciate your willingness to engage and discuss it in order to help us gain better understanding, however I'm left with one question that still plagues me...can I get those nails in like a kit or do I have to buy them separately..?"
"Definitive proof that PostModernism / Cultural marxism is meaningless shit? *The Sokal Affair* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair"
"No when Peterson talks about lobsters it’s in response to when he hears we want equality of OUTCOME. However Peterson has REPEATEDLY said he wants equal OPPORTUNITY. Peterson says hierarchies are inherent in nature however it also creates a lot of suffering for the plants, animals, and people who don’t come out on top. We should find ways to empower people to reach their full potential, to try to make things more fair. So no his comments could never be used to support monarchy unless you misquoted him. An example would be Peterson would say women earn less because women undervalue themselves more than men, which has a lot to do with how women have. Peterson coaches women on how to properly demand more pay and has high success rates of accelerating women in their careers. Now when he talks about lobsters it is in response to the comment we want equality of OUTCOME. his position is, to have everyone across the board performing at the same capacity we would have to go against nature and a millennia of evolution itself. The system put in place to achieve equality of OUTCOME would have to be a perfect dictatorship. This supposition might be wrong but the left has so far proven him right. Currently there are proposals to tax people based on privilege to redistribute to POc, disabled, lgbtq, etc... also the bbc docked a mans pay simply because a fellow female journalist complained he was paid more despite the fact he worked double her hours. To prove Peterson wrong on this point you would have to prove how equality of OUTCOME is better than OPPORTUNITY and could be achieved humanly."
"U talk about the idea of neopomomarxism not making sense because grand narrative + marxism don't mix, but it's not as though Peterson hasn't brought this up countless times. Have also seen your commentary on Camille Paglia, and it was really disingenuous. You clearly didn't go into too much detail other than burping in front of her to your audience who doesn't really know better and probably won't take the effort to go look. I don't know if you are avoiding Paglia on purpose, because if you weren't you would have seen Petersons interview with Paglia where they both spoke about the grand narrative + marxism not linking at length.  You also talk about this all as being a 'localised problem', well, it doesn't seem very localised to me when I read about these ideas going into the education system in Primary and Secondary schools, like they have in Australia with the 'Safe Schools Program', which I've gone through the teaching manuals for myself and read how much faulty research they cite in. It wouldn't be so easy to cry about how postmodernists are acting like marxists when so many of them LITERALLY say they are Marxists, like the founder of that Safe Schools Program in Australia. Also like my crazy flatmates in my Safe Space student housing who have a vendetta against me for listening to Blaire White Videos and invite batshit Feminists over who threaten to punch me in the face.  Doll, u do fucking cute ass-vids and I think you are really intelligent, but you are using that intelligence as an easy-ride and it isn't fair of you to fuel the moral panic against conservatives, libertarians, and 'anyone to the Right of Ellen Degeneres', when it feels like you aren't doing the work."

"Me watching bunch of these criticisms of JP is messing up my youtube feed. Because youtube understands that I am interested in JP but cannot understand in which ways. So after watching Natalie's video and Peter's and many more, youtube is recommending me videos with titles like 'Prof JP owns this person, Prof JP destroys that person, Feminism cancelled All hail JP...' Does anybody know how to get rid of those honestly skdksl I am tired of clicking 'not interested' every time."
"This would be a lot more criticized if the genders were reversed in the whole ContraXPeterson scene.  Contra clearly hasn't lost the self deprecating edge from the oldest videos. Just less of it, and changed the subject. This is probably a good thing."
"With regards to Hume being racist--so what? No, I'm not white, nor am I an apologist for racism. With the constant 'callout' of racism of nearly anyone of consequence, I'm starting to feel racism is the status quo, and my former outrage has been severely diminished."
"Peterson:  'here is this thing in the world that seems to be a reality (heirarchy). Maybe we should pay attention and not pretend it doesn't exist' progressive ideologue:  'but what is Peterson SAYING??? Its all so vague and 'word salady'.

"To be honest, Peterson's 12 rules are a bit of a disappointment. Only one of them is insightful (don't let your children ...) a couple are just flippant (pet a cat). You can get more wisdom from Dale Carnegie, Tom Peters, Peter Drucker or the myriads that followed them."
"To my mind, Peterson is a chauvinistic opportunistic capitalist who is riding on the anti-sjw bandwagon framing himself as some free speech martyr. Yeah, that's a mouthful, but that's Peterson; a mouthful. A talking head who misconstrues postmodernism (and Bill C-17). I love you contra, you're my hero."

"Loved this video, have sort of been morbidly curious abt JP for a while as well and I think I have similar problems regarding him as you do. For sure his whole post-modern neo-marxist thing is a bit sketch. That being said:  You mentioned at one point that JP was against trans people expressing their pronouns and that anyone pro free speech should find that problematic. I don't think this was an accurate representation of his stance, he's said multiple times he'd be more than willing to call people by their pronouns, but thought that signing it into law (as well as unconscious bias training which is v problematic from a psych standpoint), which Canada and California had done, turned a choice into required speech punishable by law. These aren't the same at all, and it's entirely possible to advocate for trans rights and respect pronouns without punishing people by law for refusing to do so, I think that's what his totalitarian bent was, i.e. signing compelled speech into law and using an unconscious bias detection scheme with dubious psychological merit to punish people for a hate crime they weren't even conscious of committing and thus unable to disprove. I think you framed this as protecting trans rights under Canadian law but the videos where he goes through the law and the very real and immediate effects of its enforcement in campuses has me doubting whether that's an entirely fair framing. The language was pretty vague, the punishment for intent was identical to transgression, and there was an underlying presumption of guilt on the offending party (i.e. accidental misgenderings could be classed as unconscious bias which would evoke the same punishment as intentional misgendering). I will certainly agree that this law does protect trans rights, but that it's totally valid to point out the rights of other people being affected and coming to better and tighter wording that protects what it's meant to be protecting and doesn't take away existing rights from anyone not covered by the law. I say this as a genderqueer African albino in Britain so it's not like I have a vested interest in promoting less rights for my trans peeps, not a JP fanboy by any means but whenever I talk to people about him this exact conflation comes up.   Keep it up, you got a new sub!"
"Peterson is a Postmodernist."

"I’m just going to start watching this channel instead of porn now."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1qVLB96nI0         this is JPs actual response to the exact premise that this video is based on, that JP doesn't understand PoMo, and that Contra thinks JP dumb because there is a contradiction between PoMo and Marxism, but JP often refers to PoMo Marxists.  This is a perfect response, and shows how fucking determined to misrepresent JP Contra truly is."

"The shot of Freud at 13:30 labelled “Daddy” had me in tears.  I love Jordan Peterson, but god damn you make great videos."
"Go to 9:56 and following. Insightful, clear, and critical."
"The flippancy with which you present this material gives me the impression that you are biased against Jordan Peterson. However the argument or the ultimate point is NOT that Jordan Peterson is correct or incorrect. It is the fact that Peterson, has attempted to present a logical argument based on empirical evidence. This is NOT something that Western Society can handle because of the deliberate conditioning of the populace. Read these  2 works: Propaganda by Edward Bernays and the Bible: especially John chapter 8 and Revelation chapter 12. We as a society have been so degraded and taken over by corporo fascist systems in the West that we are not able to think for ourselves rationally and resist the pull of SOCIAL TRUTH engineered by the social manipulators. Another work to read is the book Not In His Image by John Lamb Lash, especially regarding archontic control. At the present point you are largely creating what is known in intelligence circles as a LIMITED HANGOUT. AS IS JORDAN PETERSON. The difference is the Peterson is educating people NOT ABOUT GENDER PRONOUNS, but about the MECHANICS OF SOCIAL CONTROL. Remember, Government is Latin for CONTROL THE MIND."
"You make me sexually confused. No confused about my sexuality, more like what IS sex even? Is speaking Mandarin to Thomas Jefferson involved?"

"20mins in before you finally start talking about JP and the first thing you say is that you don't really know what he's trying to say. *Slow Clap"
"this is terrible and really unfortunate. You seem like you have a good sense of humor, though very sex based, but you don't have much of a clue of what you are talking about."
"yeah this is totally normal and doesn't look like a weird paraphiliac fetish that has to be dragged into everything, welp I'm sold on Peterson being full of shite now"
"I learned a lot here, thank you"
"I've basically spent most of today discovering this channel and I love it. In fact, I got so involved, I just realized now that I somehow forgot to subscribe like 5 videos ago. I really think you're doing something with this channel that's worthwhile, looking at ideas and positions that are in stark contrast with earnest analysis, and having discussions with people who diverge from your worldview - insofar as it seems in some sense fruitful, or allowing that they approach discourse in good faith . I think you do a pretty great job of critiquing ideas you disagree with while trying not to mischaracterize their position, and of choosing the difficult and interesting questions to tackle, not just the easy crappy arguments. Intellectually stimulating, funny, entertaining, and very human. Plus this is now absolutely my favorite critical video critiquing Peterson on Youtube to date. Thanks Natalie. :)"
"How can you act like you understand both sides when it's obvious you have no respect for Modernist philosophy? You don't have to believe it's right, and post-modernism is great too, but it makes it seem you really aren't familiar enough with the ideas to say anything important about them.  Peterson's lobster example is a response to the charge that unjust hierarchies are the result of Western culture, when many such hierarchies predate Western culture. He doesn't say they're necessarily justified. Just that there is a big unconscious psychological component involved. He even advocates working against some of these hierarchies.  I think people listen to his ideas for the same reason that they listen to other boring, white people like David Foster Wallace. Post-modernism and ironism exist to tear down meaning. So people mostly just act sarcastic and pretend nothing matters. Which is basically your whole schtick, so I can see why you'd take offense. And it's even good up to a point. But a lot of young people are starving for someone to tell them that yes, life does have meaning, and it's not all just pointless bullshit."
"Thank you for finally pointing out that his mishmash of words is just gobbeldygook bullshit that he made up to make anything he disagrees with sound scary."
"'Who shall be YouTube-skeptical of the YouTube skeptics?'"
"Some Mary from Reddit linked to this as proof that JP is somehow a sexist. How am I not surprised at this bullshit. This - folks - is what the Left does with their abundance of spare time. Of course, when they take out student loan after student loan to pay for their Gender Studies degree that is seven years in the making (with no intention, nor means, to pay them back), they have all the time in the world to showcase their arrested development."
"The irony is that the Frankfurt school was anti post modernism."
"The coup de grace:  'Marxism IS Western Philosophy.  Postmodernism IS Western Philosophy.  If you're really concerned about preserving the geographical boundaries of the intellectual tradition, you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.  Likewise, there is no feature of 'SJW ideology' that is meaningfully non-Western.  The very idea of people requesting individual pronouns to suit their individual needs is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty over collective dogma should be on board with.  You could even argue that Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy, with its concern for human progress, science, and liberty.  I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Petersen talk about the Western Tradition, but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.'"

"The fake female voice is so annoying to listen to."
"You describe postmodern feminists but don't carry that same logic when considering postmodern neo-Marxists. The collection of people under 'postmodern neo-Marxists' are using the battling groups idea in Marxism but choosing different oppressed/oppressor categories of which there are a potentially infinite number (just look at what some say about gender alone), all geared towards the destruction of Western civilisation, be it ant-science, anti-meritocracy, anti-capitalism, anti-speech etc.  The postmodernism 'no grand narratives' belief is utterly satisfied by this splintering infinitely, both conceptually (since nothing binds everyone together once you've positioned them all against one another) and by real world practice (if 'the West' can fall then there is no other narrative that can justify itself, a proof by induction).  The goal, effect and method can be described quite happily by a combination of postmodernism and neo-Marxism (much like you noticed the way postmodern feminism works).  This is not to say everyone is aware of what they are doing, ironically they are participating in a grand narrative themselves. In the same way most of us were unaware we were participating in funding the Ethiopian Spice Girls, until we were told (we were just paying taxes and believing the foreign aid budget was doing only good things).  We disagree but you make fantastic videos with a great deal of effort and humour."

"Sigh. Kermit Peterson fans. I had a big-arse row with some of them on Facebook (where else) the other day. There's a weird kind of psychological profile for JP fanboys - simultaneously holding on to a 'just world' view which leftists have come to upset and complicate with their class discourse and climate change and feminism ya-da- da-da (how dare they) combined with a sense that they're taking part in a great Darwinian struggle from which they will emerge as victorious lobsters...and- f- everyone....else. I like Peterson's point about petting cats though."
"Lucky JP, is all i got to say"
"It's dishonest of you to glide over the controversy that made Peterson famous. What you describe as a protection for transgender people was actually a legal enforcement of prefered pronoun usage, including extremely linguistically uncommon ones.    Not using xe, ze, , etc should not be equivacated to promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred you doublespeaking scumbag. The government shouldn't be able to criminally prosecute an individual for not walking the flavor of the weeks line."
"What's the lovely ambient music around 21:30??"
"but natalie, aren’t identity politics postmodern in the way that their sort of politics rely on the deconstruction of positive myths - the morality of america, for example? the trope that america was based off slavery and genocide is a deconstruction of the positive, forward looking orientation of progress?"
"R u a trans sexual. And if so what pronoun am i legally obligated to address you by"
"22:30. What you are describing, or rather what Peterson is doing is called an Appeal to Nature, or at least thats the result of it. Hierarchies are natural because they are found in lobsters. Thats just the way nature is, so thats what we have to do. Nevermind the fact that its a fallacy, but even a passing understanding of evolution would tell you that each species structures itself differently (and wed be better off comparing ourselves to say, chimps or bonobo (but probably not them) than lobsters)"
"Where can i get the last song!??"
"Wow, boiling the lobster lover. I get an education and hear a good  lobster song  tnx for that!"
"This channel is fuckin wild man. Totally wild."
"Hey, a peterson critique that doesn't strawman him into a alt-right white nationalist misogynist. I even agree with it, as quite the peterson fan.   Peterson is right in drawing a similarity between identity politics and Marxism, but when he starts talking post-modern neo-marxism you can hear the tone-shift to mindless rhetoric, and he should just be tuned out."
"Hmmm. Peterson with 1.2 million subscribers. Lol"
"At first his nonsense was ttractive but He’s gone to far for me"
"Excellent work. Have a subscribe."
"I disagree with almost everything you've said, but I respect that you're someone who sees the power in talking to people. This is where the right has filled in the void that the left so carelessly created. Your points are not purely emotional, but have a lot of rationality to back them up which I like. Some people like the fight, but I don't and I hope that the left gets more people like you! Subbed! :-) <3"
"Just fucking brilliant comradx! The Sam seder/Chapo traphouse critiques are entertaining, but satisfying to a very limited audience; white Cishet liberal men. Very measured tones in your flamboyance, such a classy lady."
"WTF, THIS TRAP IS BASED."

"I keep getting Jordy's prageru ads on this hardcore leftist podcast I listen to and it's kind of hilarious but also sad."
"Marx to PoMo a Slippery Slope? The evolution/slippery slope from Marxism to PoMo is not an evolution, it is a shared ecological niche. A vulture will flourish in a region with lots of at a dead rabbits and will also thrive in a region with lots of dead wildebeest. (Morbid analogy intended) That doesn’t mean that there is necessarily any connection between rabbits and wildebeest. The same people who would have been Marxist Wobblies and Students for a Democratic Society members are now identifying with Post Modernism because that is the socio/ecological niche that will allow their disgusting arrogant  authoritarianism to flourish. (Oh, did I sound judgmental? Sorry)  The same arrogant, know-it-all-do-gooders who marched with the Wobblies in Chicago’s Wicker Park, and ran with the SDS in Days of Rage and shouted disruptive Saul Alinsky-isms at rallies in Lincoln Park are now mind numbing bureaucrats at Wilfred Laurier University and other soulless quasi-state institutions. They never had a paper route or Lemonade stand as a kid (Darn, they are illegal for kids today, too bad.)  They never had sex with anyone who did not march with them, in fact that was the main reason for attending public leftist functions and probably still is.  That’s what I hear Jordan Peterson saying when he says Marxists have “become” Post-Modernists.  My bona fides: 72 year old white male urban entrepreneur, reasonably successful and may be able to retire soon. Tried to vote for Eugene McCarthy as a write-in in 1968 but was thwarted by Chicago’s corrupt First Ward politics. Didn’t vote again for about 40 years because I took heed of Samuel Clemen’s advice, “Don’t vote, it just encourages them.” For a quarter century I experiienced a vision of two Americas. I lived in a Chicago home, walking distance from some of the worst public housing project in US history and spent half my time trying to grow organic echinacea root in rural Indiana. My Chicago neighbors marched and chanted, “Unfair, give us something”. My Indiana neighbors never marched but they talked amongst themselves, “Unfair, we aren't getting anything.”  The urban poor said the educated elite treated them with condescension and the “soft prejudice of low expectations'. The rural poor said the educated elite hated, mocked, and reviled them.  I was shocked but not surprised that Trump won.  I might still be a liberal if more of them were as delightful and thoughtful as ContraPoints. Most if the Liberals I know are as strident as the Conservatives are boring."

"1:28 A strawman right of the bat... why?"
"Ha, ha, she confirms Petersons critique of postmodernism - its all about power. The entire message is an expression of power and dominance. Of course she is denying that the unconcious exists. This is the postmodern message: deny your inner feelings and put all blames on the world around you. Thats the easy comfortable way. She also just cutting parts of Peterson in order to confirm her ideas. Jordan B. Peterson have of course problems with his image, but he has a lot of insights that are important to understand. By the way; He does not say that we should rule the world in hierarchies like lobster - he says that human societies (and even transgender groups) tends to organize themselves in hierarchies. He is trying to understand how societies work, and even if he sometimes goes to far in his conclusions - this is knowledge and not just bombardment of feelings like in this video."
"You are crazy."
"You're clearly highly intelligent (and entertaining) but we're 8 minutes in now and you still haven't made a concrete point..."
"I've watched 20 major hit pieces against Peterson, and this was the best."
"as an avid supporter of JBP I have to give credit where credit is due. you avoided the poisioning the well nonsence of 'hitler didn't like commies either!' and actually made  some reaonable critiques. while you may not have convinced me, I have a lot of respect for that."
"okay, I watch this like, every month or so and there are lines that get me EVERY TIME the 'mmhmmm' in reply to 'is this all womanhood is to you?' the 'Sargon! You little goose'"
"Wait. Why is Dave Rubin a goon? The gay, progressive who isn't afraid to talk to conservatives? You can make fun of Ben Shapiro,  he talks funny, but Dave Rubin is actually objective, and kind of cute. He's like Anderson Cooper, but without that 'I'm a serious journalist, but sometimes I wish I could be a tv talk show guy and do hard-hitting exposes on the international conspiracy to replace politicians with alien cyborgs....but not that UFO kind of sh*t, the real alien cyborg stuff.' Oh wait. That's Alex Jones....nevermind."
"6:37 It doesn't though. He just doesn't want the government to force people to use certain pronouns by law. That's just tyranny.    He also doesn't tell people what to do, if you claim to have read the book you would know that he proposes them as guidelines rather than oppressive rules."
"In the 'up next' list, I have a suggestion for Jordan Peterson talking about 'homosexuals raising children' which has multiple levels of irony given the teenage man-love Peterson engenders."
"You're one ugly girl"
"One of the best videos I watched on YouTube. I'm both intellectually challenged and sexually aroused. Thank you!"
"Could we listen to some Zeppelin some time? How about the Avengers trailer with the Immigrant Song. Nice. Cocktails, also."
"Jordan Peterson is cool. He is, at the very least, a place where a legitimate debate can take place. Try this with alex jones ore some other twat."
"Your understanding of Peterson's arguments is weak and limited to say the least. 'on the left we don't really tell people what to do'. really? Is that why you try to force people to use certain pronouns? Is that why you shame people who don't act according to your agenda? And try to shut the opposers down? And you think Peterson is telling people what to do? He is merely helping people to improve their lives. He is not forcing anything on anyone, people can listen to him or can ignore him. Left does want to throw away existing hierarchy labeling it as unjust. Peterson says that it is the best we've ever had and throwing it away would be bad for everyone. He doesn't say that monarchy is justified because we are used to having hierarchies  for 350 million years. But it was the best hierarchy in middle ages and throwing it away would have caused societies to revert back to tribalism (or back to a new monarchy soon enough). Peterson doesn't defend existing hierarchies, he defend the idea of having hierarchies as a good way to manage societies."
"If only JP could see this😂"
"I'M UNCOMFORTABLE"
"Thank you Contra! This is the best and most coherent dressing down (!) of Peterson and his smuggled Catholicism (?) I've encountered yet. There was a recent TLS reviewer who also hit some decent notes too but in general I have been aghast at the total of failure of left wing pundits or public intellectuals to unpack Peterson. They get caught up in his particular framing of issues and play into his mis characterisation of so many things. Eg. is his lack of knowledge RE Marx or post modernism or his often quite appalling inferences - a rhetorical device he uses all too often. Thank you for your content in general too, i always enjoy hearing and appreciate your perspective. xXx  ps. the interview with cathy newman was on channel 4 not the bbc."
"Got to say I really enjoy a lot of what Peterson offers but can't stand the fanboy absolution and devotion.  Rare for someone to give a thought out balanced argument on youtube, nice!"
"Wow what a dog shit video.   1.  “You aren’t using these terms in their strict original definitions, therefore you are wrong!”  2.  “I can’t figure out what you mean by the harm neomarxists cause even though I list what you mean in the things I like about you”  3.  “Cathy Newman was misunderstood and not being a bottom of the barrel attack journalist”  4.  “I’m going to pretend I’ve never heard of anyone saying societal hierarchies are a societal construct, even though that is the literal definition of patriarchy theory”  Terrible.  Concentrate on the skits people love so much, you are bad at arguments."
"As a fan of Peterson I'd just like to thank you for making what appears to be an honest attempt to understand and present his points even if I may disagree with your interpretation of them. The main position I'd contend with is your attempt to create a working definition of Post-Modern Neo-Marxism suggests he believes both philosophies are working with each other instead of Marxism using Postmodernism as a veneer as explained in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSzpc2vh8Ow  You also conflate his opposition to Bill C-16 as his opposition to people using a trans person's pronouns when in reality it was an opposition to giving the state power to legislate and compel speech. It's important to note that there are legal arguments to be made about what Bill C-16 would do, but for the argument about what Peterson believes then we have to focus on his claimed and stated motivation."
"I was directed to this video after googling 'Please help me, I'm a Jordan Peterson fan.' Thank you, ContraPoints!"
"That is basically Jordan Peterson in a nutshell. He will take already existing terms redefine them in any way that suits him and then make logical constructs with those terms. It is easy to misslead you because the logic behind it could make sense if his new definition of the terms was accurate but when you eventually decipher his own definitions everything falls apart. The example of what is 'the west' according to J.P. and to the rest of the world or how the term post-modern marxism is used by him in a way that sometimes it basically means marxism and sometimes post-modern philosophy, according to what suits his arguement each time, are illustrative examples."
"You look so good in that historically innacurate 18th century abomination that I could cry such happy tears"
"*smashes 'SUBSCRIBE' so hard my screen shatters*"
"I guess the thing the both of you have got in common is that you have rather strange voices. I'm sure the two of you could start a conversation over this and see whether that eventually takes you into that bathroom situation."
"Z A N Y G O O N S"
"What are you"
"This is the first ContraPoints video I have watched. I had heard about this channel on the Michael Brooks show first as I recall, then seen it recommended in a comment in another video and looked into it. So glad I did! You are sooooo funny and informative at the same time!"
"Brilliant and entertaining as usual.  When I first heard Peterson speak it was on the Waking Up podcast and I pictured a dorky old Canadian probably in Dockers and New Balance trainers.  I thought this guy really has his knickers in a bunch over a few bratty college kids.  When I started to figure out that he's actually popular and right about a few things I gave him a second listen.  He's being coy.  His assertions about the left are straw men when applied to the majority.  He's also smart enough to know that. I think."
"I think the issue with Peterson is that he demands that we look only at his finger when it seems like he's pointing at stuff. Maybe he isn't actually pointing at things, but he should address why he constantly looks like pointing at things."
"CP brings up some interesting thoughts, but manage to misunderstand crucial aspects of JP philosophy. JP has explained that since you can't build a workable worldview from postmodernism (you need value hierarchy to do that, which postmodernism doesn't offer). Therefore the postmodern guys accepted the marxist ideology as an underpinning structure of thought to their body of idéas, because they need something to ground themselves in. JP states quite clearly that postmodernism and marxism is logically impossible to blend together, which CP also recognises in the video.  However, logic take a backseat to the power games that these postmodern neo marxists want to play out, they argue that logic is a oppressive and phallogic aspect of the western society. They only thing that really matters for them are power.  Personally I don't know that to make of JP claims, but we should start with trying to state them as clearly as possible."
"Although I think if some branches of royalty had used lobster symbolism in their attire that would have been pretty cool."
"Never have seen your stuff before but I'm really glad you did this when you adressed flaws with Peterson's arguments that I haven't take the time to adress myself.  I guess the right wing push back is towards specifically identity politics because it creates a group structure where your supposed to combat other groups.   For example I'm a white male and your a white trans female (I think it's transition to) rather than me coming up to speak with you about why are you trans in identity politics terms I should try my best to undermine you because I'm not apart of your group.  I see Dr. Peterson trying to fight against that idea where groups can only fight and can't be reasoned with.   Im not saying you subscribe to that kind of philosophy. By your actions in making this video not a hit peice demonstrates that your will to listen understand and converse with opposing view points and I wish there were more people like that.  Thank you"
"finally seem to have found a leftist youtuber who really intellectually stimulates me personally. gonna watch more of your shit."
"Why do i think Natalie already owned that Eighteenth Century aristocrat outfit in her closet and didn't buy it exclusively for the video?"
"Okay, here’s my problem with criticisms of the real and imagined excesses of college campuses—I’m not saying they’re fabricated, but they seem to me like an absolutely minuscule problem that’s aggressively cherry-picked in order to use as a scapegoat and foment outrage in order to push various political agendas.  That kind of demonization is alarming to many people because it’s got “Mein Kampf”-like undertones, i.e. blaming a disproportionate share of society’s problems on a relatively innocuous group and using that hatred to fuel irrationality.  I’d be much happier if people would stop using lazy stereotypes and generalizations of “college campus behavior” and just look at actual individual problems and events in their proper context, and judge those things in isolation."
"Quite articulate and seeded with some light-hearted bits. It's great to see another perspective! I think many of us are trying to figure this stuff out and it's important that we can talk about it without hating each other. A little bit of intellectual humility goes a long way and it's been valuable to hear your thoughts!"
"This seems to be an honest attempt at criticism instead on the pure slander published in the press, so serious kudos for not being a hack. However, your analysis and subsequent criticism of Peterson is shallow.   Peterson has talked extensively on the nonsensical alliance between post-modernism and neo-marxism. He's called it (paraphrasing here) the strangest alliance he's ever seen. You see this alliance all over western campuses. Watch some of the videos where they disrupt speakers; you can legitimately see gender activists advocating for rejection of biological sex alongside people with Soviet hammer and sickle flags.   He's not Justifying the validity of hierarchies or 'Western Patriarchy' with his lobster example. If you read his book (which I suspect you haven't) you would know that he's pointing out that hierarchies have existed for millions of years, and they're not 'socially constructed.' Therefore, if we wish to operate properly in the world, we shouldn't immediately dismiss them as oppressive power structures.   His criticisms of post-modernism are centered specifically around Foucault and Derrida. Peterson thinks that Foucault's fundamental premise in philosophy is that hierarchal structures themselves are solely based on power and exclusion, and so anyone who participates in these hierarchies are oppressive tyrants. Therefore, utopia requires the eradication of 'oppressive' hierarchies.   There's plenty more here. But those are the important bits."
"Thank you so much for being intelligent and thoughtful!"
"Very interesting analysis. However, Natalie misconstrued a point about Peterson's attitude towards preferred pronouns. He is not against preferred pronouns as such, even expressing on video the willingness to use them depending on individual circumstances, and if it was something that organically evolved into the language such as the term 'Ms' did. But he is very much against the idea of them being **instantiated into law**,  i.e. COMPELLED  speech, something that has never been a part of the West's tradition of common law. It is the idea of having the the choice of words to express one's thoughts LEGALLY regulated, (which in broken in Ontario can carry some hefty penalties) that raised his ire. He nearly lost his job with University of Toronto, plus his license to practice psychology, but was quite ready to be jailed over the issue. The debate at the time is fascinating.  https//youtu.be/JDvj6DQd93o"
"OH LOOK ITS A YOUTH WHO ISN'T SUPPORTING THIS BOI"
"Contra's quid about Derrida gave me life tbh"
"Great video. Fundamentally wrong. But great in quality of production and effort in engaging ideas rather than ad hominem. New super conservative subscriber.  There is a really great critique of Jordan Peterson that argues he's a Post Modernist. Worth reading it's on Daily Caller."
"I gotta say, I appreciate you actually addressing Peterson's philosophy and politics instead of attacking his character or labeling him as a hateful person. Your analysis is particularly enlightening and I love the mood lighting! Cheers!"
"oh damn! that ending, after the credits, was scary n good. ('totally disagree with everything this person says'. ??? puleeze!) 'Hello Dave...' Ha! Fabulous work, Contrapy!! You just keep getting better. Make me wish a was a young man"
"'We don't tell people what to do. We tell people what NOT to do.'  Dude that sounds EXACTLY like you're telling people what to do."
"The more I read/watch Jordan Peterson, the more I'm convinced he's using these contradictory terms simply to pander to the audience that has latched onto him. It's the old showbiz adage, 'Give them what they want.' Not that this in ANY way justifies it. I just think he's a cynical Mountebank."
"By the far the absolute best critique of Jordan Peterson's argument against political correctness ever made public. This commentator actually gets into some of the logical issues that Peterson raises. Outstanding! As a longstanding critic of academic manipulation and supporter of JP's political arguments since starting to watch all of his videos six months ago,  the absolute lack of any intelligent argument from all of the major 'leftist' media outlets from the New York Times to the CBC has done virtually nothing but prove how intellectually lazy and stupid most political discussion has become. They attack the man, but do nothing with the logic, evidence, and underlying concerns. Thank you to this YouTuber for actually responding intelligently to JP's ideas and provoking some THOUGHT. I agree JP could do a better job of making it crystal clear that he supports minority rights and voices, but listening closely, it is clear that he does. He challenges us to be more nuanced and to focus on evidence rather than argument from feeling alone."
"JBP expressly stated that post-modernism is in theory incompatible with Marxism, but says that in practice most Marxists are post-modernists (for various reasons). So this contra-points clip has invalid criticism against Peterson in my opinion"
"If a heirarchy is a just heirarchy based in truth, and competence, and is necessary for the continuing ease of human suffering, the only thing left to do is treat people the way you want to be treated, after, and only after, giving 110% to becoming as aligned with reality as possible."
"The issues though are not really contentions in the left, it's the regressives hijacking the worst ideas from all schools and tooling them to tool all of us into tools for reverse oppression. While JP's utterances are often gibberish and his prescriptive ideas are terrible, the problem he identifies is a real one, even if mislabeled."
"OMG, I am a brocialist who relates with Jordan Peterson fans in hating on identity politics because the regressive left are authoritarian lapdogs of the elites rigging capitalism. Mind fucked."
"Please do not fuck Jordan Peterson  A reminder."
"I think Jordan's concern is very simple. (And some of his opinions are definitely worthy of scrutiny, but they're also worth thinking about.) While he personally does not agree with personal pronouns from a *functional* point of view, the real crux of his argument is that *legislating* them is an affront to free speech, a thinly-veiled power play, and a dangerous precedent. People say, oh it's so easy, just use them, what's the big deal. And he says, well what happens if I don't pay the fine? And nobody has a good answer for that. The radical left thinks that this is an issue of a severity equal to black civil rights, but it isn't. They want too much government intervention into something that is in no way on the same level of severity, both in terms of the number of people it seeks to the protect and the subject in question (personal pronouns).  He does come across as conservative and at times oblique but I think he is trying to say change for the better is good, equality is good, just that change needs to be slow and young students are *not* mentally equipped to understand social problems enough to actually do anything about them. Blackmailing universities to make reckless laws that are *actually* causing harm *right now* is what he has an issue with. I think that ContraPoints downplays that aspect. Jordan never said that the potentially fucked future was the *intention* of any of these school activism and civil rights initiatives, but they could inadvertently destroy civilization by stifling thought, just to avoid angering some very sensitive students. Take an example of designated free speech zones. A school in the US has one that's like 1% of the campus and you need to schedule weeks ahead of time to do things such as pass around copies of the constitution because it could potentially offend someone. This kind of stuff is happening everywhere and growing in frequency.  The reason Jordan uses the term Postmodern Neo-Marxism is because the radical left doesn't understand history, or even thinks that history or reality can be defined in any useful way, while at the same time insisting that each individual's version of reality and history is 'their truth'. It's a contradiction. So ContraPoints is quite apt in pointing that out, it's just that she doesn't seem to realize that that isn't a mistake.  Jordan definitely doesn't want a return to silence and invisibility. What he does want, is for people to grow up, and talk to each other - not look to the school government to protect them from things that they aren't mature enough to deal with on an interpersonal level. And I think he would agree with every reasonable function of school government - to protect students from *physical* violence, by disciplining or removing students who present an actual physical danger to campus, or are so disruptive that educators can't educate. And that last part is, disturbingly, a point of argument with a lot of people. It leads right back to the postmodernism, the skepticism about reality. Because people demand that 'their truth must be respected' and the effect is (literally 'is' - has been - it's happening right now), they can say whatever they want and if they say they can't get an education because of 'verbal violence' then school government under the radical left philosophy bends RIGHT over.  And people say good! Progress for equality! But it's not. Because some people are deemed 'privileged' and have to watch what they say. Everybody is silenced, afraid to be fined, afraid to be kicked out, afraid to lose their tenure, afraid for their reputation.  ContraPoints seems to either be ignorant of what is actually going on or is deliberately whitewashing things. 'Nobody actually said this, nobody actually said that' but it doesn't matter what people say, what matters is what they do, and specifically, what they do to institutions. For example who determines what's an 'unjust hierarchy'? Women are not prevented from reaching positions of power - they *are* in positions of power, in fewer numbers than men to be sure, but women are quite different than man *on the whole. And the number of women in positions of power is increasing steadily - in the context of human history, exponentially! It is not some widespread misogyny fighting to keep them out or if it is it's a bunch of very isolated cases that are dying out naturally because our society is actually progressing *very well* on its own without SJW's trying to eradicate the last ant-sized bastions of bigotry with legislative sledgehammers."
"I really like Peterson's work, but I must admit this has several interesting points, and it is quite funny too!"
"the maquis de sade as divine? i'm sold"
"J.P fan here.  Cracked up several times during the video, I like your humor.    A few things:  Peterson doesn't defend hierarchies. He said some of them are the way they are, because they emerge out of certain behavior (some of it is biological).  He also never  said that they are 'good'. He even says hierarchies can lean towards tyranny, which of course is never good. His point is that the extreme left ON-LY assumes that hierarchies are pyramids of power, in which only the most tyrannical and powerful person will come out at the top and all the weak and unprivileged stack up at the bottom. To me it seems that you both agree on the fact, that not all hierarchies are bad and that some of them are and do need change. The question is how do you change them? He says that we need to change them (sometimes even against our nature), but we must do it in a way so that we do not discriminate against each other in the name of equality. (For instance by forcing female quotas in companies). He acknowledges that it is important that the people at the bottom will be taken care of so they do not become resentful and turn towards destructive ideologies. There are many talks where he says stuff along those lines. He.does.not.say that these hierarchies are good.    Peterson doesn't view the entire left as a super villain. I can see how one can get to that conclusion though. He says the left needs the right and the right needs the left. This is where he always brings up the comparison of ying and yang and that we as people should walk right in between the two. Everyone that is a conservative has the potential of liberal ideas in them and every liberal has the potential of conservative ideas in them. The perfect path is not to step completely over to only one side but to have both your feed on each side and to walk along the two of them, right in the middle, so that you are in balance but at the same time you can always reach out towards potential of each side.   He never said that protecting Transgender people leads to Stalinisim. He said compelled speech does.   He urges young men not to fall into the trap of ideologies, doesn't matter if its the far right or the left.  Thats it I am tired, need sleep.  Good video, thanks for the little dialogue.   ps sorry for my horrible grammar english is not my native language"
"I agree with everything except 'Jordan Peterson is not a fascist'  He most definitely is"
"Good lord.  That was fucking awesome.  Clarity in diva form."
"Will I ever be clean again?"
"Funfact, what drove me out of the left wing activist scene was the increasing notion that all forms of hierarchy should be abolished. Not everyone says that of course, but saying it ain't so doesn't make it go away. ' Also, I'm not entirely sure you understand Peterson's lobster argument. The argument is not 'the lobsters do it and so should we', the argument is 'the dominance hierarchy within a lobster population follows similar rules to those that we can observe in human dominance hierarchies, we should learn from that observation and remember that beneath the thin layer of civilization we are but mere animals.' And strength is not the only variable in lobster dominance hierarchies. So before you go and attack an argument, you might wanna be sure you understand it first."
"Your channel started popping up in my recommendations after having watched a bunch of Innuendo Studios. I'm glad I gave a click, this was delightfully weird."
"Originally, I was lefty SJW type, then I found hitchens which brought me to Harris and then Jordan Peterson. I like Jordan Peterson and other public intellectual thinkers that defend free speech, capitalism, individualism, however, I'm getting a little too sucked into the movement and thought to the point that I'm forgetting leftist theories and arguments. Need a refresher, lol  So I'm watching your vids. Overall I like what I see. They're too fuckin long though and you don't get to the point fast enough."
"I'd be able to take your argument seriously if you weren't speaking in falsetto unironically."
"If there's such a thing as a distinctively Western philosophical tradition, it's the Enlightenment and its 'children': feminism, civil rights, Marxism, anarchism. That is, all the stuff that people who talk about 'defending the West' hate."
"In my (admittedly limited) experience, when someone makes an argument against Peterson, his supporters will always say that the argument has misrepresented Peterson's views.  Of course Peterson's supporters might say that this shows Peterson's opponents can't engage with his actual ideas.  But it seems strange that every anti-Peterson argument is dishonest in exactly the same way. Shouldn't there be at least some opponents who correctly represent Peterson's views, but use logical fallacies or inaccurate statistics?"
"Peterson or you ? Hmmm who would I believe ? You think you're a woman so......Later !"
"This was good. I like most of what JP espouses, and absolutely there are issues with your arguments, but other than me, no one's perfect. I certainly appreciate the fact that you're not just firing exceptionally loud blanks (unless that's what was coming out of the bottle you emptied on dear ol' dad), and that you have a modicum of civility rather than impotent rage the likes of which we've seen too much of late even from so-called 'respectable media outlets' makes for a much more digestible viewing. What am I saying? Impotence? Firing blanks? You may have gotten to me, madam.   If anyone wants me I'll be over there having a gentle wank. -->"
"Big Peterson fan here. Also, this video is FUCKING HILARIOUS!!! You're funny, oh squeaky sounding lady... ish thing."
"I'm a big Peterson fan and I think this is one of the better critiques I've seen. Certainly the most amusing."
"This is a good video and the first one I watched in your channel.  I am a Jordan Peterson fan and probably a neckbeard.  The way I see it, the people pushing cultural leftism, like those who got Damore and tried to get Lindsay Shepherd, use postmodernism to destroy traditional norms, and Marxism to build something in their place.  Take the issue of gender. In European culture at least, we’ve only acknowledged binary cisgendered identity. Defenders of traditionalism say that going against this narrative of men and women’s place in the world causes fundamental problems in society, usually citing the Bible  like a bunch of troglodytes.  Postmodernism says that this narrative is inadequate and criticizes it. It does this justly, as it does not serve people who can’t help but not be served by it.  But with no narrative, no cause can really be pushed. If there’s no good and evil, why fight?  So in comes Marxism. It says the narrative that postmodernism just destroyed was oppressing a bunch of degenerates. So therefore they need equity and representation and etc.  I don’t think it’s likely that this relationship between the two ideologies is purposeful. I think it’s more likely that smart people look critically at the status quo and take it apart using post modernism, and then the call to action springs from their compassionate, socially conscious Marxist habits of mind.  What jbp is doing with his politics, IMO, is saying that we don’t have to demolish everything that is traditional just because it seems chafing.  We should examine the reasons why these traditions might be valuable, first. It’s alright that women choose not to work as much as men, for example, because TYPICALLY they’re less suited to intense workplace competition."
"'Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use, and I don't like it'p Kind of sums up the strawman of JP. 1. no transsexuals have told him what to say. 2. he claims the people trying to tell him what to say only care about their agenda, and not trans people."
"Actually I went to a talk the other day by an anarchist anthropologist who tried to make the argument that hierarchies don't exist in nature and that we are just anthropomorphizing the existence of animals in their ecosystem. So there are some people who don't believe hierarchies are a fundamental part of life. Have yet to meet anyone making the claim that humans don't naturally fall into hierarchical structures though.  Anyways, I love this video and will definitely take a look at your other stuff. I'm a big fan of Peterson by the way but I like to read or listen to criticisms or arguments about or against some of his ideas. I have to say that this is the best summary and well thought out critique I've come across, not to mention fair."
"JBP is Sam Harris 2.0: Has nothing interesting or novel to say, but he says it in a way that sounds smart to ignorant people. Ultimately, there will always be a market for people who add an air of authority to why being a douchebag is some sort of noble pursuit.   He's a charlatan and a crank and I'm tired of hearing about him.  /Don't bother, I don't care //Live with the fact that people can read the same material and come to different conclusions ///In this case, the right ones, but don't let that get you down"
"This is the best thing I've seen on Peterson, bar none, including every op ed."
"So here's the thing with ContraPoints:  https://theviolentink.blog/2018/06/09/trotsky-and-noel-coward-walked-into-a-bar-some-notes-on-natalie-parrott-contrapoints/"
"That is some pretty intelligent degenerate <3"
"Peterson is a right-wing post-modernist"
"Yes. Postmodernism and neo-marxism are incompatible. Peterson actually talked about them being incompatible and how it looks like an example of doublethink in one of Joe Rogan's podcasts. This doesn't mean that people cannot hold these two ideas at the same.  When Jordan Peterson talks about marxism he means neo-marxism. Marxism divides the society to working class and the rich. Neo-marxism as Jordan Peterson uses divides people in terms of their group identity which is what identity politics is. In the video identity politics and postmodernism are compared when it should be identity politics and neo-marxism that is being compared instead. By the way he never claimed that these activists know the consequences of their actions that will lead to the destruction of Western civilization.  People requesting or asking for different pronouns is one thing people forcing and compelling others to use those pronouns is another in terms of individual liberty."
"Peterson isn't defending just any hierarchy. He's clearly speaking of hierarchies of competence which are frequently attacked by or on behalf of those who are less competent."
"Speaking as a cis-white male, your videos are incredibly entertaining and you've done a great job making them entertaining, philosophical, informative and hilarious. Well done!  I think this video best captures JBP's views towards  'post-modernism,' however you define it:  https://youtu.be/qhxjoLGYaOQ  I think I fully support the individualist model as I think most reasonable people would and how you choose to express that is your prerogative. The problem occurs with larger groups of people. I think as JBP says, you have to give up part of yourself (identity) to be part of a group is absolutely right and this works at several levels of society. You may claim and say you're X but that doesn't necessarily make it true until both you and the group can agree to the terms. It's definitely a negotiation process. With it being a negotiation process, you can't just expect people to accept your perspective both straight away or unchanged. Just my 2 cents.   All the best with future videos!"
"I would generally consider myself a Jordan Peterson supporter, and while I disagree with you I still can appreciate the fact you were respectful and fair of his points. Hell, I'll even give it a like!!!"
"I suddenly have a desire to listen to the Velvet Goldmine soundtrack...."
"Just found your channel, I wish I found it sooner! Your vids are great!!"
"Can we talk about this in person over a glass of wine and then you fuck me into a mattress? This sounds like my ideal date"
"It was disingenuous of you to edited Peterson's responses to Newman to make him appear negative to her outlandish questions. You also mislead that his opposition to the Bill C16 had to do with prejudice agasint transsexuals and not wanting them protected, when if fact, it was that the law was forcing citizens to use certain pronouns against their will, or else they would suffer legal punishment. That is NOT the right method to address discrimination, by forcing people to use socially constructed language."
"I’m a huge Dr JP fan but I love the fact his woman is debating his ideas not just screeching (insert identity here)-phobe.   I do think the cultural indoctrination is a problem in today’s society, 55% of college age students don’t believe in the 1st amendment principles, so it has had an affect.   I would love to see a conversation between her and some of the more pro-Peterson Youtubers like Sargon of Akkad or PSA Sitch.   Let’s have a discussion, maybe we can reach a middle ground."
"I suppose of all the critiques of Peterson, this is the best so far, though there are some things you oversimplify or strawman him on.  For example, he has already addressed his concerns about the compelled speech aspect of C16, which you did not mention in your video.  Likewise, his 'defense' of hierarchies isn't that since they exist in nature, we shouldn't do anything about unjust hierarchies -- quite the opposite, he acknowledges that hierarchies can tend toward tyranny and have people stack up at the bottom (hence why a responsible left wing should exist), but he says they you cannot simply dismiss that hierarchies exist either (which quite a lot of progressives try to do and suggest so many things are a cultural construct).  Your main argument is valid though, that Peterson conflates post modernists with cultural marxists.  An Icelandic interviewer confronted him on his misuse of those terms, to which I thought Peterson had a valid response why, but I don't know if it flies for you.  While I can understand why he does it due to time constraints and simplifying things for the audience, I do hope he doesn't repeat doing this in the future.    Since I am a Peterson fan, I think you vastly underestimate the influence that  the progressive/regressive left has on academia, culture, and society as a whole.  But you were willing to actually tackle Peterson in a much more charitable way than the fake news media does, so I do thank you for that."
"I was trying to keep an open mind about what you were saying... until you hit the ' neck beards in line ' comment (in reference to young men).  I'll keep looking for someone who is capable of making intelligent counter points to people like Jordan Peterson. I'll at least grant that your are several steps above the shrill voices of complaint that I usually hear. If you ever manage to drop the insults as a part of intelligent presentation  I might buy into what your saying. I'll drop back in from time to time, who knows, maybe I'll learn something."
"I really tried taking a cross dresser seriously on a serious topic. Can't. He/she/it is way too biased to be taken seriously. Put aside the fact a dude in girls clothes talking psychology is comical."
"1:20 That deep breathe is code for 'Grab your fucking helmet we are going into some shit!'"
"'post-modernism is Western', no it isn't. Emerges out of the West but isn't Western. Being WEstern means being appreciative of the West, they're dependent on the WEst but they aren't a part of it"
"Is she German? Someone pls answer :P"
"I came here because others said you had something to say that might be relevant.  Watched it all, a complete load of shit. you take nothing seriously. All flash, no substance."
"Western philosophy is a set of ideals and principles that help shape and grow western society for the better. Just because a western philosopher came up with an idea does not make it western philosophy. Marxism and communism are not western philosophies, in fact they are the opposite."
"When Peterson speaks on hierarchies, he is talking about dominance hierarchies, the ones feminists call patriarchies, the same ones the identity politics crowd accuse of suppressing the colored folk. As far as Peterson not specifically differentiating between specific leftist factions, thats a moot point, since he considers both to be wrong and dangerous. Also there is a big overlap within the groups you mentioned making it difficult to tell which is which."
"i need a dictionary."
"As a bolshevik(ish) who listens to Peterson's rants from time to time, I think I understand quite well what he means by 'Postmodern Neo-Marxism'  He describes himself as a classical liberal, and that is genuinely what he is. The things he values most are constitutional government, freedom of speech, personal liberties, security in property and person etc. You know, the things certain 1700s wigheads were on about.  He thinks these are the best and greatest values in the world, and that they must be preserved at all cost.  He thinks Marxism poses a narrative of victimhood which claims existing oppression cannot be adequately addressed within a society that consistently adheres to his beloved system of values.   Which, to be fair, is true. Marxism claims the bourgeois state, values and legal systems need to be smashed for the injustice suffered by the proletariat to be adequately addressed. No argument there. Any communist will agree.  And that's why JBP hates the sh!t out of Marxists. The cold war propaganda crap he as an academic has had served to him during his education hasn't helped.(I'm looking at you, Robert Conquest)  And then he sees postmodernists trying to deconstruct everything, *including his beloved values*.  And then he sees those same postmodernists going on about oppressed groups and their victimization.  And his conclusion is:  'OMG! These postmodernists have nothing but disdain for my holy BriClaLib values and they are saying the injustice of society cannot be addressed while they still exist!   IT'S TEH KOMMIES ALL OVER AGAIN!!! AAAAARRGH!!!'"
"You're missing something huge on the transgender pronoun topic.. You said an individualist would support the idea of having a pronoun to suit an individual person, but left out the part where Jordan Peterson opposed it because it was to be Canadian law, and the average person as well as business owners or those within government agencies could be subject to imprisonment under the human rights tribunal for misgendering someone..   That's going a bit too far I'd say..  The government being allowed to arrest and imprison you for not using the correct language is a huge violation of free speech.. And a step towards imprisoning anyone who disagrees with the government..   North Korea anyone?"

"24:00. What the heck are you talking about? Absolute straw-man. Communism and postmodernism might well be western philosophy, but it most certainly would not be classified as Judo-christian philosophy, or in particular, the classic british liberalism that Jordan Peterson stands for.  Second of all, an acceptance of the primacy of the individual is not necessarily the same thing as being a proponent of anarchy. Indeed, that was a key point in his book - there is a balance between chaos and order, and the individual should land between them. We, as individuals, operate within social structures. Clearly there needs to be some permeability, but to suggest that actions should not be criticized is absurd."
"Fuck I was writing a long comment and accidentally, it got deleted, but now, I’m too lazy to write it, so I’m gonna say what I was gonna say briefly.  1- WHY THE FUCK AREN’T YOU INTERVIEWING PETERSON? These so called experts, intellectuals and professionals are failing miserably publicly.  2- I still like Peterson for the good parts he has to offer because a lot of his psychology experience is interesting, but any sane person would never take another person’s views as the ultimate truth.   Thank god I accidentally found your channel through some douchy person. -__-"
"I have a question about the alleged conflict between post modernism and communism. Could not post-modernism be used as a tool to compliment a belief system? Even if Communism and post-modernism are contradictory world views, interpreting history in terms of power struggles, seems like a tempting lens for their world view. Even if there is no goal to history, and we are simply acting out this constant struggle, it does not then follow that a utopian vision cannot be envisioned and struggled for. Next, the tools of deconstructionism can be used to create a more chaotic intellectual environment, destabilizing present structures which theoretically could allow for a new dog to settle in town. I'd imagine these folks would suggest that, their vision could come to pass, a more appropriate power balance magically be struck. As such, elements of post-modernism could be used by fringe elements to destabilize present 'oppressive' systems, and create new 'just' systems from the chaos."
"I couldn't tell if there was anything worth listening to because all of the wierd!"
"Contra points out that Marxism and post-modernism are philosophically contradictory ideas. Granting that 'post-modern-marxism' (or whatever its called) isn't a coherent world view, it does not then follow that people are unable to buy into it. Most people, myself included, do not have a clear sense of the structures of their beliefs. Rather, we cling onto whatever fruitful conceptual crumbs we pass by. Consequently, we do not consider exactly how each of these ideas are to coexist. Generally speaking, people are not philosophically consistent in their beliefs - we tend towards the pragmatic considerations of reality. Accordingly, I don't think that this segment of Contra's argument has any weight, because she failed to establish a contradiction in Jordan Peterson's diagnosis of 'post-modern neo-marxism'."
"I don't understand how regardless if you disagree with Peterson.  You can openly support an ideology, all of which throughout history have lead to the death of innocent lives and children.  Secondly an ideology that claims that white people are inherently racist and privileged ( both prejudice statements) and still claim you're a moral person.  It's clear that you're not calling out the hatred from your own side.  Let's not forget the hypocrisy of never talking about ending the Monetary system but asking for equal pay.  So basically screw the 10 million a year death toll that monetary system kills each year.  The left doesn't care about classism asking as they can buy Aldo bags and fidget spinners."
"Test"
"I came in hoping for a thorough analysis of Peterson but you really did oversimplify many of his ideas and arguments. For example, you said that he justifies hierarchies but he absolutely does not at all and has talked about it at this many many times. He simply recognizes that they exist now and have for many millions of years. This ties in with his discussion of the lobster in chapter 1 of his newest book; he goes into depth of how even crustaceans, with whom we have a common ancestor from about a third of a billion years ago, have hierarchies much like our own.  Even their brain chemisty reacts much like ours does to changes in our place in the hierarchical structure...and that is just the tip of the iceberg!"

"I'm not a fan of Peterson, haven't really even come across most of his stuff.  But at the beginning of the video you said 'reason, power and truth... these are not concepts I care about'.  That confuses me.  What does that leave?  Not caring about truth or reason... just shouting emotional pleas and giving in to whoever is loudest or most intimidating?  In my experience, that is what remains when reason and truth are abandoned.  From the little I have heard of Peterson, it sounds a lot like he is speaking as an academic philosopher, but to lay audiences that don't understand hardly anything he's talking about.  Like when he said (the only thing I've really read about) that perhaps those concerned about people being impoverished in terms of material needs should also consider those impoverished in terms of interpersonal/sexual needs.  That's the kind of idea that really can only be discussed in a philosophical type of context, in a context where people can consider the consequences and basis of the various concerns with emotional detachment.    When a philosopher puts forward an idea like that, the lay audience immediately jumps to 'he wants to turn women into brood mares, forced to screw neckbeards' or similar.  They see asking a question as taking a position.  That's not how philosophy works.  Questions are honest.  You can ask 'hey, what if we decided murder was a virtue instead of a crime?' and just follow the idea, see what it gets you.  You don't commit to the idea that murder is great and then try to bully people into your position.  The answer from the audience you're looking for isn't to start murdering people, it's to talk about the ideas, defend with reason what the negative consequences would be without ignoring the positive benefits (hey maybe it'd be easier to get a job?).  It's a level of thinking that the vast majority of people are absolutely not comfortable with and, after a 20th century rife with a growing anti-intellectualism, really very opposed to even engaging in.    When the audience responds with a blood-curdling scream of offense... that doesn't get heard.  It's little different from someones stomach rumbling out of hunger.  It's a mean, meaningless function of the body, not a thought.  It can't teach anything, and such responses have always been laid against ideas whether they were completely right or completely wrong.  So it's just going to get ignored.  The reason transgender activism and 'identity politics' gets compared to Stalin is because Stalin, whether you like it or not, actively used identity politics to fuel his rise to power and his purges.  When you focus on peoples group affiliation, you denigrate them as individual human beings.  And when you do that, even if you would never dream of playing the groups off against one another and setting one group above another, you can be absolutely 100% certain that a sociopath will emerge in your society who will do exactly that.  And having built the infrastructure that segments, separates, identifies, and separately treats each of the groups, you will have laid the framework they use.  It's not a matter of 'treating people as they wish to be treated leads to Stalin' directly.  It's that the general pattern of splitting people up into groups leads to war between the groups, whether anyone wants it or not.  And it's not as simple as 'we either mandate pronoun usage based on external sexual phenotypical expression or mandate pronoun usage based on individual identification'.  We don't have to mandate anything.  Government is not the sole mechanism by which society regulates itself.  How about this?  If you call someone by the wrong pronoun in a situation where you know the pronoun they wish you to use... you're a dick.  It's disrespectful and impolite.  Yeah, there will be disrespectful and impolite people.  So long as there is more than 1 human alive, that will be true.  It's an imperfect system, but it's almost impossible to weaponize on any large scale.  Peterson, I don't imagine, isn't under the impression that most of the people on the left, have any idea what postmodern neo-marxism even IS.  It is not necessary at all to understand what a philosophy is called, where it came from, or what its history is, to follow it.  Like if you walk into even the most extreme 'leftist' gathering and put forward the idea that maybe we should start eating children, the proper postmodernist response would be for the whole room to say 'that is a legitimate possible truth and we should all accept it'... I don't think that's the response you're going to get when you start taking a machete to pre-schoolers.  They accept postmodernism only on the most superficial level, and if they studied philosophy, they would probably reject it.  A real deep acceptance of postmodernism leaves you unable to justify eating to sustain your own life.  Postmodernism says you can not know such a thing is necessary, and can not provide a justification for taking food out of the world just on the unknowable chance it might help you live.  Marxism is a whole different kettle of fish and I won't get into it.  Really I think Peterson should go out of the public eye.  The public does not want, and is not prepared, to have serious discussions.  When they hear something like 'it'll lead to Stalin' they get too obsessed with being offended to even ask why such a thing was said and given it honest consideration.  He is speaking a language the public doesn't know, but think they know.  Peterson is completely and ridiculously wrong when it comes to hierarchies, though.  Hierarchies are not natural.  Every hierarchy is rife with violations.  On the scale he's talking, every hierarchy is full of parasites, symbiotes, and things which can't be placed in the hierarchy.  It is wrong to depict his view as 'therefore any hierarchy is as valid as any other.'  He's a philosopher.  His claim that hierarchies are inevitable only disputes exactly one claim: that hierarchies are unnatural and optional.  That's it.  You can't extend even one tiny bit from a claim made by a philosopher or you are almost guaranteed to get wrong where they would themselves extend it.  Peterson is an advocate of Liberalism, the 'political theory' kind of capital-L Liberalism that says individual rights have value.  He would oppose monarchy on that basis, regardless of it being a hierarchy.  (Liberalism, btw, won so completely across the world after the American Revolutionary War that most modern people don't even know what its alternative, Conservatism, looks like.  Conservatism is when you see it as totally natural and correct that some people are Better and are born to lead by blood, perhaps because they are descended from a god or are chosen by a god, etc.  It's the mindset that ruled the world for a long time and backed up every monarchy.  Violating individual rights was fine, because the public were only there to exist in service to the state and if violating their rights would enhance the state, it is their moral duty to be ground under its wheels.)"
"nearly wet myself at 2:41"
"Why don't you debate Jordan Peterson then ContraPoints?"
"Don't care about 'reason'??? Wow."
"I am sorry, I tried to watch this but your actions are speaking louder than your words and I don't have the patience for that behavior."
"I did come into this from watching Peterson videos and was expecting another vitriolic attack video. Turns out the most valid and reasoned argument against Petersons points that ive found anywhere on the internet involved peterson in a bath."
"Pretty good video I have to admit. I'll have to be more careful."
"21:00"
"Seriously? I can’t think of something I want to hear less from Jordan Peterson for the mere fact that I’ve heard it so many god damn times is the science behind big five personality traits, and how women and men differ in them. Which is to say they are biologically different in their demeanors. Which is to say they probably make different choices. Which is to say when looking at disparate outcomes in society among men and women that when they can vary greatly in large aggregates the biological differences between men and women helps explain that. A lot. There’s no implication to that, he’s just helping explain the differences, because absent of that we’re left to assume, what? Patriarchy? Is that what you’d prefer as an explanation?"
"6:40"
"Citation needed on how this endangers the groups you mentioned. Peterson has said repeatedly that his political outlook can really be reduced to pointing out that societies that don't organize themselves around the sovereignty of the individual fail. Unless you can point out to me a JBP quote saying that he doesn't think the groups you mentioned are individuals, this concern is completely ill-founded, and of course you can't get explicit in how this backlash would occur."
"6:16"
"Seriously underestimating the issue. There really is hardly ANY deviance from the same progressive narrative in academia. Shouldn’t that strike you as odd, that nearly all university campuses think so similarly, and are so in lock-step with one another? Really, for someone as punchy and as witty, you really should have more to say about how crummy the monotony of the lack of 'diversity' of opinion there is on social issues in universities. Because IT'S BORING. You don’t strike me as someone who likes boring. It's not just a few localized crackpot Marxists either, ask anyone who's in university now, like myself, what it's like to take a class in the communications field, or literature, or political science, sociology, or most of the rest of the humanities. Critical scholars are EXTREMELY dominant and are more of a monolith than you'd like to admit. You can play it cool and act disinterested and witty all you want, there's a reason it's not just JBP talking about this stuff on youtube, he's hardly the only one, and it’s not attracting a large audience because it sounds like this cool new fight all the neckbeards in society can get in on and feel like a part of something. Maybe, just maybe there’s something to it if he and many others from that world are sounding the alarm and attracting large audiences while doing it. I actually attended one of his talks on his book tour recently and I assure you, it is FAR from just a bunch of neckbeards."
"4:55"
"I'm not familiar with the nazi conspiracy about cultural marxism, and I do find it interesting, but I don't have to be to point out this isn't a fair or real argument. Because that means that any time Peterson criticizes something that he might call cultural marxism, you get to lump him in with nazis. Do you think Andrew Breibart was a Nazi? Because that's a term he wrote about and talked about quite frequently. I personally think it’s a little ham-handed of a term, but it gets the point across well enough and at the moment there really isn’t a better way of putting it. And maybe, he uses terms such as that because they actually do get to a bigger point than just saying progressive politics? Again, you're the one assuming motives on this. By the same logic I could say that you only used the word trojan horse to describe his self help advice to make it sound scary, when it's actually just a self-help book. See how attributing motive isn't fair?"
"Ok so I’m a particularly bored youtuber and this is a super long response, but for anyone who cares to respond I’m game to have this conversation. I appreciate the wittiness and sincere attempt to rebut JBP but I do want to disagree, a lot. And what good is the internet without youtube arguments with strangers. Also, bear in mind, I have my own criticisms of Peterson and by no means won’t accept any attack on him without exception, but I just don’t think many in this video are actually all that substantive or reasonable. Anyways here goes. I’ll break it up into parts to make it easier to get through."
"4:15"
"for all the satirical, sarcastic attempts to dispel what you want to portray as the conspiracy theories of peterson, this is a pretty big conspiracy theory of yourself pretty early on, that is even less substantiated, even after having watched the rest of the video. I kept waiting to hear the problem, what this trojan horse looks like and where the danger is, and the punch line never really came."
"Also, Peterson makes the distinction quite often between the advice he gives to 'put yourself together' or whatever, and his commentary on social issues, be it theological/philosophical political. Your suspicions that Peterson's advice on how to put yourself together is an attempt to somehow bring about social/political change is.. really kinda odd... How does that even work? Obviously there's a through line to a lot of his advice in the book to the things he says about social/political matters, but because it's the same guy, not because it's the trick up his sleeve to try and overthrow the left. As much as you try to distance yourself from the kinds of things he's arguing against as if he's making a straw-man, you're literally doing it right here. I’m not convinced his self help book is some kind of political power play or trojan horse, sorry."
"I appreciate this video. Thank you for making it."
"First five minutes:  1:24"
"Yes, he is a psychology professor at the university of Toronto, however the claim of 'Sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely lead to Stalinism' is false. The factual event: He objected to Bill C-16 because it's the very first time the commonwealth wanted to implement a Compelled speech law.  Meaning 'UNLESS you speak THIS SPECIFIC WAY, you are going to be fined, and if you will not accept the fine, you will go to jail'.  That's called compelled speech and is an abomination to self-expression and the free-thinking mind. And if we lose the ability to freely self-express and think then, as it appears to me, we may as well rearrange our governments according to George Orwell's 1984.,m we will lose everything and gain close to nothing that's actually desirable. A slightly less important point was that the bill was horrendously written in that it contradicted itself and thus it does not meet legislation writing standards."
"Surely anyone would agree that a law, regardless of its intended result, should be clear and concise in its message and intent and in NO way be self-contradictory."

"'Trojan horse for reactionary political agenda' All right, let's get down to the actual talk!"
"'Peterson advocates ethics of self-help, not merely as a guide to private life but as a replacement for progressive politics'."
"‘Replacement’ sounds iffy to Me,"
"There is some accuracy to the word, but I am not convinced it’s accurate enough that it warrants proper legitimacy."
"Reactionary political agenda? to progressivism? In the next clip shown Dr. Peterson says, “The philosophy that is guiding their utterances is the same philosophy”."
"Presuming that’s true, (And I do believe it to be so) the philosophy and agenda of the social justice warriors and leftists are propagating; group identity over individual identity, big government and control, obedience and compliance to party(group), etc. etc. is the same philosophy that Lenin, Stalin, Mao and multiple other communist leaders used as their guide.  That led to no less than ONE HUNDRED MILLION DEATHS -100 000 000 human souls! in the twentieth century."
"And now the SJW’s and leftist folks think they have got it right? After more than 100 years of failed states have attempted to make this genocidal and EVIL doctrine work, Nah, communism and Marxism had its shot.  What is going to HAVE to happen is that someone will have to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever, how the new Leftist/postmodern neo-Marxist/Communist push in the west not only can but WILL work as proclaimed/intended.  Let me copy paste that one more time   *What is going to HAVE to happen is that someone will have to prove,*  *_beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever,_*  *how the new Leftist/postmodern neo-Marxist/Communist push in the west not only can but WILL work as proclaimed/intended.*  If that's not possible then It's time to stop beating the dead horse and move on."

"Along with alot of other people, i found myself on this page due to some article saying we should check it out as a counter to jordan petersons positions. I have been waiting for someone to step up who can articulate a contradictory position to jordan peterson for awhile now... and im sad to say I am still waiting. First off, this isnt a serious discussion. which is fine, i half enjoyed the whimsical tone. Secondly, when ever i find someone attempting to engage Mr Petersons positions in a meaningful way, i always find myself disappointed at the actual points they try to engage in. Picking apart his definition of post modern neo marxism or marxism is superficial and doesnt actually even attempt to engage in his positions at all. I guess its a good start for a background of the discussion that im looking for, but it always stops there. Again, it becomes all about labels and how they should be used.. which is very disappointing. why cant the opposition (the left?) get past labels and definitions of those labels and actually address the MEAT of his arguments? great, you think hes using incorrect labeling in his arguments... but what about the actual arguments!?? I didnt get anything out of this, and im not really sure what the point was. was it simply to point out your disagreement with his definition of post modern neo marxism? why bother? what does that prove when no one is actually rebutting his POINTS about what he calls post modern neo marxism is doing and what the ramifications will be? if you ever heard any of his talks, you would be surprised at how little they have to do about the definitions of ideological groups. Even if you think his definition is incorrect, you still very clearly understand who he is referring to when he speaks. and to make things even more disappointing, even THAT argument is reaching for a point. post modern neo marxism in the way he is referring to that label simply means the current form of marxist ideology. It is very accurate as simply calling them marxist is incorrect as there are very large distinctions between where marxism started, and what it has evolved into today. at their core, they both are pushing for a communist future. how they try to achieve this is the difference. by that definition, yes post modern neo marxist would indeed destroy western capitalism.... we agree this is what his position is, in the long run. out of everything this man is saying, is this the only argument with his positions we can find? I (begrudgingly) admit, its more than i can find. He makes more and more sense every time i listen to him. also, im about to start his book, see what that is all about."
"Do you think these 'basic self-help principles' have any impact on politics?

"I'm not sure I agree but I did do a lol"
"Among the valid points of this video there is a lot of caricatures and misrepresentation.  Anyway The Left the Right, capitalism, communism, modernism, post-modernism, dominance, oppression, blah blah blah. I'm tired and bored of it all."
"Hello, Dave.  I'm afraid, Dave."
"As a Jordan Peterson fan, I appreciate ContraPoints effort to try and address his arguments, but I did not find her points to be compelling or persuasive. Even though she did that weird bathtub stuff and some other strange things (which was unusual for me to watch - though certainly interesting), I still felt like the argument was kept respectful and honest. This is rare among Peterson detractors"
"I came here because I wanted to hear someone actually refute Jordan Peterson. You're funny but I value my time and I want the last 15 min back."
"Actually that interview was done by Channel 4, not BBC."
"As an unapologetic JBP fanboy I would like to congratulate you on your criticism of Peterson. It's funny, well-thought, and - importantly - not at all disingenuous. You don't go in for ad hominems either, and your mickey-taking is never nasty. You make good points, and even though I remain undiminished in my regard for Peterson and his work, you have given me the space to look at him in a different light. I'm grateful for that space. Just brilliant. Subscribed."

"The problem with the trans-gender language laws isn't the language, most people will be happy to call you whatever you wish if asked politely. The problem is the threat of punitive action that comes with it. The same problem would occur if government decided we should help old ladies cross the street, so whats the harm in slapping people with fines/jail sentences for not helping old ladies cross the street? It's the threat, not the request."
"You’ve misunderstood Peterson.  His claims are quite clear:  the left has devolved into identity politics, end of.  That’s it.  There’s no other claim.  It’s basic, blunt English.  The left, if it continues along the path of identity politics, will slit its own throat.  He asks his listeners to contend with that.  In this video, you failed to contend with that.  So in your next video, do it.  Very simple, very plain English.  That is all."
"there are absolutely people on the left that claim that all heirachies are a result of patriachal power games, im related to a few who also happen to be effeminate west hating baby boomer hippies, if these people didnt exist and there wasnt any truth to it, he wouldnt be so popular, with intellectuals as well as the laymen."
"where are these 'intellectual discussions' happening on the left? this is one of the many problems associated with the left atm and one of many reasons why ex-leftists like myself have been drawn to jordan peterson, where are these intellectuals on the left? like actual intelletuals with credibility that wont play identidy politics, or post modernist games??? the oter poin i'd hghlight is that everyone jordan Peterson puts under the umbrella of 'post modern neo-marxist' which you claim are at odds with each other, are most definitely united in oppositin of peterson, even if their opposition stems mostly from outrage or embarrassment!!"
"this could have been a good video. but directly after condemming 'his scary choice of words' .....using 'the nazi conspuiracytheory'  as a description is exactly why the left is loosing the support of the people."
"Going to be honest, I got somewhat peeved right after you said why he was against bill C-16. The fact that you think it's okay to bend his message to whatever fits your dialogue is, quite frankly, obnoxious. He is very much in favor of equal rights, for everyone in that case. It is very, VERY, clear that he opposed the bill because it called for the necessity of calling someone by their preffered pronouns. While it is obviously the polite thing to do to call somebody by their preferred pronouns (and he's even mentioned in interviews that he has no problem doing so), it has NEVER been required by the full force of the law. And isn't that a scary thing? At a basic level, telling people that they have to say something, and if they don't, they're going to jail. That's fucking insane, and is entirely comparable to the regime under Stalin. Finally, I really don't like how people always paint him as though he's referring to all of the left when he talks about post-modernism. He is only referring to the radical left, the people who focus solely on Identity Politics (which over time, has certainly come to embody more of the left). I'm a liberal myself and I can see this as being obvious... I think people associate him with the right because those are the only people that will let him speak, and then talk with him without trying to denounce his ideas with strawman tactics. And I know the point you made about Identity Politics and post-modernism... I just don't think we should be taking it so lightly when there are clear examples in society of how they're being abused. Of course, I think you also made some decent points, especially about the dangers of backlash against some of the localization lgbtq activism, as some of his followers definitely don't understand that he's not denouncing the lgbtq community by saying that some of the things they've asked for are absurd. However, I hope you were joking when you decided to leave out those insanely crucial details. It's really not good."

"First off, let me just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this criticism of Jordan Peterson. As a former philosophy graduate student, and Peterson fan, I thought this video is  one of the most fair (and entertaining) criticisms of Peterson online two date.   I just want to say that I think what Peterson is referring to as Post-modern Neo Marxists is exactly what the nonsensical name implies. I think he uses it as term for people who, unlike you, do not really know what they are talking about most of the time. I know plenty of people who use their post-modern influences education to emotionally cherry pick their beliefs on a given topic. And more often than not, when the topic is capitalism they are not for it.    I think Post-modern Neo-Marxism is a perfect, although ironic, way of describing that way of thinking (or non-thinking) and the societal implications they produce.   Wondering what your thoughts on that are."

"Heavy fake up. Blue and purple are pretty colors. Especially the led’s in my computer cabinet. And the lights in her room. But pretty colors doesn’t make pretty a girl. Americans wear navy fake up from eye lash to eye brow. Clowns.without the red ball nose. Or blue and purple nose."
"You are beautiful, and even with the 'Oh the dysphoria...' statement it took me a couple videos until I realized you are trans.  While I love Peterson and the good his ideas have done for my life I have to say that this is not only a good 'rebuttal' to my man JP, but probably the best I've seen.  <3"

"Hi. Can we be friends?"
"My side will fight to the death to make sure you can say whatever thoughts you have, even if I personally don't agree.   Your side is willing to use the power of the state to stifle my thoughts if you don't agree.   I'm comfortable being on the right side of history on this one"

"1. Classical marxism is focused on class struggle. Neo-marxism focuses on all other forms of systematic oppression (race, gender, sexuality, etc.), which overlaps so much with contemporary identity politics that they are practically equivalent. JP often notes the contradiction between postmodernism and neo-marxism, he just uses the terms as an imperfect catch-all for the illiberal (authoritarian) left. Marxism and postmodernism are very Western ideas. JP isn't defending Western civilization so much as he's defending Western liberalism. There's a fundamental contradiction between liberty and equality when political theory becomes political practice. JP and real liberals choose liberty over equality. The radical left chooses equality at the expense of liberty.  2. JP doesn't worry much about a giant leftist conspiracy to destroy Western civilization. He's very worried about smaller leftist conspiracies to defame and silence people like Lindsey Shepard and James Damore. Based on what Jonathan Pageau says, JP is also very concerned about what kind of reaction 'postmodern neo-marxism' will provoke amongst the right. His preoccupation with revolutionary authoritarianism on the left is very much an attempt to pre-empt reactionary authoritarianism from the right.  3. JP is a (late modern) Pragmatist in the vein of William James. You mentioned Richard Rorty, who is a postmodern Pragmatist. Both forms of Pragmatism would admit to a kind of relativism when it comes to language and other symbols. The question is whether the linguistic/symbolic relativism is merely subjective, or if it actually reflects an objective reality. The late modernists would say Truth (and progress) exists, therefore symbolic relativism is superficial and something to get beyond with skepticism, empiricism, and other tools. JP reasons his way into this position using morality: 1) evil exists (Solzhenitsyn), 2) therefore good exists, 3) therefore an objective standard of progress exists. Richard Rorty and other postmodernists take skepticism too far and consequently can't get past the subjective."
"The Southern Poverty Lobster Centre has highlighted this as anti-Lobster hate speech video."
"To answer your question on why lobsters are relevant. Pregnancy takes longer time than the production of sperm, therefore women will be the bottleneck for reproduction and men are going to line up. So women can be picky with who they choose. Out of this comes male competition for status and sucess. How socessful a man is with women is correlated with his socio economic status at 0,5 while there is no such corralation for women. Lobsters may not have cereers but its still a competition for status. And men tend to value career more than spending time with family. Thats not just because norms and socialisation. Its also because the differance in incentive structure that arises out of biological differences. Women can ofcourse still want a successful career and a high income for other reasons but we cant just assume that if we take away some crooked socialisation men and women will have the same priorities.  Newman said at one point in the interview, but you're going to put all those hurdles in my way. This is a conspiracy that just because there are more men at the top they must be working together against women by putting hurdles in their way.  Can the lobsters be used to justify all inequalities? I think the point of the lobster analogy is just to say hierarchies are not created by capitalism or men deciding a few thousand years ago to work against women to keep power for themselves. But there can ofcourse be bias and discrimination but you have to show the evidence for that, but you cant say just because there is a wage gap then there must be discrimination.  Yes it might not always be clear what Jordan means but If Newan didnt see the relevance of the lobsters she could have just said, I dont anderstand why lobsters are relevant to human hierarhies can you explain in what way they are similar? You dont have to guess, or project what he is implying, you can just ask. Thats what Joe Rogan and Dave Rubin would do and there is no problems of understanding in the conversation he has with open minded people."

"Debate JP in real time por favor."
"when petterson rails against postmodernists he sounds just like a postmodernist..."
"I'd like to preface my praise with the fact that I don't agree with you that it is all relative.  I believe in morality and ethics, and not just outcomes.  I can not philosophically defend that position (yet), but that position is the central reason why I disagree with marxism.  However, the purpose of my comment here is to thank you for this fantastic video.  Very entertaining, and educational.  I really appreciated finally hearing a legitimate critique of Jordan Peterson, and this is it.  You're great!"
"Well balance review."
"Did not intend to watch the whole thing, but it was just too good. Kudos.  I did have one thought. (Apologies if someone has already tried this in the *many* comments.) I was convinced by your argument that 'postmodern neo-marxism' as a view is incoherent. But I'm wondering if a committed Petersonian mightn't respond that that's grist for his mill. That the view is at odds with itself is only further evidence that the people postmodern neo-marxists themselves are mistaken. Point being that there's a difference between stating/labeling someone's underlying philosophy and assessing whether that it is coherent. You've done a great job showing that they have an incoherent worldview--and that's precisely why we should reach for the alternative, whatever that is. So sayeth the Petersonian.  I mean, I'm kinda cherry-picking here, and I can think of a bunch of things you might say. It was just a thought."
"This is FANTASTIC. Thank you so much. xx"
"Please be my new best friend."
"You're hilarious and I wish you were right. I don't have time to comment on the whole video, but Peterson knows full well that there is a contradiction between postmodernism and Marxism's grand narrative. He has interesting stuff to say about this. Again, it seems like most of his critics don't actually understand him."
"Interesting video. Well done. I'll subscribe"
"Epic video!!! Yes, there are some bits that are sloppy (and the faux English accent hurts my ears), but hey, this has got to be the most content-rich  and intelligent youtube vid on the Culture Wars I had ever watched. And yeah, the flair. You are very very very good... I just hope that people actually listen and engage."
"This is so lovely."
"It's funny that one of the best arguments from the left actually comes from a man masquerading as a woman.  So I guess men are the best. 😂  I'm also amused that you complained about how boring his speech is. Maybe he should focus on his speech more like you do. Since you are actively trying to speak a way that is not natural biologically. 😂"
"You do realize bill C-16 literally infringes the freedom of speech right? Jordan never said he wouldn't call someone by the pronoun they prefer. In fact he clearly stated that he does refer to trans people he knows by their preferred pronoun. However he refuses to let the government dictate what he can and cannot say. He talks about how that's a dangerous doctrine. I'm tired of people trying to demonize or misconstrue what he says."
"Just because you are an emotional cripple, more fragile than a Faberge egg, doesn't mean you will be allowed to run rampant using your wounds as weapons trying to beat others into submission. You should take Dr. Peterson's advice to clean up your room. Heal yourself first. A wounded healer can only pass on their disease others."
"Good video, but I need to make the point that just because Jordan Peterson's characterisation of 'the left' as being a contradictive mish-mash of Marxism and post-modernism would be logically inconsistent, it doesn't make him wrong... It just means that most leftists are intellectual hypocrites. For example I know one fellow who is both a member of the socialist alliance party which is a Marxist political group, meanwhile he's also a university scholar focusing on post modern thinkers like Foucault and Derrida. Therefore, Jordan Peterson's characterisation of the left as neo Marxist post modernists seems spot on in my personal observations and experiences"

"Offering people optional guidance isn't telling them how to live.  Whereas forcing people to use gender pronouns is telling people how to live."
"I can't deal with all the random shit in this video. I made it to the bathtub. That should be enough disqualify me as as bigot."
"As soon as I heard the words 'what Peterson actually means' I knew in was about to witness a strawman doing mental gymnastics.  That's where I stopped the video and gave it a downvote."
"Just be a man and suck it up,,"
"Your sound is a nightmare. Your voice is too low, the annoying piano is louder, the video extracts you play are barely audible... I wanted to discover your stuff, but hell you make it painful"
"You presumed Peterson is a political actor - he's not. He's a clinical psychologist and interested in the individual, so if he sounds political to you, you came in poised from your own political position."
"This video makes me want to throw up. Jordan Petterson is 1000% smarter than you and has never even attempted to hurt any group of people. You make that up, he is not an enemy to transpeople , he's just an enemy to idiots. This video was trash ."

"No, identity politics is not merely 'advocacy [etc] for particular groups.' It is the tendency to elevate group membership above individual agency, or in other words, to see people purely in terms of their group membership and not as individuals. For example, choosing to promote an employee not because of their individual contribution but because it would be desirable to see someone in their group be promoted. Or, you know, not letting 'men' speak at awards shows. Or claiming that 'white people' are responsible for...well pretty much every evil the world has ever seen, right?"
"Telling people what pronouns to use is a 'small thing'? When he glossed over that I turned out! This  dude knows nothing and makes numerous assumptions about JP."
"Loved the video! As someone who has been a Peterson fan for over 10 years, but conflicted about his recent success  tied to politics, I really enjoyed your breakdown of the theoretical inconsistencies regarding Marxism/postmodernism. I was wondering if you’ve read Stephen Hick’s book on postmodernism as that seems to be the source Peterson draws from the most to tie postmodernism in with Marxism? Maybe at some point you could address that book specifically?  PS the bathtub scene was amazing, pulling him into the bath with you is exactly what he needed!"
"'reason, truth, topics I simply don't care about'  Why would I care about someone's opinion if they don't care about putting an intent to be reasonable with their thoughts? Plenty of people have their hearts in the right place when making a reasoned argument from either side, but in the first 1:17 of your video, thouest claimest that even trying to be reasonable isn't worthy of energy?   I'll watch the rest of the video, but this isn't off to a good start."
"I can't watch past the 5 minute mark. She's creating strawmen all over the place. She's dramatically oversimplifying his 'philosophies', and using terms like neckbeards to describe people who enjoy his books/lectures. She also believes that Jordan Peterson's critique of postmodernism is a common nazi critique (although she states that he clearly is not a nazi). She's using obvious manipulative wordplay to make her points instead of actually making them. Many Liberals have similar critiques of postmodernism. Want an example? Noam Chomsky. Must be a nazi. Lolololol."
"Oh I disagree with you for the most part, but this was a great video. Well presented, humerous, self aware and reasonably level headed when it came to the points you made. Don't have to agree to like your content."
"Although I think you've misrepresented a lot of what JP has said, I liked that you actually presented a coherent argument for the most part. I personally find myself gravitating toward JP because he makes some very compelling arguments that I've yet to see contested in a coherent and convincing way. I am waiting for someone to make a really strong case against him on the left and I just don't see that. His views are constantly misrepresented as being far right when he clearly argues that both sides are necessary and tends to be closer to the center. I don't think a good argument can be made against JP until people start to recognize that he isn't necessarily against the left, but against ideology that attempts to police what people think and say. I think it's a mistake to interpret what he says as an implication of something more sinister. The man is insanely meticulous and deliberate with his speech and I don't think that he does that to make implications about anything. I think he makes compelling arguments about the attitudes and ideas that are becoming more and more popular and presents concerns that many other people have too. The left seems totally fragmented at the moment and it's unfortunate that there aren't many people taking JP's ideas seriously enough to stop calling him an alt-right sympathizer and really tackling the issues he brings up at a higher level of analysis. That being said, I appreciate that you made an attempt to do that in this video. I know you probably do the skits to make your videos more entertaining, but I would love to see a video where you just lay out your thoughts and arguments without any interruptions. There are not many people doing what you did here and I think there's a huge need for it."
"'what is the west?'  Have you listened to much Pet Shop boys?"
"Rubin and Shapiro are 'zany goons' huh?  Identity politics were used by Stalin as justification to oppress others. When she tries to counter this argument she ends up doing a dumb bit. Video devolves from there."
"I don't agree with her thoughts on Peterson, but I do admire her ability to paint and illustrate her picture with psychology's. I think I would have awesome conversations with her"
"Very naive understanding of Marxism, particularly when it comes to how Marxism is practiced. Perhaps this is why you avoided speaking about existentialism and lived truth.  Further, very naive understanding of today's university's humanities departments that's thrown out academic research grounded in validity and reliability, rather imposes assertations and silences it's critics.  Having a good vocabulary is not a substitute for understanding the issues at hand.  P.S.  Too much lip gloss."
"But Marxism and post modernism are philosophical cancers metastasizing in the western world that will kill its culture and history. The point that they are western in origin is irrelevant. Peterson is greatly influenced by Nietzsche who argued that it was Christianity's adoration of truth that ultimately led to the death of God. Battle not with monsters lest ye become a monster"

"I really don't agree w/ what you're saying but this is beautiful. I don't know if I like that I enjoyed this, but I did. Fuck you XD"
"Your critique of Peterson is orders of magnitude better than the blatantly dishonest hit pieces that I'm used to reading. Thank you for that.  As far as I can tell, when Peterson says Postmodern Neo-Marxist he's talking about a way of thinking that rejects universality while simultaneously emphasizing the idea that people tend to be tribal and self-serving. This way of thinking is encapsulated perhaps most concisely in the idea of privilege. If you have privilege, you tend not to be able to see your privilege and therefore it taints your perceptions and your input into the discussion. Your input, therefore, may justly be disregarded on the basis of your membership in a category of privileged people. Peterson has repeatedly pointed out the incoherence of this way of thinking, that is, the incompatibility of postmodernism and Marxism. He also says that it makes dialogue between groups of people impossible and reduces the world to an ideological battleground between identity groups who can't communicate with one another, but have conflicting interests and are therefore enemies. It may not be an accurate description of a well-articulated body of academic thought, but that doesn't mean that there aren't people who think this way. I think the fact that centrist and right-of-center speakers are routinely being shouted down on university campuses is good evidence that a substantial number of people do think this way, at least on campus. It's not like Peterson is sounding the alarm for nothing. Please entertain the possibility that it's precisely because something is wrong that he has become so visible, and the same can be said of Bret Weinstein, Lindsay Sheperd, Ben Shipiro, Steven Pinker and others. If nothing else, there is clearly something wrong on university campuses."
"Hari Blackmore demanded that I provide citations to prove that two parent families are linked to upward mobility. What's the point of participating in conversation if one side demands multiple citations in order to verify commonly known truths, truths which are so widely accepted that 'two parent family = upward mobility' is akin to 'the sky = usually blue'. Hari Blackmore, if you're this stupid, then I'm out. If you're going to attempt at abusing my time by obliging me to prove facts which everyone already accepts as facts, then Im not gonna talk to you, Im just gonna write in this thread to show other people how we would probably be better off if you removed yourself from this entire comment thread."

"I'm a gay immigrant, former Democrat, former progressive, and former Obama voter. Yes, both Peterson and progressives give 'rules'. The difference is that Peterson's 'rules' are voluntary, the rules that the left gives are enforced under threat of financial ruin or imprisonment. As a gay man, I do not believe that the left's punitive approach is effective in advancing the cause of equality and justice. Furthermore, having experienced socialism first hand, I also don't have much confidence in the new-found acceptance of homosexuality by the left; traditionally, socialists considered homosexuality to be a decadent vice of Western societies, and progressives considered it a biological defect that required institutionalization and medical treatment, supposedly for the good of society. Even Hillary and Bernie didn't support gays and lesbians until it seemed politically safe for them."

"I really love your videos and I like this video too....someone actually attempting a thoughtful, balanced intellectual critique of Peterson, which I have seldom come across thus far.   Simple criticism though: I think your analysis of Peterson's lobster/hierarchies argument is, respectfully, the exact straw man you are accusing Peterson of....as it removes the context of his actual specific point that hierarchies will naturally occur, for a myriad of reasons, so seeking equity of outcome is a meaningless metric. Similarly viewing lack of equity as wholly related to 'group oppression' instead of stemming from a variety of factors that will naturally occur (thus some kind of hierarchy will always form), will send you down the wrong path looking for the wrong solutions. I think the key here is that as modern activism is based upon radically believing in and achieving these metrics, and the ideas take hold in various aspects of policy and administration, these wrong solutions, which don't receive criticism very well at all, at best end up very ineffective at solving the problem they intend to solve (as the problem itself may not exist in the way they understand it in the first place), and at worst will undermine the integrity of a system, which is at least functional and effective. Now, I don't necessarily agree with these views....but it would be a much more meaningful critique of Peterson to analyze them, instead of the 'straw man' assertion.   Likewise, I think the discussion of the semantics and history of the 'pomo neMa' term was very valid and necessary, but there was another big straw man in your conclusion, which ended the video where I thought the most interesting parts of the criticism would be: the activist culture than Peterson dislikes (under whatever term) generally has a dislike of various societal (or biological) constructs, viewing them as limits placed on certain groups for the purpose of control (Marxist = meaning 'us' the workers vs 'them' with the money and power; neo-Marxist = applying the us vs them narrative to every meaningful definable hierarchical societal construct)....and that all history should be viewed with the lens of categories and division based upon power....BUT the new categories are also just arbitrary divisions based upon the very same group distinctions, also based upon gathering a new hierarchies of power and control, this time based on whatever the 'activist class' is, essentially the same rich white bourgeoisie gaining the same political power retooled for a slightly new narrative.   I don't really think Peterson is talking about anything other than what Haidt has been talking about....he is just going about with his old white man Professor toolkit. To me the distinction Peterson needs to make, which he never seems to elaborate on (perhaps because he is never asked) is what is reasonable and what is not, and he clearly goes to far when he says all activism is illegitimate....whereas I think a common sense reformation of the all or nothing 'oppressor vs oppressed' narrative into people instead advocating for solutions to the problems groups face is the actual real reasonable concern. For example: transgenderism is a real thing, its absolutely fine, and thus people advocating for trans rights and issues are necessary and good....but saying that trans people are hopelessly oppressed by the societal construct of gender conformity as a fundamental form of limit and control by those in power, and that any talk of biological science that may conflict with radical gender theory needs to be shut down as oppressive and transphobic is perhaps not a very reasonable default position that society and the academy should be based around...."
"You will only fool most idiots."
"Not even close. Nice try."
"Are you a vampire? Peterson projects way more positive energy than you seem to understand"
"One of the problems I have, even with this very good criticism of JP, is how the critics follow him along his observations and, when his observations stop, they cannot understand that he hasn't led them to his conclusion, but to a place where they are being forced to make their own based on the observations he's made.  This is basic seminar level philosophy.  He has conclusions, don't get me wrong, but in certain tricky areas, sometimes one can't make a conclusion, because there's something vital missing, or something extra that leaves a messy remainder, and maybe he doesn't know what, but it's important, and by sharing the knowledge he's put together on a subject, maybe someone else knows the missing piece.  Maybe that piece changes everything. That's what a conversation does.  That's why conversations are so important."
"Why is murder wrong if everything is subjective and relative? I should be allowed to murder my neighbor and take his stuff because he’s oppressing me by being more successful."
"Wow"
"Please try to talk to him.  I would do anything to see you have a discussion with Jordan Peterson"
"Sorry, I was at 16:33, where you said that Peterson attacks 'the entirety of the modern left'. I don't think that's accurate. I think he just refers to those, within the modern (north-american) left, that espouse the ideas of - and I think I'm being mostly exhaustive here - social constructivism and affirmative action, and generally the whole theorisation those two ideas lean upon.  EDIT: at 20:57, you ask what he was implying by stating that biological differences between men and women is relevant concerning the different representation of the sexes in the workplace. The point he was trying to make is that the biological differences are also _in the brain_ . He was saying that women overall desire less to do the things that are necessary to earn more in the workplace, and he was arguing that if that's how women's values align, society and policies have no place telling them what to want.  He was also saying that most workplaces (especially the high-risk/high-responsibility high-reward ones) require personality traits that are less prominent in most women, and that since this requirement is very likely a result of the 'natural selection' of the free market on companies, pushing for different criteria of selection (besides competitiveness and dedication) could be disastrous, all the more seeing as we have no data that any other workplace behaviour would be at all effective.  And obviously he was arguing against the most moronic principle of all, which is equality of outcome, meaning that no matter how effective or productive or innovative or creative someone is, you have to discard them in order to fill your ranks with a token proportion of less prepared individuals belonging to a minority (or women). It doesn't take a genius to realise that if you equalise the salaries and the hirings rather than the education, you will end with crippled companies and, guess what, social injustice. Peterson also argues elsewhere, but not during the Newmann interview, that equality of opportunities is good and auspicable.  EDIT II: at 23:35. When Peterson refers to 'the West', I think he does it in geopolitical terms. He's not characterising pomo neo-M as if it doesn't belong to 'the West', on the contrary, I think he means that they're doing all their nasty stuff to the West because _that's the place_ those ideologies were born. Like the Basilisk vs Hogwarts."
"This is the best analysis of Jordan Peterson on YouTube."
"After watching the entire video it is clear that ContraPoints is confused about what Jordan Peterson is advocating. Let me try to sum it up:  Equality of opportunity is not only good, but highly desirable.  Humans differ on far too many dimensions and dividing people along the lines of their skin color, nose length, genitalia, sexual orientation or finger count is equally pointless.  Seeing the world or history through the lens of power struggle between arbitrary groups is the definition of Neo Marxism. Any sort of oppressor/oppressed view of the world is Neo Marxist.  The West of today has achieved a very fair and balanced society. Any person of any background, skin color, nose length, genitalia, sexual orientation or finger count is equally able to vote, work, travel, go to school or hold up placards protesting the poverty.  And so that there is less confusion, the West is the place with these liberties. Rough rule of thumb to define West is to look at the flow of people in the world- ie where people wish to go and live, by their own choice- basically Western style democracies where people can and do vote, there is strong rule of law and people are free to pursue their dream. This makes them rich by definition. They are rich because of these qualities, not in spite of.  Now, here is the problem: insisting that some groups are worse off, so that they should have special advantages- is in essence equity doctrine of Neo Marxism. By their logic all people are the same. Society should put weights around the historically good runners so that historically poor runners have equal chance to win. This line of reasoning doesn’t stop there. It is also advocates that some groups should have a head start so that every runner crosses the finish line at the same time. Neo Marxist can rest when everyone is equal in every way. Historically this means everyone is equally poor and starving in the dirt.  This is the same doctrine that Communists enacted that has already let to the deaths of millions of people. We should learn from our history and strive to avoid it.  According to Jordan Peterson the only true way forward is the Christian way. The individual is sovereign and we should do everything to support and help individuals. Everyone should have equal opportunity, but what they do with it is up them, personally.  A random person with different skin color, nose length, genitalia, sexual orientation or finger count should not be treated any differently than any other individual, regardless of their immutable, innate characteristics. Different groups of poeple should not be treated differently either for their detriment (alt right) or their advancement (radical left). Identity politics is equally idiotic and bad.  Thank you for reading."
"Hilarious. Nicely put. Important to remember Peterson is a depressive, which no doubt desaturates his world view."
"Sorry, but what's happened to the comment section?? People are having _civilised_ discussions!! Also the video is hilarious, kudos."
"This video above all other media critiques of JP addresses what makes his brand of social commentary so alluring and yet so misleading and dangerous. Kudos for an absolutely brilliantly crafted analysis. Subscribed and looking forward to more liberal rational and fair viewpoints."
"This was the funniest dismantling of JP I’ve seen so far. Great work. Can’t wait for your Dave Rubin video 😀"
"How come every time neoliberalism dresses up in leftist rhetoric, Peterson and his allies take it at its word and falls for the trap... but when an actual trap comes up, he says he is not a fool and will not take appearance for substance?  Anyway, political post modernism is basically the defense of all moral and cultural degeneration caused by the development of capitalism, as predicted by not only socialists but also by everyone in the 19th; a defense made using 'leftist terminology' with absolutely no actual relation to Marx. But since people like Peterson want Marx to get bad reputation from the action of degenerate bourgeois kids, and since those very kids want to associate with Marx to get, in their context, his good reputation, the farce is maintained by both sides of the play.   Otherwise Peterson would have to admit his glorious capitalist patriarchy produced this very degeneracy he despises, including the malicious use of leftist rhetoric to advance their selfish, indolent goals; its simply good marketing, you should recognize standard capitalist practice when you see it. And these bourgeois kids would of course have to accept they are capitalist excrement, not revolutionary soldiers; that they are precisely a weapon used against the working class and not the opposite. They would have to realize they are so fucking bourgeois that even a literal fascist is less 'anti-worker' than them.   The result? Neoliberalism is pushed by both sides to increase competition and colonize as many spheres as possible with market logic. These kids with rehearsed pseudo-leftist rhetoric make sure it flows into sexuality and gender relations while people like peterson make sure government is only removed from the picture after it has done the dirty work of corporations. Neoliberal interests making universities absolute garbage, but just because this garbage is dressed up in leftist rhetoric you are stupid enough to believe it is true.   Peterson and his people believe 'the left' is responsible for destroying everything that is sacred, when everyone in the 19th century saw it happening back then and knew it was a result of the capitalism-democracy pair (which are one and the same in their contemporary versions).   ps - neoliberalism is not abolishing the state in favor of markets, but the use of the state to further the interests of the market and make it more competitive, as is precisely advocated by 'leftists' when they call for affirmative action (and it goes without saying affirmative action is still meritocratic and does not break with capitalist ideology at all... and even worse, everyone knows who are the blacks, the migrants and the women who take the affirmative action spots that are created to help innocent victims : bourgeois blacks, bourgeoisimmigrants, bourgeois women, and so on.   This is how 'the right' side of neoliberalism became more pro worker than its left side: the right side didnt have enough clout to keep pushing more liberalism with its rhetoric, so its left side took over for a while. And so on and so on"
"I stopped watching when she straight up lied about him and how he came to fame. It had nothing to do with transgender people and everything to do with forcing speech. Those people can't control their feelings so they resort to wanting to control others' behavior."

"I definitely think that people should be able to express themselves however they see fit, individualism is a key component to our Western ideals.  The problem arises when people care more about a forced outcome instead of opportunity.  I think it is telling that you are a supporter of socialism/Marxism.  It is not good enough to live and let live, others must conform to your idea of fairness, be that economic or gender related.   Looking at history, it is very clear that forcing the ideal of equity in economic outcomes only leads to oppression and misery.  Do you honestly expect that forcing such a simple solution on a very complex subject like economics will result in utopia?  Because if you do, join the millions of other that had to learn the hard way.    In the same way you believe that forcing your ideals about gender will lead to harmony in our treatment of each other.  Why is it not enough that we label those with XY chromosomes men, and those with XX chromosome as women?  However you choose to present yourself beyond that is up to you, and you free to do so.  Instead, you compel speech, you attempt to back up your claims with pseudo science such as a 'gendered brain'.  Even the trans movement can't agree at all on what gender is and how to define it.  It is reasonable then to use scientific knowledge to define male and female based on chromosomal arrangement, and the rest is left up to the individual. I think you will find people are a more tolerant than you give them credit for, it is the strong armed tactics of compelled speech and the demand for the world to bend to your scientifically baseless ideas which is causing all the issues."

"This is by far the best response I've seen to Jordan Peterson's material. Thank you for putting in the time to do this. I enjoyed watching the video.   It did seem to misrepresent Jordan Peterson's positions in a number of ways, albeit through presenting only a limited subset of his views, and not through misrepresenting his positions (aside from intentionally humorous jabs, such as saying Peterson equates transgender activism to Stalinist policies; it's much more accurate to say that forced speech leads to Stalinist policies due to limiting free thought). He agrees that one might find different outcomes for each gender and each race, and offers that we should also consider age, birthplace, the income and education of parents, disability, and an infinite number of additional metrics that end up drawing a line between each person individually. He argues frequently that one can categorize a person in an infinite number of ways, so why stop at the few popular ones? Individualist philosophy derives from this observation, and Jordan Peterson's philosophy does the same.   As far as racism and sexism goes, Peterson disagrees with addressing these types of problems through government policies, since one would need an infinite number of laws to enforce all of the different ways in which each of the infinite number of categorizations might oppress each other. He argues rather that we ought to pass legislation based solely on the oppression of individuals, which includes all races, all genders, and all other categorizations. This has the effect of removing oppression simultaneously from the infinite number of categorizations.   Peterson vehemently opposes activism and legislation about power struggles based on arbitrary, binary categories, since the outcome of such battles often leads to violence. This is where he draws similarities between modern identity politics and Marxism, which relies on class struggle to overthrow existing governments. Fundamental to Marxism is the idea that each class in society thinks using incompatible logic, and that it's impossible for one class to understand the logic of another, which ultimately leads to revolution. This same type of flawed reasoning happens frequently in identity politics -- i.e. 'You're a man; you could never understand a woman's struggles' -- which serves only to rewind formal logic and modern society by a couple thousand years. Pitting groups against one another while simultaneously arguing that neither group will ever understand one another inevitably ends in violence.   Fundamental to all of Peterson's arguments is the idea that an increase in violence is always an undesirable outcome. He studied to find the answer to a simple question: how do you stop conflicting ideologies from destroying the earth? It's important to frame his arguments in this context, so as not to lose sight of the intent of his arguments. All of his public speaking intends to elevate individual thought, decrease individual oppression, and ultimately reduce violence.   Thank you again for the video. Looking forward to watching more of them.   (Also, this is an unedited brain dump, so I apologize if I haven't done a point justice. Feel free to lambast me, and I'll provide a better response. Edit: I just edited a typo, so it's technically edited, but not for content issues.)"
"'No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies' You are straw manning Peterson while claiming he's straw manning the left.  You've completely ignored the context of the biological explanation for patriarchy. You're not addressing the point he's making at all. You're just saying he's not making this point or that point which implies his point isn't a point at all like those other points would be. So, you excuse yourself from having to answer his point because he didn't make points you want to address. This doesn't suggest the points he's making are correct, but it certainly fails completely to address anything he has actually sad."
"I don't get why Mickey Mouse is so mad at JP, he's always talking about his movies."
"The desperation of the left to combat anyone who deviates from their rigid philosophy system is truly pathetic."
"You stated that Peterson said men and women are biologically different and didn't argue against that. You said it was stated in the context of a conversation about the under-representation of women in government, but you don't show that context or show him not connecting the two topics together and of course you don't show him connecting them, that would suggest your point was wrong.  You fail to grasp the implications of the differences in biology as an explanation for the differences in pursuits such as positions in government. It's pretty straight forward. I'm sorry you feel someone has to connect the dots for you in order for you to understand them. 'So, how do you respond to this? Either... (false dilemma) you fall into the trap of arguing against the obviously true statement or you have to guess at what he's implying.' No, you can ask him what the biological differences have to do with under-representation in government or whether he thinks there is a way to overcome the biological differences to provide for a more accurate representation. Based on the difference being biological we'd be hard pressed and maybe even in the wrong ethically to try and force human nature to change to our very short-sighted will.  If you guess what he's implying by putting words in his mouth, it shouldn't leave your speechless to find out that he will accuse you of misrepresenting his ideas. That's what happened with the interview, in your opinion, based on your theory, which is rooted in fallacy. Your talents like far from intellectual analysis and discourse and closer to reinforcing bias and sounding more confident than you should. I don't mean that as an insult because it is highly effective even if I disagree with your points."
"Jordan Daddyson, I mean Daddy Jordanson...Daddy Peterson? Daddy?"
"Could it be that Peterson and other talking heads from the alt-right are actually trying to appropriate post-modern critical theory in the way Christians appropriated aspects of pagan cultures? As an American Libertarian, with a background of Objectivist philisophy, I see more of a trend along these lines."
"You’re just salty that you’re mentally ill"
"5 minutes and 16 seconds in and your whole point is to straw man Peterson? I expected way too much after reading the reactions to this video. You've claimed the problem is localized but the response is national. The evidence suggests that is incorrect. 'We don't tell people what to do. We tell them what not to do' equating advice on how to be a responsible and productive adult to totalitarianism seems illogical.   'When it's okay to criticize things' Contra says is Peterson's rule but that doesn't sound like a rule, where as the left absolutely does demand you never criticize minorities, children, or Muslims. Your arguments are weak. That doesn't mean anything Peterson says or does is right, but making such a huge claim as you did at the beginning of the video requires big evidence and this is just polite trash talking a deception."
"My new favourite youtuber! :)"
"Nearly 4 and a half minutes before anything you say is relevant."
"The problem, in Contra's words, is that all this life coaching is 'basically just a Trojan horse for reactionary political agenda'"
"(cut)"
"'Peterson advocates an ethics of self help, not merely as a guide to private life, but as a replacement for progressive politics, which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil'"
"(cut to clip where the interviewer says, 'There is no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?' To which Peterson answers, 'Why not? The philosophy that is guiding their utterances is the same philosophy' This is not an example of him characterizing them as totalitarian or evil. It is him asking 'Why not?' and then comparing them as if to be the example and go against the idea that the interviewer can have total control over him and force him not to--likewise progressives can't police thoughts."
"'Peterson doesn't use the word[sic] progressive politics because [hearsay] that doesn't sound scary enough. His new scarier word is postmodern neomarxism.' Scary is subjective, I'm concerned with the accuracy of it, and Contra didn't say it wasn't accurate."
"'We have to be careful not to confuse... (introduces a different concept to be LESS confusing)' and then claims a conspiracy theory based definition of the new concept before promptly suggesting the two are comparable which leads back to, if you can compare 'postmodern neomarxism' to 'Nazi conspiracy theory' why would it be though not allowable to compare 'the utterances of a trans activist' with 'the utterances of Mao'"
"(cut)"
""
"Okay. 5 minutes in and no points made by Peterson have been addressed. Neither has there been supporting evidence for the idea that Peterson's life coaching is a Trojan horse for reactionary political agenda. Nor is there anything suggesting that Peterson uses the term 'postmodern neomarxism' because it is scarier than 'progressive'. Which, based on Mao's 'great leap forward' which killed 45 Million people in 4 years, progressive is a plenty scary term."
"I just want to express that despite having a worldview aligning more closely to Peterson it is awesome seeing someone make a real intellectual rebuttal to him. Everything I have seen prior simply dismissed him as a racist or a nazi and just assumed that was enough to show what his positions were wrong which, for me at least, only further bolstered his arguments. From someone who is on the other side of the isle; Keep it up"
"What the hell is this dude talking about?  lol."
"Hmm. Side note, just occurred to me, if this was Sept 2017 or earlier you prolly would have been topless in the bathtub. Anyways...  Most young people today, particularly the ones who wasted their parents money on a college education, are pretty much text book definitions of fascists. You've pretty much all been indoctrinated. Could not be more obvious. One must either think like you do or they're simply bad and/or should be silenced. Anyone who is perceptive can see this change in our culture.   The very foundation of fascism: suppression of opposition and control of thought. Or, ya know, the #Metoo movement, for example. ;)  The problem is, you all have been so brainwashed into it and practice fascism so frequently that it's not a socio-political theory to you. It's just the way your brains work at this point.   Ummm.... friggin...yikes?. :\    My question is.. how long will it last?  My guess, it's almost over."

"This is an amazing video.  I can hardly imagine the time and thought put into it.  Thank you!"
"While I agree particularly with your last point about reducing or summing up 'the west' to those specific ideals is shortsighted and incorrect, I disagree with your dismantling of 'Post-modern neo-marxism'. It is somewhat irrelevant that such an idea is contradictory when looking at  both terms and ideals separate. No doubt that there is an inherent contradiction, as even Peterson is aware. What is more important is how such ideas are applied. And in this sense, I actually find 'post-modern neo-marxist' to be a far more accurate blanket term than say, cultural Marxism, because it is more apt in describing certain grouping of ideas, all of which can be accurately summed as offshoots of critical theory.  So the reason why Postmodern neo marxist is an apt description in describing a number of different groups who on the outset seem unrelated, is because they tend to see the world and society through a Marxist lens of oppressor vs oppressed, and filter it through the post-modern idea that truth is dictated by those in power, and those truths are there to hold those with power at the top while subjugating those who dont have power and keeping them at the bottom. The different iterations play out like this:  oppressor group vs oppressed group in BLANK power structure  borgiasse vs proletariat in the power structure of capitalism  whites vs POC in the power structure of white supremacy   men vs women in power structure of patriarchy  colonizers vs colonized in the power structure of colonialization  cis vs LGBTQ in the power structure of heteronormativity   it's also good to keep in mind the Peterson doesnt actually accuse the left as a whole of this type of thinking, but what he deems the 'radical left'. And that while there may potentially be some truths to such type of analysis, it ultimately reduces many of the worlds problems to certain vague causes themselves, while allowing for a tunnel vision/confirmation bias that allows one to ignore many other potential variables that may influence people and solely look at the worlds problems in a univariate way. As such the idea of white supremacy and patriarchy being the cause of racial and gender disparities, when in reality, the problem is far more complex. Such ways are thinking are very dogmatic and self serving, using a kind of circular reasoning to justify itself and discredit its opponents. For example, the idea of privilege is used to shutdown conversation, and that immutible characteristics of identity informs ones logic and politics. Where we can say to each other, 'you only believe this because you are BLANK' there by discrediting someone not on the validity or merit of their arguments, but by things they cant control, like the color of their skin, the makeup of their genitals, and where they were born. And that is a dangerous path to go down. One we have seen throughout history to justify a number of atrocities including slavery and the holocaust.  Such is the potential dangers of Identity politics and the tribalism that tends to stem from it."
"I'm here to listen and learn. I've only heard Peterson's side. So I'm 100% biased.  I don't think anything Peterson says are things he thought up, it's things he's observed and witnessed through reading or observation.  Reality IS. Everything else is second to that?  (still loved the content as a first time watcher!)"

"Someone should tell the Roman Plebeians and Foederati that identity politics is a new thing. Someone should also tell the Ancient Greek Sophists that relativism is a new thing."
"And he sees that one cant be postmodernist and marxist at the same time because of the reasons you presented and he is concerned by fact that some does that and thinks that it indicates something about people on the left. He talked about that many times"
"Also, he believes that left should exist to make sure that hierarchies wont become too tyranical. Both at the social and economical level. He does not believe that we shouldnt do anything about them. You missed that somehow."
"You clearly know more about left than Peterson. He probablly knows more about religion than you. The reason why he uses 'Postmodern neo-marxist' term is that he oposes the very idea of opressor vs opressed narrative that is quite collectivist in its nature. And he does that due to his study of religion, not only christian but mainly. I recomend biblical lecture, especialy one about Cain and Abel although sepreate lecture might lack context."

"Postmodernism is not opposed to identity politics. Yes, postmodernism 'deconstructs' group classifications like race and gender in the sense that they don't have an essential nature and aren't eternally given, but it doesn't say that these categories aren't real in the current social order. The recognition of the social construction of these categories does not entail that one shouldn't use them in trying to liberate the oppressed."

"Do you ever build anything? All I see are feeble attempts to belittle others and piggyback off controversy. The fact is Dr. Peterson is a good man who says things that resonate with others, and you only encourage his fans when you go out of your way like this. You don't even prove him wrong, you just say things to make his detractors chuckle with their circle of friends."

"Loved the video (as always), hate the Hume of the video, though you admittedly don't dwell on it.   Look, can philosophy get over his arguments there. They *really* are, *really* bad arguments. At best his arguments amounts to the idea that premises need to match their conclusions i.e. if you're hunting for conclusions in biology, use biological premises/arguments. Ditto physics, music, masturbation, basketball and arguing on the internet. The distinction between ethics and the rest of that mushy human stuff and science therefore amounts to nothing better than the distinction between astronomy and chemistry, but we don't go around saying astronomy isn't science, so why would we argue that ethics isn't?  In fact, 'make your conclusions match your premises' is pretty close to the best definition of a scientific method we've got. If it was good enough for Moritz Schlick, it's definitely good enough for me! </dorky Logical Positivist joke>"
"'I'm gonna divide modernism into two periods because I feel like it' *SUBS*"

"Peterson has, to some extent, addressed the fact that 'Postmodern Neo-marxism' is self-contradictory. I can't point you to a source, but I distinctly remember a conversation he had where he criticised Postmodern philosophers for throwing out classical epistemology, but still coming to conclusions regarding things like politics and morality. If anyone knows where that's from, that'd be great (I feel a little guilty for asserting things without solid evidence), but whether or not he said it is not quite as important as the fact that his worldview is still consistent with the term being contradictory."

"@ContraPoints  A friend of mine recommended that I take a look at your video, so I sat down and took a look at your video. First things first, you've got talent for making videos. At no point does your video allow the viewer to get bored, and while some of the humor is a bit off (bathtub Peterson scene), I can appreciate the time and effort you put into it. It also looks like you put a lot of effort into researching Peterson, and I appreciate the desire to actually get into the topic.   The instigation for this post comes down to the irreconcilability between post-modernism and neo-marxism, as well as the broader narrative of the West fighting against that hybrid philosophy. Below is a link attached to one of the better Q&A sessions, with the initial interviewer providing a number of tough questions that made it the most entertaining I've come across in a while. In the video below, which should be time-stamped to the right moment, he acknowledges that there is a fundamental contradiction at play, and instead says that the moment the post-modernists move outside of their intellectual engagements, how they act and behave fall along Marxist lines. Not saying that this is any more accurate, but it would be worth a viewing to see if it changes anything.   Lastly, Peterson doesn't believe that Marxism is somehow non-Western in a geographic sense. Most of his criticisms of that doctrine have always been internal, and notably geared towards the French. His references to 'non-Western' polities are always designed to showcase the failure of the ideas espoused by Western Marxists, not to ascribe origin as outside of the heritage of ideas. Peterson's religious talks have consistently been informed by Middle Eastern, Indian, Buddhist, and Chinese traditions and myths, where he welcomes comparisons of the Judeo-Christian ethos to those traditions. He's particularly fond of referencing the Egyptians, Yin-Yang, and the Buddha.   The reason why I say all this is not to criticize, Peterson's online corpus is intimidating, and its unreasonable to expect others to watch the latest lectures and talks, which are usually two hours long and can come out 2-3 times a week, in addition to watching hundreds of hours of videos from his course lectures. The point here is just to add to the conversation, since - you know - that's what we're supposed to be doing. If we aren't willing to treat each other with respect and to highlight ideas the other might not be familiar with, then we're on a dangerous path.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V32WHDuy-Do&t=7360s"
"Please only feminine pronouns when referring to JP"
"Post-modernists/post-structuralists don't disavow structural oppression, so of course he doesn't bother to gain any understanding of them. If you see all social/political/economic hierarchies as naturally occurring rather than as the result of social and historical processes that have purposefully evolved in exploitative ways, the claim that they are used to oppress and exploit people and that this oppression should be rectified by the deconstruction of said hierarchies feels very dangerous and scary. He just wants to say things might be bad but they aren't that bad for him (bc s e l f i m p r o v e m e n t) and therefor they aren't that bad for anyone else either, pls no changey. He wants to keep his security blanket.   His whole lobster argument is a surreal attempt of reducing complex historical and social processes down to 'lol dude its just b i o l o g y'. The fact that he chooses lobsters, out of all animals, shows how shitty he is at making intellectual arguments. It's such an arbitrary notch in the wood to stake your argument in. But if you want to make arguments for internet and popularity points, lobsters are probably fine, nothing really matters then."
"Thanks, CP. You're beautiful."
"Interesting. One thing i always enjoy is gaining perspective. Perspective is a useful tool and very valuable and I can always appreciate when it is said in a reasonable manner. I enjoyed this overall though I disagree with some of your points and agree with others most notable being your point about pronouns and individualism. I am a libertarian and for all intents and purposes support the individual and their pursuit of whatever the hell they want. That said the issue is when government is involved. I support Peterson in his opposition to such legislation as Bill C16 because it is not the place of the government to enforce such a thing. Racism sexism and any other ism you can name will always exist in one form or another and people should be allowed to express and hold such views not to fear consequence of legislation but of the society which they inhabit. Anyways, always good to be able to understand what belief someone holds why they hold it and how they define it."
"Although I disagree with most of the things you say, I loved your video. It made me laugh out loud several times, and I can tell that you are clearly a creative and talented person with original ideas.  However, and I'm really sorry if this offends you, but I really feel the urge to say it: I think your voice is annoying as shit. Have you considered getting help with it?"

"'no one has ever said that every hierarchy is the product of western patriarchy'  Cathy Newman didn't object. Neither has anyone he has ever debated with."
"Let's be real Contrapoints. This video does a good job at pointing out the divides and logical inconsistencies of the left. But you are fooling yourself if you believe there is a significant debate going on between two opposing leftist ideologies. The vast majority of modern leftists, at least the one in power, fail to even realize their logical inconsistencies which is why they so consistently lose debates to people like Peterson. 'gender is a social construct and does not actually exist'. 'one can be born as one gender biologically, but mentally be another gender'. Yes, obviously those two ideas cannot coexist, and I give credit to anyone on the left who can admit that. But I have yet to see any leftists debate with each other on this, instead they try to pretend like there is no logical inconsistency because they are so blinded by ideology. However, there is one consistency here, and that is what matters: Both are trying to undermine fundamental values that the west has held for centuries (gender is real, biological, important, and men and women are biologically different). THAT is the point that people like Dr. Peterson is trying to make"

"I don't really get what this is. Sorry, first time I've seen a video of yours so I don't exactly get where the cringy stereotype and faux-nihilism stops and the content begins...unless this is all kind of vaguely edutainment? Either way, assuming there's an actual serious argument being made here which I think there is I have to wonder exactly what is the point of this. You seem to have this pet peeve about the handling of the trans-activist incident that made him famous, despite the fact that he's not against trans people and his main contention with Bill C-16 was its aspect of legally compelled speech.  Also, maybe I'm missing a source or something here, but the whole video just kind of seems like 10 minutes of softening the inevitable knee jerk reaction of Jordan Peterson fans that stumble across this, and 20 minutes of 'No True Scotsman' arguments, made more confusing by reducing a term to it's parts and taking those literally to apply that argument. Why exactly must a Postmodern Neo-Marxist do and believe everything that Postmodernists and Marxists do? This is like arguing the two party system in the USA makes no sense because all Democrats believe in an Republic and all Republicans believe in Democracy. Same kind of goes for the whole diatribe on what the 'West' is.   Was honestly hoping for something actually critical of Jordan Peterson aside from 'He uses bad terms' because it doesn't really deal with any of the arguments he makes."
"'Someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape'   Yes. Thank. You"
"Even though some of your critique is probably correct (postmodernism), I found few errors in your arguments and facts: - Peterson isn't putting all leftists in one category, he actually literally asks left people to define boundary between sensible socialist and radical left. - He isn't against left, he is all for balance between left and right saying society needs both sides to make policies such that it's benefitial for everyone. He himself is classic liberal (which is basically in the middle) - He doesn't put HR employees, liberals and university administration people as a group in marxist category. - He doesn't say that all hierarchies are good because animals have hierarchies - basically everytime he talks about that, he stresses that they should be just, effective and people shouldn't get stuck at bottom with no chance of going up. (So no, monarchy isn't that great) - He isn't against social progress of women or minorities (he is definetly for equal rights and opportunities to say the least)"

"@16:54 The video states post-modernism claims there is no grand narrative about humanity. Yet, shortly before this, the video stated that Foucault looked at history as simply a shifting from one power structure to another. Couldn't we say then that post-modernism does in fact posit a narrative, one of power? This is essentially Peterson's claim. Marxism then is nested inside PM as it reduced the power to economic class struggle. PM just takes a broader view (another JP claim).   I'll keep watching the video, but so far I don't really see you explaining how JP is wrong to link Marxism and PM together. The fact that Marxists and SJWs disagree doesn't refute JP's claim. Both factions are playing a power game. They just don't like the way the other side draws the boundaries. They have a Post-modern philosophy at their core.  The part about tension between different types of feminists: They share the common goal of changing the current system (i.e. the Patriarchy). They really just disagree about how to go about it. Destroy the category altogether OR keep the hierarchy but switch it to a Matriarchy. So again, when JP points out that modern feminism seeks to destroy the current social order, he's correct."
"Very nice response to JBP. Thanks. However, do elaborate on Marxist concern for 'human progress, science and liberty'. I mean, I would appreciate if you could point me at something better than Communist Party Manifesto, because we know how that turned out."

"There are 2 points I have issue with here: you state that indentity politics advocates for minorities, but it's not purely advocation. Secondly you acknowledge that the left doesn't really accept opposing points. When you couple these points, the left only allows for furthering of the left. So whilst it is a rabble, and not an organised movement, its an ideaology that doesn't accept alternatives. This is the main concern, that we're getting a ball rolling in a direction that it won't stop. This is why fundamentally, identity politics is a bad idea. Its not a game that pans out well. Minorities will benefit the most from progress, and progress will happen the more we can facilitate conversation and discussion. I do agree that making a generalisation that most won't immediately understand thoroughly (use of the term post modern neo Marxism), isn't necessarily giving an accurate description of the nuances of the left, but it is mainly correct. It gives the right information: the left is a self fueling idea that doesn't facilitate alternatives. Loved the video, thank you"

"Hi there. I don't like him because he is has talent as a public speaker or because of his engagement in life coaching. I enjoy Jordan Peterson because he is (at least for the most part) clear, honest, and authentic in his ideas and how he presents himself. He is accessible, reliable, and conscientious as a conversation partner, and genuinely interested in exchanging opinions … not in converting people. If you hate Peterson just because you think he is part of 'the other team' you are missing out on one of the most interesting and influential contributors to the current PC discourse. You don't have to love him or become a fan boy/girl/in-between but if you are open minded enough go check out his lectures on religion. They are an intriguing blend of old and new ideas. Cheers."

"This was absolutely brilliant! Best response to Peterson I have seen - cool headed, witty and informing. thank you!!"
"Excellent video. Very informative and entertaining. I must admit that I like Jordan Peterson a lot. But for me there are two sides of him. One side is his work as a professor and clinical psychologist. And then there is the side of his kinda crusade against left and what he calls the postmodernist neo-marxism ideology. I enjoy very much watching his lectures about psychology, philosophy, mythology and things like that. I resonate with his perspective and point of view when his is focus talking about those topics. But the time I've watched him in interviews and debates about his view about the left and posmodern ideology and identity politics I really feel disappointment. When he goes that route I realize that he's just another turd in the punch bowl. That's why I rather keep watching the videos and reading whatever he writes about the topics a mentioned I liked his point of view. At the end it doesn't matter. To be honest and without any intention to offend anybody, for me the right and the left (and everything labels stand for) is the same shit. Maybe they're not the same in their core ideas but in attitude and the way people overreact to any stupid issue both sides are the same. The alt-right, the SJW, conservatives, liberals, progressives, klingons, vulcans... all is the same shit. Monkeys throwing crap to each other, no more and no less...  Nice video as I said."
"Technically speaking, the closest alternative to 'Western' philosophy would be basically anything deriving from Abu Hamid Al-Aghazali, who is probably the most significant philosopher in history to formulate a counterargument directly against Western philosophy, and given how deeply intertwined his thought has become with modern orthodox Islam, Peterson and his compatriots DO kind of end up arguing in specific defense of 'the West' when they confront things like Islamic Theocracy and what has been termed 'Sharia Law.'  That bit is specifically and explicitly anti-Western.  It's not the only thing that split the world of Islamic academia from the European one (the Crusades kind of had a lot to do with that - turns out that when a bunch of dudes with swords and hard-ons for violence fuck up your home for a hundred years, it becomes difficult to maintain scholarly traditions like you would see in early Islamic Arabia), it sure didn't help.  Legitimately Eastern philosophy tends to be more orthogonal to Western Philosophy than strictly opposed.  The biggest difference there is that it construes things in less of a dialectical, opposed, winner-take-all structure.  When it comes down to the actual arguments, there's not THAT much difference once you get to the conclusions.  Ironically, possibly the most significant difference is a deeply ingrained notion of social hierarchy that encourages what critics like Peterson would refer to as 'collectivism.'  The sort of hierarchy that a postmodern critic would want to reject.  That said, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Jean Baudrillard can all suck every fart out of my asshole.  They have been directly responsible for more stupidity than fetal alcohol syndrome and the world would have been better off if all three had been born mute and limbless.  Their rejection of fundamental logic and objective reality as some sort of 'grand narrative' is the foundation that the very worst, most damaging elements 'the left' can contribute to discourse uses as its bedrock.  They are, collectively speaking, a gigantic duodenum that extrudes science denial  In that same vein, Richard Rorty is worse than Hitler.  He's not cited quite as often when it comes to science denial as the Frenchmen, but it's mostly because they have better brand recognition.  He's just as bad as them, if not worse.  The 'vocabulary' of science IS closer to reality, you ironist knob, and any argument you ever made in the vague direction of 'pragmatism' only filches the word to misapply it and completely misunderstand its meaning.  Like the worst postmodern theorists do with all those science words.  For chrissakes, even Chomsky agrees with Sokal and Bricmont when it comes to your idiotic misappropriation of scientific and mathematical terminology - I'm looking at you, Lacan.  I should probably stop yelling at dead people.  Doesn't seem healthy.    Anyway, yeah - fundamentally bad philosopher in a lot of ways.  You should find ones that don't explicitly endorse science denial.  It's fluffed up idiots like him that present the greatest threats to the broader left in trying to divorce it from the very notion of objective reality or functional epistemology."
"this video is fucking amazing"
"Right so. You're asking why corporations are into the whole 'diversity' thing, and all about immigration, which makes them seem left wing.   The answer being, that while marxist professors tend to genuinely believe in what they're saying, coporporations, unsurprisingly, are all about the profit. The more people you bring over to your country, the higher the supply, the more you can lower the price of labour, therefore reducing their labour costs and ALSO it increases the amount of consumers that can buy their products. Companies are always to expand, and earn more and more money - not necessarily a bad thing - but in their minds, if they are diverse enough and represent the public, they are presenting an image that is more accesible to a larger group of people that will therefore want to buy the product. So yeah, they all fall under the same category of progressive thought."
"Every joke in this video is the same, and it's 'haha wouldn't it be funny if people had secks'"
"I don't know if anyone cares, but J.P. goes over a lot of your criticisms of the concept 'postmodern neo-marxism' in his video *Modern Times: Camille Paglia & Jordan B Peterson*. He even points out the fact that postmodern philosophy contradicts the basic principles of Marxism, yet he observes that these modes of thought are somehow tied together. Whether you agree with his conclusions or not, it's very informative as to what the hell he's talking about."
"This is gold. Can’t wait to dig into more of your videos."
"You seem like a whole bunch of fun to hang out with purely based on the opening sketch"
"I liked the video; you have a great sense of humour and timing. I do want to go over some points you've made though. First off, I would like to say I am not a Jordan Peterson 'fan' but I have listened to many of his talks, as I have listened to many talks from many perspectives and people. This is long af so I’ll leave a TL;DR here:"
"TL;DR: Jordan Peterson stood against the Canadian bill c-16 because it involved compelled speech as law not because he hates trans people or thinks they shouldn’t have protection under the law (which they already have in Canada without this bill). Second, Peterson helps people as a counsellor and life coach; it is not a “Trojan horse” to his political agenda. Peterson claims that identity politics is neo –Marxist (which it is) and that the far left intend to deconstruct our current society (which they do). That is why he claims “trans-activists” are similar to Mao, because the same philosophy guiding them is the same: Marxist. I disagree with your implied accusation of intellectual dishonesty from Peterson in the construction of his arguments, but I do agree that Peterson’s “lobster” point was under developed and explained poorly, lacking context to what he meant by it exactly. Yes, the “West” is a real thing, it is the world’s experiment of capitalism and freedom. It was founded on specific principals that have since been deemed “Western” principals of diversity, freedom, and individualism. The founders came from Judeo-Christian cultures, upbringings, and beliefs, even if they themselves were not of those faiths, and they used many values they had learned to establish a foundation of law for the new country.  The ideological leftists are Postmodernists, and they do use neo-Marxism to accomplish it through identity politics, which includes intersectionality and the victim class predicated on oppressor and oppressed. Finally, Peterson is not a Conservative, he is a liberal, he has stated so many times. He does not use the bible as a support to his arguments. His idea is that the bible and its old stories contain knowledge and information about being human. He then takes these scriptures and examines them through philosophy and psychology to uncover universal truths about purpose and self-fulfillment in life. He then uses these in a modern and secular way, to help people find purpose and self-fulfillment in their lives."
"Jordan Peterson is such a douche. I love the video, 10/10."
"You're a fucking godsend."
"Noooooo, not the Lobster Queeeeeen! D:"
"Great video! Love the humor. Gonna have to push back on the whole lefties don’t call for the wholesale abolition of hierarchies, cuz I totally see that sentiment among the left or large pockets of it.  I really like you pointing out that Marxism and post modernism are part of the West."
"Quite delighted to stumble across this weird-clever-funny channel. Nice to see that Peterson's sophistry hasn't seduced everyone on Youtube."
"You can have me if you like? I mean an (ex? I dunno tbh) alcoholic and ex junkie-what could go wrong? On a more serious side-you know how to say what you want to say rather than hype. Keep it going!!!!"
"So you can't critique anybody who's a moron because a third party might get hurt, hahahahaha, okay now, byebye."
"THE END HAS ME SCREAMING"
"Don't lobsters fight each other for status? This is the point people like Peterson would like to obscure,  there is concrete physical violence that goes into the establishing and maintenance of hierarchies.  If you accept that then you have no reason to bemoan people who seek to violently overthrow existing hierarchies. There is no magical 'natural hierarchy' that asserts itself without force and I find it odd that 'might is right' comes with a lot of unstated expectations of fair play and exceptions. The ants ganging up on the frog is no less 'natural' than when the frog eats an ant.  According to 'might is right' the violence of the weak is right if it succeeds.  People like Peterson bemoan violence, but not the violence needed to maintain the current order, because they imagine a pre-ordained natural order, and furthermore assume the current state of things to be an expression of that.   On a less serious note: When women suffer discrimination its cuz on natural hierarchy and not sexism, but when incels cant get laid its cuz of feminism and not natural hierarchy.   Also, I would love to ask anyone who extols the virtues of 'natural hierarchies' where in that hierarchy they see themselves, and laugh loudly when the soft, timid middle class boy responds with something else than rock bottom."
"I see hardly any problems with not caring about the contradictory idiotic factions inside leftism. Criticising JBP while using the silly leftist categories as the patriarchy isn't gonna do either as he not only does he refuse to accept those ideas, but does a pretty stellar job debunking them."
"Your point at the end about transpeople being individualist and wanting to be called by pronouns of their choosing; You are looking at the issue through tunnel vision.  You make sound as though only the transpeople have right to be individualist and not the other people. The other people too are individuals who want the right the accept or deny the request from transpeople about their preferred pronouns.  What irritates me and other is the some transpeople only see themselves as individuals and want to cast all others together(collectivism) into agreeing with their terms. They then subsequently paints themselves as victims and get the govt involved. Again, that's just shitty behaviour.  At the end of the day, both sides are acting like cunts. Trannies get people fired for not calling them xe and people call them it or he on purpose to hurt their feelings."
"I'd hate fuck her"
"This is irrelevant but what pronouns does contra go by? I remember the video where he came out as gender queer and in it he said he'll go by either he or she, but in it he also said he's not planning on taking any hormones and wants to keep his masculine traits, and clearly things have changed, so idk"
"This is the best and most enjoyable JP critique I've heard, thank you. So many wonderful lines too...great writing."
"I really like this video, but there are some objective mistruths that have been put forward in it."
"You're amazing. Loved this."
"This lady really doesn't know what the left says... she has a really biased view of the goals and actual depth of demands."
"The poison of postmodernist thinking Well Natalie, I think you dont see the danger of the PM-Neomarxism, which is alarming JBP. I think his analysation is correct, it is like a cancer, cause it destroys the foundations of our societies : self responsability, honor for work and achivements, the canon of good goals, expression of uniqueness, striving for the best, seeing yourself as a needed contribution for society.   Equity is a process to level down, not up. The PM's offer a poisenous remedy : nihilism, relativism, equity on a very low level, we already know from kommunism, identity nonsense, victimhood, which is the most destructive aspect, but all of them are very attractive sweet, poisons, people are eagerly drinking all though they are destroing their self respect, their dignity, their ability to deliver and at the end, society itself. Sounds a bit dark, but is'nt."
"Why is Jordans head so small?"
"Funny as hell!!! XD Grate job (y)  PS: Stalin did nothing ring and the kulaks deserved it ;)"
"Does it ever occured to someone maybe Nazis were right on the cultural bolchevism stuff or are we using the 'Nazis said it so it's wrong' aproach."
"Only 300k views for such high-quality content ? Jesus.  I'm sold. Subbed !"
"Brilliant! Keep up the good work!"
"I owe you an apology! When the progressive YouTube left started to smear Jordan Peterson. I couldn't believe how viciously they were misrepresenting his arguments. The same counts for the IDW. The coverage has often been too simplistic and intellectually dishonest.   So there I was. Responding dismissive towards you when our beloved music guru Anthony Fantano linked to this video. And honestly? Shame on me. Because I didn't even watch the video until now.   My (simplistic) response was based on your talk with Michael of the Majority Report. Now. Don't get me wrong. I have learned a lot from Sam & Michael over the years. But when it comes to Peterson & the IDW. They smear to often without nuance. I felt that you were just going along with Michael his talking points.   Then I saw your talk with Roaming Millenial. A high-quality conversation between two who might not agree on many things, but are exchanging ideas. (Which, if we keep it real, is kind of what the intellectual dark web is all about.) I just don't see progressives actually debating their viewpoints with people they do not agree with. Except for the occasional Daddy Rogan appearance.   In your conversation with roaming millennial, you were making well put together, balanced, intellectually honest points. And so I decided to watch this video. And look and behold. I completely agree with you! I have personally never been a fan of Peterson his constant marxism/postmodernist complaining. And he talks about it too much and with an annoying frustration, anger, and little nuance.   I just love his lectures on psychology, Jung, the shadow self, archetypes/hierarchies, psilocybin/psychedelic, introverts vs extraverts and so on. But most of all I am a fan of his (self-authoring) writing program. It is really well put together and is the foundation of what made me respect him about a year ago.   With all of that being said. I apologize 🙏 Clearly. Dismissing you, based on one conversation was a bad call on my behave. This is a great video with very well put together points."
"@2:06 Channel 4 actually, not BBC. But close enough."
"First of all, brilliant video. Hilarious and insightful (and the first of yours I've watched).  So I really wanted to pick up on your point about JPs motivations. You point out that, due to his rhetorical style, it's really hard to determine exactly what his beliefs are. And, therefore, people often extrapolate as they please and put him at whatever point on whatever political line they fancy,  Now, I've watched a decent amount of his stuff (~30 hours or more), and I've read a bit of 12 Rules. And, as far as I can determine, he may not actually have a grand active political agenda (at least not one he wants to push forward and be associated with).  The main issue he seems to have, in political terms, is that certain mainstream, or at least powerful, stances are blocking our ability to have real discussions about how to proceed. It feels like he's worried that certain ideas have become accepted by default without a lot of discussion of validity, e.g. the 70+ alternative-gender descriptors (or whatever you'd call it), their purpose, and long term consequences. And it seems to be a good thing to discuss. The discussions might lead back to the same conclusion, but how do you know if something is valid without engaging in discussions around it that bring in many different points of view?  The funny thing is that his style, i.e. not being forthcoming about what exactly his political agenda is, means that people are assuming that he definitely must have one and, since he's not being forthcoming, he must be some crypto-fascist trying to subliminally plant ideas into peoples' minds. But it could be the case that he simply sees an issue with an idea and is trying to use his understanding of people and history to break the idea apart and modify the course of discussion. Again, this seems like a very valid thing to do, considering what's at stake.  -------  Lastly, I'd really like to take issue with your closing points, and it's something that I think is misinterpreted and perhaps misunderstood widely within this whole 'What the fuck does Jordan Peterson believe?' conversation.  The issue JP had with the alternative pronoun law in Canada wasn't that he was completely against the pronouns, it was that he believes that a citizen should never be forced by law to use any specific word in any specific occasion. And doesn't that seem completely reasonable?  Take the logic of that law and extend it really really far and you get to the kind of conclusions (e.g. the gender pronoun law leads to totalitarianism) that JP brought up. And sure, it's taking things to really extreme levels to make a point, but that's the point. The point of liberty is that any attack against it may have long term, far off consequences that are really hard to foresee, and for which the magnitude is hard to determine.  Forcing people to use a very specific word, deemed necessary by a minority of human beings is definitely against the idea of individual liberty.  Asking someone to use your personal pronoun and then them telling you to fuck off is no attack against your individual liberty.  When we start granting special rights to a minority of people, where does it stop? How do we determine what the limits and boundaries are? How do we work out the effects in the long term? When do we have the discussions to understand how we got to this point in the first place and if there are better solutions than an alternative use of language?  And this is why I think it's important to have JP around. I don't fully agree with his probable stances, but I'm very glad that someone is stirring up a very toxic and ridiculous pot that's been left to brew alone for far too long.  -----  Thank you again for this video. I think the discussion is important and necessary and we need all sides to have input. Especially from people who actually understand the human and historical context. Xx"

"1) 'The problem is that no one has said that every hierarchy is the product of western patriarchy.'  Maybe, but one's that are considered 'western patriarchal' seem to make as much sense as those that aren't.  2) Marxism isn't concerned with human progress. It is concerned with social progress."
"I find it's weird that you never talked about his point of freedom of speech, it is essential to his arguments, and that was the main reason he rejected the Canadian pronounce legislation. The “”west” topic is a bit weird, JP never stated it's something to contrast with the east, there is nothing to do with geographic boundary in his argument, in fact he was saying it's a problem the west created by itself, he did say something like the west is always trying to examine and challenge its own traditions and hierarchies, it's the advantage of the west because it's creative and renew old structures, but sometimes it can become extreme hence 'undermine itself'."

"Great video! I also think it's funny that JP would refer to these yout's with their identity politics as being 'postmodern.' Postmodernism is more something that influenced people in my generation (Gen X) and when I converse with some of the yout's I'm surprised how unfamiliar they are with these (postmodern) ideas, how much their sensibilities differ from mine, and how what they are saying really speaks to grand narratives (either learned from outdated education or newly constructed)... bearing similarity to modernism. My generations sought to dissolve borders and, maybe in rebellion to their parents, the current generation keeps constructing new ones... and its in that sense that their philosophy appears 'regressive' to us.  A simple way to characterize JP is that he's a dilettante. He's a Psyche professor, which is his expertise. The dude needs to stay in his expertise. Because somewhere along the line, he started giving these monologues about stuff he doesn't know about. And by 'doesn't know' I mean he hasn't put in the time, as scholar-experts do, to go through a systematic review of literature combined with discoursing with OTHERS who have conversations about a topic. Maybe it was because YT came along, and though most of the people doing it were much younger and unestablished in teaching positions, he decided to try out the whole 'vlog' thing. So he starts doing this whole amateur. dilettante shit, falling into the trap of applying his Psych perspective to fields where it has no business and where the people in those fields have debunked it (or at least have been having a conversation for a very long time about the limitations of that perspective)."

"I would take issue with the idea that there is no continuity between so-called postmodern (or post-structuralist) philosophy and neo-Marxist critical theory, which many reviewers point out. but this this fracture line, which has an empirical basis,  is actually very good 17:13"
"OK I GET IT whenever Jordan speaks of post modern marxist... he's really  speaking about humanists.  however, he doesn't want to attack humanists  head on so he creates the word salad post modern Marxists.  it all  makes sense now.  I'd also add that jordan does not want to attack civil rights head on.   so, he attacks whatever faults that appeals to his neandrathal followers  he could find inherent when civil rights is applied such as suppression  of hate speech and protection of minority groups. therefore, he lumps  people who support civil rights into the post modern marxist group."
"why JPB is bullshitter, part one: at 8:59... he says 'communitarian' communitarianism is an anti-liberal CONSERVATIVE position adopted by Catholics and neo-Aristoteleans like A. MacIntyre. what JBP means is collectivist, which is left wing. communitarians are actually pro-family, tend to be socially conservative, and tend to uphold 'traditional values.'"

"I praised Peterson's works when they helped me improve myself (slightly personal note: I was really close to just giving up before I read his book) but yeah I zoned out of his political side when I realized it's the same spiel, given I agree with a lot of his points. (specifically about how the RADICAL, not common leftists just use oppression, victimhood and all those other stuff as a weapon and not as problems that need to be stomped flat) More power to the man in regards to his self help stuff and his psychology stuff (those are actually cool to watch when you have time to spend) but he may wanna ease off on the political spinning"
"Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I think you dismiss Peterson's analysis of postmodern neo-Marxism too glibly, without really engaging the arguments or evidence.  If you are really intereted in these issues, you might find a couple of other people's thoughts on the matter enlightening.    Stephen Hicks is a philosopher who studies postmodernism.  His analysis seems to line up with Peterson's quite well: https://youtu.be/-BGbHG63x8w  Bret Weinstein is a far-left Progressive (he and his wife were run out of Evergreen by the radical left).  His analysis of what is going on also seems consistent with Peterson's analysis.  For example: https://youtu.be/bz0oxIZ3xIg  Also, I think you are mistaken in how widespread this is.  It doesn't seem to be contained to a small backwater of academia.  Here Bret Weinstein argues the problem is worse than people think, and spreading into the larger society: https://youtu.be/Q9mkA1GBY2k"
"LOL.I want to have a beer with you."
"Unfortunately this generation is not well informed about history and the multitude of ways governments have tried to take over. Therefore any statement about government oppression becomes a conspiracy. Governments have been trying to take over the people for centuries upon centuries, and with the modern age along with the development of psychology and sociology, there will be new devious yet silent ways to take over a society. With the indoctrination of universities, takeover of media, introduction of political correctness, social justice, hollywood, etc it is easy to tell what governments are trying to do. In fact there are very similar ties between maoists (and their 'cultural revolution')and the radical left."

I am mildly incompetent with navigating betwixt email and YouTube ...so..apologies for not responding earlier..apologies also for not responding at such generous length. So....neither JBP nor anyone else knows for sure that the dodgy matter of principle might lead to jail time, so JBP is scaremongering. First reply to that is ....the legal dept of JBP's University cautioned him otherwise. Longer account of the legally real (albeit protracted and subject to refinement via case law) path to jail more competently argued by JBP than myself. Second thing..let's say for sake of argument that C16 is NOT really backed up by the dread might of the Canadian government. In which case...it is what? Just a convenient vehicle by which Canadian govt. can express some very proper and decent sentiments? Is LAW really the best place to advertise this very proper sentiment? Does not LAW already recognise the concept of bullying and harassment? My feeling would be...' Beware folk offering to sell you stuff that you already own cos they are likely wrong uns up to no good'? I would welcome no addition to law that attempted to specifically protect any particular identity politics characteristic of my ( despised by many) identity. I expect protection qua human being already explicit in law. The issue of good manners IS very important. There are horrible hateful people out there. Left leaning people have no monopoly on a responsibility to stand up to them. Right leaning people can ( we have all seen comments sections) be very unpleasant, for which I offer no apology. But I also counsel earnestly against assuming they must be some ill conceived word ending in IST...as does contrapoints. Fair play to contrapoints."
"ContraPoints: “[Peterson] uses the term “postmodern neomarxism” to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force bent on destroying Western civilization […]” Nope. He doesn’t. Far from talking about a unified left, he describes only the far left this way."
"Fantastic point being made at 20:30 . subbed!"
"Peterson isn't just trying to protect western values. Hes trying to defend the enormous advantages and wealth we have all gotten from capitalism and industiral revolution. While Marxist countries in their attempt to get rid of inequaity and the bourgeosie, killed and and used force to try and make people equal and fit into the mold they wanted. One of the famous results were how millions of ukrainians starved because a bunch of left wing intellectuals told the poor that the successful farmers were successful in spite of the poor. So they killed them and took their land and everyone starved because the people who killed the farmers werent succesful farmers because they couldnt farm. Which is why capitalism is effecient and effective. Those rich farmers did well because they did a good job. ANd they fed alot of people. People in communist countries were still struggling to eat while western countries and capitalism had virtually eliminated famine and starvation for the poor. Which had never been done before."
"The invocation of power dynamics is either explicitly or implicitly used by all the different 'types' of liberals and is why jordan bunches them under post-modernism. The identity politics today that are used by the left are all based on power. Just because all these liberals disagree, doesn't mean they don't have some base presuppositions and ideals among them."
"peterson has gotten letters from trans people opposing bill c 16. And tbh its pretty presumptous for the people who made that bill who were largley not even trans to say they know what the trans 'community' wants. And then lie saying Trans people arent already protected under those laws."
"Peterson is so harsh because a couple years ago he suddenly realized that an institution that he loved and worked in and for most of his life and worked so hard to improve has been taken over by virtually all leftwing, progressives/marxists. And that they were affecting science and spilling into the real world. And basically turned the humanities and arts into an indoctrination camp. With no representation of other political views."
"ContraPoints, I love you. That is all. Thank you."
"LOL peterson is scared of mixed racial identities. White is a mixed racial identity in that of itself."
"😂"
"Hey. JP homedog here. I can say proudly I have my room in order. My house is still in the great battle between order and chaos, though. Yes, I am speaking figuratively.  Thanks for articulating things I sort of knew, but could not place in such logical lines as yourself. Thanks for making me think more deeply and logically about these issues. I still have ten minutes to go, but I am really glad to have found your channel.   My intellectual side is stimulated and you made me laugh quite a bit. New subscriber, who will be pondering on all this for a long time, possibly."
"17:17 you are explaining his Idea of neo Marxism wrong. The point is Marx said that the class system will overtime ultimatetly shrink down to 2 classes. And there comes the reference to modern day. The modern left call everything Nazi or Racist right of them, so the variety of public opinions shrink down only to 2 classes in their view. So its non-sensical if you put up a strawmen about his definitions without using his definition and instead using your own. 21:20 No he is not suggesting that, he is suggesting that women make different decissions on average than men, and there comes the result. 22:10 again you misrepresented a point. The point was made, if there is something sexist or racist in govermental structures, the people should pin point that, and the common answer of the left was, these things are social constructs, where peterson says hierachical structures come already from within the nature. 22:24 Now you re using broad terms, and which gender hierachical or race hierachical structure is in place? You re doing the very thing, you say Peterson does, Saying something which sounds fine for most people but not being too accurat when it comes down to it. 23:44 What ? Peterson says the west is build around individuality and those leftist type are standing to oppose it by making politics based on gender and race. The the very opposide what you claim here. You are saying things here Peterson never said and just assume everybody takes it.  I stop here. I came from the reddit AMA hoped for some good criticism , which had some really good critical questions, as he offers enough room for criticism as his religious definition, but this is a let down :("
"As a 39 year old woman born a female, I can say that I do not think Peterson wants to silence woman and put them back in the home, for example. I resonate with some of what he says, minus all the speculation on postmodern neo-Marxism. I can't say where this all fits in but I can speak from anecdotal experience. I grew up not feeling oppressed. I always had this mentality that, I can do anything you can do better, I can do anything better than you!' 😋 It's like this reversal has happened. I am educated (mjr poly sci in intl pol, mnr in psychology and then RN) and I worked as a nurse for 8-10 years until I decided to stay home with my young children (first 5 years are so crucial). I feel torn for this desire to work and make my own money with wanting to be there for my kids and being involved in their lives. I also feel conflicted that as a woman, I feel pressure to work. So two things, I kind of want to work yet I also feel pressure to work (self imposed/society). There are some woman who work because they have to and some who stay home because it's actually cheaper (due to childcare) to be at home. Then there are those who choose not to work. With feminism, woman entered the workforce and some slowly moved into higher positions. To me, I think that is progress. However, I think some of us are paying a price in terms of that some of us feel expected to work for various reasons. To me feminism should be woman should feel free to do what they want without societal pressure or disapproval. Of course real life takes place, and if in a relationship and have a family, a woman staying home or working should be an equal discussion between her and her partner. I also believe many woman (not all because individually we are so different-not every male or female can or wants to be, say, a CEO of a company), are torn like I am. So what is going on here, what is happening, and why is it happening? I think Peterson is answering or making sense of, through various sources of information, those questions and perhaps other questions that try to make sense of the world. I do not believe he wants to oppress woman, or any other group for that matter. He's an academic. He lives in the world of thought and ideas to explain phenomenon in the world we live in. Perhaps his values ie) freedom of speech and democracy, feel threatened and like anyone else is trying to protect and uphold those values. ♥️ I also feel he deals with many different issues in his talks but they are being lumped together, and hence the confusion. Just some thoughts."
"It is insanely frustrating to see an intelligent person construct such an bad argument, and to then not be called out in the comments.  I hope someone else has deconstructed the non-consequential argument given by the speaker.  I will add another argument here.  First of all, the speaker seems to agree with most of Peterson's personal advice, but dismisses it as unimportant.  The speaker seems to save most ammunition for a supposed take-down of the term Postmodern neo marxism.  The speaker applies a well worn leftist rhetoric to attempt this.  1.  Define the terms - NOT as Peterson says them, applies them or means them, but define the terms in narrow ways which the speaker insists by fiat are the correct succinct definitions.  It is pretty clear the speaker looks closely at the terms Postmodern Neo Marxism not to understand Peterson or get what he is saying, but in an attempt to discredit him. 2.  Argue against the terms as defined by self - Once the speaker has defined Peterson's message not as Peterson intends it, but as the speaker insists by fiat it must mean, present an argument that the terms as the speaker has defined them have an internal contradiction. 3.  Appeal to the audience - The Speaker then appeals to everyone to side with the speaker to recognize the solidness of the speaker's argument, forgetting that the speaker was NOT arguing against the words as defined by Peterson, but as the words defined by the Speaker.  This is a particularly ignorant way of arguing.  I repeat, the speaker attacks this phrase, Postmodern Neo Marxism, NOT to try to understand Peterson - but to discredit.  So following some logic and rhetorical honesty here:  1.  Peterson did not say , Marxism.  The speaker made a grotesque rhetorical mistake(which given the Speaker's obvious intelligence, one could construe as a deliberate lie ) when the speaker substituted a succinct definition of Marxism for the term Neo Marxism.  Neo Marxism does not have the constrained definition of Marxism and is much broader term referring to much beyond class struggle and economics. 2.  The Speaker tries to narrow as much as possible the broad term Postmodern for the express purpose of presenting a NULL Venn diagram which really does not exist. 3.  The Speaker's argument seems to rest upon the Speaker's wrong perception that the Speaker's narrow definition allow no overlap of these terms.  As if people who subscribe to Postmodernism CANNOT be Neo Marxists. 4.  In reality all the Speaker has shown is that the two narrow (and because of the substitution of Marxism for Neo marxism) ultimately incorrect definitions for Postmodernism and Neo Marxism have very little overlap. 5.  It is obvious that Peterson DOES NOT think Postmodernism is the SAME THING as NeoMarxism, otherwise there is no reason to pair the two together to make a new term. 6.  If the Speaker has ever heard Peterson talk for any length, the intelligence of the Speaker should lead the speaker to realize that Peterson is highlighting the nihilism of Postmodernism and combining it with the emphasis of the collective over the individual of marxism. 7.  It is this really disturbing philosophy --- a philosophy which uses the idea from Neo Marxism to undercut the value of the individual by only looking at the value of the group ---- combined with the skepticism of postmodernism to undercut the idea of the divine worth of the individual --- that Peterson finds pernicious and destructive.  Peterson is all about reclaiming the idea of the IMPORTANCE and DIGNITY of the individual.  The term Postmodern neomarxist does a good job of defining Peterson's opponents who are putting forth the idea that tries to destroy the value of the individual. QED."

"i mean, he is a fascist"
"Great video!  I'm a fan of yours and JP's so I was excited to finally get a chance to sit down and watch it.  I think you may have misinterpreted three things though.  I'll list them in order, but I also think it's from most debatable to least.  JP's criticism of transactivism is always in the context of C17, i.e. compelled speech.  As I'm sure you've seen elsewhere, he doesn't take any umbrage with transgender folks or their rights.  Neo-Marxism is not just 'Marxism, again'  It's the assumption that Marx missed the mark when he put the class struggle in capitalistic terms, but everything else he described is true.  That is to say, a Neo-Marxist will identify the powerful and the powerless not by their wealth/means of production, but by 'new' denominations.  So the idea that white folks oppress PoC, men oppress women, cis oppress trans, etc...  That's Neo-Marxism.  Marxists assume the rich oppress the poor, by virtue of being rich and poor.  Neo-Marxists assume the majority demographic oppresses the minority demographic, just by virtue of being those demographics.  Lastly... identity politics has nothing to do with advocacy.  Identity politics is the assumption that those with like-identities will have like-politics.  So when white people assume that every Hispanic American's chief political concern is immigration (which is a common assumption and a patently false one) they are practicing 'identity politics.'   I will say, contrary to JP's assertions, that identity politics are not confined to the left.  The right does it about immigrants, Muslims, and 'true' Americans all the time."

I don't care much for his attempt to link it to an higher power, and care much less about him trying to tie it to Christianity specifically.  I cringe everytime but I got to admit it is the best argument for religion I have seen in a long while. He straight up methophor-rized the entire thing."
"I think you've explained this better than anyone I've heard so far, simply because you're able to speak in terms a philosophobe  like me can enjoy and understand. Thanks, you have a new fan!"

"You made your first mistake when you launched into an analysis of what Peterson is trying to push politically, this it a transparent attempt to pigeon hole him into some category you've defined and then straw man his arguments to death. His messages have been quite reliably apolitical, I've seen about 200 hours of his UofT lectures and speeches, and saw the guy live in London a few weeks ago. And to say that he's Trojan horsing politics is to basically attack motives, which you can't know. You can only accuse. All the evidence shows that he's against authoritarianism across the board both on the left and the right, that people tend vote their temperament and that's in part biological and hence discussion between both sides is required, society is a dialogue. Which is why he's against mandated speech laws like the interpretation of Bill C-16 that was confirmed by the Canadian human rights committee.  The main reason he appears to have any kind of political motivation is because he's observed the facts about the state of the universities and society in general. So he'll say something reasonable like the left and the right should have an open discussion about ideas, but you'll note the left wing shows up to beat drums, smash windows and interrupt his speaking events on campus and other places. That the left is attempting to control language through amendments to law like C16 and is constantly no platforming conservative speakers on college campuses.  When you have a society that's divided politically in large part due to their temperament then each side needs to be represented otherwise they're just being suppressed and that fosters discontent and then that results in backlash, and it's what the left has done and has been doing for decades now. Trump was that backlash in America because guess what, people were sick of the PC police and so voted in someone who wasn't afraid to just say what is on his mind. In UK we voted to leave EU as a backlash because here we have the same thing, the left beat the drum of multicultralism and accuse anyone remotely concerned about borders and immigration as racist and for decades those people were quiet, until suddenly the silent majority wasn't silent anymore. Proving that silencing people through these means doesn't actually work, it just appears to work, you just drive the problem underground where it fosters and then bites you on the ass. Either way the point is a neutral message of 'people on the left and right should talk' turns into one which looks skewed when one side of political landscape is doing absolutely everything in its power to prevent that.  This is the reality the left wont face up to, in this endless tirade for rights for everyone, this 'me me me' culture where everyone deserves everything because - reasons - the left has lost all perspective about how tilted the current system is. We have conservatives in power in both the UK and the US and we're still tilted to the left because the whole overton window has been moved so far left that even saying there should be discussion between the 2 groups as seen as extreme. We're in the period of the backswing and the pendulum will go the other way and what the left doesn't understand is that 1) It's inevitable and no amount Orwellian control will stop it. 2) The backswing will proportional to how far you've taken things. So if you continue on this path of extremism that's what you'll get in return and that's why we've seen the rise of the far right in Europe, it's reactionary and it's proportional. Just in the same way that people fed bottomless pit of rights and entitlements are now starved of a message about responsibility and picking up a heavy load and carrying it best you can, Peterson is providing that and people are lapping it up. And it's NOT political, it's a personal message to the individual about how they can better their own lives, WITHOUT mucking about the political structure at all, and that in fact if you can't even get the things local to your life sorted out, you'd probably make a mess of something vastly more complex like the political system.  And yes labels are messy and people often label themselves and something like a post-modernist or marxist and it means different things to different people. Peterson actually spends a lot of time identifying the people he's critiquing so instead of taking a word like post-modern neo marxism and defining it how you see fit and then straw manning his position. Because semantic arguments are boring as fuck.  *edit*  Oh and the 'west' that Peterson is referring to is the observable fact that when you consider all of human advancement over the biological history of humans as a species, that there's no better place on the planet at any time than the west right now, that we've done something right to get to the top, and that we have a stable functioning society that not only takes care of basically everyone but is also still rapidly improving basically across the board. And that critique of that should be done carefully because right now the only place you can make comparisons to are HYPOTHETICAL perfect societies which we have no idea if they'd actually work and mountains of evidence that when they've been tried before using the same presuppositions and ideology lead to untold suffering and death. Facts that aren't even taught to most students at school, instead they're taught the current structure is oppressive and bad, a position that can only seriously be held by people who are literally the most entitled generation of people in the entire history of civilization. You only get such people when you've fed them their entire lives and endless string of rights and free things."

"Marxism and Post Modernism are actually doing the same thing underneath the surface of narrative. Yes, both are opposed in that one presented a clear narrative of power and class struggles where the other simply broke apart narratives. This being said both need to assume that the power to shape 'narratives' or organize the world lies in the waking or conscious awareness of man. Therefor, Marx presumed we made the power structures and thus can change them and Post Modernisms believes there are no narrative since we made them. The opposite thus comes in those who suggest there are 'narratives' or ways in which the world gets organized that are not conscious to us because they are either subconscious (Freud and Jung) or innate/natural (Nietzsche and Sartre).   This is why he would say the patriarchy does not exist, not because women don't have hardships, but because they are not designed by men. They simply are part of nature. Thus the question that cleaves these two side apart is not left or right, it's not feminist or sexist, its at it's core the question of do we shape our own reality consciously? Peterson and those on his side would argue no, you do not and they Post Modernist Neomarxists (as he puts it) are in the vain of that we do construct it and thus can alter it."

"As a Peterson fan, I would love it if you were able to debate him. Would you be open to something like that?"
"It seems like you completely misunderstood his points, or you understood them and decided to make a video contesting them anyway for the views. Yes Marxism and Post Modernism are conflicting ideologies in some sense, but the Neo Marxist Post Modernism that Peterson describes is something else entirely. It takes the goals of Marxism (equality) and seeks to achieve them through the destabilisation of our systems and our hierarchies. Peterson hates this as it undermines the natural hierarchies of competence in a misguided pursuit of equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity (which is what we should all be striving for)."

So you wast 30 minutes of peoples lives to beat around the bush of truth.  This is dumbest shit I've ever seen.  Also youre a confused cross dressing man who has no clue what the fuck youre talking about."
"Damn, I didn't know philosophy could be this sexy. Great video! I've been struggling, since JP became (in)famous, to figure out why I disagree with him. I think you explained fantastically why I can't agree with him. Well, more that he isn't really making a great argument in the first place. I think you did a great job of showing how vapid his rhetoric really is."
"Don't be so certain about him not being a fascist. That still remains to be seen.  He uses ideological and rhetorical tactics straight out of political authoritarianism which coupled with his history is already pretty damning. I'm glad to see that his old colleagues, who previously supported him, are starting to denounce him.

"25:04 - 'The very idea of people requesting different pronouns to suit their individual needs is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty over dogma should be on board with.' I wholeheartedly agree,  enforcing those values or pronouns onto others is a completely different matter however.  As a Peterson fan, this was a very interesting video to watch, and it's healthy to see criticism of him. Great video, quality explanations of the issues at hand and production by the way, you have a real talent.   Regarding his use of Post-modernism and Marxism, I inferred that he was projecting the class struggle of oppressor and victim onto race and gender, which is more straightforward. In regards to Post-modernism, I see it as a criticism of... I'm not even entirely sure, something along the lines of those he targets on the left being hypercritical of the 'oppressive structures' in society being negative, as it derides everything that could be positive of our society as negative, I think that's where the two go hand in hand. He's said on several occasions how he thinks people should feel lucky to be in the position they're in, relative to how horrific the past has been."
"Peterson is mostly known for his biology based psychology, and to some extent for his existentialism (which is deeply steeped/based in/on his experience as a clinical psychologist). His pragmatism, on the other hand, has often been downplayed - or rather completely unnoticed - by his critics, and the same is the case here. Peterson's characterisation of 'postmodern neo-marxism' is one that has to be understood in the light of his pragmatism. It is only through this (his pragmatism) that one can hope to understand his conflation of Postmodernism with that of (neo) Marxism. He knows very well that conceptually/theoretically postmodernism (has to) reject Marxism, as it is just another 'metanarrative'. He mentioned this so himself in one of his lectures (if memory serves me right, I believe he specifically mentioned this in the lecture in which he made that joke about 'postmodernist not believing (in) biology but acting like they do...because they all die!'. Hahaha, cracks me up every time. I could be wrong though - My memory could serve me wrong! PS - Let's assume that she [Contrapoints] missed this particular video/lecture).   It is, I believe, imperative to understand and identify someone's epistemological and ethical stance if we are to critique or criticise their beliefs and theories, otherwise, the whole endeavour could amount to nothing, or even worse to a straw man and a red herring even if that endeavour has the most honest of intentions. And I believe that this criticism has an honest intention, and that is why I am making this rather long comment. When it comes to epistemology and ethics the postmodernists are all about hermeneutics. Peterson's hermeneutics is pragmatism - His epistemology is based on it and his ethics or rather his ethical judgments too, I believe, are based on the same as well, and his criticism of 'postmodern neo-marxism' should also be understood in this light. In any case this is still a pretty good response. I had been convinced for a while that leftists (like Current Affairs ;-)) are only capable of straw-man-ish, red herring ad hominem attacks. But you've changed my mind, at least to some extent! I mean with all the efforts you've put in with your gimmicks this is a really decent video! Keep it up."
"*Channel 4 interview"
"The whole individual liberty in relation to non binary pronouns idea is that you should deal with it at the individual level and not the group level. It's about treating those you respect (i.e the trans and non binary people in your own life who are in your life because you do respect them to some degree) with respect by changing your language (something very fundamental) at their individual request, not just generally changing your language because some coalition of people who happen to share some aspects of their identity tells you, or in the case of Bill C-16 forces you, to do so."
"Great video. This is the first I’ve seen of yours and I’m glad I stumbled across it. I’ve been so interested in JP and so confused about him. This is the best commentary I’ve seen or read on the topic."
"You know, not that I think this would happen, but it really might be interesting if CP contacted Joe Rogan or Dave Rubin (or someone similar) about getting on their respective shows. Those guys put so much of their credibility on 'we're free thinkers who just want to hear people out' but tend to focus much more on speaking to conservative commentators rather than 'left' voices such as Contra. An outright rejection would sort of underscore that they themselves have prejudices and agendas as to who they talk to, and if she were to be featured on either program, I imagine it would be very compelling if probably sometimes uncomfortable.  Food for thought."
"Gawd this is hilarious and great."
"This was absolutely horrible, but sadly one of the better counter point videos to Jordan Peterson.  Identity politics being a divisive idea that puts your group identity over your individual identity is toxic plain and simple. It does nothing but divide people and pit them against each other.  Post modernism puts feels over reals, which combined with identity politics adds further fuel to the fire of giving people more reason to fight amongst our groups despite the fact that things have improved dramatically for all groups. You skip over critical theory, which is the source of a lot of Jordan's issues with the modern left. Critical theory breaks everything down into power structures of the oppressed and oppressor, rather than viewing them as competence hierarchies which is how Jordan Peterson views them. He even says multiple times that they can become tyrannical and can develop issues but these are structures that have gotten us to where we are and throwing them away without truly understanding them could and probably would be our undoing.  Critical theory is very similar to Marxism, and you can see it's influence on modern Feminism and how they are more concerned with equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. The more people embrace socialism the worse things get and the slower our progress because it works against human nature. We are inherently unequal and the West succeeds by embracing that inequality to the benefits of everyone.  One final thought, if Capitalism is the monetization of helping others then Socialism is the demonetization of helping others. When you view it through this lens you see why the more capitalistic a nation is, the more wealthy it is and the better off all citizens are despite financial inequalities between the people at the top and bottom."

"This video is so cringey unwatchable. Too much snark"
"I think Jordan Peterson is using the term postmodernism and Marxism loosely to describe the power-oriented ideologies that have manifested themselves in the radical left. He is fearful of a society that perceives all hierarchies as being motivated by power because they tend to devolve into tribalism. Marx defined what he saw as a historical dialectical power-play between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and post-modernists basically say that objective reality/objective truths are unintelligible so all interpretations of reality are exercises in power. Sure, the technical definitions of Marxism and Postmodernism diverge, but if we are going to talk about the collectivist beliefs that have sprung from them then it is appropriate to place them within the same category."
"if you have the mind of a woman....why do you wish to have the body? isn't a body simply outside baggage of the mind? This is why I wonder if trans is a cultural illness...this is why people that identify as women always tend to identify as 'cultural representations of woman'  ....such is why they dress as the cultural woman and/or change their voice, cut off their weenie and attach boobs as a fashion statement."
"Heh, this is pretty desperate."
"This is Just fantastic!  Now I really don't like the man my self, but you drive home the points against his BS epicly!   More of this pleas :)"
"Amazing! ....I've been following JP for some time now, went thru all the biblical lectures and many public debates. Although super interesting - many things have been bothering me for a long time... frustrating as everyone seems to think that everything he says is 110% accurate objective scientific truth's - not a world-view. Then I found you!   Such a relief! You addressed almost all of my concerns - and many things I didn't even think about - with great style, in an extremely intelligent and funny manner! I'm very, very thankful! ...And happy! :) /D (swedish person)"

"I like some of your video's ContraPoints, but there are many things you get wrong in this one. You say (I'm paraphrasing)  “all his life coaching is basically just a trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda, and he's against Progressivism, but, instead of using the word Progressivism he's come up with Postmodern/ Neo-Marxist.'  This is a strawman. You're claiming that Peterson is against Progressivist politics, but, I've seen no indication that he's against using science and reason to improve the human condition through reform. (He's a scientist, he's in the top 1% or thereabouts of cited scientific publications)  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordan_Peterson2  Furthermore, you have no evidence for that claim, you cut to the Cathy Newman interview where Peterson is referring to trans activists who, unscientifically, believe that gender is only a social construct. So that doesn't seem like progressivism to me.  Now, I don't know your position on the status of gender identity (And I mean no offence, btw, I’m sure you’re pretty filthy just like everyone else). But the biological, evolutionary, and genetic sciences indicate an objective difference between the sexes. Sex isn't a spectrum, it's a bimodal distribution, there are obviously socially constructed elements, but to deny the material nature of sex difference is, anti-science and not progressive.   Also your critique of Peterson's 'Postmodern/ Neo-Marxism is wrong. You make the point that you can't have Postmodernism and Marxism together because Postmodernism rejects grand narratives and Marxism is a grand narrative etc, so Peterson doesn't know what he's talking about.   What you don't get is that Petersons term, he states, is a 'strange pastiche'. So for him it's kind of a religious, often illogical, impulse to flatten hierarchies for the sake of toppling over the power structure. 'Compassion for the downtrodden' is often used as a mask to cover up the deeper motivation which is a resentment for those who have more than you or, in other words, resentment for those who are higher up on the hierarchy. The deeper psychoanalytic point is that it offers a kind of meaning or telos to ones trajectory in life, but, it’s ultimately a destructive one because a new hierarchy always gets erected and the new power structure faces the same threat as the one before from some newly “oppressed” minority group.   You go on to say 'basically it's the entirety of the modern left' (16:50). But that's just not true at all. Peterson is clearly in support of the part of 'the left' that's aligned with empirical science and is focused on lifting up and protecting the working class. For example he supports the birth control pill, as it allowed the competency of woman to enter the workforce. He does have his concerns over some broader implications, but, he's “eminently” happy to have woman contributing to the progress in the world.   I don't think this has been enough to call Peterson a reactionary or to say he hates the entire modern left, or that Postmodern/ Neo-Marxism is (((code))) for Progressivism. You are making the conflation, probably due to your own political biases, which is fine.   Moving forward you say: 'Underrepresentation of Woman in government?” Where did Peterson talk about woman in government? Not in the Cathy Newman interview. They were talking about woman in FTSE 500 companies.   Furthermore the argument he was making was crystal clear, he wasn’t leaving anyone to make assumptions. Woman aren’t as highly represented in those top positions because of many reasons. One of them is that there is gender discrimination. Another one is that Woman are more Agreeable than men and won’t fight as hard for those competitive positions. Another reason is that woman, on average, opt for more of a work/life balance and don’t work as many hours as men. Another reason is that Woman who are successful and make lots of money tend to marry men who are also successful ( wealthy woman tend not to marry poor men) and they realize that they’d rather focus on a family instead of spending 80 hours a week working to have a dual income, when their husbands are already making good money. The point is there are lots of reasons, you don't have to assume anything, you just have to look at the data on the subject, and there is good, clear, data on the subject I'm not making this up.   Now, this whole thing about “unjust hierarchies”. That IS the point, to many resentful angry young college kids, every hierarchy is unjust. It’s more of a symptom of being uneducated, thats why this problem is so prevalent on college campuses and social media as opposed to anywhere else.   The production of this video was top shelf and I did learn some new things. I even think there were some nuggets of fair criticism of Peterson, but on the whole, I think you missed the mark."
"The Judith Butler quote points to the idea of intersectionalism and JBP I think uses this to collapse groups down to individuals.  Individuals assert rights and are held responsible for their actions.  Groups cannot assert such rights as group responsibility is a taboo.  Everyone complains about collective punishment.  The class struggle of Marx asserts collective rights and boy have they delved out the collective punishments.  Note to self: lets not do that anymore.  Try something, anything else.  I happen to like Liberty but then again It is implied that I enjoy some privilege.  My wish is to promote liberty for everyone."
"Jordan Peterson's arguments are riddled with fallacies and nonsense. No one should be taking him seriously."
"What was gray is now technicolor. By the way, excellent job of dismantling the tactics JP used during the Cathy Newman interview. I’d be curious of your thoughts on the whole “women wearing make up in the workplace.”"
"See, this business of LAW is a sober thing indeed. Law is a blunt instrument of state coercion, no laughing matter. Consider the following witty absurdity:- The person of Mrs Windsor shall be called by her preferred pronoun of 'Her Majesty' , not just as a matter of courtesy but as a compulsion backed up by jail time. Sounds good? As a matter of principle? Do you see why JBP might be on to something MORE than an issue of good manners here? Respectfully. Peace. Out."
"can u maybe make a video about the israeli-palestinian conflict? im confused."
"Unironic thanks, contra points, for an effort to respond to Dr Peterson at the level of ideas. Your civility and sobriety and kindness...are GOOD things. The flame war with whatsoever personality, Mr Y, etc, etc is, well, okay I guess, ..a chacun son gout...artful exercises in rhetoric, disputatious youth being virile...does not interfere with my right to be old and sad and quietist and fun squashing and grey and dull. But, y'know, here's a thing....a dull grey mum and dad 18th century bore kind of idea..it feels more and more urgent the older you get...expressed better by JBP than by me...we might..y'know, wisely, from time to time, make a conscious effort to abstract ourselves and each other....to our words. Choose some words carefully and stand by them. Speak some good words, bigger and better and simpler than our frail selves. We could call those words....oh I dunno...prayers? And we could unironically share them with everybody. We could call the key words 'universal values' ( in case 'western culture' sounds alarming). Just a marketing or branding issue really. Then, more carefully still, we might wonder which of those words are SO safe that we might , with appropriate dread and reverence, make them LAW."
"You know you've done a good video when Peterson's only response is 'No comment'."
"I will probably regret watching this, but i guess its important to listen to the other side. Peterson does not enforce his rules with law or bullying that is the difference. And people like Dyson reveal the many people on your side who quite happily abuse identity politics turning it into a weapon to attack white people etc for self gain. I think Peterson making a point that people aren't just clay to be molded, (as post modernists seem to think ) is a valid point that you just strawmanned. Personally in my opinion i think you're helping destroy the west, incouraging destructive colonization, fascism in the form of 'hate speech', helping hucksters like Dyson and the Labour party, degeneracy and are just generally poison. I think you will only care and understand when your selfish pampered ass gets effected, do you even have doubts?."

"Subscribed. I mostly disagree but it's really nice to see intelligent criticism of JP rather than emotional stuff. Also, I love the theatrics. LOVE THEM!! You're awesome!"
"I'd like to thank Cracked.com for the introduction to this interesting channel."
"Splendid! I kind of got myself into a twist over JoPet and the 'incels' at a certain site called Fetlife ... which can be annoying even on an otherwise quite good day ... so to save time and consternation, I'm simply going to let this video speak for me. You're pretty much saying all the things I would have said anyway, plus you don't have the disadvantage of being, well, me. (I'm way too easy to hate on.) Plus you're much better looking than me, which is always an advantage."
"Great video,  very well reasoned."
"Fuck me you're funny."
"Excellent video. It's great to see such an intelligent response to Peerson. I'm amazed that I've never come across your videos before, but you've earned a new subscriber!"

"that was kind of ridiculously watchable"
"Thank you very much, added to playlist. I sometimes agree with JP, sometimes not. I think he confuses his associations, too. Purely through reasoning, I'm nowhere near as widely read as you. Sometimes, as I follow him, I think 'Where on earth are we going now?' I don't think any state should tell people what to say, that way clearly lies evil, and there is no need. But I'm more than happy to use whichever pronoun you think suits you. Even if it's a completely new one. Unless it sounds really silly. My opinion is that such a pronoun should a single syllable. And include object and possessive forms in its design. For obvious reasons of frequency of use, together with articles, these words must have evolved to flow freely among all other words. Just tried a few, it's not that easy, is it? It would be even harder in French, of Italian, say, due to apostrophised abbreviated forms.   Language seems to evolve like the huffmann code used to compress it, the shortest codes being used for the most frequently used words. And when you try to introduce a new pronoun, you find all the most economical viable slots are taken."

"I found out about this video after seeing a video on YouTube referencing the recent Munk debate with Dr. Jordan Peterson, the topic of this video. The video is called 'Curb your Jordan Peterson Quote' and is a edit of Michelle Goldberg's statrment where she paraphrase Jordan Peterson saying, 'Maybe if women don't want to be the workplace to be sexualized, they shouldn't be allowed to where makeup.' To where Peterson immediately says that he didn't say that. To which she responds by telling the audience to Google the vice interview. So of course the video cuts to the vice interview where not only her statement was found to be dishonest, but he clearly stated that he was not saying her statement likely due to the fact that he for saw bring misquoted in the future which is exactly what happened. Why did this happen? I wasn't sure. Maybe she didn't actually watch the video and saw a biased review online where the writer misquoted him due to their agenda. Maybe she did watch it and misquoted him due to her agenda (which it wasn't smart to tell the audience to Google it only to discredit her claim and be denounced publicly online as a liar) and to assume higher intelligence I'll go with the assumption that she didn't actually watch the vice interview. Now I went to her twitter and of course what I predicted was true. People were mentioning her with assume link to the video assumed what was funny was that her (status? I don't have twitter and rarely go to its site, so I'll compare it to facebook, apologies for my ignorance) states that she doesn't read @mentions so maybe she really doesn't. That's unfortunate since she won't learn from her mistake then. Anyway that situation reminds me of this video. Now this video was a bit difficult for me to sit through as to be honest, and this is my opinion and I'm sticking with it regardless of feelings hurt and outrage, that the setup was creepy and cringy. I believe that's for the comedy but it's not for me so I won't continue these videos. But that's also not the point. The point is that as Michelle Goldbloom had done, Jordan Peterson's ideals were misrepresented here. Although this case was different. I don't think this was due to maliciousness. I think this was a case of skimming through material about him, not understanding  what he's saying or selective listening which the later is common across all humans so certainly nothing to get at arms about especially if you're going in knowing the person you're listening to is against your ideals, you're going to tend towards selective listening and combativeness. Many people do not realize this as this is not commonly told to people so bare that in mind people. Also I understand that many interviews give Peterson limited time to speak his position and usually cut him short because he goes on too long for the alloted time the interview has with him and they need to get across certain conversation points on their list in reasonable time. My best advice is to check out his Q&A and maps of meaning lectures where he has the ability to get his ideals out there fully and without interupption and of course without the meme 'So you're saying...' and you'll get a clearer picture of what's going on and will definitely understand that he doesn't really care about what is happening among the post modernists and their divisions and only cares about being told to speak words which is an orwellian nightmare and scares him because of the belief that the acceptance of compelled speech in law will lead to a slightly worse law then worse than, that then worse than that, until we have that Orwellian nightmare I wrote about earlier. That line is why he makes the comparison to the '20th century killers' because history is indeed repeating itself and he wants to stop it before it's too late. Now many people completely miss that agenda of his and think that he's against Trans people and feminists and such which he states across several videos that he doesn't  care about that though the way they're going about their goals is unhealthy and dangerous in itself, he cares about where the acceptance  compelled speech laws will lead western societies  (hence against orwellian). If you do not know what I mean by orwellian, I'm specifically referring to George Orwell ' s novel 1984. If you have the time, read the novel fully, if not go to spark notes or something similar and get an overview though I again strongly suggest you actually read the novel. I assume many of you know about it anyway as it was required reading in many primary schools back when I was in school."

"As a student of Andy Warhol and (briefly) a fan of Peterson, I'm fairly confident Warhol is exactly who Peterson thinks he's describing with the word postmodernism. Peterson thinks postmodernism means a denial that any event or work of art has any intrinsic or objective meaning. Warhol's whole deal was the subversion of art as a concept by demonstrating that he could captivate millions with pieces which were as close to objectively meaningless as possible. Warhol took the philosophical question of meaning as pertains to art and answered it -- empirically -- in the negative, doing an end run around everyone's theories of meaning ever.  This kind of thing clearly makes Peterson shit his pants. It's like when you're a teenager and you get some good weed in conjunction with Carl Sagan videos and it suddenly hits you that there is no up or down in the universe, all location is relative, no orientation is correct, and none of it ever ends. I know I'm not the only one who's had that click and gotten literal vertigo paired with the impossible fear that I could fall off the planet. I'm pretty sure that's how Peterson feels when someone points out Christian ethics might be just one more arbitrary social construct, just like whatever it is Siberian dirt herders believe. For Peterson, postmodernism is to philosophy what relativity was to physics. And Peterson reeeally wishes we could all go back to pre-Gallilean times. He can't handle the idea that there is no one privileged perspective which defines Truth and Virtue and whatever other sterile Platonic ideals pedants feel like bickering about.  For the record, the reason I stopped listening to Peterson is because every additional hour of his content made it increasingly clear that whatever else can be said of the man, he is perpetually upset. He is visibly unhappy 100% of the time and I dunno maybe this is just me but I don't think that's the sign of a person whose outlook on life is worth emulating."

"Hey I was linked here by Cracked and I'm not sure if the main focus of this video was supposed to be educational or entertaining, but I feel as though the parts of the video aimed at entertaining the audience really detract from the analytical and informative pieces. The ideas you talk about just get lost inside your jokes about attending AA meetings and whatnot and make the video unwatchable for people not interested in the same sense of humor, as the video just feels really drawn out and irrelevant."
"Starts with a lie and gets worse from there."
"I am not nearly as leftist as you, but I really appreciate your channel. It is refreshing to see someone who is (far?)left actually articulate the problems they have with our society/culture, even if I don't fully agree. It seems like most young people now-a-days conflate their entire personalities with their political leanings, and as such, they take differences in opinions very personality. Meanwhile, many people on the right seem to enjoy being 'correct' more than they enjoy meaningful conversation.   Thank you for actually engaging in a dialogue that is informative, productive, and funny, without being mean-spirited."

"I've listened to Peterson talk for upwards of 75 hrs now. I've had his ideas on my mind at least once a day for over a year. I can say that you don't make enough of an effort to understand his thoughts or you stop once you have a rational sounding argument for each point that will persuade the majority of people not listening closely. But my opinion is such: You are being intellectually dishonest or simply negligent in your desire to learn what he is saying. Still the closest i have heard to someone having an argument against Peterson, but not quite convinced. Good job though"
"I never thought Peterson thought there was a conspiracy to intentionally destroy the west but that the post modernist will end up destabilizing the culture through their babbling and bickering. I personally think he is right but in the sense that every culture and nation falls eventually as progression naturally deconstructs entities formed in the past. Protestant America will and is declining and perhaps America will as well. Why are we so special? Why would we last forever in our current state? Our own constitution doesnt account for the rapid growth in tech. Is meta deta personal property? Should every citizen be allowed to own a tank?"
"Great points. Now off to the pertinent matters: would it be gay to suck her dick?"
"please do a video on Peter Singer I'll give you like $10"
"In all my time online I have met many who hate Peterson and I failed to understand why. While I cannot say much for them you have an actual argument against him that I can agree and rationalize. It seems like since he dropped his book and started getting interviews the man changed into the ideologically possessed man he hates. Now maybe this is because of the environment he is from, where students attack him for having opposing views and the negative press so loud to him he cannot see the moderates who are idle and silent.   At the very least, thank you for helping me see him from a new angle"
"Peterson's label of 'Postmodern neo-Marxism' is just as stupid as the labels 'Alt-Right,' 'Democrats/Republicans,' 'The West,' etc. These labels when given more than 2 seconds of thought show that they do not make sense and are used so broadly that it is almost impossible to figure out who is 'supposedly' covered under each label.  If we use these broad-brush labels, our arguments mean little because no one can be certain who our arguments pertain to, so the issue cannot be solved."
"It's a good comedy bit.  She would have been a better debate opponent than the silly columnist that joined the baptist preacher."
"Seems weird that the drive in technology and modern culture is simplification - we dumb-down exams for the sake of cultural differences, we replace words with ease-recognition symbols, 'less is more' is being pushed as the corporate meme from optional extras in cars to the way people talk about movies. Yet the Progressive Left has been busy making gender descriptions - I think we're up to 37 officially recognized ones now (?) - but also makes demands to enforce recognition of these new descriptions as a matter of human rights law. 'Misprouning' people might seem important to the ultra-minority that demand it, but it's just not feasible in a country where the average IQ is 100. These are demands that do not recognize the limitations of human intelligence - usually because the people demanding them are of higher than average intelligence. It's a form of Elitism - i.e. intolerance - masked as a call for tolerance enforcement. ...and how should we feel about 'Tolerance Enforcement'? It does sound very Demolition Man."
"'I think to people watching this it comes off as if leftists are like, afraid of his actual ideas.' Yeah. To me, it looks like almost no one in the world can manage to criticize him, but maybe that's the trick. Kudos to you for actually engaging with him, its not like I believe everything he says is true. Unlike him, I actually believe in the validity of transness and dysphoria.   Its also embarrassing that an old man trying to get people to self-actualize gets treated as if he's another Goebbels. Or that a relatively unknown (gotta be honest with you) youtuber does a better job explaining his positions to the layman than paid journalists do (who often can't help strawmanning him). Its not a good look to anyone who's on the fence, and it just increases his popularity amongst the audience that already distrusts journalists. And its not really true that 'the left only appears unified to people who are far on the right'. The philosophical squabbling you identify is something only those really deep in academia would know about. Not even the general student population in universities would know it, either. The rest of us out here don't really have awareness of those philosophical debates."
"You're a deviant, a degenerate, and my new favorite person. I found this researching Jordan Peterson (cause Youtube reeeaally wants me to watch more of him) and you make so much more sense than anybody else I've heard.  I love the points you make in a couple of your videos about the Left being weakened by only arguing with itself about small points instead of developing fuller arguments for their basic worldview. It's really scary to see Fascism gaining ground while the Left is spending so much energy infighting and whining."

"All hail the lobster queen!"
"Really appreciated this. I generally like Peterson a lot, but there have always been things I don't like about him that I could never put to the right words. I've read some criticism of him, but most of it's been straw man. Your video's the first critical take I've seen that got it right, and boy did you get lots of it right. Particularly appreciated your takedown of postmodernism vs. marxism, and your analysis of how vague and over-generalizing his 'postmodernist neo-marxist' term really is. Thank you, you've added a lot to the discussion."
"Excellent video. Peterson has expressed that he never had a problem with calling whoever by their preferred pronoun. He had a problem with there being a law forcing professors in Canadian colleges to use the preferred pronoun. He had a problem with “compelled speech”."
"I don't necessarily agree with the assessment, but I appreciate a less reactionary analysis"
"I came into this video a somewhat fan of Jordan Peterson and still am i do like some of his points and overall like how he talks and argues even if sometimes its shady I still like seeing people debate like that and sometimes manipulate an argument in their favor like the lobster thing. I figured you would just go after him with no real strong points of your own and I'm glad i was wrong. Came out of this video really looking at Jordan differently respecting him less as a person but still hold respect for his speaking ability's."
"I don't think it's meant to be a perfectly coherent concept, but a very loose label for the simultaneous focus on radical constructivism and cultural identity power dynamics on some extreme pockets of the left."
"His voice sounds really annoying now, made it hard to watch."
"Contra,  Relating to your video about violence, I’d love to see you do a video about the politics of AI ethics in Westworld.

"but you really wouldn't be happy watching strangers with candy for the rest of your life. that is a FUCKIN' LIE!  it's a lie taken metaphorically as well."
"Beautifully articulated and well presented.  Not only did you provide the most accurate definition of postmodernism (an antithesis to modernistic values) that I have seen on youtube, but you put them in context to its influence on modern society. You also exposed that Marxism and postmodernism are fundamentally differently, which is of course is obvious to anyone without a political agenda to satisfy.   I would like to point out that one of the reasons why its hard to debate against Peterson is that his views encompass distorted, reductionist views across a large spectrum of fields: sociological, philosophical, ideological, religious, and even biological concepts. In order to prove them wrong, you need to fact check everything he says, which is challenging for a person to do so on the spot. When you do catch him in a lie or fallacy, he starts with his mental gymnastics which can be hard to escape if you are not aware.   Thank you for your service to this young, impressionable, desperate generation."
"Wish there was a version of this that didn't have the random nonsense on it. I'd have bothered finishing it."
"First, I really enjoyed this video. It was quite entertaining. Secondly, it seems to do a pretty good job of exposing some serious weaknesses in JP's political philosophizing. I say 'seems' because I am not very familiar with his writings or talks. The events that originally brought him into the limelight, and the arguments he made at the time, left me singularly unimpressed, and you could say that has prejudiced me against him. But based on the comments section here I have to say that either his political theories and arguments are very weak, or his supporters here that are defending them don't actually understand them well enough to do a decent job of defending or even explaining them.  But there are also people saying that they like JP for some reason but do acknowledge that he is not above criticism, which is positive."
"“...Who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely lead to Stalinism.”  Right off the bat you start off with a straw man argument in order to fit a narrative. Pathetic."
"He's said often he's happy to use the pronouns people want. But he wont be forced by the state to do so."
"I'm hardly qualified to rebut either you or JP (my field of study is comedic loafing) but you are feckin' hilarious."

"You can try your best to challenge and inform people in the most entertaining way possible and yet no matter how much they like what you're saying they cannot change their minds. Their beliefs are not rooted in reason but in emotion. They won't change their minds or suddenly change their reasoning without something more personal to change the way they feel. Until then, they'll find new ways to rationalize their stance. But at least you've opened a door."
"This is one of the best things I have seen in a year. Thank you so much Natalie."
"Contra, I have the impression that your voice is a little bit higher than usual. What's going on?"
"https://imgflip.com/i/2aixl5"
"This is so funny."
"Hey there! I'm really really big Jordan Peterson fan, and I can say with some degree of self assuredness that this is the most credibility I've ever seen somebody on the left give JP.   I understand your confusion about his definition of postmodern-neomarxism. I think his definition of it is a little confused. Stephen Pinker (I think)  defined postmodernism as  (at its base) the denial of objective reality. I think this fits, and I think that the definition you supply is both informed and one I can use to talk about this confusion.   So essentially Jordan Peterson believes that as a philosophy postmodernism is defunct, due to the fact that we must frame our interpretations of the world around something objective. Biological evolution has chosen to do this around the existence of pain, which we can agree for all intensive purposes occurs universally enough across experiences to be  objective. So in his opinion postmodernism as a philosophy has failed.  He believes that postmodernists have begun to recognize the holes and inconsistencies that he sees in postmodernism, and he believes they've begun to fill those holes with Marxism.  So the rule of thumb generally is: you take a common leftist claim you don't believe is based in your objective interpretation of reality, and then you divide it across oppressed/oppressor lines that marxism clings to.   'Women have not achieved equality due to a functioning oppressive patriarchy'  'Minorities do not get equal opportunities because they are oppressed by an institutionally racist system'   Of course he's not exactly clear on all of this, and I really am putting words in his mouth here, so don't quote me on it. But I think I'm close to the mark....bucko."
"I do not agree with all that you said, BUT I fucking love you!!!!"
"lovely"
"I'd consider myself a supporter of Peterson (somewhat). I do, however, agree with some of your points. Great video!"
"'Someone who favors individual choice should be in favor of individual gender expression.'  Sure, but not in the form of state enforced speech codes."
"Nice Pink Flamingos reference!! Great vid!"
"Peterson fan boi here,  like your work.  Not convinced, you glossed over many of his finer points more humorously than disingenuously which is refreshing.  I agree with the clip at the end from Rubin, you're the closest I've found to contending with Peterson's ideas. He'd probably interview with you if you asked. Just saying"
"Holy shit you’re really fucking pretty."
"I respect Peterson and think he is providing an important voice when it comes to defending some social norms, but it bothers me that so many of his detractors put their foot in their mouth before they ever get a legitimate criticism out, either by misrepresentations or using ad hominems, which then allows his fans to devolve into the usual circejerks. This does nobody any favours. Peterson is operating in a grey area but he's clearly doing some things right. It's a legitimate issue to question where he draws the line on multiple issues, but flagrant attempts at character assassination by painting him as alt-right, misogynistic, racist, etc etc are going to be nothing but counter-productive.  A voice like yours is important in winning the battle of hearts and minds. You don't take yourself too seriously and that allows you to actually get a point across without giving his uncritical fans an excuse to reduce you to an identity politician / sjw. I think you are definitely one of the more valuable voices in this ecosystem. Keep it up."
"My phone froze right when the video ended.       I guess you could say it was SHOOKETH"
"Actually Peterson never says that it's a 'unified philosophical force' but makes the argument that it's an aggregate force made of many competing and cooperating wills (those arguments in the left you talk about) which results in a general push that includes both post modernist idealogy and marxist viewpoints (despite their contradictions). For easy digestion and understandability, he sacrifices precision, so he says 'Neo marxist post modern'.   And that thickness and impenetrability of communication that he avoids that most philosophers fall victim to, is something that you have occasionally complained about (in your video about what why you left academia).  the one thing classic liberals and libertarians tend to do is boil down their points (while sacrificing precision) to come up with something easy to unify, for effect. Order is just a core aspect of right philosophy, so it makes sense that precision (which is something left people chase to the ends of the earth resulting in only becoming more confusing with constant term redefinition) would be sacrificed.  Once again, thank you so much for being you and making videos of this caliber. It's nice to finally hear someone that represents these viewpoints who isn't weaponized, is patient and understanding, and ultimately has the best intentions.  Please don't stop making videos, you're wonderful."

"My main issue with this video is how you portray peterson as someone who is against trans rights and against using personal pronouns. He fought compelled speech legislation because it infringed on free speech. He didn't refuse to call anyone by personal pronouns. He refused to be forced to say specific words by the government. This is the basis of his whole philosophy and why he's popular. He spent decades studying authoritarianism and sees it peeking up its head in the government and universities in the form of compelled speech legislation. The road to totalitarianism is made one step at a time and is supported by a complicit population. He was standing up for what he believes was the first step towards a totalitarian state. This is the whole basis of why he's popular and his reason for speaking out in the first place. Please try to get the basics right before you move on to further criticism"
"It seems like both sides just hear someone that can speak intellectually and tells them what they want to hear, and then instantly latch onto it without the least bit of skepticism. Lets them feel confident in their beliefs without thinking for themselves. Sad.   Great video though."

"i thoroughly enjoyed the video but think we're taking the ayn rand/tomi lehran/joseph mccarthy wannabe JP's ideology/intellectualism too seriously.  he just made  up the term 'post modern marxist' because it sounds scary to conservative 'white male and the females who proft by pretending to empathize with their struggle' christians."

"So nazis thought that cultural Marxism is a conspiracy aimed at destroying the West, therefore cultural Marxism isn’t real? I don’t even believe in cultural Marxism being real, but this argument is invalid. Nazis also thought that smoking is bad, therefore we can conclude that it isn’t by your logic? You’re also conflating the words “should” with “must”. Peterson is proposing some (pretty retarded) things that you should do, but he doesn’t want to enforce this rules using the government. The leftist activists generally want to enforce hate speech laws, so called equal pay laws and so on, that’s fundamentally different."
"Well crafted video. Beautifully made! However, the framing of Jordan Peterson ideas as comparable to Cultural Bolshevism and therefore he is a facist, is a bit naive. It's like believing that there is no left extremism that, eventhough ideology wise with good intentions, is very bad and very dangerous to all humans. Extreme believes have caused so many lives to suffer in the past, that it is ignorant to believe that more of the same extreme ideology will do better next time... I think, that believing that there is no left extremism or downplay it's danger to society is like looking away when people get hurt or injustice happens. Please don't! Look at the facts, look at the places where injustice happens and call them out - don't try to frame every person that tries to look at the places where people get hurt as right extreme where the truth is the opposite - if we all look - we can make to world a better place!"
"TMBS brought me here. Glad I discovered you and your channel!"
"You know, I don't agree with you or your ideology but seeing this video is refreshing. You are clearly intelligent, well spoken, and open to having a sincere discussion. Sure this video has humor woven within and it did come off very sarcastic but it's not the ridiculous ad hominem and broken-record-recycled-rhetoric shouted by blue haired, nose pierced, androgynously clad college students across the country . I think there are some misinterpretations of Jordan Peterson and his beliefs but this is the most rational analysis of the man from a far left leaning individual I have seen. Kudos to you. One request: when you provide definitions to different terms I would like to see the source shown perhaps at the bottom of your slide."

"If you think it's the 'neckbeards' who haven't been getting the Campbellian message of 'follow your bliss' then you may want to ask yourself what message they have been hearing instead, and from whom. If it really is a question of a lack of a father-figure, then you may want to ask yourself why people need some kind of stand-in father-figure in the first place.  And then you call all the ideas you say you agree with a 'trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.' Aside from this claim being unclear (don't use metaphor for such an important, driving claim of an argument) it seems to be an implied argumentum ad hominem. I don't care if there is anything 'reactionary' related to what he's saying or not, I would instead much rather hear about why he is actually wrong to say what he is saying. I don't even know what that word means, and I've had a thousand different people, including dictionary-writers, define it for me. The most effective definition of it that I have seen would put people like the original left, as in the people who sat on the left-hand side of the monarch, under the banner of 'reactionary.' Same thing for abolitionist movements. This particular video may be more geared toward your regular core audience who can more easily understand your verbal shorthand, but I don't think that's a wise approach to take if you're going to address the ideas of someone with such a massive following. I imagine you probably clarify later in the video, but you're already losing me, and that's not a good sign.  To paraphrase your clarifying point, he argues it is better to focus on sorting yourself out than to focus on progressive politics. Yes, he does say that. He also says it is better to sort yourself out than to focus on the politics of white nationalism. As he has clarified repeatedly, he believes identitarianism of all kinds is nothing more than a distraction from one's own personal life journey. He's getting at a question of meaning. His argument for linking identity politics, whether it's leftist or right-winger identity politics, to the ideologies of Stalin and Mao is because they are the same thing. You do not have the right to offend and the group is more important than the individual. When the force of law is used to force people into *addressing someone in a certain way*, whether it is an autocratic monarch or a group of angry danger-hairs, that is not freedom. When the group has the rights as opposed to the individual, no individual is free. So yes, there is absolutely a comparison between trans activists and Mao...and Stalin, and King James.  'I do not believe Jordan Peterson is a fascist.'  Well, that's good, but I invite you to question how much weight your words carry on this point given that the thing you did immediately before saying this was give a wink-and-nudge argument that he's doing the exact same thing fascists do. At that point, people could take you at your word and they'd still be justified in viciously opposing JP just as they would any other fascist, because one's intent is often unrelated to the results of one's actions. It is generally only a court of law where questions of intent come up, and even then, only in regards to culpability, usually. Once we take a more pragmatic approach, intent becomes less relevant.  'My worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very localized problem, and I worry that some of society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.'  There are, at bottom, two problems with what you've said here; the first is the claim that what Peterson is challenging is a 'very localized problem.' It's not. Postmodern philosophy and Marxism, never mind the 'neo' at the front of it, are the two driving philosophies in the social sciences and the humanities in the world. I know this because that's where my academic training is, and those two philosophies, more postmodernism than Marxism, are doing all kinds of damage to those fields, and they're producing people who have an ideology that forces those around them to put 'we are anti-fascist' posters in their windows so Antifa doesn't go and break them. In the academy, the places we might go to get the message of JP's that you said earlier that you agree with, the stuff you called simple, basic self-help stuff, is not being taught anymore. I have had many, many instructors over the course of my training, in the high double-digits, and I can name four who taught anything approaching what Peterson teaches about how to handle life, eschewing anything he says regarding political activism and social issues. Whether you think this is a good thing or a bad thing, it is happening.  The second problem is the positioning of a person or class of people as 'the vulnerable ones.' I'm not worried, and you shouldn't be either. This is what is known as a threat narrative. Position someone as vulnerable, sound the alarm, rouse the protective instinct. It's actually what tribes the world over have used to justify going to war. 'Those bad people over there are coming to rape our women so we have to kill those bad people' has basically been the battle-cry of every army ever. People have criticized the damsel in distress bit numerous times in the past, but the fact is it draws peoples' attention for a reason. I'm not, strictly speaking, a 'fan' of Jordan Peterson. I've found my own way through authors like Joseph Campbell, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Carl Jung so a lot of what JP likes to say is old hat to me, but one thing he has rightly identified, is what I like to call the lefty playbook, and threat narratives feature heavily in the lefty playbook, just as much as they feature in the right-wing playbook. In our society, vulnerability is a currency. Vulnerability is a currency because we have given preeminence to certain altruistic virtues, and you don't even have to be intelligent to recognize that you can game those virtues; you just have to be able to pick up on certain social cues and follow your instincts. All of this is expressed in the idiom, the squeakiest wheel gets the grease. That's how activist groups of all stripes and political persuasions get resources (whether we're talking money, effort, time, compassion, love, etc...) allocated to their pet cause; they convince the resource-holders that they are the ones who need those resources the most. Look at the history of female vs. male domestic violence shelters to see a mountain of supporting evidence for my point.  I'd like to focus in on something; you don't really disagree with JP's points about how to live a good life, according to my understanding of your position. It seems to me, the only problem you have is with the potential threat that an unrelated ideology might hold to vulnerable people, because JP's ideas challenge the place of primacy that progressive politics holds in some peoples' lives. To me, it sounds like you're saying that you see any challenge to progressive politics, or at least strong and direct challenges to progressive politics, as bad because without those progressive politics, some people will be put in danger.  Assuming my understanding of your position is true, can you see why JP compared trans activists to Mao? Anything that threatens the orthodoxy is dangerous to the people? Actually, it's worse than that, isn't it? Even if x *doesn't* threaten the orthodoxy directly, people might discard the orthodoxy in favor of x, and discarding the orthodoxy will threaten a vulnerable population. Again, your words were, 'My worry is that you're leading an international political backlash against what is a very localized problem, and I worry that some of society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.'  I think we need to move past falling for threat narratives, tripping over ourselves about who is or isn't the most vulnerable, and start treating people like individuals. That's all I have the energy for for now. I'm going to finish the rest of the video.  Edit: Okay, got a little father in, and I agree with everything you said regarding your history lesson about modernism, postmodernism, and the problem of the rejection of meta-narratives and reconciling that with anything resembling a theory or hypothesis, including Marxist thought. However, a particular feminist academic by the name of Sandra Harding solved that problem with her work on standpoint theory and strong objectivity, out from which intersectionality (white supremacist cishetero capitalist patriarchy) was born. She sidestepped the problem of the rejection of meta-narrative by arguing that since there is no one grand narrative to construct the world, instead, individual personal narratives must be used to construct the world, which is where we get the idea that oppression comes in many forms, and only if someone experiences a specific type of oppression are they equipped to understand (and arguably even recognize the existence of) that oppression. This is how Marxists are able to deal with feminists without calling them 'bougie idiots' (yes I used to read Jacobin). Generally though, feminists seem to rule the proverbial roost, with people like Marxists and anarchists playing second fiddle.  I fundamentally disagree with everything you said about JP leading a backlash, or that it is 'targeting' anyone, and find even your framing of his ideas in this way to be objectionable and yes, even offensive. JP is not 'targeting' anyone or anything but the specific legislation that, according to the head of the OHRC, enables a governmental body to fine someone who is unwilling to use what is considered to be a proper mode of address, and, in the event of the accused failing to pay the fine, send to prison. I don't like insulting people, and I'm generally happy to address anyone how they wish to be addressed, including whatever weird pronouns any given person contrives. See part 2 for more."

"I was going along, and enjoying this video, until you said that there's no connection between postmodernism, Marxism and identity groups.  UBC philosophy professor Stephen Hicks says otherwise.  He says all the top postmodern philosophers leaned far left/Marxist.  Foucault started out Marxist and later was a Maoist.  The original postmodernists were professors in the 70's and produced a second wave of postmodernists who are still professors today. One, Lentricchia, said postmodernism is not about truth but social change (paraphrasing). Social change was needed because enlightenment was a fraud, certain groups were oppressed, the only truth is power, identity groups are oppressed or oppressors, power structure needs to be flipped etc. (around 50:00) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BGbHG63x8w"

What allows for that luxury?  Capitalism.  So flatter yourself with the idea of an academic education but you can't address Peterson's ideas head on.  You talk around it, you digress, you ridicule, you circumnavigate all the insane seas of madness but can't address his ideas head on.  Try something transgressive -- try to meet your sea monsters head on.  Have courage.. yes, learn something from a lobster.

"You're funny! I enjoyed the video. I did see you slide off from solid footing in the actual, material criticism of JP a bit, but not as much as most. I think you really did well. I do want to say that Peterson has addressed the Marxist/postmodern marriage and its internal logical inconsistency along with the impossibility of a monolithic left as conceptualized and hoped for in intersectionality many, many times, with historical data underpinning the former's advent and simple common sense describing the latter's foolishness. This video doesn't successfully refute or even attempt to field in detail, his assessment there. Aaaaaand lefties definitely do argue that hierarchies are inherently unjust. They produce inequality, and activist leftists are steadily railing at any observable inequality with a blanket and uncritical presumption that any and every difference in outcome between identity groups stems from something nefarious, even when there are natural causes that don't require an 'evil actors' interpretation. Peterson's statement goes to the nature of hierarchies themselves as concept; his elucidation of which refutes the basic assumption that all inequality-producers are the result of injustice and oppression. You did ok, though. I'd enjoy seeing you talk to the guy directly."

I'm what I like to call an '80% fan' of Jordan Peterson. I like a lot of what he says, and I really like that you took the time to understand his positions before disputing them, which is a very productive way to have a conversation about him."
"Well that was fucking hilarious. Big JP fan here, but enjoyed that immensely. Great arguments even if i ultimately disagree with many of your conclusions because I could agree or sympathise with elements along the way, but wonderfully comic in just the right places too  - maybe the best thing I watched all week. Bravo."
"I am a pretty staunch conservative libertarian, and a big fan of JBP.  I find his honesty and directness, as well as his deep understanding of the human condition, very refreshing in an age of too many voices, many just repeating things they heard from others.  Prior to this video, I have not felt intellectually challenged by pretty much anything anyone has said that opposes my worldview.  I've seen you in live chats with Sargon, or Bearing or someone and I found you quite unpalatable.  But either you've grown a lot since then, or this is just a much better medium for you to express yourself in.  In either case, I really appreciate what you had to say here, and I dig the aesthetic, even though a lot of your presentation should make me uncomfortable as a conservative Christian.  I guess I've transcended that identity to regard your work fairly, which is what every aspiring artist deserves."
"If you think this is funny, fine. But nobody can possibly think that this is somehow on equal intellectual ground to anything jordan peterson has ever done. Very disappointed by the actual quality of the arguments."
"Though I think you have good points in here and i did decide to watch/listen to the whole video but your first description of how JPB rose to power is either a dumb joke or a blatant misrepresentation of the truth.  “Professor who got famous for sounding the alarm for how protecting transgender people under canadian human rights law leads to stalinism”  Even if your of the many who say his interpretation of what bill C-16 does to canadian human rights laws is incorrect it is still falacious or ignorant of you to say that his intentions were to thwart civil rights for transgender people. He was only concerned about the compelled speech of the bill. He never said transgender people shouldnt be able to use the bathroom of their choice or acquire housing. (I know you didnt specify anything, these are just examples issues I’ve heard of)  So the only thing I could think as to why you painted it like you did was you were maybe joking or maybe you think that his entire uproar about the matter is some sort of right wing conspiracy to thwart trans rights.   I was reluctant to watch the video based off of this misleading presupposition your video started on but pressed through and I think you make legitimate points but like many, including JBP about post modernism and left wing politics, you over infer intentions at times to fit your argument.  Well made video though you definitely dont phone anything in"
"You should be on the JRE podcast. That will be an amazing discussion,"
"I hear a lot of people confusing _Cultural Marxism_ with _Cultural Bolshevism._ _Cultural Bolshevism_ was indeed a Nazi pejorative. But _Cultural Marxism_ was just a neutral, alternative name for Critical Theory back when the Frankfurt School was founded. (Although them term was later appropriated by right-wing conspiracy theorists.)"
"I think petersons biggest problem with the gender pronoun law is that the government would have to enforce you to use preferred pronouns, which is pretty authoritarian. He has used preferred pronouns when trans people ask him to before, he just doesn't like the idea of giving the government enough power to force people to what to say."
"I get that Peterson's characterisation of 'Postmodern Neo-Marxists' shouldn't really make sense. But there do seem to be a lot of people who combine Postmodern and Neo-Marxist arguments to justify their politics. And it's that contradiction which makes those people so impossible to reason with."

Will watch more before I criticize too much, but saying that undermines your cred as 'contrapoints'/highlights your blindspots. Your prod. quality and articulation are so good! I think stuff like that should be easy to refute for your namesake."
"Don't politics follow from our private (local) lives?  If we can't get it right locally, should we be making national decisions?  I think that's an intelligent point of Peterson's.  Consider the results; rural America is far more peaceful than Urban America, despite being less educated and supporting Trump.  The necessary question is which should we respect more?  I'm straight, mostly, I think.  But your video here is actually sexy in a kind of Rob Zombie kind of way.  Fuck if I know.  Anyway, love the creativity and the fact you actually gave Peterson a decent shake, considering your position politically.  Your jokes and satire actually are worthy of response, which is unusual from the Left.  I don't think reasoning is what you think it is.  The foundation of reason is will.  Where does will come from?  Also, your slide at 16:45 is incorrect.  SJWs, feminists, academic admin, liberal (left wing) politicians, and the SJWs populating corporate HR can all be classified under 'Marxists.'  It's a spectrum  Guess I should define 'Marxist.'  It's not about friend or enemy.  It's a conflict of ideology.  Marxism leads to the adoption of a form of power politics ideology; this falls into a spectrum.  The issue is time.  A democratic socialist over time will adopt more and more controlling laws, eventually ending in a communist or fascist state.  The people must pull against this, we have to fight for smaller government; and if we do well, we can simply hold our liberty as it is.  Marxism originally was identity politics, forming lines along class.  While I am sure this concept has existed since prehistory, I can only name it as Marxism because Marx truly defined it.  The only difference between this and neo-Marxism is that the latter incorporates race and gender, as well as SES.  Peterson doesn't justify any particular hierarchy.  He simply says they are inevitable one way or the other"
"you're very funny and entertaining but there are a lot of things wrong with your analysis of Peterson's arguments and seemingly a surface level understanding of them... for one, his 'backlash' is not to 'target gender equality, lgbt acceptance, and civil rights'... what kind of nonsense is that? He completely advocates for equality of opportunity and for individuals to take personal responsibility and have the freedoms afforded by the West. I don't understand why you are confused about his messages if you say you've watched so much of his content... He also doesn't 'tell people what to do or how to live their lives', he gives people guidelines that he has seen work for people to have a meaningful life based on his many years of experience as a clinical psychologist.. 'the left doesn't tell people what to do' lol that's a good one. They absolutely attempt to shape the way others think through control of the media and demonize behavior and thought that deviates from their opinions. 'The patriarchy' is a misleading concept that Peterson explains in depth in some of his lectures... Don't you understand why he compares so called 'transgender activism' to the fundamental ideology that drove the Soviet Union? It's using identity politics to separate people into groups instead of as individuals and pit the groups together as 'oppressor vs oppressed' which is just a slight of hand rebranding of Marxist thought, which actually is quite dangerous. Yeah your definition of identity politics is so wrong... what equality and rights are 'POC, gay, transgender, and women' not afforded in Western societies? The hierarchies that exist in Western civilization are hierarchies of competence, as JP says. Most people in power are not there because they unfairly swiped it, but because they worked hard enough and had successful enough ideas to climb to the top... People requesting different pronouns to suit their 'individual needs' is not at all what Peterson was fighting, it was the legislative mandating of compelled speech under penalty of law regarding using the right pronouns that he objected to which is something the left pushes. How is compelled speech in any way good? Lastly, JP advocates for Judeo Christian values because they work by giving people discipline and order in their lives so they can bear life's suffering and make something of themselves instead of blaming society for all of their shortcomings."
"Not that often you come across a leftist who is not utterly toxic and full of bile, subbed"
"'I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people, but....'  Yeah if it only just STOPPED THERE... So, how many genders are there again?"
"Not a bad video but there are a few details you get wrong about Jordan Peterson. With regards to what Peterson calls 'Postmodern Neo-Marxists', he recognises that the two labels are (or rather should be) contradictory, as one is a grand narrative based in modernism and the other being fundamentally opposed to and wanting to deconstruct narratives. He recognises this and that is why he constantly goes on about it, for the very reason that it should be contradictory, even though so-called Neo-Marxist Postmodernists still exist, that is; people who are very much postmodernist in their view of society and the history of society but at the same time still try to push Marxism as the one legitimate way we ought to structure it if we are to attain freedom, justice and equality for all.   A lot of the controversial things he says are just that; they're short, expedient, oversimplified soundbites (which I dislike) that at time may even sound inaccurate or dubious in the way he might say them in interviews, as they are designed to grab attention, but if one were to watch his own longer videos on his channel he articulates what he means much more clearly and succinctly and it starts to make sense.   As for casting clearly different parts of the 'left' as a sort of postmodernist monolith (again, expedient soundbites), I think he is more referencing the large influence postmodernist thought has slowly had over time on the more recent movements on the left, whether they themselves realise it or not.  All one would have to do is watch any number of MTV decoded or the more out there BuzzFeed videos to see the influence critical race theory has had on it's content (low hanging fruit I know but such channels command large audiences and therefore influence).  Just my two cents anyway, other than that enjoyed the video."
"I'm saddened by 'Pomo Neo-Marxism'  Come on, 'Pomo Neo-Mo-Xo'! Or even 'Pomo Neo-Marxo'! They were right there! :D"
"I stopped watching political crap but I'm making an exception for you. Subscribed!"
"The more videos I watch, doesn't matter if they're liberal, conservative, SJW or alt-right, the more I get confused about what post-modernism is."
"you look exactly like jordan peterson"
"wew lads we found a gaylady who wants to police people's speech"
"A few things:  Dr. Peterson doesn’t “tell you how to live.”  He points out empirically derived models of how to live if you wish to have a statistically higher chance of feeling more fulfilled and being more successful.  These axioms and choices tend to lead to long term happiness.  That’s an important nuance that you’ve missed.  Social justice is the idea that “Justice” isn’t adequate, necessitating the need for a modifier on the concept.  If justice is a blind concept that indiscriminately rights wrongs, then why the need for the modifier?  Social justice uses group perspectives instead of individual perspectives, placing higher values on minority groups and harsher penalties on non-minority groups because of perceived advantages in order to right perceived wrongs in wealth and status inequalities, even if these inequalities aren’t inequities.  This idea stems from postmodernism and the tenets of Marxism.    Google Women’s studies and read the definitions and objectives from the universities and colleges that appear under the search results.  Common themes include: social justice, inequality (without the distinction of inequity), intersectionality, etc.  Take the 2nd and 3rd grouping and see where the overlaps across the country in the the US exist in universities.  You will find that universities across the country are teaching these fields to students, even though 80% of the underlying research sees 0 citations, meaning scientists don’t accept the research as valid.  If the concepts in women’s studies, such as social justice, are compared to Post modernism and neo-Marxism, the parallels are staggering.    Take a few hours and do research, not just watch a few videos and claim to have a deep understanding of the material.  I’m a scientist, so as such I am an empiricist.  His general claim is accurate.    I think your failing in the understanding of his critique comes from certain times when he says something that isn’t hyper precise.  Example:  the interview with Cathy Newman when he reacted to the trans-activists question.  He was comparing the ones he has had  interactions with.  In his personal videos his publicly added the nuance that he doesn’t believe the activists he has interacted with represent the trans community.    Pay closer attention before grossly misrepresenting his content."
"got to 1:30 and he's already been misrepresented, cool. Probably a fine video, but I'll never find out."
"I think Peterson is harmless overall when he's discussing Jungian psychology, since that's his wheelhouse. It's when he starts to dip into WWII, gender roles, and even *clinical* psychology that he doesn't sound too bright. And I've seen a few of his Q&A's where he gets a blatantly anti-Semitic question and doesn't immediately denounce the person who asks it."
"Your misleading when you open your talk about describing Jordan Peterson. He argued that forced speech takes away the RIGHTS of Canadians and has no place in Law. If you start your video out dishonest like this why should anyone bother listening to some Dude dressed like a Chick. Come on try and do better if you want any respect."
"OK good points about his mislabel of 'postmodernist neo-marxists'. I also feel he gets too riled up with the 'destruction of the west' idea, so I can easily agree with those points in the video.  However. What Peterson is saying with the lobster argument is that hierarchies aren't necessarily evil and, naturally, you agree. Then you continue to say there are 'gender hierarchies'? What Peterson implies is that hierarchies can often come about due to some having more affinity for 'positions of power', while others are have more affinity to be 'the crowd'. He seems to imply that, from the data he has viewed, men are MORE LIKELY to be assertive and have the 'qualities' to be at the top CEOs and women are 'less likely'. Whether this is true is a matter of whether or not he has read the data correct. He NEVER says women can't get to the top. He NEVER says all hierarchies are just.   Now you say he never outright says a point, but leaves it hanging in the context. But this? The context is there are fewer women than men are in the top positions. His claim 'women on average tend to be more agreeable which has empirically been shown to not be suitable for these jobs'. If that's a controversial statement then you shouldn't find it controversial and you just have to find opposing evidence to prove it wrong.   Also dropping a fact like there are biological differences in the sexes and hinting at that being a possible reason for under-representation of women a) doesn't discount possible societal disadvantages women might face, b) isn't controversial even if it's implied as the sole reason for why women are underrepresented in these areas. It's not controversial, because you can simply prove it wrong by counter evidence. It's only controversial if you think it's trying to call for unfairness...  A lot of people don't outright say implications because sometimes, these might not be true; they're just throwing ideas out there and Cathy Newman would go to town on trying to call him a misogynist if he was like 'women aren't suited to work in high levels'. In addition, there might be other reasons behind a certain occurrence on top of the fact he is saying...."
"Peterson got famous by saying it was wrong for the Canadian government to compel all people by law to use whatever words one group of people decided they wanted to be used. It is surprising that his 15 minutes of fame has lasted so long."
"Love to see you on the Rubin Report!"
"This is very well done. Of course, identity politics was very much one of the main concerns of totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. They wanted to eliminate groups which had the wrong identity - kulaks, Jews, Roma, intellectuals, people with glasses.  Individualism was more an American idea, as seen in so many American films where an individual stands up for freedom and justice"
"All good and well but how do you explain the shit that's happening on North American University campuses?"
"Your jokes aren't funny, but I encourage you to continue because I'm sure you'll get it. These things take time to perfect.  I think your points against Peterson are pretty weak and I'm certain that a man like him would destroy you in debate.  That said, I think you would find that more or less, he's on your side, or at least the part of you that wants the best in yourself. He's not a monster and his ideas are pretty widely applicable, even if you take them with a grain of salt."
"The ONLY thing that would have made this video better was if Jordan Peterson himself played ur JP Bot"
"Peterson has made my life much better. I love seeing some reasonable criticism of him for once.  Well made video and more power to you!"
"I'm obsessed with you"
"Well I saw someone post your video on Russell Brand's podcast with Jordan Peterson, I became curious enough to click it and got about 6 minutes into the video before I lost all interest in continuing my venture... The video is clearly thought out and put together really well but I just wasn't able to force myself through the 'funny bits' to get to your points.   I tried! Another time and another video, perhaps?"
"Chomsky loathes post modernism."
"Watch the 50s video Posture Pals.  Will frighten."
"Contra Points, I am falling in love with your truly perfect humour and razor sharp insight. Please tear a new assholes in Rya, she is fucking horrid"
"Thank you for that. I am so tired of Peterson. Seriously...clean your room? If you are above 12 and need to be told to clean your room...no words...what next? Clean your ass? Change your undies?"
"I'm glad people are starting to take Jordan Charlatan to task"
"My knees get weak when you diss Derrida like that..."
"i don't agree with you at all but it was a funny video! especially with the jordan batherson part"
"No wonder all the drugged up degenerates support you. What is wrong with this world?"
"Hey CP and CP viewers!  Can you recommend other channels that can give counterviews to JBP?  Awesome video! You got yourself another subscriber, from the 'JBP side'."
"hmmm - first off, good video, this is funny and well delivered, and a fine critique.  However, I think you can't see the wood for the trees on 'post-modern neo-marxism.' I would say that the fact that the definitions are vague is because the coalition of people that he is describing is very academically loose, despite their political convergence. While they might have disagreements internally which in an academic sense seem quite large (such as the difference between marxists and SJWs), in the real world they are all very much on the same side of most issues, particularly under the shared banner of 'intersectionality' (which I note you didn't touch on in this video, despite the fact that it is key to petersons description of this coalition) and the belief that the entire system of western civilisation is oppressive and should be overturned. While these two groups have large differences *on paper* , at the street level, they attend the same events and want many of the same things... if a group acts like a coherent entity, then describing them like one is not unreasonable at all. You even said it yourself that 'people with experience in leftist circles know that marxists and identity politics activists are constantly at each others throats.' Built into this is the fact that they are very much in the same 'leftist circles.'  I agree that post-modern neo-marxism is a clusterfuck of an idea, but I would argue that this is more a reflection of the poor state of left-wing thought than of petersons ability to identify what that thought is."
"Oppressor and Oppressed dynamics are still ever present in the Postmodernists' motivation for its refutation of all hierarchies. 'Post-modern neo-Marxist' is not as nonsensical as you would believe. My best guess is that you're getting caught in the Semantics of your misinterpretation of his thesis. I'm not convinced."
"Look, it's a nice and fun video. Funny even at multiple points. I also appreciate the fact that you're willing to even have a dialogue about this as experiences with the rad-left (not implying you are here, just speaking from literal experience which tends to shy away most from even engaging these days with those just flat out in the left) end up turning into name-calling and eventually totally shutting off their ears. So watching someone who's not only taking an interest in JP's points but also thought about them to a certain extent is more than refreshing. However... I've gotta say you may be either misrepresenting certain intentions of his or just possibly misunderstanding them.   As a for instance, you say that he justifies hierarchies existing in the context of him approving of them. However, this isn't the case as he doesn't think of them as being morally just, he simply states they exist and that by trying to go against something so ingrained within our primate brains is going to be a really fucking hard game to play. That famous line from the NBC video saying 'the left should be way more pessimistic' is exactly pointing this out. It's not that 'Hey you shouldn't talk about inequality' because he very well insists that inequality exists. He was stating that you can't lay inequality at the feet of JUST those same hierarchies that stemmed from the past to create modern day capitalist and western societies. It's the matter of trying to treat a symptom but not the disease itself. The disease being a society that outpaced our own biology and it's now reeling from it.  In terms of the idea of postmodern neo-marxism, the idea behind this concept is the complete reductionist attitudes that postmodernists behave in which end up banding people together in those camps of the short-list of about 8 categories you posted in the video. Then, by banding them together, they proceed with the marxist idea of classes within those groups that have been slighted or wronged in some way (proletariat), shape or form and convince them that there's this broad and evil enemy (patriarchy(bourgeoisie) ) that has to be brought low in order for them to have any success. It's not a hard concept to understand when you see it in practice, but when you look simply at the origins and the conflict they had decades ago... then yeah I can see how it seems silly to put the two into the same camp. But by that same logic it doesn't make much sense for intersectionality political groups to exist when on one hand they preach freedom of women's rights but then also say that muslim cultural practices need to be included within those rights and discussions. It's this faulty idea of all the people that are under-represented are necessarily going to like or even work well together... which sort of explains the whole lot of irrationality when it comes to those same identity politics. Groups of people are flat out going to have different opinions and goals sometimes. That is what a dominance hierarchy means. It means we're all fighting either for ourselves or the group we fall into representation with. Is it morally just? Nope, not really at its most basic and brutal functions. Should we stop doing that? Yeah probably if we suddenly think we're capable of doing that with no dishonesty... but ask yourselves if you think that's even a realistic probability? I liked star-trek too and that's a great societal end-goal but we are SO far out from reaching that on a global scale right now it's putting the cart before the horse.  I mean you hit the conundrum on the head yourself where we pay for university to tell us capitalism is bad but then say ok go work for capitalism now. What sort of weird and strange marriage is that? Well, it's the same kind of weird and strange marriage, that at it's foundation seems nonsensical, that postmodern neo-marxism is.   All said, this isn't to deny or excuse that the fascist politics of the extreme-right are in any shape better, because extremism on both sides turns people into lunatic ideologues, focused only on helping their group and the rest be damned. In some cases they even actually mean the others will be damned in a religious sense. In the worst cases they devolve over the most basic concept of racial identity, which is such a tribalistic mindset it really is hard to believe that we even engage in it these days... but like I stated before we're simply not even close to the point of moving past the things we should have long ago, but we can all at least be made aware of them and work towards recognition and shouting down those that legitimately practice it. I think that's what JP meant in one of his lectures. That yes, the road we all have ahead of us is shit and it's suffering. But if we can move even a little bit closer to the idealization of heaven and move further from this hell we're throwing ourselves into (all of this figuratively if you wish) then so be it. That is worth the damn (he probably said bloody) effort. If we improve the world even a little bit by these engagements and can find some common ground then the walls of text at 2 AM are worth writing."
"So...you want to sck Peterson´s d1ck or what was this about?"
"'Someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape' XD"
"I feel like the real itch behind JP's spooky, spooky post-modern shadow monster is just the fear of deconstructionism, and the idea that we'll scrutinize all of our societal pillars so intensely that they'll crumble under the weight. Not only does that make the foundation of western civilization sound super fragile (and why would you want a society in which the fundamental principles can be eroded that easily), but that questioning and inward analysis IS 'western civilization.' That's what the Enlightenment was: a reconsidering of beliefs previously taken for granted. Most schools of post-modern thought are a direct outgrowth of that analytical approach to dissecting the world around us."
"This channel is absolute garbage."
"“Clock me, Amadeus.” Shit, I laughed."
"Hey Contra,   I love all of your videos and I think you are just great. I was wondering what your opinion was on something. How do you feel about the term pansexual?  I used to call myself pansexual back in my Tumblr days but i kept being called out by people who said it was basically the same as bisexuality. I disagree but what do you think?   Keep up the great videos, I hope you can answer this question somehow one day!! <3"
"I fuckin love you, please don't stop doing what you're doing!"
"Great video, however I have one serious gripe with it. Peterson argues that post-modern marxism is a direct evolution of classical marxism wherein the idea of oppression of workers is transmogrified into oppression of whoever is currently not in power. That is is his justification for the combination of the two labels, and given that definition, I think some of his points do make sense. Many of those obsessed individuals shutting down lectures about topics they do not like will justify it with the inherent power struggle which makes shutting down speech a morally justified tool. I'd love to see a deconstruction of this specific argument, mainly because I haven't been able to find a flaw in it myself, nor have I really read or heard anyone else really come to grips with it."
"I love you"
"Contra looking neat!"
"You're absolutely right that Marxism and postmodernism are incompatible philosophies -- yet when I converse with the average leftwing person today, I often see them spouting both ideologies and trying to graft them together, such as by superimposing the intersectional grid of oppression onto Marx's original concept of the ongoing struggle between lords and serfs. And also juggling their belief in no objective reality, no such thing as race, or biological differences between men and women, with their insistence on dividing everyone into the category of oppressed or oppressor."
"You are a men. Deal with it."
"Post-modernism destroying the west is not a conspiracy, but a reality."
"I'm only half way through and I already love you. I also love that weirdo Peterson. My only remaining question is are you ambidextrous?? :P"
"Wtf! Bro, go back to the shower chambers pls !"
"God I have this fuckboy-in-his-40s cousin who worships Peterson like a DIETY. Every single conversation he brings up Jordan Peterson, he carries around his books to lend people. I've been trying to politely tell him this fucking guy SUCKS but he's way too convinced. I'll keep these in mind the next time I feel like ruining a family gathering by being The Political Gay Cousin, thank you ContraPoints"
"I kept thinking the Peterson stand-in was a person with a mask on their face, an then you pulled it in the bathtub"
"YES MOMMY  IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SHIT ON THIS MAN AS ELEGANTLY AS U DID"
"look for this video 'Atheist Debates - Thoughts on my conversation with Dr. Jordan Peterson' to see more of his bullshit debunked"
"So my boyfriend introduced me to your channel and I think I need to leave him now. I'm in love with you."
"I'm 4 real in love"
"We need more Marxist professors to make the cuntry great again. Gotta speak power to truth."
"This is the first of your vids I have seen. You are fucking awesome."
"Yes, Marxism is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy.  This video is a finessed critique of Peterson."
"<3"
"Why does philosophy have to be so hard??"
"JUST DISCOVERED YOUR CHANNEL I LOVE YOU AND I'VE BEEN BINGE WATCHING ALL OF UR VIDS!!!!! PLEASE MAKE MORE VIDEOS BC UR FUCKING HILARIOUS AND U MAKE AMAZING POINTS <3"
"Absolute garbage. The humor was cringey and the ideas shallower than bath-water. Please stop."
"Make a video about vegetarianism, i d like to hear your opinion about that, guess also would be quite fun."
"You are a good person, thank you."
"Really really reaaaaallllly loved this. Have gotten a lot out of some of what Peterson talks about, mainly the tips on 'getting one's shit together' and I found his take on some issues to be an interesting version of conservative commentary. He's clearly a very intelligent man, but he undeniably has a horse in the race when it comes to white, heteronormative, capitalist framings of society, and worst of all, he genuinely seems to have a dearth in his ability to be empathetic which he'll dismiss by saying 'I'm a clinician'. I'd love to see his take on things if his children are to come out as being gay, trans, or somewhere on the queer spectrum.  Anyway, delighted to finally see a rational rebuttal of Peterson. The student activists were really becoming fish in a barrel for him!"
"As much as I love JP, it does have to be said he boxes in post-modernist thinkers to an extreme degree."
"Good vid but work o'n the voice"
"I'm a really big fan of JBP, and I'm also a really big fan of this video. There are a couple of points you made that i take issue with, but in more of a 'I kinda wish we could chat this out and come to a better understanding' way, not so much a 'go fuck yourself way.' Have my sub, you've certainly earned it. I hope someday Peterson starts to appeal to you a little more. Thanks for being so respectful and thoughtful in your criticisms."
"Also a bit of a Peterson follower, in a loose sense, not interested in his books but I've enjoyed his podcast apoearances. I found this video very funny and insightful."
"Fan of peterson here, I don't agree with any of your qualms about the lobster king, but I found you very articulate, entertaining, funny and interesting. You didn't try to demonize him in the way I thought you might, in the way that many of his critics do. Subscribed."
"love this video, Contra!! <3   does Peterson make a compelling case that 'Postmodern Neo-Marxism' = so called SJW agenda = undoing of Western society?  as you say, the black-and-white view that the 'SJW agenda' is 100% evil and wrong and stifling and oppressive to free speech, is very reductive.  tbh, i don't agree with the new 'have to use correct pronouns' Canadian Human Rights Act legislation either -- even if only because basic respect for others' existences in this way is still so controversial, that it isn't the right time yet for the legislation. right now, the legislation serves as more of slippery-slope-fallacy for scaremongering about loss of free speech, instead of being able to be implemented effectively. i understand those who would argue with me on that point though.  at any rate, *protections of freedom of speech, vs. protecting people from hate speech that leads to real violence* is a conversation worth having! and Peterson is one of the people dodging it, rather than having it.  'free speech at all costs' can mean the cost is human life, as we've seen with Charlottesville, the Charleston Shooter, etc., influenced by neo-Nazism...  when they're 'allowed' to speak about murdering people and let that hate fester, then unsurprisingly, murdering actually happens!  and it can be argued that platforms that let them talk to each other, online and such, are tacitly not only allowing, but COOPERATING with these evil conspiratorial groups!! notice i don't say 'is,' i say 'can be argued.'  so it's not as simple as, 'human rights are about freedom, including freedom of speech!'...because sometimes 'freedom of speech' contributes to factions that physically and psychologically harm people, in this case gender-nonconforming people.   so couldn't it theoretically make sense to at least admonish a professor, if that professor's refusal to use a student's correct pronoun contributed to said culture?  i think it's a very good question, a very good debate, that cannot be overdrawn with Peterson's 'SJWs are dangerous' hard stance."

"Can you do a video on immigration?"
"'The very idea of people REQUESTING different pronouns' ... this statement emphasizes the way you're twisting Peterson's words and views, throughout this video... although you do make some good points (but, try not being so blatantly bias).  AS YOU WELL KNOW, Peterson, NEVER had a problem with people 'REQUESTING' the use of different Pronouns.  He's problem IS ONLY with 'Compelled Speech'... governments FORCING people to speak and/or think the way THEY think is appropriate.  Governments, or any powerful group of people (and if you don't think extremist and/or activist groups don't have power, you're blind), should NEVER have the right, in ANY free society, to dictate what a person can say and/or think!!!  Next thing, you're gonna advocate for Re-education Centers, for Wrong-Think... and you will have to, if you think a Marxist-Utopia is even REMOTELY possible, given that, one person's Utopia is another person's Hell :P"
"You and JBP on Rubin's show would be FASCINATING!"
"Omg the bisexual manicure!!!!! 😂😂😂😂💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
"Peterson has addressed the apparent paradox of Post-Modernist Marxism. It's his belief that while Post-Modernists claim to have no objective values or categories, this is actually impossible for humans (this comes from his psychological-mythology beliefs) thus they insert, perhaps unconsciously, Marxism as their moral worldview."
"The fact that Nazis hated communists/Marxists and said they were plotting on taking over the world doesn't make it incorrect. The Nazis were also among the first that said smoking was bad for your health. Global revolution/conquest is the ultimate goal of Marxism/Communism."

"I don't know how I missed ContraPoints up til now.  Thank god for Current Affairs, who wrote an article that led me here (They thanked god for ContraPoints).  This is *exactly* what I want out of youtube, man.  I'm home.  <3"
"I'm a follower of Peterson's work, and I generally like what he's doing.  I also really appreciated your good-faith critique.  Good faith is becoming rare in today's polarized market of ideas.  But I have an observation.  Although you rightfully object to his framing and terminology, you also inadvertently confirmed much of what he says:   'They spend four years teaching us how capitalism is bad, and then they say: 'Now you're educated.  Good luck getting a job under a capitalist system.' '"
"I loooove this! One tiny note, the Cathy Newman interview was on Channel 4, not the BBC. :)"
"i haven't watched one of your videos in ages and your voice sounds so lovely!"
"Ok that was amazing!"
"oh shit son how is it that my anarcho socialist ass only found this channel today!? Some kind of crime has been committed against me I'm quite sure, now I just have to figure out who to be mad at. In any event, I love this channel now. LONG LIVE THE LOBSTER QUEEN!"

"Contra Points > Trixie and Catya Show of viceland"
"contra don't fucking deserve your beautiful, smart, sexy, funny, cute ass.   This Commie dies inside every time I remember I can't have you to myself. Lol"
"at 1:08 in this video 'reason, power, truth; these are the kind of topics I simply don't care about' This gets substanciated in the video by the complains about the Cathy Newman intervieuw that, even though Petersons statements are correct, what he might possibly might be insinuating by them is, according to ContraPoints, is dishonest.  Though at least I need to give ContraPoints credit for demonstrating the ability to distinguish between what is stated, and what might possibly be insinuated by the statement. (so far the first video I have seen of someone critisizing Peterson while actually being able to tell the difference between what is stated and what might possibly be insinuated by the statement) Without even an attempt at checking wether or not said possible insinuations were intended, this is just slander.  Perhaps ContraPoints better sticks to making videos on topics ContraPoins does care about instead."
"wait... are we sure we don't want to abolish lobster hierarchies? 🤔"
"i like Peterson but I think I like you more.   subbed"
"noone has ever said that 'lobster's exist in hierarchies, therefore we ought to support all hierarchies are natural'. You're a fucking idiot. The lobsters are brought up to illustrate the point that hierarchies pre-date society, they pre-date consciousness for fucks sake. The point is that hierarchies will ALWAYS exist, so what kind do we want ? We CANNOT get rid of hierarchies, and should not degenerate to that."

"You're forgetting JP is a jungian, he believes (and also says it on many occasions) that what he calls post modern Marxism is not a coherent world view. He would say: 'what do you know about what you believe' and that 'people don't have ideas, ideas have people'.  He thinks that Marxism (+ the adding of identity politics on top) got mixed up with postmodernism (or sceptics) because you can't act as a believer in postmodernism - Why do anything? That gives the postmodernist something to do."

"Up until the 6th century, most Christians were Syrians and most Syrians were Christians. But look at this account, written by the Syrian Christian John bar Penkaye, of the invading Muslims:  'When he saw that there was no amendment, he raised a barbarian kingdom against us, a people who would not hear supplications, who knew no compromise, no peace, and disdained flattery and meanness. Its delight was in shedding blood without reason, and its pleasure laying hands on everything. Its passion was raiding and stealing, and its food hatred and anger; it was never appeased by offerings made to it. When it had prospered and done the will of Him who sent it, it had taken possession of all the kingdoms of the earth, had subjected brutally all the peoples and brought their sons and daughters into a bitter slavery, had avenged in them the opprobrium of God the Word, and the blood of the martyrs of Christ shed through no fault of their own, then our Lord was satisfied and rested, and He agreed to give grace to his people. So the Lord, to punish the sons of Hagar 9 for the ravages they had made, gave them two leaders from the beginning of their kingdom and divided them into two sections.  This was so that we might understand the word that was spoken by our Saviour. But they were united until they had subjected the whole earth, but when they returned to tranquility and rested from war, they fought one another. Those in the West said: “superiority is due to us, and the king must be chosen from among us.” Those of the East contradicted them and claimed that it was to them that this was due. As a result of this contention, they came to blows. When they had settled the business according to their methods, the victory fell to the Westerners called Ummayyads 10, and this after a great slaughter that took place between them. A man among them named Mu`awiya 11, took the reins of government of the two empires: Persian and Roman. Justice flourished under his reign, and a great peace was established in the countries that were under his government, and allowed everyone to live as they wished. They had received, as I said, from the man who was their guide 12, an order in favour of the Christians and the monks. Similarly because of his guidance they held to the worship of one God, according to the customs of the old law. Firstly, they were so attached to the tradition of Muhammad who was their leader, that they inflicted the death penalty on anyone who seemed not to obey his commands. Their troops went every year into distant countries and islands, raided and brought back captives from all the nations that are under heaven. From every man they required only the tribute, and left him free to hold any belief, and there were even some Christians among them: some belonged to the heretics 13 and others to us.14 While Mu`awiya reigned there was such a great peace in the world as was never heard of, according to our fathers and our fathers' fathers. It was as if our Lord had said: “I will test you in this way, as it is written: ‘by grace and justice iniquity may be pardoned.’”'  It's really not that surprising that Muslims tend to still be like this, and since they oppresed Jews and Christians since their very beginnings until only recently, it's not that surprising we're resentful against them. But pointing out this out can only be interpreted by the left as evidence of racism. As Zizek predicts, they come up with a delusional fantasy about a white 'Other of the Other' who is behind the scene pulling the strings.  Edward Said pulls one of these Western howlers when he suggests that David Hume (your favorite queen) articulated his empiricism in connection with his racism. But he doesn't seem to want to conduct a genealogy of how medieval Muslim commentaries from the 9th century until the modern period talk about how Allah wants to send homosexuals to hell, inflict terrible corporal punishment on them. Or, in your example, ISIS is the result of a reading of Paradise Lost.   As you correctly point out, a true postmodernist *should* want to deconstruct the very idea of a monolithic 'West' and demonstrate that 'Western' intellectual history is a discontinuous ruptures, schisms, clashes of ideas, etc. between Roman Catholics, Albigensians, Anabaptists, and dudes who like scat porn. But those most influenced by postmodernists don't want to do this at all. This would be completely contrary to their true underlying political motives.   You're right that nothing about SJW ideology is non-Western, but they want very much to obscure this, ignoring that they are parasitic on Western ideals of equality and individualism even in critiquing a monolithic 'Western' mode of thinking or set of ways of thinking. Nietzsche, one of Peterson's favorite writers, hated the leftism (both anarchism and socialism) of his day precisely because he saw it as a pseudo-modernistic inheritance of Christian ideas that were secularized. For that matter, when SJWs point out that #NotAllMuslims believe in beating women, owning sex slaves and killing homosexuals, what they really mean is that it is perfectly possible to indoctrinate Muslims into modern Western values -- to 'white-wash' them.   Foucault believed that liberal democracy was a 'disciplinary society' that was no less constituted by relations of power than any other, but at the same time this is no less true of postmodernists. But this is no less true of the ethical injunctions present in Foucault's political activism. And it's no less true of Bill C-16 that Peterson became famous for protesting. As Carl Schmitt notes, there is nothing more ideological than the gesture that pretends to be post-ideological and 'neutral.' Threatening to fine or subject someone to 'anti-bias' training (ideological brainwashing) involves attempting to impose their power on those who disagree with the philosophy of linguistic idealism that underlies contemporary transgender ideology.   Politics is the articulation of the difference between friend and enemy, and Bill C-16 articulates as 'enemy' those who disagree with the the transgender ideology that has its roots in ideologues like Judith Butler and Michel Foucault, and it undertakes sanctions to 'protect' transgender people by punishing those who think differently and attempting to gas-light them into submission through trying to force them to believe something that they know is not true on pain of violence. I believe that a 'transwoman' is a man who 'feels feminine,' and that 'I identify as a woman' is nonsensical gibberish, and 'I am a woman' is a lie. This is simply what I believe, and there are those who experience this as violence, and there are those who believe my beliefs make me worthy of having violence inflicted upon me through instituting Bill C-16.  A man who wears a dress does not automatically begin a Stalinist, but someone who enforces Bill C-16 in order to 'protect' such people, is Stalinism at-the-gates. From Schmitt's perspective (and I think Schmitt is right here, and he is ironically close to Foucault), different political regimes must necessarily perceive others as aggressors, and each group will necessarily experience certain beliefs of incommensurable worldviews as forms of 'violence.' We're all violent aggressors -- postmodernists simply tend not to be honest about it when it's a cause they're defending."
"You're right that Marxists and neo-Marxists tend to be critical of identity politics because the latter are seen as obscuring allegedly more fundamental economic conditions that alienate and enslave people of all skin colors in fundamentally the same way, but I think it's telling that both advocates of identity politics and critics of identity politics both tend to cite some of the same authors, even if they differ in their application of the ideas. The fundamental idea is that the West, whiteness, white supremacy, the patriarchy, the bourgeoisie, capitalism, blah blah blah, is resonsible for literally everything. I think this is the central connecting link between neo-Marxism and postmodernism that really matters to Peterson, and the rest, in his eyes, is just details, even if there are groups among leftists who see one another as 'traitors to the revolution.'  So when Jordan Peterson says that biological differences between men and women are largely the result of differences in socioeconomic status, this is an attack on a large, homogeneous left who may disagree among themselves on how to understand a properly 'liberatory' social program, but they are all unified in their disagreement that this constitutes an example of 'neurosexism.' I think the essential expression of leftist resentment, regardless of what sort of '-ism' they pay lip service to, is that anyone who is disadvantaged socioeconomically is because they are oppressed by some 'Other of the Other.'   So both neo-Marxists and postmodernists alike might see patriarchy as a relatively autonomous cultural system, unlike a classical Marxist, who would see it as an epiphenomenon of 'capitalism,' but the point is that both object to the idea of the 'neurosexist' belief that there are enduring neurobiological tendencies between men and women that contribute to this difference. Men tend to be more interested in STEM fields that pay much more whereas women are more likely to be more interested jobs that involve interacfting with people; men tend to be more highly represented on both ends of the IQ bell curve, and tend to perform better in the visual-spatial categories that are essential for success in these fields, etc. The point is that these differences are simply not necessarily the result of oppression at all.   The minute you start saying anything about extremely heritable tendencies or abilities, the left loses their shit. Despite being one of the most validated predictors of criminality in psychology, as well as extremely heritable, IQ has all but disappeared as a reliable predictor of criminality in Western social science literature. And if you point out that schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder are all both highly heritable (sometimes primarily heritable), as well as very reliable predictors of criminality, the left loses their shit and blames it all on socioeconomic factors, oppression, patriarchy, etc. (these things can and do exacerbate and sometimes even produce these tendencies, but there is nonetheless a highly heritable component that produces such differences, and it's not always someone else's fault).  Leftists ridicule this as 'biological determinism' and Marxists will code it as 'the ruling idea of the bourgeoisie', neo-Marxists will code it as 'hegemony' a la Gramsci, postmodernists will ridicule it as a dominant 'discourse,' but it's all the same garbage -- resentment against the more fortunate and an insistence on seeing those who are less fortunate as oppressed, when this is not always the case. The point is not that Peterson is so far to the right that anyone to the left of him is one homogeneous blob of Stalinism, but that these leftists tend to commit the same kinds of errors even if they are articulated in terms of incommensurable theoretical frameworks.  I don't think Peterson's reticence in the Cathy Newman interview was an attempt to be able to frame himself as being strawmanned -- that sort of obscurantism just isn't his style. Look at what he says here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Ur71ZnNVk  Look at how reluctant the guy he's talking with is to accept the fact that, if you have an IQ of 83 or lower, you're pretty much nothing but a burden on society. This is primarily the result of genetics. This is how the left is in general.  I agree that the 'lobster argument' is goofy, but he clarifies further when he says we should expect continuity between animals and humans in the way we organize our social structures. Instead of appealing to lobsters, he should have talked about more closely related primate species. Gorillas males tend to dominate harems of females, and females exhibit sexual selection in which they seek out the physically largest and most dominant male. The female orangutan rejects sub-adult males and is only receptive to physically larger males who have undergone surges of testosterone that have made them more dominant.   Female squirrel monkeys and female hamadryas baboons likewise seek out the largest males. While most of these primate species have males that tend to actively dominate harem groups, attack competitive males and unreceptive females, in some of these species where females have more power, they still actively seek out dominant males even without constraint.   For example, female gelada baboons are the ones who initiate mating, and they will chase off males they don't like and can survive perfectly fine on their own, but they choose to actively seek the most dominant male (who is nonetheless at their mercy if they decide they don't like him). Even the female-dominant lemur species Verreaux's sifaka, whose females beat up males and take their food, are still attracted to males with the highest levels of testosterone, and in terms of reproductive success, are effectively harem groups even though they are not under male constraint.  How shocking that our reproductive and social habits so closely approximate those of our closest primate relatives. Shocking! I think Peterson's point would have been much more cogent if he had used these examples. But leftists routinely dismiss this kind of reasoning despite its obviousness. Again, this is the case whether we're talking about a second wave neo-Marxist feminist or a third wave feminist. The only reason they like bad boys (at least while they're ovulating) is because patriarchy made them do it, and since all men are complicit in patriarchy, it's all our fault. Unlike feminists, I very much support the right of women to choose their sexual partner without having to be lambasted for allegedly responding to social conditioning. But there's hardly anything more pathetic or deluded than a feminist who gets burned by dominant guys only to turn around and shriek at #YesAllMen 'You do this to me! Fix it. Make it better.'  I'd recommend Barbara Smuts' 'The Evolutionary Origins of Patriarchy' or almost anything by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy for an account of how these hierarchies spontaneously result from sexually antagonistic co-evolution, not a purely social 'patriarchy' that comes from nowhere and unilaterally conditions and determines the subjectivity of both men and women. The important thing, of course, is to avoid the naturalistic fallacy and conclude 'well, men evolved to be rape-y, so let's just accept rape' (said no evolutionary psychologist ever). We can combat these problematic tendencies without having to believe that all sexual differences between men and women are purely social.   For that matter, we can accept that men tend to watch more pornography because visual indicators of sterility are the most important determinants of sexual attraction and pornography hijacks these neural mechanisms. This is most likely watch chacma baboons masturbate when they see females with sexual swellings even when the swellings are only prostheses attached to females who have undergone ovarectomies, and they will pay (in grapes) to view images of this. Or, take for example, the idea common among second wave feminists that prostitution exists because men want to rape. I think it's obvious that men who solicit prostitutes tend to have more problematic tendencies, but these tendencies are common among primates as well.   Capuchin monkeys were trained to use money in the form of otherwise useless pieces of metal, and the male monkeys immediate began trading them for sex with females. The common chimpanzee, bonobo chimpanzee, rhesus monkeys, verreaux's sifaka, etc. all involve trade of resources for sex with females (this is true even though bonobo chimps and verreaux's sifaka are female dominant). They're just taking advantage of the sexual differences in behavior that tend to spontaneously result from differentials in parental investment (contrast this with the pipefish seahorse, in which it is the male who becomes pregnant instead of the female, and as a consequence, they are highly choosy and selective when confronted by several females competing with one another for a chance to mate).  Not only would they see this as an attempt to 'justify' patriarchy, but they specifically see it *only* as an example of justifying 'Western' patriarchy. If I were to cite Karen Bauer's 'Gender Hierarchy in the Qur'ān: Medieval Interpretations, Modern Responses' on how basically all medieval Muslim commentators believed in the subordination of women to men (which usually involved divinely sanctioned beatings), I would be accused of Islamophobia."
"Jordan Peterson sympathizer here -- I actually like this video. But your 'Why I Quit Academia' summarizes exactly what Peterson hates about contemporary leftism. They (inconsistently, as you point out) insist on the existence of something like a monolithic 'Western' hegemony that has just harbored an obsessive hatred for brown people for thousands of years, thanks to Edward Said's horrific 'Orientalism' and its legacy among contemporary postcolonial critics. They take a highly local phenomenon peculiar to modern Western imperialism in the Middle East and generalize it across thousands of years, even though Western Christians have usually gotten along just fine with 'Eastern' Christians (except for differences in Christology, which was a purely theological and not a racial matter), and the bad reputation Islam has, arose among Syrian and Assyrian Christians whom Arab Muslims invaded and massacred.  The point isn't that being transgender automatically makes you a Stalinist or Maoist. But what Peterson was specifically protesting was the use of Bill C16, which effectively says that they will lock you in a cage with rapists and murderers if you don't vocalize your allegiance to their political agenda and force you to say things you don't actually believe. You voice agreement with Peterson's complaints against the authoritarian tendencies of the left in stifling even minor disagreements, but now the left is threatening to jail those who disagree by reading their disagreement as inherent violent.   I agree that Peterson is at fault for not explaining what he means by 'Postmodern Neo-Marxism,' and left without definition, the concept does appear contradictory, especially if 'Neo-Marxism' is conflated with classical, 'orthodox' Marxism as is done in this video. Marx takes his 'oppressor / oppressed' duality from Hegel and articulates it in purely class-oriented terms, as the bourgeoisie vs. the proletariat, and structuralists and post-structuralists reject Marx's realism, materialism and economism, but they just go on to proliferate a whole bunch of other identities (some obviously real and legitimate, some more questionable) that are oppressed in social and cultural respects.  It's true that post-structuralists adopt a skepticism that seems to almost take the form of a kind of linguistic idealism, but despite the epistemological and metaphysical differences you point out in your video, there is real ideological continuity between Marxists and post-structuralists. Antonio Gramsci, for example, departs from classical Marxist emphasis in rejecting exclusive emphasis on the allegedly alienating effects of the capitalist mode of production on subjectivity and emphasizes that cultural hegemony can have causal efficacy in its own right. Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer, also neo-Marxists, likewise come to emphasize the role of the 'culture industry' in pacifying the masses.   Louis Althusser was a teacher of both Foucault and Derrida, and following the fall of the Berlin wall, Derrida declares his allegiance to Marx and argues that deconstruction is the true heir of Marxism. Althusser helped to mediate his distinctly Marxist version of structuralism to later post-structuralists, and while they jettison Marx's primary concern with economic factors, looking at power relations and how they code our way of viewing the world becomes their major concern.  Edward Said specifically cites his reliance on Gramsci's analysis of hegemony and Foucault's discourse analysis as the grid through which he analyzes Western perceptions of 'the East.' It's because of this reflexive hatred of the West that, despite being gay, Foucault favored the Iranian revolution. Anyone who's read any of the scores of medieval Muslim hadith or Qur'anic commentators knows that Muslims have always hated homosexuals, which makes it at first seem odd that Foucault would support them. But once we understand that cultural Marxism ('postmodern neo Marxism') is primarily by a hatred of the West, it makes more sense.  I think 'cultural Marxism' is actually an accurate description of what Peterson is getting at, rather than some sort of Neo-Nazi dog-whistle. Now, if Peterson started using the term 'Jewish Bolshevism,' then we should be worried. I hate Marxism but I don't think it's a plot deliberately formualted and perpetrated by a centralized, secrete elite whose purpose is to finance white genocide and finance international Jewry.   Hitler believed this because Jews tended to be disproportionately represented in Marxist circles, but this is just one of innumerable cases of an ethnic or racial group falling in with a bad crowd, which happens to various populations all the time.    The identity politics that Peterson is criticizing is fascist. Stalinism, as Mussolini pointed out, was obviously a form of Slavic fascism. Ugo Spirito said the same thing about Maoism after visiting China.  What made Hitler's use of anti-Communist propaganda so bad was that he used it specifically to pin it as a discourse that was being perpetrated by a specific racial in order to justify persecuting them. But anti-Communism was not original with Hitler at all. Winston Churchill hated Communism and even noted that Jews tended to be disproportionately represented among Communists, but he noted that there are plenty of 'good Jews' who are not Communists and he rejected the idea that there was some kind of unified racial conspiracy. Hitler's anti-communism was bait that led to a much darker close to which anti-Communism does not ordinarily lead.   One of the main reasons Hitler even enjoyed any support is because the German populace had good reason to believe Communism was a real threat. By the time Hitler came to power in 1933, Stalin's manmade famines were just ending - they killed 7-10 million Ukrainians by stealing their food supply in the name of his collectivization campaign, and 38 percent of the Kazakh. This was a prelude to the Soviet Union's murder of 12 million Eastern Orthodox Christians and their closure of the vast majority of mosques because of the Marxist idea that religious and spiritual belief is inherently 'reactionary.'  You argue that Marxism and postmodernism are fundamentally at odds on the grounds that Marxism is a grand narrative whereas postmodernism is a skepticism of ground narratives, but I believe (and I think Peterson would agree with thsi) that humans are so inherently predisposed to generating grand narratives that self-identifying postmodernists are no less modernistic in this respect. Matthew Sharpe articulates ZIzek's critique of the anthropological and psychoanalytic consequences of postmodernism in this respect:  'On this analysis, the generalisation of reflexivity means that the Symbolic Order (the underlying socio- cultural rules) is disintegrating because it lacks a metaphysical guarantee in the ‘Other of the Other’ (such as Nature, Tradition or God). Instead of the big Other, or Symbolic Order, what we get is a multiplicity of localised fragments of the big Other with a merely regional application, together with a proliferation of ‘little brothers’ and ‘obscene neighbours’, sinister others who – in the absence of a communal Symbolic Order that might constrain their action – confront the subject as bearers of a threatening enjoyment. In the place where the Symbolic Order was, there is only the competing confusion of a multiplicity of incommensurable language games, heterogeneous discursive universes whose coexistence depends upon the suspension of warfare rather than a social pact. This situation is exemplifi ed, for Žižek, in the proliferation of specialised committees called upon to deliberate on ethical dilemmas: the lack of a Symbolic Order means that moral questions cannot be referred to a social consensus, but become the province of fragmentary and transient ‘little big Others’. For Žižek, the nonexistence of the big Other means the dissolution of the communal network of customary norms and social institutions that regulate the everyday lives of all members of a society. The consequence is that many people adopt the desperate solution of paranoid fantasies about a Real ‘Other of the Other’, a world conspiracy, new messiah or alien invasion, as a compensatory delusion. This is an analysis that, in psychoanalytic terms, indicates a diagnosis of postmodern culture as a psychotic condition.'  Zizek says:  'The paradoxical result of the mutation in the non- existence of the big Other – of the growing collapse of symbolic efficiency – is thus the proliferation of different versions of a big Other...The typical subject today is the one who, while displaying cynical distrust of any public ideology, indulges without restraint in paranoiac fantasies about conspiracies, threats and excessive forms of enjoyment of the Other.'  This 'Other' of the postmodern subject is 'The West,' 'patriarchy,' 'white supremacy,' all of the reflexive stupidity that you mentioned in your account of why you quit academy. The borderline-psychotic delusional fantasy that ISIS is the result of John Milton is exactly the kind of paranoid belief we would expect from humans in light of our tendency to spontaneously generate totalizing worldviews. Even if they *say* that they reject grand narratives, they generate them with all the consistency of a fundamentalist.   lmao @ transgendered disabled drone pilots btw. But once again, your critique here presupposes that Peterson is talking about classical Marxists. But he specifies 'neo-Marxist' for a reason, even if, as I've admitted before, his use of terminology is poorly elaborated and contains an inner tension due to differences in belief between neo-Marxists and postmodernists. But the neo-Marxist Antonio Gramsci's concept of the 'subaltern' is readily taken up by postcolonial theorists who otherwise are highly influenced by post-structuralist writers."

"Postmodernism began as an architectural movement, a contrast to modernism. When postmodern theory really gets going in the 1980s certain Marxists hated postmodernism.

"did you literally comb through all these comments removing the negative ones? This is bizarre, like, you're on youtube saying stuff that half of north america hates but there is no abusive commentary. Not even any positive comments which cite specific ideas you've talked about.  Your entire video boils down to 'revealing' Peterson's ideological incongruity of his label 'postmodern marxist's', ya know, because those two things can't exist together and are 'fundamentally at odds'. You build it up as if it would deserve your dropping the mic right after, but Peterson has literally talked about the incongruity of those two ideas, and how that chaos is a defining feature of the type of people he is trying to describe; the conceptual incongruity of marxism and postmodernism manifests as a chaotic person, obviously. BESIDES THAT though, you're doing what you always do. You're boiling the whole argument down to the specifics of labels, as if that invalidates his massive body of work of which that one label is one small part. He doesn't talk about 'terms' infinitely, unlike you. He talks about IDEAS, like the IDEA that you're using language to 'proove' that 'it's difficult to say' he doesn't want mass murder against all non whites and women. THAT'S DANGEROUS! Don't you get it? Instead of playing language games, please have the ACTUAL CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD. You, Contra, want degeneracy, no labels, capitalism to fall apart. You are deeply skeptical of institutions. Peterson is fairly religious and conservative, he likes institutions, he doesn't want massive sudden social change, but not because he hates you. He believes that the institutions of the west are what allow you, Contra, to live the way you do in more safety than anywhere else in the world. And that's not to say that trans people don't face a struggle. But I believe that it is western institutions which are the cause of the west being out ahead of the rest of the world in terms of interest in helping trans people.   What's your endgame?"
"ugh your mind"
"I was only half listening to this and it's full of holes everywhere.   The most recent one was 'But then you can use the lobster argument to justify any hierarchy!'  No. Jordan Peterson is saying that the radical left is anti ALL hierarchies. He flat out says that the radical left believes that all hierarchies are based on power as opposed to competence. The radical left wants to get rid of all hierarchies. The point about the lobster is that you can't do away with hierarchies because the idea of hierarchy is fundamental, hardwired into, the human mind.   Again, the radical left does want to tear down all hierarchies. The furthest left you can go is the idea that society should be set up in such a way that we eliminate all positions. Let's say there is a company. Everyone that works there owns it and makes the decisions. There is no distinction between a janitor and a CEO, they are all just employees, or if there is a distinction then the janitor is equal in every way to the CEO. And you're closing your mind off if you don't think that you could present that to people on the far left and get a positive response to it. So we say, OK, let's have a janitor and a CEO. The janitor will clean and the CEO will make high level decisions that affect the direction of the company. OK, well, how do we decide on who will be what? The far left would honestly say, well, just assign it at random.   In short, Jordan Peterson is defending the idea of hierarchy as being valid because he views the idea of a valid hierarchy as under attack by the left.   See, your argument is essentially this :   Jordan Peterson says, 'Well, we have a common ancestor that first developed the gastrointestinal system that we see in ourselves today, and this means that we must eat things to survive.'  Contrapoints, 'Jordan Peterson wants us to eat rocks.'  or actually I suppose I can get closer  Contrapoints, 'Jordan Peterson wants us to eat hemlock'   So it's true that we can place constraints on what a valid hierarchy (meritocracy/nondespotic) should look like just like it's valid that we can put constraints upon what constitutes an edible to a human being. Must be Organic. Must be non-poisonous."
"would smash subbed"
"This is great. I generally like Dr. Peterson, but these things have bothered me a bit and I don't know enough about Post Modernism or Marxism to know if his concerns with some things are reasonable. This is exactly the video I needed to know to verify that I disagree with him on that end of things. He does certainly throw babies out with bathwater, and has expressed disdain for things that have to do with Marxism, even if he has no argument against the things themselves. As a Pragmatist, he views different sets of truths as toolboxes. I think it'd be better to take things tool by tool. Thanks for posting a rational and entertaining analysis of something important!"

"shit is weak. compared to the last 100,000 years of human history professor peterson is a veritable demigod of progressive liberalism. all these arguments, counter arguments and commentaries upon commentaries lack depth and appreciation for how enormously godlike humans have become in terms of raw power in an enormously short time. that anyone would find a serious objection to a human urging us to proceed cautiously in a world mostly of our own design, the consequences of unreflective action in which no party can credibly predict, is the idological equivalent of icarus's flight ... in fact this ancient myth is designed to teach humans exactly the limits of our intellect that every generation continuously must discover or ignores at its peril ... don't assume because you don't often see wolves on your strolls down city sidewalks that the laws of nature ... and human nature especially, no longer apply to you ... but who am i to tell you this if you understand you have no need to hear it if you don't it's the only thing that might save your wretched life from miserable pointless suffering. motte and bailey throughout the video. essentially this speaker asks us to put on equal footing the arguments of a man who has devoted his life to educating students, helping people work through their difficult and wrecked personal lives to be their fullest selves, and raising and supporting a family any one of which is miraculous in its own right if done even moderately competently ... against the arguments of a person who has decided that nature has failed her idea of herself ... as if the idea of one's self preceeded nature and must make the latter serve the former. perhaps this is a dreadfully unfair thing to say ... to draw in someone's personal life into a critique of their flaccid ideation and poorly formed projections. At least in this respect let us imitate nature and be cruelly unfair. Laughable."
"Peterson is one of those people who's nowhere near as great as his fanboys pretend while also being nowhere near as bad as his detractors think he is."
"Thanks for this video, its well put together and is quite informative!   I personally enjoy Peterson's rhetoric for the most part and tend to agree with him that and legislation which commands citizens to censor their speech could be a very slippery slope. He specifically sights how our thoughts play an important role in defining/evolving into our actions and by controlling our words you are destroying an important intermediary between thoughts and actions which is a recipe for disaster in the worst case scenario.   Now i want to temper the paragraph above with the idea that most ideas or policies can become slippery slopes if they become rampant and its not completely unique to the space of controlled speech. Though the space of speech is so integral to the evolution of thoughts and ideas (which in turn guide and inform the development of our species) that i cant help but feel everyone on all sides of the political spectrum need to be more mindful of the power of words and exactly what purpose they serve to us all."
"What I've gleaned of Petersons lectures and podcast-appearances is that the naturally occurring hierarchies inevitably produce results along the pareto distribution that will look patently unjust in observation and that we haven't (the left or the right) found a working solution to this problem that wouldn't devolve into totalitarianism once the natural occurrence reproduces the unjust result despite efforts to stop it (since we don't know how to fix it). In the case of bill c16 Peterson made the claim that LEGISLATIVE approach to the problem is the wrong step to take to protect the minorities, as this would be the first steps towards the totalitarianism we should avoid. There's a lot of other things I would like to expand upon, but it's 4 am and I do actually have to get up at some point to cook a mother's day dinner, so toodles!"
"i love you and your videos with all my heart. you got me back into politics and you're such a fucking cool and hilarious person. lots of love!"
"You can get your information from Dr. Jordan Peterson. Or this tranny who does not know what biology is. Nuff said"
"Degenerates"
"They want you, Natalie. They know the only way to neutralise the threat of your influence is to capture for their own. Will you resist the siren call?  Also you’re cute and I liked when you said “i learnt it at the AA meetings I refuse to go to” it was really good."
"I was given a link to this video from another video which attempted to criticize Peterson. The other one was too complex for my small mind. This one I could follow, with inhuman effort, for about 3 minutes.. Peterson can express things clearly. My small mind can follow hos thoughts for 20 minutes or even more.."
"Marxism is the idea of permanent class struggle in order to destroy hierarchies, neo-marxism is this idea applied to social constructs like race, sexuality and so on. Post-modernism is the idea that words have no meaning, that there is no truth, and categories are simply play or words outside reality, so in other words, it is a delusion. It describes pretty well critical theory, and the major philosophical and political assumptions in higher education. This means science has no place, and everything is politicized to further some goals.  I do agree that his concept of the 'West' is lacking if not outright historically wrong. It's also true that he suggests a naturalistic fallacy with his talks about hierarchies, but falls short of actually saying it. So he let's people fool themselves. Nevertheless, those things are more than just power struggles, and in fact are the opposite of it, which is why Marxist theories are dangerous for everybody. Anything that denies science and reality is dangerous. It is the case for the individual, but even more so for a society, because at a social level, if everybody is delusional, only a few people will be left to do something constructive. So it is a slow erosion at first, and when it comes into enterprises and the body politics, it is pretty much over. Obviously you don't care, but some people do."
"Wow this is fucking great!   Totally agree on Strangers With Candy as well. You are my people."
"I disagree with one point: Identity politics isn't just about LGBT, women, etc and equality... it also covers white supremacy and other forms of racism, nationalism, and so forth."
"ContraPoints, I have a very important question for you. What do you think of peat bogs?"
"You're good. You kinda lost me in minute 13 when you dismissed the unconscious and its influence in the conscious mind, but besides that... great job I'll subscribe RIGHT AWAY."
"Dude, this video is HUGELY education to a goon like me who doesn't understand ANYTHING about postmodernism beyond hearing it demonized by the Peterson set. So basically, I sort of now think that it's a rejection of the idea that we're progressing on a line and improving all the time and instead recognizing that our progression is just movement in a direction - and a direction that often serves to reinforce the needs of those in positions of power."
"I want to be your friend,   Greetings from South Africa!"
"I disagree about your assumption that he thinks its a conspiracy by leftists to bring down the west. The problem as he lays out is that progressive politics as what the far left has subscribed to leads to basically the same place Mao and Stalin went when they killed over 100 million people in the name of equality. And hes both right and wrong. Peterson's arguments real flaw is not showing when that happens, when do we take a step too far ? It comes across to most leftists as him saying any progressive policies are evil, but thats not what hes saying. He's saying the problem is these people dont know when to stop, when they 'fix' a problem they keep pushing, thats where alot of the backlash on progressiveism comes from. Feminism wants equal rights to men so they push for the right to vote which is fine, then they want the right to have a job which is also fine, then they want to be payed the same for equal work which is fine, then they want the right to not be harassed which is still fine. So at this point they are basically equal as a group but they dont stop suddenly its now we want to be givin special treatment in consideration for certian careers becasue women are under represented in theose fields, but it turns out its becasue the vast majority of women arent intrested in those fields is why women dont take those jobs, now suddenly youve unblanced the system and its not equal its weighted in favor of a minority of women over a majority of men. Bill C-16 did this for trans people in canada it unbalanced the system and gave power of law to a very small minority of a minority of people thats why Peterson objected.  Marxism did the exact same thing in China and the USSR and thats why Peterson uses that as an example. It took equality and its meaning and put that in the hands of a minority of a minorty who put foreward laws that were in their best intrest becasue they figured 'if im equal then everyone is equal becasue im the oppressed minority',  so they killed all political foes deaming them 'people who hate equality' while allowing tens of millions in rural areas to starve which lead to food shortages which caused millions more in the cities to starve. So no I dont think its Peterson saying Marxists are conspiring to destroy the west, its more givin the policies we are implementing with the mentality we are implementing them in which we give a minority the power to control the majority  its far to close to the same marxist ideals that killed the tens if not hundreds of millions in the 20th century and continues to kill people in countries like North Korea and Venezuela"
"I really respect and like JP and enjoyed your video. I do think that its not hard to understand what Peterson means about postmodern neomarxism. First of all he has said that it is an inconsistent philosophy, because postmodernism isnt concerned with logic consistency and truth. Second, in his bigthink vid he states that his red flag with this ideology that underlies trans activism, feminism and marxism is the abhorrent idea of equality of outcome."
"I knew he was a dumb fuck when i seen his face!"
"Pretty smart, and hardworking too. I think, however, that there are more flaws in her arguments than Peterson’s"
"This all seems kinda knitpicky to me, especially the part about 'why do you call it the West?' Well what else are you supposed to call it? 'White people?' 'Europeans?' 'Heirs of Rome?' Those all have even stronger implications than 'the West.'"
"This is really great."
"Hello Contrapoints. I am not a big Jordan Peterson fan, but I am a big fan of yours. You and I hold many contradicting views and I am willing to be some very similar views. I have been wanting to have a conversation with you for a while, and if you are interested I would love to set up a time. On here I am a nobody and I do not expect to get an answer but hey, it is always so if you do not try right?"
"Any video that gets Peterson in a bath tub gets a thumbs up from me!"
"Beyond subbed"
"I mean, you totally poured out mothers milk in this video, just wasted it, that mother had to die so you could have your fancy bullshit."
"Do yourself a solid and research nutrition science."
"It's so hard to get on board with your channel when you still believe in murdering animals."
"Good,video, but why did you have to do the animal product thing?"
"10:05 It's kind of funny that you critisize Peterson for comparing trans-activists to Mao, but in same time think that it's a legit argument to compare Peterson to nazi because he used simmilar words."
"When we got to the Atari noises I almost lost my shit, lol."
"Great astute video, but slow it down, girl. Too many complex ideas ideas and explanations coming rapid fire. It was hella hard to follow."
"fan. tastic."

"Evergreen state college ,  we don't want , that's why."
"I would love to see a public debate between JP and you. Yes, you are that good. By the way, Dave would be no match for you. Take on JP and let the good times roll!"
"With all this YouTube ad revenue you would think he could get some voice training lmao"
"Milk cost too much money to be wasting in every video! Lol"
"No one has demolished Peterson and his repulsive schistosome tribe with more fucking elan!  Mazel tov!!!!!!!"
"As a queer JP fan i think you hit the nail on the head with JP's argument at @23:00 his criticism is from the left IMO.   It is a left based critique that the anarchists shifted in ideology to not wanting un-just hierarchies but the 'left' has been co-opted by fascist capital forces disguised as the left,-- and now reject all hierarchy. Seriously, i was at a party and some guy was arguing against music theory-- he was not a musician-- but saying that music theory just expresses the western tradition (not true).   It's arguments like that where JP is strong-- ie against straw-man arguments that enact fascism through a false doctrine of equality ie all sounds are equal is offensive to music-- music is hard and the people making it are spending a lot of their energy on making it good every time-- so it is not just noise.    I think if you want to understand Peterson's direct criticism of Neo-marxim you were spot on with Foucault. But I think it has deeper roots even. It is really the French 60's interpretation of power dynamics of Marx's dialectical Materialism.   In a simple way, Peterson is a rejection of Marx in the same way that Marx is a rejection of Hegel.   JP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq2dQQnjN74  Zizek https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tABnznhzdIY  Jewish encyclopedia on Hegel:  'His system has been described as 'logical idealism.' According to him, all that is actual or real is the manifestation of spirit or mind; metaphysics is coincident with logic, which develops the creative self-movement of spirit as a dialectic and necessary process. God is this self-unfolding spirit, and in the course of the selfrealizing, free process of unfolding, creation leaps into being. The world is a development of the principles that form the content of the divine mind.'  Peterson and Zizek both seem to be arguing for a self defined system that uses Chrsitianity as a symbolic way to kill man's concept of God, and step himself into the power of the super-ego and define his own reality. We cannot do that now, because we do not have the tools of art. Which Zizek and Peterson are both helping to describe.   But we need to make our own symbolic meaning structures (Peterson) and not rely on a big other (Zizek.)  These are essential points for us on the left. Remember, the bros that he is reaching to are the low hanging fruit we looked beyond.    I studied under Coetzee--> Under Derrida.   Theory:   1. Peterson has a working class background: Fact.   2. Peterson is well respected in Academia for years until he starts getting Donations from patreon-- which undermines the very funding and power structure of the academic left.   3. JP is using the tools and the language and the knowledge of the left tradition through the Logos in the traditions of: Nietzsche, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Jung, Freud ect. to critique the current state of the left-- to wake up to symbolic reality, and to ditch materialism.    4. The Facade-Left, is not the real left: an egalitarian platform to find the 'true ways' through discourse-- yet  the Facade-Left (the Vampires Castle) sets it self up to talk about egalitarianism in order to compete to be 'the most egalitarian' and sell the most books-- through domination of market through capital--not conversation.  5. Identity politics in this regard is the perfect capitalistic tool against social egalitarianism as it creates the system to subsume the the subject of socialism in an ever fractional set of identities which all need to fight for their specific 'equality'' and thus separation and continued otherness, and limits the effectiveness of group organization and identity.    6. Because of the threat that JP is to the fake-left, who is on the capital spectrum selling ideas, The facade left has pigeon whole'd  Peterson in an argument about the nature of prescriptive language, which is protecting symbolic reality and naming things, calling him a 'transphobe'-- when that is misrepresentation of his arguments in order to discredit him based on Ethos, as he is correct we must find a way to re-create grand narratives-- his point! Some narratives are useful.   Mark Fisher wrote in 2013 before killing himself:   http://www.thenorthstar.info/2013/11/22/exiting-the-vampire-castle/"
"Really awesome video. I'm a Peterson fan and this is one of the better criticisms I've seen of him on youtube. My only complaint is that you seem to be conflating Peterson's view of the radical left with his view of the left as a whole. I would agree that sometimes he doesn't make the line so clear, but he has said that the left is necessary and just, actually working to dismantle unjust hierarchies, but he sees the radical left as dangerous and their ideologies as becoming too mainstream."
"Personally I am afraid of Jordan Peterson's ideas precisely because they're not new ideas. I'm afraid of the damage that it has already done and will continue to do in the U.S. I'm afraid of the damage that it will do to Ontario, where the University of Toronto is, when people like Doug Ford, who are cut from the same cloth, are elected into power."
"As a hardcore Petersonian, you made some really really good points there.... touche amiga...why don't your bring those to Jackie Jackson's  *coughDAvecough* free marketplace of ideas....sooon... Viele Grüße aus Deutschland! Prost !"
"But what are we to do with the damned centrists?"
"Bible readings ewwwwwwwwwww"
"I think that on a small scale, everyone is socialist. My family and I share the same house, the same food and the same money. But when you extrapolate the ideals of socialism to a much larger scale (i.e. the population of an entire country), it becomes nearly impossible to manage and creates footholds to brazen corruption. The reason why it may become hard for everyone deal with government mandated funding is because what I consider important (education), may not necessarily be the same thing for the next family and the family after that. Mean while, the people who control major industries (military, power, oil, agriculture etc.) would invariably remain at the top sort of speak, and this is where corruption would start seeping in, which would consequently foster violence, poverty and a lot of other bad stuff . There are many historical examples of this happening (even here in the US). This is why I agree with capitalism, and the federally mandated equal employment opportunity act brought on by the civil rights act of 1964. Please give this a read and let me know what you think at your earliest convenience. Sincerely."
"This was so great"
"That white outfit at about 10 min in looks great on you! Your hair looked really good too!"
"'Trans activists aren't Stalin', yeah, no shit Sherlock. An egg isn't a chicken either, but give it time and it'll get there."
"Fun fact: Peterson is well aware of the postmodernism/Marxism contradiction. 'You don't get to be a postmodernist and a Marxist. You actually technically cannot be both of those things at the same time.' - his own words from Joe Rogan Experience #1006, 1:29:50."
"Intersectionality has been influenced by poststructuralism including Derrida, and Foucault but also black feminism and standpoint theory mixed with some post-colonial and yes even marxist influence."
"I’m a fan of Dr. Peterson, loved his book and I think this is fantastic and I agree with so much of it. You’re brilliant. I hope JP sees this, I think he’d love it. Bravo!"
"I fux with this, even though I find myself aligned with Petterson and the the right. Well constructed video, with a good bit of entertainment. One thing I do have to ask: What do you attribute your source of cynicism/unhappiness? Do you find that it is your transition that is the cause, or the people that you might perceive to oppose your transition? I see a lot people who are unhappy who are turning to politics (identity or not) to fill some void and find conflict. That latter point is personal to me, because I caught myself picking sides when I was in a depressed state, and this certainly does not just manifest in the left or in the right."
"As a Scotsman i am deeply offended...by how that cucumber was cut, i mean who needs cucumber sliced that thick?"

"...I think I'm in love"
"That was a great point about 'the West' at the end. 'Postmodern Neo-Marxism' is western. It's not about deconstructing western culture, because, as pomo neo-Marxism is part of the west, it can only be an evolution. Therefore, what Peterson (and all these right-wing closet fascists) are defending is the idea that western society should not change, that it should return to when it owned the entire planet as colonial possessions. Peterson's racism exposed! Lol"
"I tried to pay attention but, got too distracted by how cute you are *_*"
"I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE U AS OUR TRANSGENDER STALINIST!!"

"It was channel 4 not BBC"
"I hope Contra reads this.  This vid got me to reflect on how I see myself as a feminist. If I’m a post modernist feminist, where even the separation of gender and the idea of womanhood is in itself oppressive, or regular modern feminism, which embrace the idea of “womanhood” in almost a post-post-modernism way to rally together women as a unified cause for change. Because I’m kinda half and half, in terms of how I wish to define myself and want to step forward with my gender identity. Because defining your gender identity as an individual outside of any collective group can feel liberating, but I don’t even know if that’s for me. And my medication, which would give me those desired physical characteristics that are associated with what society categorises as “womanhood”, is something I greatly desire as a form of feeling comfortable in my skin and how I’ve seen myself even at an early age, but then I have to wonder if those feelings about my body should be fed into through transitioning or if they’re remnants of an exclusionary way we define gender in our current patriarchy. AHHHH IT’S TOO COMPLICATED. As Contrapoints would agree: Dysphoria is a fucking bitch. I wish I had your assured voice when you conterpoint Cockbane’s post-modernist TERF rhetoric of “Is that all women are to you?” with “...yeah.”"
"Grand narrative vs no grand narrative. This may be one way to characterize the divide, and it may be temperamental. Like Sam Harris and Peterson seeing parallel but separate truths. You actually can figure out what Peterson is saying, but it requires significant work, not the least of which is understanding Maps of Meaning. If you are temperamentally like Sam Harris, and see the spiritual dimension of humanity as pure consciousness, then it is irreconcilable with Petersons, which is predicated on evolved Archetypes (imagistic). This is the difference, say, between the the traits of openness and orderliness (potentially, may not quite have that right). It is also the difference between Buddhism and Christianity “roughly speaking” as JBP would say.  I hope you get on Rubin. I have advocated for this."
"You’re missing one thing - that it is when the pronouns are enforced, required. Not that they exist or are valid, which of course,they are (within the reasonable parameter of being able to function in society without counter-oppression). Enforcement is one of the main issues. I do wish you would be on Rubin. I have advocated for this"
"i don't agree with almost all of the points you've made but bITCH I WAS SCREAMING THROUGHOUT THIS VIDEO YOU'RE HILARIOUS GIRL WOw i subed"
"You know, the problem here is that you shame your parents with your own behavior. I'm sorry that you have a mental disability but your parents are secretly dying inside because of your behavior. The reason why everyone hates gays is because you seem to not care that your behavior hurts your parents and society in general. This is why I can't support the Left, I honor my ancestors and love society too much."
"I am freezing and this doesn't help me not die."
"Thank you for being what the left needs right now. Nothing will upset the alt-right more than having a gender queer use arguments and not just “being offended”."
"Ex-JP fan here. I was a fan until it became clear he was a really a bit loony when it came to left-wing-conspiracy stuff. Though he rightfully exposes how sexism and racism are cynically exploited by the left, he NEVER speaks about the fact that aside from that, sexism and racism are also very REAL problems.   Unfortunately almost everyone on the left seems to be too scared or insecure to actually engage on the subject matter, resorting to slander in stead, and therefore they make JPs points seem even stronger. So thank god for this video that faces JP head on, on fair terms, and brilliantly calls him out on his bullshit in a hilarious way."
"Postmodern neomarxism as used by Peterson is obviously a loud blanket word, he uses it disregardless of meaning ascribed to both words by postmodern or Marxist intellectuals (who do not agree upon any definition anyway instead caring of developing enough originality to take a sweet spot after inevitable death of Badiou and Lapavitsas). He uses it to describe any political philosophy that cares about social planning or engineering. He might as well used ‘Platonism,’ ‘redistibutionism,’ ‘philosophy of closed society,’ or ‘social engineering,‘ yet ‘Postmodern Neo-Marxism’ sounds much better and irritates precisely right people. While disagreements over vague terms as ‘alienation’ or ‘globalism’ indeed takes place among certain academics, it is quite challenging generally to find a Rawlsean who is unsympathetic either to Marx or to Foucault.  In other words, he treats social engineers just as a normal person treats flat earthers, not giving a fuck whether this is a Creationist fundamentalism, visual hallucinationism, esoteric neo-Arian alchemy, or hollow earth theory. Simply call them flat earner loons, it pisses all of them off."
"Fair criticism. I still love Peterson. Don't care so much about Peterson the political commentator and he quotes the bible a little too much for my personal taste, he's not an expert on everything nor can anyone be. However, I do believe that as a motivational psychologist,  he's second to none. He's somehow managed to cure the existential misery of a large group of young people (myself included) by telling us to stop being whiny little bitches, pull our finger out and just get on with it... And we love him for it. He's a silver-tongued genius."
"JORDAN PETERSON DOES NOT claim that trans rights will lead to genocide. He is saying that the underlying doctrine is basically the same as the marxist doctrine that killed over 50 million people  in the 20th century. Try wrapping your head round that before you write Peterson off.  Ok? Oh yes, and as an indigenous British person STOP APPROPRIATING my British, Georgian culture.   Got it? Good!"
"I shouldn't have smoked before i watched this."
"The Cathy Newman interview was Channel 4, not the BBC"
"I'm worried that people who are into Jordan Peterson will come away thinking that holding a conservative ideology contributes to worldly success, whereas in reality, it's more the case that successful people promote conservative ideologies because doing so safeguards their power. What brings success is hard work and dedication, limited by environment and innate talent. The ideology that drives you to work that hard could be conservatism, but it could also be just about anything else, really. Praying will not bring you money, and neither will conservatism on its own. Meanwhile, as a conservative drone, you would be playing into the hands of the wealthy."
"Disliked for giving points to the dumb scammer"
"Jordan Peterson is not evil and he does not force people to take his words.  Your frame of him being evil is just kind of lame. Honestly your entire argument is based on an assumption. That being said, you are entertaining. Even when you are short handing every topic Peterson talks about and exaggerating everything Peterson stands for. Honestly no your argument wasn't that good at all. It was all assumption. At least you are funny though."
"The more I think about it, the more it seems like there are only two possibilities:  Either Jordan Peterson is a man who constantly regurgitates the rhetoric of fascists and uses a term very specifically and very obviously 'Cultural Marxism' except even more ridiculous in exactly the same context that fascists use 'Cultural Marxism' and he is so utterly unaware of the implications of his own language that he has no idea that he's doing that.  _Or_ he's intentionally dogwhistling neo-Nazis.  So which is Jordan Peterson?  An idiot?  Or a fascist?"
"So the general impression I'm getting from this here is that Jordan Peterson is yet another 'classical liberal' whining about how things are changing and that's bad, except he does it in a really well-spoken manner and says things the alt-right love so they use him as an argument to authority."
"So ... it seems postmodern of JP to deconstruct 20th century communist despots in a way that allows comparison to today's 'SJWs'. Or is he taking apart the modern kids in order to liken them to those murderous thugs like Stalin, thus throwing current motives into question? I think I've got it wrong, because it can't be postmodern to simply argue points with which you disagree; that's old school. Yeesh. I've been watching your channel all day and you've made me think a looooot. Thank you! Like I said, you're very good at this."
"So this is Chris Chan? I heard he had tried becoming a woman.... I didn't believe it though"
"You're very good at this."
"Seams you kinda lack self awareness, if everybody needs or appear to need, a 'purpose in life' and all those peopleDON'T believe the patriarchy is real, and all those that DO don't need a purpose, maybe, just maybe, you have made fighting the patriarchy your purpose, while you do seam mostly self aware, you seam to fall short in this regard. Though you appear to actually get close."
"The consensus seems to be that the lobster gang approves. Great job, Contra. Also, this video is 100x more entertaining than anything Peterson has ever put out."
"'hello, dave.' you killed me"
"extremely fucking good video. thanx for explaining this justin beterson guy"
"The bottom line is that Jordan Peterson just isn't all that smart -- he presents arguments that seem, on surface, to make sense, but once you scrape the patina off [ *if* you make the effort to scrape the patina off], you find that it just doesn't hold together -- the main reason for his success is that, though he is not all that smart, there are many many people who are even less smart than he is & so, as things are relative, such people are impressed w/ his 'intellect' -- like most people of his sort, he is avid at attacking the a prioris of others, but maintains an unshakable oblivion to the a prioris that he himself holds..."
"Yeah you are right the enlightenment sucks"
"can't wait for the inevitable dragging of homestuck into philosophical discussion which may or may not happen while Natalie is making youtube videos. anyway i'm thinking of putting the mask in my icon back on and talking abt politics and going by 'leftist rorschach' or something anyway pt 2 this video was great, as are all of your videos and i would die-i'm really glad i watched that video you did with lindsay ellis awhile ago and found your channel through it."
"You make the world a worse place."
"HI im a not an inteligent person in fact im stupid, and dont care if people insultme for this, but will try to acomodate some way of thinking to the topic at hand. I Think Peterson brings some isightfull  and somwhat novel points of view, for what it is an infinite, complex and ever changeing field of discution, thats why his views seems broad. Seriouslly dont think that anyone could say what the heck is happening anymore, so i will not sweet on semantics of what is the correct way of thinking or behaving. Dont know if your points are right but at least they are interesting, somwhat auto indulgent, and i know flawed as petterson's are, but thats not a problem really. usually don't write on this kind of videos cos, let's be honest, dialog is dead and discution dead as well, but I have watch your work, and find something profoundly disturbing... the lack of Latinoamerican Writers on the bookshelf you usually display behind you (if you have some I could not see them).  I could recommend some if you like fiction: Borges, Onetti, Quiroga, Lezama Lima, and if you feel a bit brave a good old Jaime Saenz, if you want I can send you one for free just because I want to remediate some First World problems and you look hot on wig. I can only send one though, because im poor, capitalism does not reward readers ."
"I dishate ContraPoints. I agree with close to 0% of what he says and the skits can be cringy but at least he's out here making arguments with a sense of humor. Most leftist just reee the word 'racist' into the void.  As wrong as he is about nearly everything, I like listening to his arguments and would beer him and hear his side out. I literally only have one far left friend that is capable of this and that sucks."
"As a Peterson fan: great video. One of the most level-headed, thorough, and reasonable responses I have seen. You definitely made an effort to make an interpretation of his broader work and arguments, rather than many critics who lazily focus on one or two dumber things he said in older videos. I think if you and him got a chance to talk he would have a lot of good responses to your criticisms as well, but as it is this is unfortunately one way. Also I fucking love Strangers with Candy."
"your videos are getting so good, it's crazy"
"Can anyone cite any of the clips you used from Peterson in this video please? Just wanna check the context to make sure you aren't trying to push a false narrative."
"yr fake voice is ridiculous"
"Why do you look and sound so retarded?"
"This comments section is.... Actually very civil. Woah."
"I seems to be ideologically opposed to you, but I heard about you from Colin Moriarty and he was right about you. You're awesome. Keep making videos."
"Fine, Contra. I’ll subscribe. I had a few misconceptions about you and few major differences, however, your videos are too damn entertaining and informative to resist any longer. Looking forward to the wacky ride. You live in Maryland, yeah?"
"Genius"
"I disagree with a good chunk of what you said, but it's good to hear from someone who brings a dose of rational thought to the debate. I do think that you oversimplify JP's arguments a bit: I don't argue that there isn't a hint of sinister authoritarianism behind his intentions, but you can't really make the argument that identity politics are in any way a force for good. Whether they are white supremacists or hardcore feminists, forming political blocks on the basis of physical attributes is absurd and incredibly tribal/barbaric, especially when each block accuses the other of ruining the world. Never in history has any good come out of that. Either way you've earned a subscriber."
"I was hopeful at the start, she seemed elocuent and smart. But then it just came down to semantics and misrepresenting JPs views...same old."
"This was very good. I think Peterson would have a chuckle at a good amount of your barbs. I also don't think he would be too angry discussing your points. Clearly, his frustration has to do with a number of not-so-bright activists who have, for some reason, achieved enough social power to shut down talks, suppress speech, libel, cast threats and a range of other pretty nasty things. Thank god we have someone on the left who is willing to engage ideas honestly and head on. All power to you and yours!"
"My favorite part is when you bring up the presence of what we call post-modernism in ancient athens and the enlightenment. One of my biggest pest peeves is people identifying 'ancient thought' with Plato and Aristotle. Like goddamn, Plato himself made the point that his view was the unpopular one at the time!"
"huge peterson fan. Still really enjoyed the video. I mean, I feel like a few nuances of his arguments were purposefully overlooked to suit your criticisms, but this was probably the best criticism out there (and really enjoyable to watch!)"
"(7:13) Wow, some of those kids are going to land up on Dr Phil for being rebellious."
"Loved this! Thanks for all the information you present in your video!"
"By 'West' we mean 'What made the West succeed'. It is not to mean Western as in the geographical location, but about the axioms that made Western Civilization stand out among the others, and those ARE Judeo-Christianity (only a fool would deny that), Capitalism, and Individualism."
"This was so good! Thank UUU!!!"
"Though I'm a bucko this is a good video (in spite of the first 10 minutes)."
"'No one on the Left' = 'Everyone else but me'"
"I love JP. I'm just here for the DECOR... I'm so confused. I should probably clean my room..."
"You are trying really hard, I respect your struggle.  You still very much exemplify that void he is talking about. We all know how you gonna end up. Degenerate and Sad."
"Progressives are being called Regressives now.  So yeah, Progressives' label is scary enough."
"17:42 Your definition of identity politics isn't correct. I believe you framed it the way you did because it makes a lot of your arguments stronger. You should make a video on the subject of identity politics. I would like to hear you talk more about why you think this way. How would you differentiate black identity politics from white identity politics given your definition?   21:00 You say there are numerous ways to respond, yet belabor one way of responding, which you would probably agree with, is the wrong way. There are other ways of responding which would enlighten everyone as to what JP thinks by digging deeper into what he thinks.  Cathy didn't have tough job. It's simple, ask a person to expand on a belief more and phrase it back to them in a way you think they would agree with while keep digging."
"👅"
"A super video, as always.  I find the inclusion of academic administrators in the postmodern neo-Marxist bagel quite strange. They were not as receptive as JP would seem to think they should be to (when I was involved with UCU, one of the trade unions for people who work at universities) thinks like gender pay audits, dealing with the gender disparity at the professorial level, and so on. We've also just finished (or finished a chapter, at any rate) of industrial action against the university employers over pensions that saw weeks of strikes.  Can I ask - how much of Peterson's thinking do you think is a development or misreading (if I'm being charitable) of Popper's concern about totalitarianism and/or (if I'm not being charitable) of ideas as expressed in Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism?"
"thank you for not patronizing and instead actually clearly explaining your points"
"Note 'Our Boys' shows Marx and Engels. Labeled as such, undermined your argument defending what Peterson describes as Post Modernism or what is in essence Cultural Marxism as you noted. By aligning yourself with their ideologies. While I can appreciate your methodical, well thought and creative approach to critique, Marxism is ultimately an ideology of theft and coercion. Which is exactly why Peterson speaks against it. Having been entrenched in Academia for a couple decades, he's experienced it first hand. As has anyone truly honest and standing center on these issues will admit. I cannot count how many Professors, Teachers, Speakers and Students I've encountered that espouse as a matter of their education, some degree of Marxism as the answer to Society's ills.  This is the impetus for the theory of 'Cultural Marxism' because a nation's culture(s), are then effected by people in the right places(College positions, Politicians/legislators, celebrities) push this culture to replace the old. Without understanding that the old culture is still evolving and may voluntarily come around to a more favorable and equitable outlook on it's own. By pushing the 'new' culture it appears passive and maybe even evolutionary but in reality it's manipulation because no Society, nor the world as a whole with over 7 billion inhabitants, will agree nor sacrifice their own cultures and identities to appease others. So when Canada tries to make laws that if you misgender someone, you suffer some legal penalty, this is Authoritarianism. It doesn't account for that person's own beliefs of which they have every right limited by acts of violence of course. It doesn't account for the thousands of years of observable science and social structures, despite the truth of a minority of more socially liberal cultures like Native American tribes. Voluntarism is absolutely necessary for any social or political changes to come about without violence or some level of force and even resentment. To some, this is all reminiscent of 'Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that's where it's really at.'(Ayers) as we see Left groups aligning at marches, and political rallies. Maoist concepts of the great leap forward were irrational and horrific as the results proved.   Where Peterson gets it right, is that ultimate responsibility is in our Individual hands. For our choices, decisions, etc. As are the repercussions of our choices. Nowhere has Peterson stated that Transgenderism IS fascism or Communism. Instead, he's saying more that the organized effort to Coerce an entire society of people to use words, that a minority of people demand, or even a majority of legislators, is pretty Authoritarian. Going back to my Canada point or as we've seen here in California recently. Particularly when despite their claims, the Science is still out on whether or not for instance the 100+ to 300+ alleged genders exist. As well as the deliberate separation of 'Gender' from it's synonym 'Sex'. Personally, where I'm from(NYC) I've known Trans people since I was a teen in 1980s, and most were wonderful people, all were wrapped in some internal and external struggle for acceptance. Or with depression, substance abuse, prostitution, etc.  I sympathize with them, and think that all people should be free to be who, what and where they so desire for whatever their reasons are. Likewise, and I believe this is the crux of Peterson's opinion on the issue, other people shouldn't be forced to sacrifice everything we've been taught both through the sciences and experientially for millennia. Without the 2 main genders, there would be no society for you, nor I to live. As well, all people in a structured society have had to struggle. It's not fair, but like anything it takes time with less force and more freedom of choice even for those who are against your choices.  That Marxism demands coercion is a Historical fact, and the tired point 'that wasn't real communism' doesn't alter the reality that once you centralize power in the hands of a few, expecting the so called 'Dictatorship of the Proletariat' to become a reality, you're kidding yourself. It has never panned out that way because of Marxism's inherent flaws. In essence making it little different than any alleged representative government or more totalitarian governments. All of which require some degree of force to function.  In other words, no system is perfect but there are some terrible systems despite the good intentions that paved their roads to hell.   Freedom is not just a word but a philosophy. As for Marxists and Identity Politickers at odds, this is true IMHO but not at a significant level. Certainly not when it comes time to vote in candidates, or push a relative issue from a shared agenda. As I've witnessed, again going back to the 80s, through the 90s and into the millennium... Marxists tend to infiltrate Identity political movements. Not necessarily intentional, but as a means to a collective end. Similarly the Civil Rights movement was susceptible to their infiltration with promises of equity and equality.   It all appears an attempt at 'Group think'(Collectivism) and just because a group thinks a certain way doesn't mean it is the be all end all in thought. In fact, it is the same stance any LGBTQ, is railing against when they're demanding equal treatment and/or anti-bias laws. Collectivism doesn't work involuntarily, because like it's brother Communism, it requires force because  no two people will agree on every topic all the time. While Individual Liberty does jive with people 'requesting' individual Pronouns, but again and I am repeating myself ad nauseum here I know, NOT THROUGH GOVERNMENT FORCE. There is no Individual Liberty when Government Force gets involved. Individual Liberty is a two way street as noted above.   All that said and some of it redundant, I did enjoy your video! No, I've never read Peterson's book, I've only watched his lectures and interviews. No, I've never met him either."
"your make up game is on point!"
"Good stuff. I don't think Peterson is anywhere near as wrong as you seem to think, but I do think that you made some solid critiques and made a very entertaining video."
"Thanks for clearing things up: I am a kind of queer left progressive but relatively laid back person and love daddy, I mean Jordan Peterson too so I was confused. I also know now that although Sargon does make a couple good points, I do hate him very much. I also now fully understand the term reactionary which is helpful.   Sometimes I think you are a creature from my imagination but I am not smart enough to dream you up yet, beautiful."
"So I'd consider myself someone who likes and identifies with SOME of Jordan Peterson's viewpoints, I am also definitely someone who identifies as from the left of politics. First off, I thought this video was great! (I love your sense of humour, haha!)  I don't like how Jordan Peterson allows religion (aka old school identity politics) to seep into his writing. I don't like how he allies himself with other people who are on the right who I don't like - but  I don't pay attention to them anyway, so whatever. I don't like how he seems to make up pseudo-academic names for things which are perhaps outside the bounds of his academic forte, as you demonstrated.  However, I do think that there are things he says which ring true in society - even if not articulated as well as they could be - and which should be taken seriously if WE wish to be taken seriously.  I think Peterson is fundamentally anti-authoritarian and small statist. In his case, he's probably a conservative and so it manifests itself as part of an overall libertarian political stance. I think that that is possibly what he refers to when he claims he is a 'classical liberal'. I think that this underpins a lot of his controversial opinions, but I think that it is also why so many people identify with him.  On the Canadian pronouns issue (for those who don't know, Canada made a law which legally requires people to use certain pronouns), I think he is correct. I (I hope obviously) have no issue with using a pronoun if someone asks (Jordan Peterson has gone on record saying that he also doesn't have a problem with this I believe), but I agree with Peterson that it is dangerous to legally mandate the use of certain words and phrases, and that this is altogether different from banning the use of certain words and phrases, because it sets a scary precedent - it produces a new tool that can be used to legislatively enforce something. For me, and many, it's not about the domain (trans rights and activism), it's about the strategy (legally compelling ordinary people to do or say something or else risk punishment). I think that social pressure should be the tool used to get people on board with pronoun use - not legal means. I don't think Peterson would have engaged with this topic if that was the case.  I think that this same pattern is observed in some rhetoric about equality in representation the workplace, for example: my understanding of Peterson's core argument is not that it is a good outcome for women to be less represented in the workplace. Here he has an opinion on the domain (feminist activism) and the strategy (legally compelling companies to enforce ratios based on gender): I believe he simply advocates for an equality of opportunity (I work in the tech sector, and we're DESPERATE for more talent - nobody in my sector who is worth paying attention to cares what gender, race, creed, etc you are), and not an equality of outcome, because the outcome should reflect INDIVIDUAL (not group) interests. And again, we should be really selective about what we choose to force someone to do, as opposed to banning things we can't do in society which is a bit more straightforward I think.  To me, this is why he labels certain activist groups as totalitarian: because the strategy they are using is authoritarian and designed to compel against will. This is also why people on the left like myself identify with him - he's talking about fighting against authoritarian ideals which cut across both the left and the right of politics.  Spouting racist crap, being nasty to trans people, or not making a cake for a gay couple 'because Jesus' is horrible, nasty, and morally wrong. However, making it impossible to see and challenge people who have those opinions is dangerous and a recipe for radicalisation. People need to be called out in public when they do stuff which is socially unacceptable, so that others understand why.  The rest of his public persona that I know about is generally less interesting to me.  I hope you can tell by the way I've written this comment that I'm not looking to troll or come across as abrasive. I'm not an expert on Peterson, or on social theory or philosophy or politics, but perhaps this comment can help you all understand a little further why people like him (or at least the parts of him that they see!).  I welcome all constructive feedback! And in the spirit of free speech, if you want to be an asshole, feel free to do that too, but don't expect me to respond :D"
"As a fan of Peterson and his work, I just wanted to say not bad. Thought-out and entertaining video. We need more conversation like this."
"You had me at PCP :)"
"Peterson sounds like the new Shapiro."
"Gee Nick you really did fall flat on your arse after crackergate."
"I am JP fan, and found this to be insightful and extremely entertaining. I can’t quite get there on some of the argumentation, but appreciate the video."
"This was a great video and i would love to see anyone try to respond to this you are becoming the idubbbz of the youtube politi-sphere due to your 'fuck everything' attitude and hilarious self aware skits while still getting across some cogent points backed by research and i really dig your content for that. and even when we disagree i am still highly entertained. all of these factors lead me to the belief that you require more popularity, and so i subscribed. keep up the great content."
"@28:04 very similar thought to mine, although I agree in some things with ContraPoints. Subscribed!"
"TJ Kirk made a good analysis"
"Very entertaining video as usual Contra, I have to say one thing though. I rewatched the interview and nowhere does he mention that all hierarchies are natural or acceptable because it's natural. he simply says that it's natural behavior. Your point that the lobster argument is a strawman is pretty much void without specifically mentioning where he says that all hierarchies are okay due to hierarchies being a natural occurrence, which he as far as I'm aware never does."
"4:34 was that a cut?"
"22:40 I think that's actually where Peterson is going with the lobster analogy.  Right wingers are essentially aristocrats."
"Hey what you have to say is worth listening to and thinking over. But I think you're going to lose a lot of people with your cringy sense of humour. I get that it's kind of your shtick and you do it in all your videos. But if you're going to criticize someone seriously you should probably not spend a good part of your video ridiculing them. Just my two cents. Otherwise, great video and thanks for your insight!!"
"This is really great.  Thanks for making this video."
"I'm not a hume fan, and I believe that he is a racist and that's obviously bad. Just like.. it's dumb to equate one idea they have with the rest, no matter how terrible they are. Early philosophers had a lot of good foundational ideas we need to know about, but we simultaneously terrible people. Acknowledge good and the bad and separate them is all I'm saying"
"you cant trans your gender"
"This is smart"
"Oh my god look at that list of patrons!"
"I disagree with most postmodernism yet I have to say you are one of a very very few leftist who is able to articulate your views without overtly emotional and false accusations against those you disagree with."
"Who's mentally ill, You or Jordan Peterson?"
"I'm a big Peterson fan and agree with most of his opinions, but your video was excellent and hilarious, well done!"
"ContraPoints is the best thing that happen to YT!"
"I really like Jordan Peterson! I think people on both sides of the isle just need to chill the f out."
"I'm a big fan of Peterson's work, but I think it's important to have reasonable voices of criticism (such as yours here) to challenge his points.   (almost didn't watch the vid, because the voice you put on in the first 40 seconds of the vid was so unpleasant to listen to)"
"This was pretty good, I could have missed it but I don't think when describing postmodern neo-marxism you actually explained NEO-marxism, like you explained Marxism and postmodernism and said there not compatible which is true but I don't think you touched on its neo iteration which is definitely more compatible with postmodernism in comparison to plain old Marxism, still I could be wrong, and just have missed it, and still it doesn't effect the video that much, and still, awesome video, subbed."
"This channel is awesome"
"23:30 to 24:10, way to disprove your own point in 40 seconds or less, you idiot."
"entertaining... yes shallow... yes  but in all seriousness the lens with which you view his content and the person is both skewed and clowdy...  LET THEM EAT CAKE"
"I have just subscribed, thank you. Do not wear black face."
"I like Jordan Peterson. But I must say that I actually enjoyed your video and you brought up some very good counter points. Would love to see a debate between you two."
"When talking about what Jordan Peterson thinks you never once seem to think that you could be wrong and he could be right, because you hold fundamentally different ideas as true, so when he gives you nothing but true statements you assume he is being disingenuous or is implying something else, instead of taking his points at face value which is why he will always win in a debate with someone like you.. Neo marxist post modernism is any post modern thought built into the marxist framework of oppressor and oppressed. Oppression is alot more complicated than neo marxist post modernists think it is, including you. Oppression has a definition and it is alot more useful than the marxist definition that all neo moarxist post modernists use. Also identity politics is not SJW activism, it's any form of politics BASED ON IDENTITY, this includes fascism and political racism."
"Your consumption of the mutilated corpse of a holocaust victim for a cheap joke hurts your message a bit.  I think I will just drop another friendly reminder that if you actually care about being opposed to institutionalized oppression you need to stop supporting the perpetual mass rape and murder of animals. I want to like your stuff, but it's hard for me to take seriously moral prescriptions from anyone who doesn't understand why needlessly stabbing an animal to death is wrong. You expect of others to do the right thing by changing their regressive habits, so lead by example and do the right thing yourself. ❤️🐮🐷🐔🐟❤️"
"25:06 / 28:19 have no idea have transgender people requesting, my problems comes when i am demanded by law to call people certain things."
"also women are completely fairly treated in western society if not treated better than average and are over represented in education. ever thought they could be under represented in government because the average differences between men and women mean that they are less inclined to seek out that type of occupation? not possible in your delusion huh? well at least she doesnt completely swear by some of the retardation on either side and it seems like she put effort into the video but 'he should have been easier to read if he wanted to be read' is just like oh god really hes hard to read for you what the hell at least you put together a better video than most of the other stuff ive seen of people trying to engage and criticize jordans ideas and they need to be criticized and refined but maybe try again? be a little more intellectually honest this time and maybe read a book or two on economics? pretty please?"
"You don't like reason or truth... At least you're honest so I can avoid this trash."
"you have a poor understanding at best of all the stuff you talked about in this video and even his opinions are misrepresented you should be more careful when trying to make a serious video. also the underlying idea that you think capitalism is still bad for society but you have nothing to compare it to that actually works like good like getting a job under capitalism? yeah if you choose a low demand topic of study sure you think it would be better if we were all just assigned and given jobs? so delusional and you had some reasonable criticisms aswell overall 3/10"
"Hmmm I probably don't agree with everything you say, but this is a really high quality commentary channel based on this video.  The visuals, comedy,  and research is all there. You seem to be a leftist who has their life together with the ability to use your brain too, so I might have to subscribe."
"can you write a book on how i should live my life?"
"It's was on Channel 4 not the BBC"
"Man, the lobster fandom is really getting out of control, isn't it?"
"I hate you because i 've been meaning to make this video for almost a full year now and you beat me to it... although mine wont be so weird"
"35 years ago this man said this and they called him crazy.  Sorelian revolutionary identity syndicalism ends bad.  Xenoestrogens (EDCs) are killing the coral reef.  https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4 https://youtu.be/LSz_nks0Yuk"
"Great video, Milady! C'est Magnifique!"
"14:06 you treat the topic of being a transgender female like it's a joke.  Hard to take you seriously when you can't even take your fucking self seriously.  Clown."
"I love Dr.Peterson, and I'd love if he could see this video."
"'Societal structures are natural' And being gay/lesbian is also natural, but naaaaaaaaah."
"Good criticism, I always thought postmodernism and ID politics were contradictory and ppl believed them both. I didn't realize those are two different leftist groups.  However I always thought by neo-Marxist Peterson and others mean the opressor v opressed mentality in general."
"when did she start looking like a drag queen?"
"Wow I think I just fell in love with you."
"as a bisexual I indeed agree 'degeneracy' is the perfect word to describe me :>"
"'on the left, we tell people what not to do' which is still thinking that you can tell people what to do or how to think, or else they are inherently a bad person for disagreeing with any aspect of your worldview. the difference is, Jordan Peterson wouldn't call you a deplorable racist sexist bigot transphobic homophobe for not following his life advice. it is there to follow if you want. the left's advice for behavior and life is much less of a prescription like Dr Peterson, but more of a demand lest you want to be branded an evil reincarnation of Hitler."
"I've never been more jealous of a lifeless mannequin in my life.... Ehem! I mean, yeah. Great vid!"
"I’m a huge fan of Peterson’s lectures and his general advice for individuals but your video really helped address a lot of my questions about his political / ideological rants. I still see some of his ideas about “the left” having both Marxist and postmodern views but this video really cleared up a lot of my confusion on the topic... like you said, I think a lot of the confusion may come from the fact that a lot of the left are arguing amongst themselves, and from the outside it appears to be one collective.. by the way, this video was brilliantly put together, enlightening and fucking hilarious hilarious at times! Great job!"
"Hey you're not bad! Subscribed ;)"
"Fuck you lobsters"
"Can you please stop using stigmatizing, homophobic and trans-phobic slurs like 'degeneracy'? They're otherizing to people who happen to be GSRM, even when you put little hearts around them."
"wtf is a lobster in this context"
"I am prone to agree that we shouldn't use 'postmodern neo-Marxism' as a catch-all scare word, because Mage the Ascension was fucking awesome and if you disagree it's because you're Technocratic scum. But the division between the intersectional left (which is all about framing those identities you mention as unilaterally oppressed groups that you can stratify along the same lines as you would the bourgeois and the proletariat) and the gender-critical radfems (the ones you guys like to call TERFs) ought to be a clear sign of who is winning. Judith Butler would be an exemplar of the sort of person JP describes as a 'postmodern neo-Marxist.'"
"You purposefully miss his ultimate point about identity politics that is the categories in which group identities can be divided in to in the end are  endless and the like the Marxists the followers of identity politics put group identity over individual rights and liberty.   Also you try to paint his opposition too bill c-16 as trans-phobic where as just recently we have seen how problematic the bills language can be also that it can be used to silence debates and discussions about gender and maybe even race. Seeing as how leftists like to silence any discussion that doesn't support their talking points are you really surprised with the use of this bill in the Lindsy Shepard case.  In the end what he is advocating is individual rights instead of group rights. Fair inequality is better than unfair equality."
"25:04 made me laugh. You're 'requesting' individual pronouns by trying to create legislation that infringes on the liberty of people who don't use your pronouns. Whether or not it constitutes 'hate speech' to repeatedly misgender someone, there is certainly a case to be made that it constitutes harassment (at least under Bill C-16)."
"Probably because Capitalism isn't bad. Marxism is a fantasy."
"Hey, you make couple of valid points. However, you missed some. One thing you never mentioned was how Jordan Peterson only cares about pronouns because the Canadian govt. want to make a law that forces people to call those like yourself who are transgender or otherwise their preferred pronouns. The govt. should not try to control speech in any way. Now he never mentioned taking human rights from transgenders. However, that’s what the left what it to seem like. There is a great amount of hypocrisy and hypersensitivity in the democratic side that is driving tree-hugging, freedom-loving hippies like myself who identified as liberal away. For one thing Feminism is supposed to be about womens’ rights. Yet, feminists also support Islam which is a mysogynistic and controlling ideology. If you don’t believe me look up rape gangs in Europe and then check out videos of Speakers’ Corner in England. Lauren Southern asked feminists if they preferred Islam or women’s rights. Only one was able to answer. The rest just acted like children. Liberlism is basically about control themselves. Antifa is a great example of the violence of the left along with the Black Lives Matter movement that promoted black supremacy instead. If any of these movements cared about equal rights they would defend the rights of western citizens despite skin color. Now there are more people of color becoming Republicans and Democrats try to shut them down. Just check out Diamond and Silk or African-American celebrities such as Kanye West. Democrats considered him cool until he started supporting Trump. Candice Owens, who makes great points, is an African-American Republican who got tired of black people playing the race card. If the Democrats and BLM cared about blacks then they should try to deport the illegal Mexicans in California who go into black neighborhoods and shoot them. This comment is way too long so I’ll just stop it here. This video was entertaining but, not the best source of information. God bless."
"I think you have a fair shake to peterson and it looks like you gave a shit enough to do some reasearch, which is why I subbed. Though I think I disagree with you on most issues the far left finds most pressing in modern politics. I am not a huge fan of Peterson and while I think his work is somewhat important, it’s mostly due to a lack of others doing the same work. Peterson often degenerates into flowery word salads and Jung-worship. His take on religion is mind numbing and ridiculous, which I’m glad he was more exposed for by Matt Dilahunty. But I support Peterson as so far as he supports a kind of libertarian liberalism and opposition to censorship and identity politics, as well as the growing oppressive nature of political correctness. It seems Contra is one of the few, if not the sole leftist who sees valid criticism of the left’s ideaology and tactics. The purity spirals of a “no true Scotsman” variety. The hyper vigilance in respect to the most minor of possible offenses. I would like to see a conversation between Contra and Peterson. Would be interesting. Though I’m sure Peterson would word salad his way into a jungian psycho analytical blah blah blah bleh blah"
"Thank you. This was pretty awesome. I don't have a personal opinion of JP, and when it comes to core values, I do see myself more on the left than on the right. However, over the past years, I have come to be rather frustrated by parts of the left. The level of naivety and dogmatic moralizing as well as the lack of an intelligent long-term strategy and self-awareness has just been depressing. Anyway, your channel and way to approach typical 'leftie' topics gives me hope. This is a great way to take a clear political standpoint while at the same time being (self) critical, nuanced and respectful of opposing viewpoints. Plus, great humor, too.  Subscribed!"
"This is so fucking good. First YouTube channel I'll ever donate to. Please keep up the good work."
"Nice to see a decent rebuttal to Jordan Peterson."
"Not BBC! Channel 4 interview with Cathy Newman ! But otherwise an interesting video :)"
"Regency contrapoints (with snuffbox) is probably the best thing I've seen today."
"You were fairly close to confronting his ideas...  (It was a good video though, and interesting nonetheless)"
"At the beginning of this video the following claim is made: '[Jordan Peterson] got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under canadian human rights law shall surely lead to stalinism'.  When and where did he say that? Citation needed."
"It’s not about human rights laws, you already have all the same human rights as everyone else, it’s about forcing everyone to call you what you want to be called under the threat of shaming, fines and jail time"
"Are we going to keep sidestepping the fact that the pronoun issue isn't about 'mere requests' to be addressed in a particular way, but rather for refusing to do so becoming a punishable 'hate' offence?"
"haha top hit for Jordan Pee."
"I'm a fan of Peterson, but I found this stuff to be some really funny shit!  Well Played!"
"I fucking love it!"
"Judeo-Christian values, there's an oxymoron if there ever was one."
"We need to protect trans people. But I guess we don't have to protect white women and children from Muslim rape gangs all across Europe..."
"I THINK...... you're gonna end up on the right.."
"When Peterson talks about 'Neo-Marxism' he's refering to the application of Marxist philosophy to identity politics. Essentially, neo-marxism is the idea that identity politics can be understood in the context of a war of classes or categories: the privileged (white, cis, heterosexual, men) and the disprivileged (black, women, homosexual, trans...), essentially victimizing the disprivileged while putting the blame or responsibility on the privileged.        What Peterson tries to say when he compares them to communist regimes, is that those ideas follow essentially the same pattern and motivations, and can very easily lead to the same place.  Postmodern Neo-marxism, in the context he uses it, is the idea of questioning the basis of modern science, philosophy and society, while at the same time trying to offer an explanation to those by the application of Marxist philosophy. For example: STATEMENT: 'there are two genders, man and woman'  POSTMODERN NEO-MARXIST RESPONSE: 'this is false, it is a social construct, gender is actually not a binary state, but instead, we think so because our (patriarchal) society has indoctrinated us into believing it. All children are born genderless but we imprint their gender roles and behaviours onto them when we raise them, there is no such thing as a baby being naturally 'male' or 'female'."
"You accuse Jordan Peterson of attacking a straw man in regards to leftist ideology, yet from the very beginning of your video you paint an inaccurate description of Jordan Peterson, particularly with Bill C16. While it is clear that you are ignorant to his message, I can't tell if it is willful ignorance or if you simply missed the point."
"My response as someone who supports Peterson is: Peterson mentioned the disparity between Marxism and Postmodernism and how it doesn't make sense that it would work together. But then look who he has to deal with: People who try to argue that there is no difference between genders, who still say there's dozens of them and can't stand being critizised. It's good to know feminists with a brain have found out that you can't make all these claims at the same time, though. I think they are underrepresented by a certain political group."
"This is too funny. Great arguements too. Subscribed!"
"I just figured out how to defeat him:  Jordan 🅱️eterson"
"On the otherhand CP, you are in fact both a trans activist and a Marxist, so Peterson is right on this sample of one."
"Good job!  It's tough to get around the people who keep thinking that because Peterson says some things that are obviously right then everything he says must be obviously right."
"You know, anytime a girl falls for the bad boy, she accused of having daddy issues. It's usually goes something like 'Wow, her dad must have an abusive a-hole that's why she falls for abusive a-hole'. Well, that's how exactly how I feel about JP (mostly male) fans, I just can't understand what they see in him other then they must had a Dad who was either abusive or neglectful. Sorry, that's just my honest observation."
"Very informative and enlightening video. I feel connected with a lot of things Jordan Peterson has said, like the fact that in nature certain gender-based hierarchies seem to be inevitable for example the female-based hierarchies in Hyenas and Bees and his example of the hierarchies in Lobsters, and helps us understand the human hierarchical default and tribalistic tendencies in human nature. It would be a step in the right direction to overpower and overwrite our tribalist behaviours we often times don't have control over. That is something I want to experience within my lifetime. More so, because I myself am of Arabian descent and both my parents are immigrants, what was mostly the reason why I got bullied in a mostly white school. A great example of where the 'weaker of mind' children access the tribal nature more easily because of group think. But how far can we go in correcting our human nature, and more importantly how long will it last before everything we have worked so hard to achieve in correcting this nature before it goes full-circle and we repeat our history? I think Jordan Peterson and many other intellectuals need to keep producing these perspectives, so we can engage in a true and honest conversation that in time will lead to a better understanding of society, and will benefit a multi-cultural world in general.   Thanks for making this video, it gives me alot to think about. And I subbed to your channel in anticipation for what's to come next ;)."
"Nicee"
"He didn’t bring civil and lgbtq issues into this. They were coopted by the activists he takes issue with. Like the vids, u got fab girl flash. Being cool n funny doesn’t make you right dohhh:)"
"the Canadian law doesn't protect trans people, it criminalizes any misgendering of them regardless of intent, the wording of the law is vague and nebulous... and you believe such a law will bring about the acceptance and integration you hope for? lol sounds like the logic of peace thru segregation, and that worked out so well... btw Marx was a douche and his ideas have killed over a billion people in their time on earth, what a dude to stick up for lol"
"Loved this video. Your production is top notch and hilarious.   I do have a critique on a couple of things though.  I don’t think you understand what Jordan Peterson means by post modern neo-marxism. He is describing the post modernist push to use the state, corporate rules or employee codes of conduct to institute speech codes and hate speech laws. As well as special protections for certain exclusive classes if people. These are policies that he sees as Marxist in nature. I think its valid to view authoritarian push of post modernists as Marxist especially when when the authoritarian policies they are pushing violate the free thought or speech of others.  Also what you are saying is his definition what the west is off. He isn’t talking about ALL  western philosophy. He talking about philosophy and culture that have been the normative guiding force behind western civilization. Which would not include post modernism."
"WHat? an actual reasonable criticism of JBP? as a jbp fan, I cannot accept this"
"I can understand the appeal Jordan Peterson l must say some of his psychological insights interesting and lecturers are interstings by I disagree since I'm not as traditionalist as he is and I'm not that fond of religion. But I'll admit some his fans act a bit much and get a bit anti- leftist. But I most say love the video Contra points keep it up. Also it was British channel called Channel 4"
"I loved every minute of this. I love your videos!! You are so beautiful 💖💙💜💖"
"I'd like to know what he said at 7:22 to completely enchant Rubin and Shapiro. They both laugh, Dave turns towards him then they both unknowingly lean towards Peterson simultaneously as if that will get them some more of his sweet wisdoms. It's kind of creepy and it's a perfectly chosen snippet to represent that ocnversation."
"You've got sanpaku. Just something I keep noticing."
"Thanks for the calm video that wasn't chock full of personal attacks like so many people only deal in.   So, I find your criticisms interesting, though I think the biggest flaw in your argument is quibbling over definitions. This is something that also happens too much, as our vocabulary is too limited to describe exactly what group of people/ideas we have in mind. So, the question is, what does Peterson actually mean by postmodernism? I think it's unfair to say he's overgeneralizing when the term itself is self-refuting. Is it absolutely true that truth can't be known? Nobody, literally nobody, is actually a postmodernist. Unless theyre suicidal, nobody is going to question the truth of the premise 'if i walk out in front of that bus, it will probably kill me.' Now figure out how to use a self-refuting term to generalize a bunch of people. Still, who he has in mind is most important. Even if he were using the terms incorrectly, the key is not the term used but the group in question.   Now, I would also disagree that postmodernism as you defined it makes up only a portion of the Left. But I'll grant your point for sake of argument. Peterson is concerned with the fact that the postmodern form of Leftism has the power to actually get what it wants politically, and the horrors that will bring down on the world. The same folks who are postmodernists, as you've defined it, are the same folks who are moral relativist by extension (I can't judge another culture's practices, even if they're Nazis), whose only creed is political change without end, and so on. Their philosophy is assumed on some level among most groups in society (there are tons of Christian relativists, for example). I'm a teacher, and I have debates on a variety of subjects in my classes. One of the things that perhaps 75% of my students say is that they can't judge whay someone else does, no matter how awful. And I live in a very conservative area! That attitude has gotten more common in my seven years of teaching, too. And this attitude is a direct threat to our existence as humans, as is postmodernism as you've defined it. That philosophy leaves wide open the gates for totalitarianism, which I think is the crux of what Peterson has criticized it for. I mean, why not have a dictator if it's not appropriate for you to judge what someone else does?  This is turning into a rant. I know you have tons of comments, but if you'd like to respond and discuss, I would be happy to talk to you. :)"
"Great Job! When are you going to be on Bill Mahr?"
"Unequal outcomes are not direct evidence of injustice. To say that Peterson ~implies~ unjust hierarchies are legitimate is intellectually dishonest, or you infer that simply because you do think unequal outcomes ARE evidence of injustice.  Equality of Opportunity VS Equality of Outcome. What do you think is more important with regard to social justice?"
"psychologists are mostly cops...peering inside with their torches"
"Did you seriously just fucking try to normalize smoking pcp?"
"Peterson doesn't self identify as a conservative. Stop forcing your labels on him."
"Watch Jordan Perterson for yourself. Make up your own mind. Don't listen to oversimplified misrepresentations."
"I left a comment earlier saying that he identified as a liberal and I find it hypocritical to for Contrapoints to force her labels on him. Someone responded by telling me that 'she literally said that in the video'. I deleted the comment rather than watching the whole half hour over again. I regret that now. When does she say that? After implying that he and all his followers are alt-right for 30 mins?"
"Well despite the creepy drag queen coming onto a mannequin thing, this is the only good critique of Peterson I've heard. You actually have listened to the guy, unlike other people seem to want to hate him just cuz.  Your wrong on that one thing that everyone trips up on though. He doesn't give a shit about who wants what pronoun used. People can work than out between themselves he says. The point is the Canadian government forcing the use of words(as he sees it). It's not the same as 'I don't want to because I don't like it'.  Your 'girl' voice sounds like a Kids in the Hall Character. But it's sort of fun to see a guy in drag acting snarky and theatrical. The trans-fad going on with the teenagers right now lacks any colour or fun!!  I'm sure it's the real deal for some of them, but I'm guessing most will grow up to be boring suburban binary gender married bozos like the bisexual girls who came before...."
"He never spoke out against trans rights, he spoke out against impelled speech. His whole point is that once you let the government make laws forcing you to say  something, where does it stop?"
"Jordan Peterson identifies as a liberal. He is a leftist. No matter how many times you try and frame him as the opposition, he will still be a liberal."
"I must say you became my drug. I don't know how I ended up watching this video, but I am now watching everything you made. I found my other me"
"You know what? I like you. You're not *needlessly* aggressive, you don't talk down to your audience in your video, and you're funny. You present your idea with a personal take, but without giving off the holier than thou vibe I find many left-leaning videos have. Kudos to you, thank you for the video - really good one"
"I love Jordan Peterson and really love you perspective on him. Also your video was so entertaining and im subbed.  But i think the fear of radical leftism is a real concern. The UK is a radical country where not subscribing to political correctness can land you in prison. You can see threats of censorship or the Facebook pages of police in the UK. Also the cases of Alfie Evans and Count Dankula would be huge violations of the Bill of Rights in America and its scary to see that stuff happening and a country so culturally linked to America. However i love how you broke down the postmodernist neo-markxist contradiction and question what really is 'the west'"
"Who is this bloke 'Contra'?  He seems like a complete nonce."
"I’m a huge fan of Jordan Peterson but I really liked this video. For one the visuals, direction and humor are very well done. This is the most fair, reasonable and informed criticism I’ve seen of Peterson so far. I disagree on some points but of them were valid points that left me with something to think about."
"Hey Contra I loved the video, it was very well made and absolutely hilarious but, even though I do disagree with your analysis of Jordan Peterson and his fan base (I count myself as one) it was a very insightful point of view that disagrees with JBP. Anyways, I hope you get to be In the Rubin Report someday lol."
"Your bit on his “rules” vs your rules is that his are advice for success that has to be completely voluntary, and you attempt to get your rules backed by legislation so you can prosecute people for living differently than you. OOPS."
"Raising the pitch of your voice to sound like a muppet is definitely a good way to appear as a female to help cope with your mental condition."
"you are a man"
"I was expecting to read the usual 'anti JP vs Pro JP' comments in the section, the 'He's a hack' and the 'You haven't truely understood Jordan, you should watch his series of 4 hours long lectures', so I'm happily surprised to see fan of Peterson that, just like me, don't want to be stupid yes man living in manicheism and challenge their viewpoint by watching 'leftists'."
"Okay but I think the connection between postmodernism and identity politics is that Peterson and others see identity politics as the ultimate end result of postmodernism, given the realities of human nature. If people need a higher purpose for their self to manifest (which seems like a given to me), but then you strip away every religion and ideology which could have provided belonging and purpose, what are people left with to attach their heroic self to? Only the most basic things about their body: their gender, race, and sexuality.   I don't know if Peterson and his ilk believe this next part, but it's a thought I've had to develop that: only the people who can find meaningful narratives regarding the basic qualities of their body - narratives with conflicts, villains, and room left for a heroic quest - can actually experience meaning in this scenario. The term 'social justice warrior' reflects the hero's journey. So ultimately, the 'postmodernism --> identity politics' theory sees members of oppressed groups filled with meaning as they crusade for their rights, their meaning-hungry friends trying to piggyback on these epic quests, and your average white male floundering and stewing in a meaningless void. (except not really because they very quickly pick up the mantle of identity politics themselves as, to varying degrees, they almost all set out on quests to defend the hapless cis white male; and a small group even become masculinists and/or white supremacists)"
"Hi there, im also an avid follower of Peterson. Im really glad to see that the political left is starting to make some real and effective arguments against the other side,  for a long time it has been a route, this video was both informative and entertaining and well argued doing a good job not to strawman the other side too much. Overall I think that a return to civil discourse, through back and forth debates such as this can  really help to make the world smarter, more civil and more willing to bridge the divide and see the points of view of the other side.  I hope this is a small step to a much more politically and ethically, balanced and informed world."
"It Came From The Cringe..."
"Suppose you're (neo-)marxism, and you want to replace the western grand narrative (christianity, classic liberalism, the enlightenment, whatever you think that grand narrative is). Wouldn't it then be very useful to weaken said narrative by deploying deconstructionist philosophy on it first? It doesn't even matter if you're the one doing it. Let the post-modernists tear down the narrative, so that you can fill it in with your own narrative later.  You could claim that the post-modernists would tear down marxism just as it does with the other narrative, but who is to say that pomo is strong enough for that? Who is to say even that such a battle of ideas will be fought with words in the first place? If it boils down to violence, pomo will lose, precisely because it denies anything unifying.   I don't think post modernists have to agree with marxists, let alone conspire together, for the combination of the ideas to be deadly."

"1:20 yeah I know"
"I admire your breadth of knowledge and gift of whit. I disagree with just about every point you make, but it is a pleasure to watch you make a logical and funny argument against my points of view. Sadly you are alone on your side of the political spectrum  where anger and  angst control weak minds."
"this is a great video. though i disagree with most of your conclusions, i respect the time that is put into this video. at long last a person speaking from the left that does not brutually missrepresent jp."
"What is that music in the middle of the video? Steve Reich? Subscribed."

"The worst part about comparing transgenders to Stalin is assuming Stalin is a bad role model."
"You’re my new fav whatever this is."
"As someone who has been accused of being a Petersen fanboy for calling out certain left-leaning youtubers or media outlets for making trash arguments and strawmanning against Petersen, thank you so much for making this video. It is intelligent, well-researched, organized, and really funny. But what's really bothering me is that it isn't people like you who are challenging Petersen in interviews. Instead it's big corporate or govt-funded media like Channel 4, NBC, and Australia's 60 minutes who completely malign him, selectively edit his interviews, and strawman his arguments, while at the same time completely failing to engage and confront his viewpoint in an intelligent way. And I think that's why your average 'Petersen fanboy' can be resistant to criticism against him, because they only see it in the form of the dishonesty that always comes from corporate media...who I don't think are friends to the real progressive left either."
"Everything about this video is amazing. How had I not heard of you until now!?!???"
"I'm a huge fan of dr. Peterson. he's helped me a lot. This is the first coherent argument I've heard against him. I agree with some of the stuff you said and I disagree with most of it. You gave me a lot to think about and for that I thank you."
"I was genuinely impressed until you started cutting clips of him speaking down to 3 to 5 words at a time in an effort to misrepresent his point of view. Regardless, it is very refreshing to see an outspoken liberal making a logical and well thought out argument, and doing the research to back it up. The norm today it seems is to go straight for character assassination, and your typical 'racist, sexist, homophobe, bigot' buzz word basket of deplorables rant. You seem like the type of person that you could debate with and come out learning some new things and respectfully disagreeing on others (and probably have a few good laughs). Respect."
"Fair enough ContraPoints, you kept me watching for the whole 28 minutes. Fantastic and reasonable response to Peterson and for the first time in what seems like a long time, I have changed my view on something. And I'm a stubborn narcissist at the best of times so that means something"
"Great video as usual Nat :3"
"Tranny sounds like he has swallowed an unfinished sentence"
"Well, I stopped watching after you called it a BBC interview. Basic fact checking out of the window, yeah? Not unlike Mr. Peterson, trololo."
"It is a pretty good video. However failure to recognise however unlikely postmodernist neo-marxist alliance is just lack of observation. Yes they might be disagreeing and have a lot of differences but a common arch enemy is very uniting."
"That wasn't the BBC... it was channel 4."
"I was disappointed by this. Peterson is much more of a straightforward fraud than contrapoints implies in this video. He's essentially a fake academic: he has no formal credentials in politics at beyond undergraduate level and little prior to that. His lectures are absolutely terrible conspiracy theory horseshit with no sourcing: he's like a pretentious Alex Jones.   I'm guessing contrapoints was using socratic yes-yes method to pull over Peterson's fans, but I felt a tougher line would have been more appropriate with someone who is up there with lizards-are-our-masters lunatics."
"Progressivism is cancer"
"By calling someone a racist, and then immediately saying that person is Scottish as its a negative- is racist.... hahahahaha, this is ridiculous.  I'm glad I watched this video with an open mind, because the contradictions and haphazard, shallow analysis of philosophy make this a hilarious parody of intellectualism (typical modern day leftism)."
"Pathetic view numbers, you wouldn't even be worth Jordan Peterson's time to debate."
"peterson fan here. thanks for taking the subject seriously and summing up all the parts of daddy peterson i'm _not_ so keen on, it really helps. i've been recommended your channel before but never clicked a video as i was too afraid you'd be not-so-good and put me off the left even more (i'm originally a leftist but disillusioned) so i'm happy to discover you're actually both sane and hilarious, haha, definitely subbing to get a leftist voice of reason in my life as well."
"I'm a big fan of Professor Peterson, really enjoyed this video. It can be difficult to find critical responses to him that are.. well.. reasonable. I'm wary of any one-sided influence, so do really appreciate having a counter perspective on things. I think some of what you said has been explained to some extent by Peterson himself, notably the apparent rift between post-modernism and marxism. You made good points without attempts at misrepresenting JBP, so again, much appreciated from this Peterson follower. Ty."
"'So much for the tolerant Jacobins.' I freagging died."
"Aren't lobsters solitary creatures?  Is there a lobster hierarchy at all?"
"Its a channel 4 interview not a BBC interview. Great vid tho."
"A lot of his ideals really do seem to be a Trojan horse to shit on minorities. But he's so sneaky about it that if you try to call him out on it, he can try to portray you as a shrieking irrational SJW. A lot of fascist provocateurs love to troll minorities into getting heated, upset, and defending themselves - then pouncing on them for getting too heated. It's super frustrating."
"Hey Natalie, I love your videos! Any change you could do a video about Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens?"
"What is gender? No self-proclaimed progressive has ever managed to provide me with a coherent, usable definition. If no-one can demonstrate that 'transgenderism' is a meaningful concept, then treating 'transgendered' people (that's the correct conjugation) differently under the law is obviously a terrible idea.  Yes, gender eccentrics ought not to be persecuted for their differences, but no, that absolutely should not mean that a person gets to arbitrarily decide which pronouns others use to refer to him. Your ridiculously antiscientific narrative on gender is not helping said eccentrics."
"please help me  I'm new here But I cannot unsee it"
"i am. so, so excited to watch this."
"As a eastern european commie lesbian, im not a fan of JP and its really hard to describe why you don't like someone. I don't like his weird mild inconcrete answers. Or the fact that he is rich (don't trust rich people, they fucked someone over to get there). Or the fact that he has narrow set of western values. I don't know he just gives of inflexible middle aged parent vibe."
"In my opinion, this is the best video I've seen on these subjects in years."
"I really appreciate how well studied you are for this. That in tandem with the level of editing and setup shows how hard you work and i respect that like crazy. I think you may have simplified and in so doing, misrepresented SOME of what Peterson has said, especially his confrontation of Bill C-16. He just said he refused to use compelled speech when it's being enforced by a government but if a student personally asked him then he wouldn't hav e a problem with it. I don't know if he was being honest or not but he seemed candid.  Either way, great video. Props"

"20:06 'Opposing the social advancement of disadvantaged groups...' Right there, that's the problem many rational thinkers has with the left.   That statement alone when framed as it usually is... Advancement vs who?  Often the answer is  'Against privileged or non disadvantaged groups.'  1. You generalize and discriminate to apparently 'stop' generalizing and discriminating. 2. You negate any moral authority you had by committing the same act you rail against.  (1) How do you know a group is disadvantaged, or one is advantaged?  You have to make a sweeping generalizations.  Remember *WHY* racism was bad in the first place?  People looked at someone, made a broad sweeping generalization about who they were, and acted as if they 'knew' about them enough to act on this person they don't personally know at all.  (2) You act on this generalized 'moral authority', which is racist, sexist or (pick another poison) and because that group in the past committed (again you are making the same mistake) you are right to enact laws, treat them badly, ruin their lives, etc. So if you were 'right' to generalize this group in the first place for whatever reasons you had, and then act on it.  Then that group who you are acting on, who did the SAME thing with a different shade was acting correctly as well.  You NEGATE your own ideal.  Welcome to the idiotic cycle of violence.  It's a cycle of hypocrisy.  To say you need to *ADVANCE* a generalized group of people you consider disadvantaged means you are generalizing like all the racists do!    It's not about making anyone 'invisible', it's about making the idea that you KNOW all about someone based on a generalized group invisible or not exist.  As it should be.   People with on their bodies are always invisible and never talked about!  It's not that they are invisible, it's that the aspect of them you are trying to highlight PALES in comparison to who they are as an individual person!     There's a very good reason ad-hominem is a logical fallacy!"

"Yay for someone actually understanding postmodernism for fucking once!"
"Even though I would say that I generally believe/accept the mentality behind Peterson's teachings (I don't think that's the right word but you get the idea) I tend to find myself in a truly anarcho-libertarian state of mind. I hate government interference into people's lives in any way. And because of this, I think even as a fan one has to see the possibility of truly terrible people taking his words and ideas and perverting them for fascist goals. The flipside of that is that there are a lot of people 'SJW's' who are very whiny and that doesn't seem to help the situation either.    I guess this is just an example of a slippery slope,  And I feel Peterson is more the top of a mountain which can easily slide left or right. I loved this video because it pointed out some obvious fallacies in his work, and even if I wouldn't personally call myself 'left' I can easily agree with her points.   Be kind to the people who you come in contact with, and respect them. I think this is one of the more thought-provoking videos I have seen in a while. Well done. Much Love!"
"Marxism is Jewish not Western"

The best thing about it is that it introduced me to Jung, who led me to Richard Tarnas, Jean Gebser, Alfred Whitehead and John David Ebert, which I'd say is the best generalist intellectual on the internet, hands down.  JP's politics? They're absolute trash. His whole diatribe against post-structuralism and marxism is taken from Stephen Hicks's book. Talk about being ideologically possessed.  Great video! :-)"

"'Judeo-Christian' actually has Middle Eastern origins, while neo-Classicism was what inspired the founding fathers. The buildings of that time mimicked Greco Roman architecture and democracy, while not permitted for everyone, was from Athens, Greece.  Humans are not lobsters. Even humoring him to discuss animal social behavior, why lobsters? Why not seahorses or corals? There are many different types of animals, with their own hierarchies (including those with alpha females). Years ago someone with religious right ideology argued 'Even the birds know.' It is fine to ask, 'Know what? Which birds? Do you mean sex? So are we discussing hummingbirds, emperor penguins, or cardinals? Or something else?' Hummingbirds are like free love hippies, emperor penguins change partners each mating season, and cardinals remain with one partner for life. If he seems vague, is it so bad to ask specifics?"
"Wow this video was well done and quite hilarious. I haven't gotten your style up to this point, but now I do. You weren't intellectually dishonest, as you strived for.  But I am certain that marxism and postmodernism are not mutually exclusive. You nail the description of postmodernism: an inability to to know what you know and a very reductionist and divisive approach to thinking. Peterson has clearly said before that postmodern neo-marxism is marxism with gender vs. gender and race vs. race instead of class vs. class. If you combine the two, you get a reductionist and relativist approach to race and gender; that it can be endlessly deconstructed and focuses on oppressor versus oppressed (ala Marxism). In short, the exact definition of intersectionality. Postmodern neo-marxism IS intersectionality."
"Where's that white dress from?  This video is perfection. Subscribed 💌"
"Do Culture of Critique Next!"
"I've always been a huge Jordan Peterson fan. This is one of the first videos I've seen that actually brought up some valid criticisms of him. Especially without resorting to personal attacks or anything. It's nice to see people on both sides are still willing to have civil conversation about politics, or anything for that matter, as lately all I've seen are personal attacks. Although one thing that I didn't think really applied to JP here was the note about people requesting pronouns and its relationship to individual liberty. While 'requesting' the use of the pronouns does not violate individual liberty, and could be seen as even promoting it, Peterson argued that the legal requirement of using these pronouns is against individual liberty. This 'compelled speech' as he calls it was part of the Bill C16 that his grievances with gained him a majority of his initial popularity."

"A great video. Your opinions on this topic feel fresh and real when compared to some other options on Peterson on both sides of the aisle.  You really went down to the language and broke it down more than I personally and I think others care to do. I've agreed with Peterson on these subjects other than self help for a little while but I think that's because he sounded smart and I didn't really look into them. They just felt reasonable. Having real political opinions on things is hard and takes up more thought in the day than I care to give most of the time."
"o look....another woman with an opinion.....how 'revolutionary', darling."
"There is a monumental difference between a voluntary acceptance of the idea's that Peterson puts forth, and having legislation force you to accept ideas, or even make you speak, in ways you find repugnant. This seems to be a distinction you don't see, or if you do, you don't address, why?"
"tf is this why is it recommended?"

"I love you, you are beautiful. Keep up the amazing work."
"I consider myself a fan of JP. I really enjoyed this video and will likely check out others. You gave me a lot to think about and I'll be sure to call more of what he said into question. His advice has improved my life recently. I think that's why criticizing him can make some more extreme people so defensive and rude. Keep up the great work and much love from the other side."
"I am a big Peterson fan, and it is so refreshing to hear a well-thought and articulate critique on him. Great job!! In-depth research, fantastic explanations, very good arguments, and the bits of humor kept me quite entertained.  ya fuckin nailed it!"
"This is ultimately a fairer look at Peterson than most lefties have given him, albeit a catty one. It’s a very low bar though.  The “Cultural Marxism” point is based on a fallacy. If Hitler told me tomorrow that the sky was blue I wouldn’t disagree just to show my contempt. The truth  or falsehood of a statement is always the important part.  Peterson has not argued for a particularly organized conspiracy either, but that the bias of academia has produced this effect organically.  Points taken on lefty infighting, but that doesn’t really militate against what he’s saying. Part of what he’s trying to avoid is the societal decay inherent in all that naval gazing and hair splitting.  Regarding civil rights for LGTBQ++++++, he’s consistently advocated for equal rights but no special treatment, true to the “individualist” label he champions. Why don’t you see about getting him on? Maybe after his book tour when he has spare time again?  Your points regarding sheep following Peterson due to inability to accept nihilism are interesting, I’m not sure if you’re trying to be edgy or serious.  Many other thoughts but probably no one is going to read this anyway.  Cheers."
"I love the proletariyacht"
"Wtf did I just watch? Lol. Well if you want individualism try changing your name. Everyone having their own personal pronoun makes the language confusing and frustrating."
"Definitions as Peterson uses them:  Post-modernism: infinite subjective interpretations of the world = we can’t know objective reality and there is no right and wrong. Western values, EG dominant Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian ethics are now passé at best, often viewed as flatly evil. Resulting values vacuum makes people look for meaning elsewhere.  Neo-Marxism: Bedrock ethic is punch up. All humans are categorized roughly into oppressor and oppressed categories (collective identities), mapped onto race / gender / sexual orientation. The only moral good is to work towards equity, which mostly means everyone has equal resources = flatten the hierarchies."
"How could someone possibly 'disagree with everything' another person has to say? What does that even mean? Much of what ContraPoints has to say are simply facts expressed from a point if view. Is it the facts he's at odds with or the right of another person to their own perspective?"
"How dare you dissolve my unrealisticly cohesive world view with your awareness of dizzyingly varied perspectives. You biznitch!"
"The funniest woman in the left is a man  LOL"
"When Contra mentioned Rorty I almost creamed my pants. I fucking love that neoprag sob."
"As much as I like Peterson for some of his beliefs that I have found personally helpful, it's pretty clear that he's WAAAAAAAAAAY overrated. It's kind of dissapointing that he isn't more empathetic to leftist viewpoints given how astute and reasonable he otherwise seems to be. It's almost like he's bought into his court of sycophants and that thought makes me sad."

"The Cathy Newman interview was Channel 4, not BBC."
"What an entertaining video! I was curious when I saw the title specifically on what topic you would critique JP. I find that he can speak for minutes on end without saying a thing. But it’s a testament to your argumentative rigor that you were able to deconstruct him so. Also, and this is totally off topic, but I am impressed by your video work flow. That lobster queen joke invoked the usage of the 18th century sexual deviant costume twenty minutes after it was first presented. It seems you either must switch in and out if these costumes constantly, or just plan your videos in their entirety, and film scenes non-chronologically,which will be woven throughout the video. Anyway, as always I had a good laugh, and learned something new. Thanks!"
"The one thing i noticed lately is how conservatives have been arguing againts materalism, hedonism and how money is making people evil and spoiled which ironically means they are arguing againts capitalism"
"H'YUGE Jordan Peterson fan here. I've seen many videos of people trying to come with counter-arguments to JP, this is by far the best one. You pointed out some stuff I can't dispute. Good show."
"Dem references."
"Big JB fan, loved the video."
"He wasn't against laws protecting trans people. He was against people being forced to use words they dont want to. But your welcome to ignore that fact and just call him transphobic like everyone else. Truth doesn't matter here."
"Contrapoints is cool and certainly makes a man re-think a few things (about politics and philosophy, nothing else of course). This is an important video. I was initially drawn to some of Peterson's stuff because of his critique of the whiny, identity-driven student crap that is called 'the left' these days. I am a real leftist and therefore consider class and anti-capitalism to be far more important than whether everyone is nice to you. However, very quickly I began to realise Peterson is a Fascist. Maybe not the textbook definition but very close and repackaged for a modern era. A lot of what he says and the way he argues are classic Fascist obfuscation techniques designed not to prove a point but simply used to allow the passionate opponent to either humiliate themselves or to keep changing the parameters of discussion until the argument becomes null and void.  He also always uses the phrase 'cultural Marxism', which as stated in the above video is a Fascist idea. He is also a christian (with a small 'c'). Happy not to actually explain his beliefs or defend them, whilst still pushing the message that a return to 50s values is what the West needs. He is dangerous because he is softly spoken and comes with a veneer of intellectualism. His message is for white men and he tells them their enemies are; the left, the establishment, and minorities. In addition he claims the establishment is 'the left'. This only leaves 'the right' as the saviours of disenfranchised white men. It's all classic Fascist crap. If you watch Hitler's speeches and read his stuff it's very similar. Hitler too was softly spoken and came with a veneer of intellectualism and his message was for the disenfranchised white youth in a time of economic depression and global realignment. Beware Peterson."
"ContraPoints, would you go on the Rubin Report?"
"I am interested in these 'hierarchies.' Why are they specifically unjust? And what replaces them after they are abolished?"
"A self-described dropout with a long history of mental illness and a YouTube account takes a run at a successful professional researcher who treats mental illness instead of promoting it. Say what you will about how fucked up this timeline is, at least it's thoroughly entertaining."
"Peterson is aware that postmodernism and Marxism are incompatible in theory. What he argues is that precisely because postmodernism does away with all grand narratives, and because we need grand narratives to act, the post modernists fall back on the oppressor/oppressed grand narrative of Marxism. Where the 'cultural' part comes in (whether Nazi's came up with the notion or not) is that instead of looking at the oppressors and oppressed as class based, they look at it as race/gender/identity based. Cultural Marxism is real enough to me, because it is quite obvious that this narratives of race/gender/identity oppressors and oppressed is alive and well (both on the left and increasingly on the right)."
"15:45 https://youtu.be/rSzpc2vh8Ow Peterson addresses the paradox in that video if you skip to 6 minutes 25:13 https://youtu.be/_GAyMck7UtE Peterson is against legal ramifications for speech. In that video he says he would address a transgender person by the preferred pronoun."
"This is the most erudite description of modern philosophy and politics I've come across in quite some time."
"I appreciate the content, quality and humor. But not the arguments. That fringe section of academics on the left wants to tear down hierarchy by redefining all the essential parts necessary. I thought that was obvious with the kind of statements they make about identity. Nobody wants to police how they refer to themselves or whatever way they think about themselves, normies are mostly just telling them to stop forcing everyone else to believe their delusions about the epistemic reality the rest of us live in. For example, you're a weirdo and as one you know how we roll; we don't expect people to 'get us', we don't care about conventional definitions about gender, etc., because we think it makes everything more interesting and offers a perspective that other people may not directly understand but see value in."
"Soggy, bible patting conservatism, I love it. I just always said he's boring old Puritanical prude."
"Ive got alot of instgram thots in my family and one thing they taught me is what good Fakeup look like nice job"
"This video demonstrates just how little you understand the topics you speak of. Whether you meant it or not, this is a gross misrepresentation of Jordan Peterson's views."
"Lots of good points in this vid, you've got a new subscriber out of it.  Overall, I like Peterson. He's sort of a new version of Camille Paglia or Ayn Rand, because his adherents make t-shirts of the stuff he's said they like, but ignore the things they disagree with, whether it's on point or just plain whackadoodle. I don't think he has a firm grasp of postmodernism, he tends to see it as an amoral 'anything goes' approach to life. My understanding as far as I remember was it analyzes the worthwhile-ness of hierarchies through a lense of cui bono. Anyway, He's Canadian, so he may not like it cuz it's French.  I agree with him on Marxism, but I think he vastly overestimates it's place in society. I mean none of the problems we're having in this country is because of too much socialism, quite the opposite. Anyway, great channel. Glad I found it."
"Long live the queen. She is a human being."
"I thought your falsetto was gonna drop after you were done with the Victorian ho stint, but then you kept doing it and I was like 'Oh, that fake high pitch isn't a joke.'.  I like your interpretation of JBP as the Tyrannical Father.  Your points in the bathtub were pretty weak, tho.  Hard to seperate extreme leftist activists from GenderQueer LGBT Gender Theory majors cosplaying as AnarchoCommunists.  And acting like a self-help book is telling people what to do, meanwhile the left is 'just' telling people what to do is disingenuous.  The rest of your argument is about how the white capitalist patriarchy is keeping you down; justifying downplaying straight white men's opinions on account of their gender and race.  Your video style and format is entertaining but the core argument is nothing new.  At least you didn't go full Cathy."
"I don't agree with you almost in every aspect, but I love the video anyway."
"Bounced, am interested to hear your points, but not in the subtext of this video lmao. Too weird. Hope you two converse someday. I feel like all these videos amount to are.. Here's what person said, so here's what said person thinks. If Dave Rubin just made videos about people his show would be lame. You're super funny, though, too! ✌"

"Maybe Peterson is trying to be Jesus. Parables, and grand narratives. Pretty much the same thing by the way he describes it."
"Is it just me or does JP have that Ben Carson-esque 'ready for bed/no morning coffee' look and tone of voice?"
"*'... who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law shall surely end in Stalinism.'* Is this really what you think he was doing?  I mean, then right afterwards you go on to chastise Cathy Newman for taking the least charitable interpretations of everything he was saying-- like, less than a minute after.  :P"
"tfw you realize that this person was a dude. And I genuinely thought that you are beautiful. You got me there.         I think I gotta rethink my sexuality..."
"looks like 845 'rational skeptics' are terrified of their views being very gently challenged. huh. ironic."
"There is some shady shit happening in HR departments. Modern feminists have been burying evidence that doesn't fit their narrative since the 70s. It is troubling that people wearing masks, calling themselves anti fascists are behaving like fascists (beating people up for being in the wrong place or not thinking/saying the right things) while calling anyone on 'the other side' a fascist. So I think there is something behind Petersons claims. There is a difference between defining yourself a certain way and insisting that others see you (or at least say they do) the same way, especially when the way you choose to define yourself is ever changing. By all means call yourself whatever you want but don't insist that it be everyone else's reality. Not a bad video, I enjoyed your theatrics."
"There's an entertainment factor here I can appreciate. But even if forced speech laws weren't able to be described as stalinism or post modern neomarxism. The fact that the left hates capitalism and have 0 understanding of economics and wants control of economic policy is a lot more terrifying than some kind of vague patriarchy."
"The cucumber.. plz no."
"Lobsters incoming....."
"Jesus, ContraPoints, you're too pretty for me to understand half of your video. I know, and I'm sorry that's what I got from this."
"i really wonder how this came up in my recommended, and what the shit i just watched"
"I was a dummy before this video, and I'm less of one now."
"I don't understand how you can frame modernism the way you do and ignore Kant (and Hegel). Your interpretation becomes very hard to take seriously after you move from Hume to figures like Freud, Durkheim, etc., blowing past Kant (and Hegel) as though they didn't exist and weren't *at least* as important as Hume for the stuff you're talking about (much more so, I would argue). I've found that a lot of (analytic and continental) academic philosophers today (grad students, professors, etc.)—and these are the ones who bother to read the history of philosophy in the first place—have a real gap in their knowledge of Kant (and especially Hegel). I know you come from / have a background in academic philosophy (though this is the first video of yours that I've watched), and you seem like you're very authentic and honest, so I'm curious: does your experience with Kant and Hegel measure up to your experience with earlier philosophers like Hume or later philosophers like Deleuze and Foucault?  Also, I think your presentation is excellent, and it's nice to see philosophy being seriously discussed at more than a purely superficial level—with good production value."
"1. This is probably the fairest, most lucid criticism of Peterson I've seen. 2. I'm gonna assume that you really, really love Pink Flamingos (and John Waters in general)."

"Could we get her on the joe rogan show pleasee?"
"the only reason anyone critiques peterson is to use his name in their title and get traffic. as much as people hate peterson, they love riding the coat tails of his notoriety"
"The sheer stupidity in these comments is amazing. Apparently everyone forgot or never learned (wouldn't be surprised) about the 20th century."
"I really liked your presentation and you seem really well read on the subject. Sadly, just like JP, your arguments are peppered with ideological blind spots for your side, the left. I still prefer his ideas despite some of their flaws because ideas he is talking about is what brought us where we are today. Like it or not, it's history's vicious cycle of rise and fall of cultures and civilizations. The rise never happened when it was at the height of its decadence. I feel that we are living in an age of decadence and that 'the West' is about to topple down."
"It's not interesting if the concept of 'Cultural Marxism' is a 'Fascist' idea. It's only interesting whether or not it entails a reasonably correct description of reality"
"Contra, I'm trans and Peterson has made it quite clear he's fine with trans PEOPLE. He's not fine with trans ACTIVISTS. He even notes the difference in the video.  In the video you post a clip of, they flat out say,'trans activists'. Many of us trans people DO NOT support the ACTIVISTS or current activism going on in the 'community'. There is nuance to this issue."
"hi im new here.  she's hilarious."
"Brilliant. Thank you."
"I don’t agree with much you say but I always end up clicking like because your takes are so entertaining..."
"welp, this is pretty great"
"@ContraPoints  JP objects to compelled speech and you frame it as him wanting to object to protections of trans people, not exactly the same thing but the 2 issues do interact on that  C16 law. I don't think JP has ever claimed they are aiming to bring about a totalitarian regime, more that is what the outcome will be using their methods and what he is saying is true of some academics and i don't believe he is claiming all, some professors proudly proclaim that they are training activists for a communist revolutionary overthrow of the government BAMN and Yvette Felarca off the top of my head. You can leave the tag on part about the bolsheviks off as i don't believe he has claimed that, correct me if i am wrong.  I don't agree with JP on everything after all he says he is a christian and i am an atheist and when people have that debate with him, he turns to profound vaguery, 'what is truth' 'truth can be just what helps us to survive' and so on, no no no JP.  The corporate HR department part he refers to is the caving to diversity and gender quotas to try force equal outcomes, like the BBC has for example.  I have heard post modern professors say that scientific facts are not facts because they were obtained through the lens of a white male patriarchy and that we should dismantle it all and do it all again through a feminist lens, that is how it you get the CROSSOVER between post modernism and marxism, you use post modernism to deny science of its facts and then you rebuild science using a marxist lens, to me this is no different than the girl in a South African university that said all of science is wrong because it was done by the white colonialists and that witch doctors can call down lightning to strike someone, you can't explain that, that is the crazy post modernist shit JP and others are referring to.   Ok so i guess you are putting yourself in the SJW camp and saying that you argue against marxists, who???? i only ever see SJW's argue against anti-feminists for example. Who are these distinct marxists, separate from the SJWs that you challenge?  Contra said 'when really its just a bunch of bumbling bafoons who can't stop squabbling with each other over every little thing' exactly, its that squabbling petty distractions that is keeping us from dealing with the real issues, calling every little thing sexist, every little thing racist, every little thing transphobic or homophobic or Islamophobic, shuts down the discourse and divides us all.   As far as i can tell what people mean by the west is, Europe and the US and they mean that those societies in the west are based in secularism, we don't live under theocracies, we live under democracy and the government is suppose to protect people as individuals and treat everyone equally under the law. The middle east lacks some of these things(has theocracy), as does China(doesn't have a democracy and was communist), that is the full extent of what people like me mean by the west in general. Then some genuine racists chime in and we all get muddled together by our opposition through the guilt by association fallacy.  I might be arguing against you but i do like you and your videos and you are looking great by the way. I think overall a pretty decent and honest video but i think you muddled up some things as i have attempted to clarify above and i would say i am center left."
"'We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad...'  Where? When? I went to a pretty average state college in California and not only was Marx almost never mentioned during the entirety of my political science degree, but I personally became way more libertarian during college (this seems to be common for us white males)."

"Great critique of Jordan Peterson's beliefs and no not all Jordan Peterson fans are fanboys who insist on attacking anybody who questions"
"Jordan Peterson...the smartest person in the continent of America. Wish he was a u.s. citizen, that way he could run for president here. I liked your video cause it's called contra point, and being against a point is what you do, so it's right on the subject, and because you're funny and talented."
"This video is a good, I like the arguments and just want to make some things clear.  The activists are postmodern in the sense that they won't accept labeling of gender. By that Peterson means that some (mostly politicians and students) don't acknowledge that gender and biology correlate more than it differ.  Marxist because they believe that these loose groups (women and minorities) are being oppressed in a consperity like manner and the left dislike inequality. Jordan too dislike inequality, but do not want people to live in the illusion that everything would be perfect if we force men down the ladder so to speak.  If someone needs an example, see one of Jordans conversation with a journalist ob Svenska Dagbladet . // A concerned Sweed."
"He didn’t argue “against protecting trans people”. He argued against forcing people to use horse shit fake bullshit made up pronouns. Good for him."
"I think that postmodern neomarxism works as a concept because they both share a disregard for hierarchical structures. Jordan Peterson sees this as an impossible and therefore futile task. Because there is an endless amount of tribalism that can occur which is toxic. They work together as a concept if you think about it in terms of marxism applied to ideas. That is more or less to say that all values, ideas and opinions are equally valuable(a main thesis of the contemporary left.)"
"I'd like to see you have a discussion with Peterson. He's pretty open to that sort of thing."
"Shame you didnt dig into any of Petersons wacky Jungian mysticism or frat-bro like fascination hallucinogens. It might be cherry picking but there is no firmer rebuke to Peter-philes contending their favorite daddy-o is rationalism incarnate than him spouting off a bunch of bullshit that belongs on a Joe Rogan podcast."
"JP is not against civil rights for trans people. He is against people in the Canadian government passing laws that compels people to use preferred pronouns for 'non-binary' individuals. Moreover he is against the law legislating biology - he claims that bill C-16 could make it illegal to say that there is a biological difference between men and women. Furthermore JP never compared trans activist to Stalin. What he does claim is that the progressive left's push for 'equality of outcome' is at the core of communist philosophy. The implementation of which led to the death of hundreds of millions in the early 20th century. Whether you agree or disagree with these points it would be nice for intellectuals on the left to actually attack what he says rather than setting up and knocking down obvious straw man arguments."

"First Contra video I've seen.  Fucking hilarious!  I probably disagree on some politics but she made good points.  Seems far left but able to take/make a joke, which is refreshing.  This is the type of progressive that can change minds.  Subbed for sure."
"At least it won’t procreate"
"Mlle. ContraPoints, this is great and very creative - really as substantive as creative. But it's not onside folks you need to impress with your analysis. It's JP's fanbase. You've got way too much flair for them, and I doubt they're going to stick around to listen. Btw, I would love to see you have a back-and-forth with JP in a public forum."
"Awesome a left leaner actually listening to what JP says and unpicking it. Thank fucking god. I'm so sick of people attacking him instead of his arguments. You heard the hope part and grasped the 'oppression' part  and picked his conclusions to bits. I like that. He does what the worst leftists do - ascribes personal conspiracy motives. I loathe it. No I don't believe in 'the patriarchy' I just see everyone being shat on in different ways. Which is not the same as saying I don't believe in equality or that i think that things are equal enough now. I just disagree - strongly - with the methods employed to fix it. And just because someone is a racist or a misogynist doesn't mean nothing they have to say is worth listening to. It just means watch out for inconsistencies which could be steering their arguments to unfair or abusive outcomes.  Anyway - tl: Dr - thank you for this."

Not everyone is gender-confused."

"If a school adopts a policy to enforce students paying for the tiniest thing.  Everything costs money.  You'd call them capitalist. (Screw what they actually believe in right?)    By that same token, if a school/business enforces an egalitarian policies through equality of outcome that's absolutely Marxist.  There's no need for any sort of 'conspiracy'.  And as much as people might hate being nickle and dimed.  Equality of outcome constantly shows itself to be much MUCH worse."

"Marxist = Believes people can be subdivided into classes, that are ordered in a rigid hierarchy and locked in perpetual conflict.   Neo Marxist = Believes that things like sex, heritage and identity can be equated with the concept of class. Though intersectionality theory 'does' provide a lot of nuance, this things are typically analysed in the rigid marxist manner, with rigid hierarchies and perpetual victims.   Modernist = Someone who believes in grand narratives, science (see also 'biologism') and in a wider sense the value and identity of the western world.   Postmodernist = Someone who treats objective knowledge with contempt, especially biological attempts at explaining components of human behaviour. Someone who is skeptical of the value and identity of the western world. Someone who wants to deconstruct and problematize even truths that are useful and highly self evident   Post modern neo marxist = Someone who does the same things as a postmodernist while politically motivated by a neo marxist analysis of society (where masculinity, capitalism and western capitalism are portrayed as oppressive structures which need to be counteracted)."

"The reaction from atheists to the mention of judeo Christian anything is really bizarre.  I'm a Catholic.  Kind of.  My entire religious education had two layers.  For the intellectually lazy,  there was bearded daddy God.  For anyone with even a slight inclination to question, catholicism made a strong frame to explore a spirituality and question.  I LIKE hearing about religion, all kinds.  I even like hearing about atheism, although it's a pretty short conversation, especially when the person frothes at the mouth when you reference the Bible.    Why the bearded daddy God appeals to people and why they willingly (seem to) give up agency...that's not a simple answer.  Really.  Why others would rather die than give up that agency, that's interesting too.  You had the privilege of higher Ed.  Many don't.  Worldwide, the only access some people have to bigger questions is through organized religion.   Peterson doesn't exclusively focus on judeo Christian values/worldview.  His Bible lectures are the type of thing you'd hear in a first year theology class, which is NOT a bad thing.  It's interesting to see a person 'get there' from a very different profession.  They have good introductory references to solid sources.   It's undergrad Contra.  You were most of the way to a PhD. Your criticism kind of comes across as you dismissing people who enjoy and get something out of 'undergrad' as poorly educated idiots.  It's elitist, and one of the most consistently irritating traits of leftist academics.  The people who get something out of Peterson don't work in the ivory tower.  And most ivory tower academics couldn't find the front line of a mine with a map.  No matter how oppressed they claim to be."
"political post modernism today could pragmatically be described as 'radical subjectivity'  where the radical part is optional.  Anyway, what I miss from this otherwise good video is the whole point about how a lot of these left ideas are being lumped together - with all it's in-fighting not overly visible from the right - and are driving a huge part of left-centrists and centrists to the right, because it's become toxic in the otherwise progressive leftism which is easier for the masses to digest."
"17:15 HEAVY TRUTH RIGHT HERE"
"What an oddly eucatastrophic moment for the rekt'ed of the earth! The best (and not the least beautiful) response to some of Peterson's uninvited cultural careenings. You've been very fair and, I think, will be treated fairly because of that. Thank you."
"Awesome a leftist who can have intellectual and honest conversation. I’ve read gulag archipelago and any form of group identity and Marxism must be stopped at all costs."
"Neo-Marxism is not Marxism. In the sense that Peterson is using it, it is the perception of society as a struggle between various social classes stratified along other dimensions of human identity (e.g. race, gender, sexuality) that enables bougie champagne socialists to condescend to everyone else about how privileged we are while laughing at us for our above-ground pools. This seems like a pretty serious flaw in your analysis.  As far as I can tell, the extent to which Peterson regards this to be a postmodern ideology is more difficult to pin down. I usually make a point of referring people to Peterson's interview with Stephen Hicks, as it appears JP's criticism of postmodernism is mostly in lockstep with Hicks', and Hicks drills down on these criticisms in a much better fashion than I am liable to articulate here. Something to do with an emphasis on power relationships resulting from our inbuilt biases? Hicks spends like the first hour just detailing the history of philosophy leading up to the introduction of postmodernism, so it's really worth a listen. I'm not really well-versed in that literature."
"I swear, Cultural Marxism is like the Illuminati of the modern age."
"This is pure brilliance"
"You're pretty funny. Also arousing."
"The Cathy Newman interview or possibly anti-interview was on Channel 4 News not the BBC, things like that are important to us Brits, well the pedantry ones anyway - also takes the polish off how rigorous you appear."
"Really you don't talk about philosophy........... Ok you really need to get out more, or maybe i should. So how do you think progressives are supposed to progress....... and yes Peterson doesn't understand post modernism. See this video    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU1LhcEh8Ms&lc=z23axfdjoymixx3o204t1aokgvxrkcwviosyluiwmfjtbk0h00410.1525646387189266"
"Omg, as someone who really likes Jordan Peterson, I loved this video! It's so refreshing to see someone disagree with his ideas in an organized, collected, and funny manner! This is what's seriously lacking in the culture right now. We need more civil (and cheeky) discourse like this."
"I really like your videos. That is all."
"Me: Yay! Hume! The bes- 12:56 Me: aww :("
"Ahhhh...the obsession with politics, perfectly indicated in the Trojan horse argument.  Problem, of course is that progressives cannot make the responsibility argument because current progressive politics are anti-responsibility and paternalistic.  So, of course, progressives must resort to describing dog-whistles and Trojans. Just a small and important distinction.  Peterson is not anti trans people, he is anti legislated speech.  Presenting him as anti trans is not honest."
"I can't hit the like button enough times... Bravo"
"Am I the only one who thought this was a bit rapey?"
"Two genders only."
"contrapoints is actually jordan peterson in drag"
"This is probably the best video I've ever seen on YouTube."
"dam u look hot"
"Even ignoring the content (which was great by the way) that was one of the funniest, most well constructed videos I've seen anywhere on youtube."
"Yep. The 'Neo Post Modern Neo Marxist' label is rapidly becoming as vapid as the 'fascist' label. Both side dish out silly alarmist labels in lieu of actually debating. Someone says something slightly conservative or right wing? They fascist neo-nazi cunt. Who, if we allow them to continue, will destroy our civilisation and march us all to the gas chambers. Someone says something vaguely left-leaning or progressive? Then they are a neo-Marxist postmodern arse hole who, if we allow them to continue, will destroy our society and march us all off to the gulags. What ever happened to listening and debating ideas?"
"Still clearly a man. I'd suggest to keep up with the hormones a few more years."
"So I wanted to thank you for being your strange self. Your production values and costuming are killer and you seem to be having a really good time doing your thing and being yourself. Which brings me joy, because one of my younger sisters is in the middle of transitioning and it's really nice to see someone just having that as part of their identity and being a successful but still eccentric human being. My sister's got some issues and I worry about her finding her stride in the world, I'm concerned that part of her thinks that once she becomes a WOMAN (heavenly chorus and lightning bolts) she'll feel normal and all the things that make life difficult will melt away. And I think it will help her feel more herself, but chasing normal is a farce. This might sound like a backhanded compliment but it helps knowing your kind of weirdness is out there, because you're eccentric in a creative way and I can point to you and people like you when my sister doesn't think the world has a place for people like her and say 'Look at these people, they are killing it, they are happy, they exist, there's space for you in the world!' So thanks for that.    As for Peterson; I can't speak to any of his other stances, I haven't really been keeping up with what Peterson's been up to, but I was always under the impression that the original complaint about the Pronoun law was that people were being sort of bludgeoned for things they hadn't said rather than things they had and there was a lot of pressure from the university administration to adhere to these new rules  before it even became a law or face job loss. As I recall he was hugely (justifiably or not) concerned about the way the law was written making it precedent for essentially compelling certain kinds of speech. Not that he had a problem with using certain pronouns.  Though I do recall he found it perplexing the sheer multitude of terms that were listed and how many designations (of note were the many 'animal-kin' designations) were given the same weight as those we've become (or are becoming) accustomed to. I didn't really have a problem with that stance, I think it's way easier to tell people they can't say discriminatory things in a professional setting than it is to tell people they have to use certain terms or risk being penalized. And I can see his point in being opposed to that tactic in enforcing anti hate laws.  Of course the law also essentially just updated some aspects of the Canadian criminal and human rights codes to account for gender identity and expression (and catch up to some of the provinces in doing so) which was good so he might have been making a big todo because his bosses were being really pushy and he's now become a celebrity over what amounts to a workplace disagreement. Which would be hilarious if it didn't cause so many people so much grief."
"Watching this from the other side of the political isle, I have to admit the video is hilarious.  So, let me preface this by saying that I do not consider myself a Peterson fan, though I share some of his views. That being said, the argument presented here is sound, but, ironically, like the Cathy Newman lobster debacle, it only chips away at the surface, targeting his phraseology and formulations instead of the substance of his claims.  Yes, ''postmodern neo-marxism'' is a nonsensical term. And, yes, Peterson is only using it to avoid the extremist baggage that goes with ''cultural marxism''. However, the fact that some leftist academics (Herbert Marcuse in particular comes to mind) actually attempted to push socialism through culture rather than economics. Now, this isn't an assumption, or a conspiracy theory, as Marcuse openly discusses these things.  For example, in ''Repressive Tolerance'', he argues for the complete abolition of freedom of expression for right wing ideas (all of them, not just the extremist ones like fascism). In 'One-Dimensional Man'', he claims that the workers have become ''too integrated'' in capitalism, having lost their ''revolutionary potential''; that, instead, radical intellectuals should create a revolutionary vanguard by rallying the ''socially marginalized'' (women, racial and religious minorities, LGTB folks). So, when you take this ideological platform into account from a theoretical standpoint and compare it to what is going on in American and Canadian college campuses in practice, can you truly see no connection?"
"This is a great video with some great points and I wish I could focus on them more but I’m vexed and haunted by the JP mannequin"
"This video has done the best job so far that I have seen of pointing out how utterly AVERAGE Peterson's intellect is. Scratch a bit and there's literally NOTHING interesting there."
"12:02 no Zarathustra’s Serpent?! I’m incensed!!"
"I hope Jordan Peterson watches this. It will make him so uncomfortable."
"You are chaos, he is order. You are a cute couple."
"My boner is incredibly confused right now..."
"'you're saying we should model our society....     around lobsters'"
"omfg daddy Peterson!!!!"
"Out of all politic channel Contra has the highest production quality"
"So good 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
"i loke your definition of ironism"
"I never thought one needs to read that many books to understand the breath of Western philosophy and you went an extra mile to somehow read the Map of Meaning. And I didn’t know there is a fight within the left. I thought the left were all are united. Marx vs. identity vs postmodern!! Worst team up ever. Well, I felt like I need to donate to your pateron for reading all those books...  I fell away from Jordan when he was not clear on his beliefs against Harris. I guess there are infighting within the right too. I thought you were going to talk about C-16 but surprise that you went for his belief system. I appreciate your help. I learned something even though the solution is not in sight. I just know what it is not. The left has to figure out what they want to be: Marx, postmodern or identity or something else and nothing else."
"Alright.  You got this unapologetic JBP lover to subscribe.  If only to reimagine the bathroom scene as a self-insert fanfic."
"You're amazing"
"This channel is fantastic!  Contra has set the bar on what to be if you're an SJW type person.  Funny, insightful, intelligent, intellectual, and did I say funny?  Good stuff."
"I call her Miss Peterson. She said that shouldn't be a problem.?."
"So within two minutes of your video you say you're not into reason and truth? Hmmmmmm..... You're an idiot and I'm already done listening to what you have to say."
"That Sargon self-pwn tho...  Michel Faux-Coo"
"This was the last place I'd think I'd find a solid/well-thought argument counter to someone like JP. And I actually like/sort of follow the guy! Good stuff ContraPoints. Earned that subscribble,"
"Holy shit you're make up is so amazing in this video!! 😍"
"Gotta get me that bisexual manicure... BUT HOW WILL I PLAY MY GUITAR???"
"We must defend post modernity against the neo over intellectualism of SJW´s like Peterson."
"This was a great analysis. Not only was it informative, but it was amusing, too.  Regarding 'PoMo Neo-Marxism vs. The West' I think you missed the mark a bit. When people talk about 'The West' they talk about the ideas that they value, given them by their ancestors. Free Market, and Free Speech the most important of those, I might say.  These values are DEFINITELY under attack. I think it's more complicated than just 'Neo-Marxists did it!' But Marxist thinking and Critical Theory are definitely elements at play."
"Comrade  Contra A.K.A. La Contra is at it again!"
"spot on"
"David Brooks called him, queue hysterical laughter."
"First, to get things straight. Are you really suggesting that Communists (academic or otherwise) actually weren't plotting to destroy the West? I mean, does the Cold War mean nothing? I suppose you could argue that its all the West's fault that we couldn't let the Communists live their peaceful existence, but for some reason I don't think that's a complete story.  Sorry if that seems like a strawman, but I just genuinely don't see how you can possibly think that Communists weren't trying to destroy the West. It isn't like the Soviet Union actually thought that it could coexist peacefully with nations with 'free markets.' I just don't understand why thinking that Communists have been (are) trying to destroy the West makes you a fascist/nazi. I would go into how terrible the DPRK is (or how bad the USSR was), but I'm sure that will be met with 95 theses against the West. Look, I agree that talking about 'Postmodern neoMarxism' is inflammatory, but do you think you're not being inflammatory by suggesting that Peterson is employing 'fascist' tactics?  Its hard to know where to go from there. As usual, you enlist the typical 'Postmodernism is opposed to Marxism' and vice versa sort of argument. This is true, but only to a point. The sad thing is that I think you're actually aware of this.  For example, its not like the Postmodernists like the current status quo, and you're absolutely correct that they just want to 'deconstruct' everything. You also admit that they just see shifting terminology/vocabulary as a shift in power. So from that it makes complete sense why Postmodernists would be (neo? whatever the hell this prefix means)Marxists, at least in the sense that its just a tool to cause chaos (i.e. deconstruct what we 'think' we know). That doesn't mean that Postmodernists would like marxism, but instead that they see Marxism as a tool.  So if you were going to accuse Peterson of anything here, I would actually argue that his most damning criticism is that he's actually a bit of a postmodernist himself. I actually think that's true, and I hope one day to ask him about it.  Also, I find it highly interesting about the 'sarcastic' conversation. Was it sarcastic because you were actually admitting that progressive politics takes the place of 'purpose' in people's lives? Watching your videos, I really think that your 'progressive politics' is really important to you, and it drives you to act. I don't know, it really sounded to me that you are reinforcing Peterson's point here. You can sit there and say that you don't think your life has any purpose, but you're certainly not acting that way. If you only did youtube videos for the reasons that you said, you wouldn't be exclusively making political videos.  By the way, are you really suggesting that transgenderism isn't about 'deconstructing' gender norms? Is it really that much of a stretch to suggest that 'you can become the opposite gender' is attacking how we understand gender? I'm really confused about your question, because its almost like you don't listen to yourself speak. You have an entire channel about this sort of thing.  As to the 'abolition of hierarchies,' I simply don't believe this statement. Its right here in the communist manifesto: 'The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.'  Now, you might argue that they'll set up 'new' social conditions, but a) why on earth would those be any better? and b) if you've thrown out all social conditions, then you have no social conditions to create. You can't just make social conditions out of nothing. I really think, quite literally, at least for Marx, his end goal was some sort of communal anarchy absent power. The way he talks about people who aren't on board with communism, for example, is almost like they're an ancient people. Its almost like he thinks that the communist is 'enlightened' (which makes sense, because he's working from the Hegelian Dialectic) and the people who don't get it will wither and die, leaving only like minded spartan people minus the spartan spirit. But maybe you're right. Maybe anarchy does mean that there is a rule. Kinda goes against the name, but ohwell.  Honestly, I kinda hesitate to even post this. It seems like, to me, that you haven't even tried to engage with these ideas. I will agree that Jordan Peterson is just like yo, but on the other side. He's certainly a political figure.  He's certainly says controversial and interesting points of thought. However, I kinda get the sense that you're not very self aware about what you are. I kinda get the sense that you think that you're actually not trying to do the things JP is saying tha you are, when--especially in this video--you do them over and over all the while denying that you do those things. In most of your videos, I would have taken that comment about Freud to be a joke, for example; but in this video (especially the bathtub dialogue) you seem to deny that you want to, say undermine gender norms ALL THE WHILE BEING A WOMAN WHO WAS ONCE A MAN.  How can you possibly sit there and say with a straight face that you aren't interested in destroying the current cultural values? I guess you do that by just throwing your hands up in the air saying 'what are the current cultural values anyway?' To which I say, bullshit. You act on values, I act on values. Everyone acts on values. To borrow a phrase from Nagel 'you don't have to know the origins of the universe to know you want an asprin when you have a headache.'  This video is just really frustrating to me, because I get the sense that you're actually really angry about all this. It seems to me that you're so angry that you've decided to block out what you really think about this only to hide in epistemic skepticism so you don't have to say what you really think.  I simply don't believe that you've shared your actual opinions here. The reason being is that even the videos that I disagree with vehemently are delightfully provocative. But here, I'm just left thinking what the hell you are actually trying to say."
"well done Main point: Marxism— grand narrative post modernism— rejects marxism in many ways and grand narratives in general  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 I’ve been saying this for a while and I’m glad i’m not the only lunatic post modern neo marxist out here (:"
"Im a big fan of Petersons , But I think I found the devil to sit on my left shoulder.  Subscribed."
"was that a weed plant"
"This is the best YouTube video ever"
"I have learned alot from JP and alot from ContraPoints!  Tis possible to do both my friends.  Most important lesson I have taken from JP,  do not give in to the negative aspects of Tribalism that  exudes from the extreme right and left,  be your own person.  Take responsibility so you can make your life and the lives of the people around you better. Make your self strong so you can lend that strength to others.  Peace and Love good people."
"26:10 Fucking awesome reference!"
"very well made!~"
"I don't think you tackled the topic well enough."
"as soon as she snorted her pinky I subscribed"
"D   A   D   D   Y"
"I'm so happy you have made this video response. I saw JP's BigThink video and I agree, he's an articulate man who denounces white supremacy, but he's got some issues in his arguments, and I love seeing you lecture about him!"
"I UNDERSTOOD THE PINK FLAMINGOS REF"
"This was a very informative and entertaining video. Thank you 😁"
"Splendid vid! Thanks yo"
"My purpose (as a Discordian) Is to weaken and disorder all forms of order. Stronger Orders make for stronger disorderers."
"love how you structured your video. Very cool."
"I stumbled upon this video. It’s hilarious and so well done. I saw a video of him saying he wouldn’t support gay marriage if it were supported by Neo-Marxist. Like I’m sure gay couples have a picture of Marx next to their pictures of Judy Garland. But yeah, it’s okay to deny human rights based solely on his personal dislike for support from a small segment of society. How prevalent does Peterson think Neo-Marxism is today? I know plenty of conservatives but not one Marxist! This is just a straw man in order to give his ideas a sense of immediacy."
"Watch one video on anime traps and suddenly Facebook starts recommending me shitty leftist propaganda..."
"Any summary of Peterson's work that does not address: the Perato distribution, evolutionary pragmatism, and a biological model for the  emergence of ethics is an oversimplification. A straw man. I think you know that. I think your deliberately avoiding these things. The left will never properly address Peterson's criticisms until they start engaging honestly with his arguments instead of trying to generate excuses to dismiss him. You came closer than most. I like watching your videos but, I wish they were as insightful as they are entertaining.   Also I would like to see you address the work of Steven Hicks. I think that might make Peterson's 'postmodern neo Marxism' look like less of a 'cluster fuck'."
"Very good video. I haven't found many entertaining and intellectually stimulating leftist (or rather, not right-leaning) channels. Good points are made. Easy to sit down and watch and stay focused."
"I just can't listen to your voice."
"Why are your videos so scary"
"Wow! This is incredibly hilarious, creative, insightful. Where have you been all my life, ContraPoints!?"
"It wasn't BBC interview"
"This video was amazing.  Also, in the car today, I was singing 'Lobster Queen' but to the tune of 'Dancing Queen by ABBA lmao."
"You aren’t interested in reason? How are we supposed to have a rational conversation if you aren’t interested in reason?"
"Is homie here supposed to be discrediting JBP?"
"I really enjoyed that.  I lack much training in philosophy and Western culture because I got an engineering degree, which doesn't make you take much of those types of subjects, but JPs calling identity politics neo-Marxism made no sense to me, so I've been watching things by and about JP for awhile to try to understand better, and this one is Gold."
"Big JBP fan, the bathtub scene was my favorite part."
"Would you ever speak/debate with him? It would be fantastic! I think the left needs someone that can have dialogue with him and I think you're a great and I think your criticisms are fair for sure. Just stumbled across your channel, subbed!"
"first thing you said about Peterson was a strawman.  video over"
"You got some of the best political content on YouTube but legit all your jokes are about gender and sexuality"
"I've been subbed to you for years, and I have to admit I haven't really been watching the last year or so but damn! You've really stepped up your game. Well done!"
"I love all free expression unless it expresses distaste of my own expression... Believe me, that makes perfect sense. Now enjoy this video of my lies while I pretend my body didn't naturally produce a male genitalia. It's ok because this is my expression. Just remember that if you don't like my expression your expressionary reaction is the problem and allows me to belittle your expression en masse. Don't mind that less than 0.0001% of Earth's total population is transgendered, it's most certainly normal enough to be considered natural. This is art, not delusion. You are rude and bigoted if you disagree..."
"Something something Kermit joke"
"Postmodernist points are being used as an (illogical) excuse for Marxism, the people who are doing so are contradicting themselves and I believe that's the point. They say, you can't possibly know the truth while simultaneously saying the 'oppressed' or 'harassed' person is right. Yes, postmodern Neo-Marxism is an illogical name for an illogical group."
"Omg I love this channel now!"
"Fuck off"
"You’re so weird, I think I’m in love with you"
"I disturbingly liked your video (mostly because of the sex-doll), even as a self-reportedly Peterson-fan, but I would like to hear your thoughts on this; it seems most of the disagreements/polarization is against the extremes of the opposite position.  For instance; Marxism isn't only defined by it's grand narrative that postmodernism denies. It's also defined by seeing a power-struggle as classification between groups, which is a postmodern (at least today) concept. And while postmodernism asks legitimate questions about common sense/the grand narrative, it's also provided answers with a certainty the theory itself disavows.  Perhaps you'd be willing to consider this article and the ones it links to: https://areomagazine.com/2018/04/28/skepticism-is-necessary-in-our-post-truth-age-postmodernism-is-not/"
"Goddamn if you're not sexy as hell"
"Liked for you putting 2:42 together. High-quality video shitposting."
"I don't think you understood his points about hierarchies.   Hes not justifying or defending  them, he wants ppl to understand them better - to stop blaming capitalism or the patriarchy for the negative effects of a natural dynamic which is 3.5 billion year old."
"The only reason why this moron got 'popular'  was due to his misrepresentation of history and Bill C-16.   his debate with Matt dillahunty really shows his stupidity"
"Do you think Peterson wants his 12 rules to be enshrined in law?  You compare Peterson writing a book of guidelines with changing the actual law in Canada to compel people to use 'trans' people's pronouns.  Do you see the difference between writing a book of ideas that people can use or not use at their discretion vs making laws that compel speech?  Do you really not see the connections between neo-Marxists, HR depts, feminists, SJWS, postmodernists, etc?  All advocate that there are no differences between sexes or races, and that equality must be enforced by a government.  They say both that everyone is equal, but that diversity is good.  You say Peterson is contradicting himself in his attacks on these disparate groups, but the contradictions are within the individual ideologies themselves.  Why do you act like women should be 'equally' represented in government positions?  What if fewer women want those jobs?  What if fewer women are competent enough to fill those positions?  You say Marxism is at odds with postmodernism, but Peterson talks about neo-Marxists, who he says have given up on the class struggle and switched the debate to over your beloved 'oppressed people.'  You exemplify this by bringing up 'disadvantaged people' constantly and talking about hierarchies of race, gender and economics.  What are the hierarchies of race and gender?  Like what does that mean?  How are those relevant to any Western nation where equality under the law is ubiquitous?  Or do you, like the neo-Marxists and SJWs, want an equal outcome for every race and gender?  And you want to abolish the hierarchy of 'economics?'  What does that mean?  How is that not exactly what Peterson is talking about?  A hierarchy where the more competent rise to be more economically successful is inevitable unless you have a neo-Marxist totalitarian state which prevents the rise of the competent.  Requesting someone use a pronoun can be seen as individualist - having the government compel people to use whatever pronoun you choose or make up out of thin air, is not individualist and is totalitarian."
"we're breaking the lobster ceiling"
"You missed the neo in the Marxism. It helps bring it together."
"ContraPoints vs JBP debate/interview/talk. Do it. Peterson constantly complains that left doesn't invite him.  I trust ContraPoints to handle it much better than Ms. Newman."
"But also like why do we have to live under the impression that life is suffering in the first place? I feel like in order to better live a life when discussing philosophy by not starting with the given being that suffering is the default people would be better off. And I’ve been diagnosed with major depression so like... yeah I don’t know."
"Can we talk about Pepe Silvia?! I'm dyin' to talk about Pepe Silvia!"
"Lol jerking off and taking dirty bong rips to this. Looks like i found my trap anime waifu. Imma do a cum tribute to lobster bae now hit me up on twitch"
"These comments shitting on Peterson are embarrassing..."
"The biological differences between men and women mean we shouldn't expect 50/50 numbers across the board. So when men are more likely to die at work, and women are underrepresented at the extremes of certain fields, we can't infer sexism. The conversation doesn't have to end there though: is there any way to improve the process for sexual crimes which disproportionately affect women (except in the US if you count prison rape)? Should women get lighter sentences for the same crimes and win custody of children more often in divorce? What percentage of female engineers and politicians should we even be aiming for? I don't think JP is shutting down those conversations, and I know that the right-wing position isn't 'you don't deserve justice and equality'. Those are nebulous terms, we just have different definitions.  Great video Contra, really made me examine my ideas as usual. You're looking really great, I hope the transition is working out for you"
"Yay! How marvelous! I simply loved everything here, kudos to Zoe Blade!"
"Love your nails."
"So um. I'm far more aroused than I thought I'd be. Like... far more."

"You must be doing something right when you have a total JP fanboy with a username which references a right-wing politician elated when you release videos. I noticed it a couple of days ago, but I decided to wait until I had enough free time to really digest what you're saying and appreciate the production"
"Thank you @ContraPoints! I appreciate your lucid critique but especially your delicious humor and wigs."
"Yay! How marvelous!"
"This is simply the best video--perhaps even better than many of the best books--on philosophy I've ever seen. This should be required viewing for every graduate philosophy program. I hope this earns some kind of award to draw more attention to it. Congratulations."
"I had to watch this several times to keep track of the argument, but it finally set in, and it's perfect. This is the ideal response to Peterson."
"Okay sultry eyes, I see you!"
"I think it is actually useful for people to engage with others ideas like this person does rather than just demonizing the other and dismissing it because of intellectual laziness and ideological overconfidence. This is probably the only person who criticizes JP that has actually spent the time to even figure out what the fuck he is even about first"
"he's probably not using the term 'progressive politics' just because it's becoming less and less obvious what constitutes 'progressive', especially in a social climate where speech is tantamount to violence."
"Intellectual arguments for the particular over the statistical aggregates... which is always ludicrous. A man with only a hammer only sees nails ... a man who scrutinises personal psychology only sees personal responsibility !"
"I love this"
"Loving Abigail's character development from asshole TERF to confused TERF."
"This was quite difficult to understand. Initially, I agree with Peterson regarding the free speech issue; mandating certain forms of speech is dangerous. I also don't see any benefit in compartmentalising one persons entire mindset into either left or right ideology.  I do not wish to hurt anyone, or cause them suffering. Personally I cannot identify with the non bi-gender issues. I also consider most of my ideas to be on the left spectrum.  So I think this is what I do not get: Why are the new non-gender-binary pronouns so important that it is morally/ethically and intellectually justified to mandate that form of speech?"
"Really liked the video. I think your caricature of Peterson's rhetoric is spot on. However I think that it is a very convincing method of making your argument. He states what you as a listener considers true and  you are then able to draw your own conclusions given the context. Also your point about it being tricky to answer such arguments was not very convincing since you yourself had good answers to the examples given. I mean Newman could have responded to the lobster argument by simply saying that no one on the left claims that hierarchy predates western society."
"Kudos!  As a subsidiarity minarchist, I'm not on-board with your politics, but I <3 <3 <3 your actually criticizing what he's saying/doing, rather than just taking a flamethrower to a cardboard caricature.  Screwtape was wrong: argument IS the best way to keep the patient from the enemy's clutches, and where that's concerned, you're ON POINT.  :)"
"I don't see what the hulabaloo is all about... neckbeards and redpillers swarming around a harmless one-hit wonder hack like Jordan Peterson is simply a sign how thoroughly the alt-right has been curbstomped by antifa in the public sphere. In other words... it's a good thing. As for Peterson himself... Benjamin Franklin was right - an educated blockhead is still just a blockhead.  Your voice is sounding great, by the way."

"20:52 one of the things left tries to catch JP on, is that 'imply', the trick however is - he does not imply. He tries to articulate stuff as far as it is possible, but won't cross the border, and the gap in imply and what is being articulated is almost nonexisting in most cases. the point he conducts is through general picture created by those articulations. The whole picture is the point, and words are used to voice consciousness and subconsciousness as they appear as is. He does not answer what to do with all that but established a modern understanding of the old basis on which, as a real and objectively observed reality, we need to build our next levels. And one of the problems of the left, they did forgot or ignorant about the basis or roots and if they do not include that in their thought process it not necessarily will lead to a good system."
"Despite not agreeing with practically any of your points I am happy this exists and isn't just a stupid rant. It has the capability to start something that doesn't just demonise people for having different points of view and I really like that."
"Great video. Small correction: It was with Channel 4, that Jordan Peterson had the interview with Cathy Newman, not BBC. Believe it or not, we Brits do have other news channels other than BBC."
"*looks at CP's wall of posters*  Is that Rachel McLish on one of those posters?"
"Great video by the way. I forgot to write this comment yesterday when I saw it and took to arguing with others in the comments. It's worth pointing out that no political youtuber even comes close to Contra's video quality. Your recent ones are exemplary of how everyone should do youtube. The amount of effort put into these is worthy of praise. JBP uses one measure for the truth of his words and that's how and if they positively improve people's lives and according to him, he's got plenty of experience in talking. It's his job, and I think a lot of his advice is good, and a lot of his psychological insight into historical motivations is at least interesting. He could do with a bit less fear mongering, but for me what made me pay notice to his words wasn't the political things, it was his interpretation of Pinocchio, which ended up making the movie infinitely more interesting, and made me start pay attention to the things I find interesting and why that is.   As a side note just to share my opinion on the issue of trans-gender and -sexualism - it's rather weird to me that this is the harder thing to accept compared to gay marriage, when it should be the other way around. Historically speaking, cultures have been way more accepting of trans people than gay people, and we have some modern examples of very traditional cultures where this is still the case. I guess trans is much harder to communicate, especially if someone's never met a trans person in real life. Homosexuality in culture is much newer than transgenderism (and I do mean in terms of gender, as in the performative role, I know sex change operations are relatively new) so it's really confusing to me how gays would be more accepted than trans people. I'm all for everyone, but I think on the issue of trans, the current west is entirely wrong, seeing as how they aren't already integrated in the culture when they should be."
"The critiques of Professor Peterson are cool and all, but my favorite part of the video was %100 the bisexual manicure"

"Congrats on making it into Current Affairs! https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/05/god-bless-contrapoints"
"I really enjoyed this video. As someone who has been following Jordan Peterson for a while, I have been getting very frustrated with his arguments. On the one hand, he gives off an aura of authenticity and intellectuality, but he also seems to over simplify complex concepts (like lobster hierarchies or PoMo). Thank you for this excellent deconstruction of his viewpoint. I think I have understood the man a bit more because of your video and now have some more talking points when discussing J Pete with friends.   I wonder if you have seen this video he did for Big Think (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVUnUnWfHI)?? He makes a very similar criticism of the left and PoMo and Marxism as he has done before, but here he makes this very legitimate point. He says the there are those on the right who have decided which markers of the extreme/radical right are intolerable - racial superiority he says is a well accepted marker on the moderate right of something which can never be tolerated. He goes on to suggest that the left should do the same - identify a marker which would make a doctrine/ideology intolerable. He suggests that it should be the 'doctrine of equity', saying that equality of outcome can never be achieved. I think here he makes a valid point, not about equity, but that leftists should identify a marker for what is an unacceptable doctrine. What do you think of this final point?"
"The back drop of this video looks just like a bar in DC"
"OH NO! AN INDIVIDUALIST! QUICK GET HIM TO THE GULAGS!!!!!"
"Jordan Peterson is a hot dad who i want to shut up"
"JBP is not using lobsters to justify hierarchy, or to claim that they are inevitable, but to explain how we got here, and to point out that it needs to be considered as we move forward. Lyshenkoist tendencies do in fact exist still and following them might go to bad places.  For example:  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08038740.2015.1136681"

"That's a better explanation of the time line of modernism to post modernism than I had in 3 fucking years of university. Good work."
"First time viewer, and damn, both your sense of comedic timing and your analyses are razor sharp!  I'm one of those loser guys with whom JP's stuff about growing the fuck up resonated pretty powerfully with (as you say, because of the language used - turns out that's pretty important to people who think analytically) but I've also been a 'practising' atheist my whole life (and appreciating his nuanced-but-subjective take on the archetypes in the bible and their social impact ain't gonna change that) and think of myself as left-oriented. So I'm generally in agreement with what you like and dislike about the guy and what you agree and disagree with.   I'd also throw into the 'dislike column' how he tends to brush over just how much of social hierarchy is NOT predicated on competence like he asserts - he throws a bone to those of us who can see how the wealthiest and most powerful actually keep (and inherit and pass down) their position by saying hierarchy is not ALWAYS a fair meritocracy (and oh-dear-yes-that's-a-problem) but the reality is that it hardly EVER is. Shit, is that too Marxist a comment for someone who counts himself as something of a JP fan?  A bit where I disagreed with you: Identity politics isn't some innocuous organisational mechanism to rally advocacy around, it divides people and uses the idea of privilege to insist on who can and can't talk about an issue, as if we have no common humanity or can LEARN about what we might be unfamiliar with. Seems to me it's essentially as discriminatory as the oppression it's attempting to fight."
"In before '... you just aren't on the same level of analysis as JP'."
"Peterson doesn't care about angry trans activists telling him what to call them, he cares about the government enforcing it."

"I take issue with just one thing in this video: 25:50 The 'reason' that Hume critiqued was abstract thought divorced from the input of concrete experience, which was the mode of knowing about the world that the Rationalist philosophers advocated. Hume and other Empiricists rejected the idea that one could derive truth about the world simply by connecting thoughts to other thoughts following rules of reason or logic; truths about the world have to be discovered in the world itself, not in the minds of people who only entertain ideas about the world.  This is an important distinction to make, because it underlines a huge weakness in the worldview of online 'skeptics', who seem to believe that abstract reason alone can produce anything of concrete practical value. It can't. It's a tool, and, just like any other tool, it's only useful within the limited range of pursuits for which it's specifically suited. One of the many pursuits for which it's unsuited is the discovery of moral or ethical values, which is essentially the point Hume was making when he wrote the quoted passage."
"This video was an actual masterpiece"
"Yet another absurd hit-piece full of strawmen and ridiculous leaps of what we will generously call 'logic.'  The surest way to spot a fanatic is their seeing fanaticism everywhere but in themselves.  Opening with proclamations of how you're not going to act like   Kathy Newman and then just rephrasing her drivel isn't fooling anyone.  You have, as usual, made no arguments.  You have simply stated your ideological presumptions as a given and proceeded from there pointing out how—obviously—anyone who contradicts you is clearly evil.  Lame.  As to the corporate link:  no, they don’t believe your bullshit.  They are simply co-opting it to control you.  Fundamentalism is handy to those in power that way.  Congratulations on selling your soul to the very people you claim to oppose in exchange for a pat on the head and the vacant assurance that yes, YOU are the GOOD people.  Now, regarding postmodernism and “Marxism.”  Yes, they are a contradiction and Peterson has always pointed this out.  No one ever accused you guys of consistency or intellectual rigor."
"This is one of your best."

"I wanted to write something  smart (mansplain) but really you said enough <3<3<3"

"contra is right in that peterson and other neo-liberals are hypocritical for their reactionary stance toward the fruits of liberalism/the enlightenment, and yet still clinging to the root which produced them."
"Good and very informative video. It's sad that people actually take Peterson seriously."
"Natalie I love your content.  It is really refreshing to see someone deconstruct Peterson's views, and argue against the most charitable interpretation of his philosophy.  One question: you frame Peterson's self-help content as a 'Trojan Horse' for his political agenda,  but are you sure it isn't the other way around?  It seems to me that he gets a lot of attention for his political beliefs: that's the source of his initial notoriety, it's what interviewers ask him about, and it's certainly what gets him play time on right wing and 'new center' media circuits.  However his direct messaging to his supporters (i.e. his book and his lectures) seem to lean far more toward the personal responsibility side of things.  I think you could argue that rather than being his true end-game, Peterson's politics have served as the hook with which he got the attention of a generation of lost young men who've been spoon-fed this reactionary anti-sjw rhetoric for so long, and largely he's used his spotlight to push his own positive message.  He didn't have to do that.  I'm sure Tucker Carlson and Dave Rubin would have been happy to continue having him on every couple months to talk about nothing other than the excesses of the left and 'cultural marxists' since the initial bill C16 debate in Canada."
"Channel 4 not BBC (very different things in the uk) , aside from that the video is phenomenal."
"I don't feel to comfortable about this. It's way to erotic for me to consider criticism against Peterson (also it make my peepee feel funny)"
"Marxism or any modern(and not postmodernist deconstructionist) 'Progressive' ideas which purports to be for betterment of people in general fail in the fact that they either are ignorant about or underestimate their own(and their comrades') capacity for evil   Postmodernist deconstructionist ideas, on the other hand, have deconstructed everything to the point that action becomes impossible for them. A truly postmodern intellectual would either be a nihilist or a buddhist monk, because if everything is a power game, and power games are in net, harmful, then why bother playing them..?  With irony you can only do so much. Read the writings of David Foster Wallace on irony And how he predicted an age of authencity and authentic emotions and authentic talk(have seen those clips of Dr Peterson breaking down and getting emotional) almost a decade ago"

"You're so pretty!"
"Frankly, as someone who likes his new book and plenty of the points he raises from time to time, I find your response a delight. It helps me understand some of the problems and loopholes in his rhetoric, or at least how he communicates it, and getting a healthy and rational dose from an opposite point of view to what I'm used to hearing helps me get a grasp of the situation much better. In general, I think hearing a rational argument for two sides of a matter makes for a good habit, so I'm glad I got to see this. Thank you :)"

"You’re weird, I like you."
"I've been looking for this for a while. This is such a clear explanation. Thank you!"
"Seems to me that your main (and really only) critique is that he isn't explicit enough with some of his ideas. Tbh, some of the things you talk about being unclear don't seem so unclear to me... What I'm trying to say is: it seems like a lot of people have jumped on the Peterson hate-train recently, but most of the critiques can be resolved by simply watching his reply to said critiques or asking him for clarification. Your position is understandable, but some of the other Peterson critique videos seem like it's a bunch of people who want to hate Peterson and don't want to leave any room for clarification. They just assume the worst...  Btw, whether Jordan is using the post-modern neo-Marxist term correctly or not, it seems clear to me what he means. A lot of people are taking the dictionary definition of those words (which is understandable) and then applying it to JBP's line of reasoning (this is bad). If they argued in good faith, they would argue what JBP is implying and not the meaning of the words he chooses. But obviously they just want to make him look bad."

You initially say that you've spent hours watching / listening to his video's and podcasts, yet what you take from the whole debacle that got him famous was that 'he didn't want to call transgender people by their pronouns'. Sigh. His MAIN point with that whole thing was that he was against COMPELLED SPEECH by the government of Canada, that goes directly against free speech. Also kinda funny how you're coming from this 'he's on the right' angle, which also just isn't true."
"Blaire white  < Contra Points"
"Clicked randomly and immediately a misrepresentation. That's not his view of what West is, he of course realizes in addition to points attributed to West, marxism, postmodernism and SJWism are all part of Western thought. Just that he believes the former are what makes the West great. Also, wanting to be called by a specific pronoun can be seen as individualism, yes, but forcing another to call you that can not, quite the contrary, it's suppressing that person's individualism to call you what they personally choose to call you."
"Can I just stop to say that irregardless of politics, Contra's transition is ON POINT?"
"Progressive politics is evil and murderous. Classical Marxism was an economic theory that was totally wrong. Every prediction was wrong . The labor theory of value is ridiculous. And every single society based upon Marx's economics failed after murdering millions of citizens. As a result the Frankfurt school dumped Marx's economics entirely, retaining only his resentment, hatred for capitalism and lust for power. They also abandoned any attempt to improve or even envision a better society. Their job was just to criticize the society they preyed upon. Post-modernism maintains this adherence to being utterly useless and entirely critical.   'On the left we don't really tell people what to do'???? I guess AAA wasn't enough to stop you drinking yourself into delusion. Telling people what to do is all there is to leftism. And leftists don't just tell you what to do, given any power, they enslave their societies and force people to do what they are told.  Post-modernism is actually skeptical, so skeptical that it doesn't think Ohms law is real. Postmodernists think that gravity and electricity are social constructs. They also hold that no one can actually understand the Pythagorean theorem because it can be interpreted in an almost infinite number of ways if you try real hard. Marxism and post-modernism share a belief that the only real truth is power, by which they mean political power, the ability to kill people. Post-modernism unlike Marxism can't believe in the kind of power that can be measured by volts and amps because for them neither amps or volts exist, being social constructs and all.  Postmodernists spend their lives writing interminable texts that explain why writing texts is useless since texts can mean almost anything. And they write these texts inside skyscrapers, using elevators and air-conditioners while denying that the knowledge that made all those things possible exists. Postmodernists are either insane, or hypocritical liars. Richard Rorty states that 'at 33,000 feet I am a modernist'. So he at least is just a hypocritical liar.   But this video is a pretty amusing presentation, sad that it is being used to defend evil and idiocy. Maybe you just need another anti-freeze highball, the drink of the proletariat."
"'Who got famous because of sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under the Canadian human rights law shall surely lead to stalinism' - you are being dishonest"
"I liked this video, but I am amazed at the rude and arrogant people in the comment section, who actually call Peterson a fascist. I think there is a pretty watchable youtube video where Peterson justifies his use of those terms in an almost satisfactory way(it's something like jbp postmodernism neomarxism) I don't agree with him about using those weird words, but you seem to be simply guessing why he uses those terms."

The only animals we should be compared to are other great apes, but even then only tentatively because, yeah, we're smarter than them too. Shitheads who try and box us in with X animal are just identifying which Human instincts they personally want to promote in society, then arbitrarily declairing those to be the only true human instincts.

"Postmodernism is the use of critique to deconstruct social structures and paradigms. It should not so much be viewed as a philosophy but as a tool, especially outside of earnest intellectal circles. It is not at odds with Marxism when used as a tool to deconstruct the current paradigm to make way for Marxism, nor is it at odds with identity politics when it is used as a tool to deconstruct the current paradigm to make way for degeneracy and foreign invasion. The creation of something new often requires the destruction of something old, and postmodernism accomplishes that.  Notice that the postmodern feminist in your quote, (((Judith Butler))), is using postmodernism as a tool, since, like most Jews, she is incentivized to promote non-identitarian inclusivity given that Jews are a rootless clan that live as guests or 'renters' in others' countries. Obviously they benefit from the inclusivity of their hosts, but if the push for inclusivity turns identitarian, it forces Jews to give up their relative invisibility to rally under their identity as Jews to lobby for Jewish 'rights' in their host countries. The problem with that is that while native citizens have a natural right to exist in their respective societies and therefore a right to be heard, Jews do not have an inherent right to exist in others' societies (and they know this well because they have been banished from their host countries literally hundreds of times over thousands of years), so doing this would make them more publicly visible as what they are: a foreign tumor."

"This was a brilliant take down of Dr. Peterson’s vagueness and incoherency when it comes to expressing what, precisely, he objects to so vigorously.   I would argue though, that Dr. Peterson fell prey to the same thing that many of us out here have in this age; namely that in trying to sort through the ridiculous degree of contradictions and mutually incompatible beliefs and positions that the contemporary left fosters, Dr. Peterson just lumps all of those contradictions in together and misrepresents them as a coherent worldview where they are rather, an incoherent worldview.  He is right though, that there is in fact, a worldview. You point to conflicts between academic post modernists and left liberals in academia, but that’s not really what most concerned people are concerned about. Peterson does take aim at those academics, but I think the problem is despite the fairly philosophically coherent examples like Judith Butler, the majority of academics at most lower and mid tier universities that the average person attends are not expressing a coherent worldview, but an incoherent one. The left very much does mix fundamentally post-modern ideas with modern ones. That result, is the one complained of.  For example, the left does embrace a modern idea, the coherency of identity as a means to understand and interact with humanity. But it embraces this concept within the framework of an ethics of the will, whereby what is moral is what is desired or contrived as such by the individual. That is a fundamentally post-modernist idea, a la Camus’ myth of Sisyphus. This is why the contemporary left is viewed as increasingly totalitarian and threatening. On one hand, they can tell you “this is the way the world is” and in the next tell you that there is no truth but what a given person desires. It’s why the left can argue for extreme individual liberty when it comes to some things, but absolutely believe that the state should police and penalize other things. It also demonstrates that wherever post-modernism is concerned, incoherency follows. It’s all well and good that you think there is no truth but what you make, but the minute someone else’s self-truth conflicts with your self-truth, what the heck do we do? The only way we can and have responded to this conflict is by creating systems that regulate power, so to maximize the capacity of individuals to live their “truth” without coming into undue influence from other self-truth livers. This project is probably what Peterson really cares about.  While you are right that post-modernism, Marxism, liberalism, Christianity, are all technically “western”, I think you have to admit that some things won out more than others in the West, and some things are more foundational than others. This is exactly why Peterson points to Judeo-Christianity, because it truly does underpin or at least frame most of what came after it. Marxism and Liberalism both rely heavily on common reference to Fundamentally judeo-Christian ways of looking at the world. Heck, Marx essentially quoted Jesus in the communist manifesto.   In summary, I think the conflict JP is waging and what the western world is waging, is a conflict between whether truth is objective and independent, or subjective and dependent. And while both sides often incorporate assumptions of both of those larger views, I think that the left fundamentally believes, even if it doesn’t always act, as though truth is entirely contingent and personal, where the right believes that it is constant and universally applicable. That’s really the fight here, and it’s hard to boil it down to that when people contradict themselves as much as they do.  I think JP’s point, and the right or centrist or liberal view, comports more with observable reality. And this is precisely because where the left claims no truth but my truth, they are incapable of furthering that view without insisting through their political activity that *someone’s* truth should be imposed to the detriment or exclusion of contradicting truths."
"12 Rules for Life is bogged down by his desire to bring Judeo-Christian literature into places it doesn't need to be. I gave the audiobook a try, it's OK, there is some good stuff in there. However, it reads very much like it's written by an apologist, someone who seems to want to write off any harsh interpretation of the religious texts as misunderstandings of what they mean, but don't worry, Jordan has figured out how even something as disturbing as God ordering Abraham to slay his only son Isaac as a test of faith and loyalty was actually a message about how you sometimes need to give up what is most precious to you in life. You need to make self-sacrifices. That's all it is... only it fucking isn't! You don't just remove the jealous, ruthless God from the story and turn the whole thing into a self-help metaphor FFS. He does this several times in the book and its very easy to see through.  Also, the way in which he seems to see some things as just too complex, and other things as just plainly simple, whenever it suits him, is particularly annoying. For example, apparently you are not an atheist. Even if you think you are, you aren't, because you are too complex. You don't know what you are. Apparently, there are no atheists, they just don't know what God they worship. Right, OK then Jordan. Then, in the same book, he implies on multiple occasions that the horrors of the 20th century (mao, stalin, hitler) come about when these religious traditions and ideals leave society. Oh wow, it's really that simple huh? Something as complex as the formation of the Soviet Union, or Nazi Germany, is simple but apparently you are too complex to ever be an atheist?  And why is that even in a self-help book in the first place?  It really feels like two Jordan Peterson's wrote the book for two different reasons. The first one is the experienced clinical psychologist who actually has a hell of a lot of good things to say, particularly to young people. The second one is a Christian apologist eager to shove the bible into anything he can, even where it is totally unnecessary and doesn't seem to fit at all. The result is a bit of a mess.   I'm still happy I checked out the book as some of it is very entertaining and informative. However, most of it is boring old assertions and arguments I've heard over and over again."
"'So who's Jordan Peterson?'  *deep inhale*  That was the perfect encapsulation of the Jordan Peterson Experience."
"wow so much butthurt in this video - just ... wow"
"26:00 I love the John Waters reference!"
"Watched hours of Peterson myself. Peterson isn't wrong about cultural marxism, denying it exists and what it does simply means you're oblivious to it, cognitive dissonance and denial are one with progressiveness. Cultural marxism is what turns a weak-minded white man into a liberal bugman, brainwashing them to self-destroy in order to help any cause but their own. The one thing Peterson is factually wrong about though is blaming straight men for whatever is wrong in society today. Straight liberal men are *also* at fault, but that's it. He basically spends hours telling men to self-improve to become worthy of something that's not worthy at all. Oh, and he's spot-on on gender politics."
"Good video. JBP does represent the left as more unitary than it is - especially in academic circles. Postmodernism and neo-marxism do go together though, as you yourself showed at minute 24 when you said that a true postmodernist would not just take apart the concept of the west, but also call it out as oppressive, exclusionary and supremacist etc. As you said earlier in your explanation of marxism, this theorizing of history and societies in terms of oppressors and oppressed is very much the core of marxist ideology. So while the two might not always go together, they certainly can and in public discourse often do. And that's what JBP is up against, constantly victimizing some and villifying others and trying to demolish not just unjust hierarchies, but any kind of hierarchical difference. That doesn't mean that he defends all hierarchies. His lobster argument is more sophisticated than that. He speaks of hierarchies of competence and a lot of western legal traditions in which individual liberty and freedom of speech are essential values. That is where you misrepresented things somewhat. But still, good video."
"Anybody calling anybody daddy makes me wildly uncomfortable."
"It's a bit off topic, but why does the LGBT community love to oversexualize themselves as much as they can even in the most innappropriate situations as well, but then cry out transphobia, homophobia when it gets met with disgust, even though the same thing happens when a heterosexual person does it ?  And what does dick/pussy sucking 'humor' have to do with making a 30 minute argument about not liking the word 'Post Modernist'?   Just because plenty of people have been labeled post-modernist in the realm of philosophy doesn't mean that post-modernism can't be used in a huge context.  Even though post-modernist architecture and arts exists as well, they don't have much to do with philosophy.   It's just a term used to define the timeframe in which something was created, and shouldn't be thought of as anything more. Whatever the naming is, it is undeniable that this newer form of social justice has a hell of a lot in common in with the principles of marxism (e.g the fighting of classes)."
"Contra, I do watch Peterson and although I am not too keen on the Jungian archetypes and wotnot he is clearly a passionate and genuine person.  I've been waiting for someone to actually critically analyse what he has to say - rather than do hit pieces - and you've gone some way to doing that - but you still have mischaracterised some of the things he has said.  For instance I haven't heard hims ay anything that is against LGBT rights as such - and his comparison of transgender activists to Mao or Pol Pot is I think just a way of highlighting how far the activists are from representing transgendered people.  I would really enjoy a live debate between you both if that was ever possible."
"I am really like your video.  My only gripe: although you raise very good points, you stay in the territory of how things shoud be and none on what people are making of things.  Happens a lot when you talk about the left.  Your left and what is seen and called 'the left' are way different, and not making that distinction makes you look a bit ungrounded on current events.  Example: 'SJWs are western philosophy'. If that is so, why so many SJWs say things 'science must be decolonized'? But it could be me."

"Contra, though I consider myself largely a supporter of JBP (and you for that matter), I appreciate your perspective on the matters he discusses. There's certainly a greater diversity of thought than what can be found within the framework of Jordan's beliefs, and the importance of such a realization cannot be overstated. Also I quite enjoy your set designing sensibilities as well as the neon glow of your mood lighting.   Congrats on surpassing the 100,000 subscriber milestone!"
"23:57 you contradict your previous statement about neomarxism not being compatible with postmodernism. You say that a postmodernist would say that the 'west' is racist, exclusionary, supremacist. But, these are the points that a neo-marxist would make because neo-marxists divide people in opressors vs opressed, and tell everyone that their moral duty is to help the opressed."
"fucking americans shiggedy."
"First of all: 'he protested a law to protect transgender people' Wrong immidietly, his problem was the compelled speach aspect of it, the fact that they are legislating speech, you could possibly be punished for missgendering someone under that law, since the ontario human rights comission dictates the law. Look at the lindsay shepard affair if you want direct proof, plus when he was talking about bill c -16 he got a letter from the university that he should stop doing what he is doing since it could be illegal.   So about 4 minutes in or so you say he basically talks about basic self-help stuff, well yes, but that's oversimplyfying it, the best self help is supposed to be clear and basic, and if it's taken for granted and wildly known the society has done a good job, so a lot of what he does is explain thouroughly why responsibilty will derive meaning and purpose in life.   And you said his videos are for young men, i don't think that to be the case, the youtube audience is around 75% so naturally it can happen that most people that come to his videos are mostly men, but the thing is it was slightly over 50 % of the people that bought is book were female, and what do you mean it's mostly for men? Why can't women have som self help advice which you seem to think is the only thing he is about?  Ok so this video is pretty funny.  You don't seem to like him comparing transgender activists to maoists, well what he means by that is they have similar ideology, Opressed vs the opressers, they just hade different people they saw as the opressers and the opressed.  In the last like 10 minutes it is really hard to respond to, you go on and say a lot of things that are connected, but these points you make seem flawed. If you would discuss this with peterson do you really think you would come out on top? Peterson knows what he is talking about, the thing that annoys me in these last 10 minutes is you make it seem like he doesn't, and i understand you have questions about what he is saying, i just feel like there already are answers to what you are bringing up. For an example you say post modernism and marxism is western philosophy, like what? yes they of course they are, but what philosphosy is better? which one is the one we use and has peformed better for society marxism or capitalism? what even is the point here...?"
"Theyre not just requesting additional pronouns to suit their individual needs though, they're using state force to compel everyone to suit their individual needs. The former aligns with the values of 'the west', but the latter alligns with the values of a totalitarian state. The very kind of state you accuse Peterson of simply 'fear mongering' about."
"I like Jordan Peterson. I don't have to agree with him on everything, but he makes valid criticisms of post-modernism and speaks from his conscience as an independent thinker in a world where most people just divide themselves along ideological lines and follow what Bukowski called 'The Genius of the Crowd.'"
"All these people saying 'I'm a JP and a Contra fan', just stop it. If you like JP, defend him. Don't pussy out like this by saying 'look at me being so goddamn nuanced, I like both of them' and then don't follow up with anything meaningful or say something that clearly reveals you like JP more but just don't have any arguments to back it up."
"Natalie! You're so pretty!"
"I'm sure if Dr. Peterson saw the milk pouring thing, it might just give him a chuckle... if he's not completely weirded out by it... I guess it's kinda like Marmite?  Could you do a video on identity politics and how it's employed if you haven't already? The impression I get is that is 'fuck you if you're not a woman, POC or lgbt' and 'fuck you if you _are_ one of those but have even slightly differing beliefs'"
"lmao ur impression of peterson's voice was spot on!"
"So I don't fully understand how postmodernism can claim that there are no great narratives, when the idea of *not having a great narrative* IS *a great narrative* about humanity. Doesn't that imply that postmodernist argument argues itself away? It's sort of like saying 'Everything is subjective': If the statement is itself subjective than it cannot rule out any objective claims including the one that the statement is objectively false. And the statement can't be objective either, since it would be false if true.  Isn't then postmodernism just another narrative out there? If so, why should I care about that and not some other narrative? After all, there's no way to discern which one is better (whatever that word means) since reason and rationality are the means by which people in power get what they want."

"not sure I understand the relevant point about 'spending 4 years teaching people Capitalism sucks...'  most people who emerge from leading institutions are ardent believers in the free market... neoliberal economic thought is extremely well represented in the university system...

"I saw a video of this guy this week. about 4-year-olds and adults looking down on them for misbehaving. After that I went on through a couple more...  but on the channel I watched the tiles were about 'alpha-males' and this kind of vocabulary... sounded dodgy... Anyway, I hadn't heard of JP until last Tuesday. To be honest I was like 'Oh, yeah! Canadian scholars, right?' ...   But then it reminded me of that 'tunnel history' thing...  I was quite intrigued by Peterson, I felt as if he wants to extend the realm of his studies into a right-wing political stance, like nutella on a crappy french bread (not 'F'rench!), while appealing to an agreeable/disagreeable audience that believes their advantage over the outer West just came about because of hard work and a pragmatic stance in the rulling economic system ... and by that, whining is for losers and lazy people God keeps alive for some reason."

"The West = logos  Postmodern Neo- Marxists seek to benefit from chaos for an ideological agenda.  Benefitting from chaos is the anthesis of the logos.  Therefore PMNM is “against the West”   Took reading a lot of Plato to understand this.   Still a great video!!"
"You picked up a new subscriber today :)"
"contra is my fave leftist"
"Should've used some KY Jelly on the Peterson mannequin since he's such a slippery MoFo."
"I'm a New Subscriber and I really liked this entertaining video. Well done! It was insightful critiques of Peterson, though I think he's misunderstood a little bit.  3 Points I'd like to touch on: 1. Though Peterson may say anti-west, i don't think he says/means it's not west. he's saying it's the yang of the western ethos. Dare I bring Eastern terms into this...oh boi. And saying Judeo-Christian, as much as I'd like to give it up to Platonist compelling western thoughts since ever...I think it's Peterson's attempt to salvage what he thinks is a rotting civility by bringing faith and his archetypal process to remind us it's not all religious dogma garbage. The West is not soulless as he fears nihilism as I'm sure he's dealt with it too often with his patients. Plato unfortunately did not make the mark in being as influential as Jesus has been door to door. That can be debated though...  2. Marxism and post-modernism can be under the umbrella left thinking, high in openness, whatever. Fundamental differences does not matter to the ideological possessed because they themselves are in the 'power' dynamic to care about the philosophies through and through. Jordan should just call these people puppets doing ignorant dirty work. These are swaths of people from various ideas, maybe even your friendly neighbor. He's pointed this out in some talks and warned of group mob mentality.    3. Peterson has lived a fulfilling career for himself with business side jobs, and everyone from the classroom to his clinic. He's got a great story as I've listened to probably 100s of hours of his audio. (finishes masturbating) He has supported Trans, and does genuinely believe there are generational ideologues seeping into the humanities. I don't think we should deny the idiocy of SJW dogma of 'I'm making a difference' when you can by being educated and reasonably ethical. I think we underrate ideological possession from happening in HR departments too. It could happen considering the common person who would be forced to watch this video (because they'd rather watch buzzfeed) probably wouldn't understand 80% of the vocabulary or significance of these philosophical builds in time. (maybe I'm pessimistic). I think he doesn't give merit to Patriarchy and resorts to lobster gibberish because how he believes hierarchy is complex on competence and swapping identities for the sake of power dynamics, a naive aim that works to tear everything down where in fact naturally we're heading toward a more prosperous society anyhow. So when he's asked, is it appropriate for men and women to be flirting at the work place? and his response is Maybe, he's pretty much said 'we're going to find out.' He's talked extensively about women controlling their reproductive process and how unique our time in history is for women and peace. I think all he asks is we aim for a greater good (which doesn't bash Trans...) and not buy into our societal flaws as reason to break down into group mentalities that birth ideological viruses and burn down our library of Alexandria.   He's a maybe guy, and people shit on him because he won't put chips toward fighting the patriarchy. I think he's aware it's a divisive game that he refuses to take part in. I don't blame him...makes sense from someone who knows a shit ton of epistemology. We live in the best times of our society so far. It will likely get better if we don't tear it down. This is his gist. Should he talk about other issues? I guess, but plenty of others talk their truths."

"It must feel great throwing darts at a portrait and wiggling around in a negligee while winkingly  exclaiming 'nonsensical', but patching theories together at their dichotomies dishonestly dismisses a booby-trap's net seams likely to seduce the less jaundiced -which is probably everyone else.   No one on the radical left seeks to void hierarchy?  No one on the radical left denies the inevitability and the competitive benefits of winners and losers?  No one on the radical left is attempting to jury-rig (and hence infantilize, patronize and cripple through tokenism) representational outcomes of group identity demographics?  These are certainly strategies against which Peterson particularly rails. Are you denying that the radical left is not in favor of these methods so that what they see as justice may be achieved?  Many on the radical left see flipping hierarchies as not establishing a hierarchy at all and rather as a paradigmatic pendulum intentionally swung in the opposite direction of what they remain convinced is their right to determine as real history.  Instead, this ostensible achievement perverts even a modest degree of balance through its use of vengeance.   Worse still, their strategies oppose insuring that the means to acquire the merits of success can be diffuse and organic enough so that there are always at least some present and accessible in virtually all social scenarios.  This is the West's strength and that Peterson sees the West as a monolithic amalgamation of competing ideas would be pretty palpable positing a close read or listen.  Yes, the West!  It is more reasonable, your insinuations of National Socialist propaganda not withstanding,  to consider the objection Peterson lodges against pomo-marxism not so much in invasive terms but as the epitome of an internally destructive appetite that can easily grow beyond containment.   EDIT:  I look forward to your braving the youtube nazis and offering your take on the Marquis.  Maybe you could throw in a little Pasolini.  Wouldn't that be fun?"

On the other part of the argument, yes post modernism wants to take down the west. aswell has all value structures and ideas (once they can be multiple interpertations of them) , and stupidly , althoug knowingly, creating a total colapse of the logos. Just comenting the last part cause i think you really dont want a honest conversation about this."
"What a reprehensible video, it's so bad that one can't even try to respond to it, it's just a straight up F- , imo you should just delete the video, there is no fixing or saving this now."
"haha didn't think you'd notice the colin moriarty part, i was watching that stream when he mentioned you. About jbp's post-modern neomarxism, he has said several times that those two concepts are at odds with each other, he just says that they are using post-modernism to devalue the axioms, biological truths and other facts current society has been predicated on and then after devaluing them slide marxism underneath, because they were marxist to begin with. For example the concept of wealth inequality is directly portrayed as oppression in marxism and in modern day for example any wealth inequality between women as a group and men as a group was and is portrayed as oppressive or unfair even if evidence suggests that there isn't for the most part any unequal treatment and mostly it is about different averages between the sexes and life choices that lead them on having different amounts of earnings as groups, but they reject the argument with post modernism saying that there is no difference between the sexes anyway and then treat them as collectives and pit women against men (their oppressors). Even beginning from the faulty assumption that two random groups of people have to have the same amount of earnings otherwise the wealthier group is oppressing the other. Now capitalism of course has its problems if left unchecked will create massive inequality, but you can't throw the baby with the bathwater, capitalism drives innovation and economic progress and even with increasing inequality the trend is that poverty is decreasing around the world. The place of the political left is to advocate for the people at the bottom of the economical hierarchy and decrease the inequality that capitalism produces. Now it has abandoned it just to play identity politics and treating people in regards to their group identity and not who they are as individuals, using that as a segue to what you said about trans comparison to mao, he wasn't comparing mao to the trans community or individuals he was making a comparison of some trans activists are ideologically possesed and are driven solely by group identity politics which as a set of axioms are similar to maoist china, doesn't matter who you are as a person it just matters who you are in regards to your group identity. Probably you might disagree but he just has a hard stance on identity politics from the left and the right, as he has called out right wing extremists that also want to define themselves in regards to group identity. Well sorry about writing that much, I like your videos anyway and think you had no ill intent in mischaracterizing the central point you made about postmodern neomarxism, that indeed sounds weird anyway. Still enjoyed the vid, look forward to seeing you in the rubin report lol, good luck in all your endeavors"

"This was very interesting. But I think you missed Peterson's point. He argues that there are obvious differences between people(s). But that we shouldn't use these categories or groups to advocate for anything, and should instead focus on the individual. I wouldn't say he's conflating social justice with post modernism, he compares them together because they both suffer from this problem of using collectives to argue about progress. Which he is opposed to no matter who is making the argument.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he or you is right or wrong, but I think you approached this from the wrong angle. You're argument doesn't counter Peterson's because you're both arguing different things."

Did you really just claim that the man's f#$%ing *life's work* is just a Trojan horse!?! All the theatrics and a 30 minute video, and you couldn't be bothered with even *basic* research on the guy?"
"Peterson has stated a lot that his basic ideas do seem familiar to many people, and should cause they're archetypal. It makes sense because these basics are, as stated, simple and familiar.

"I didn't know I was a post-modernist until this video, thanks CP!"
"While I disagree with you on some things, I appreciate you making this video. One thing that stood out to me is that you never mentioned one of Petersons main points, repeatedly he says that he is not claiming that he knows all or that the what he is saying is the final analysis. Also his issue with bill c-16 stems from the fact that it is government compelling speech with the full force of the law behind it, not that it is an attempt to protect transgender people.   Not saying I know the right way to think or act upon whats going on in society, just that those are two aspects of Jordan Peterson which you do not address in this video which I would like to hear your thoughts on."
"vous là-bas avec votre jacobin tolérant"
"Jordan Peterson just mixes the right wing reactionary beliefs against the SJW's with the right wing beliefs of Neo Marxism while also criticizing Post Modernism which he claims simultaneously influences schools and universities to indoctrinate young people into left wing ideology which is a right wing conspiracy theory that does not measure with reality in any way. Heck in one of his interviews he says we should not compromise with the left because it means that the left wins somehow. To find the interview where he says that watch the three arrows video on Jordan Peterson. The problem with the right wing is that their beliefs about the opposition are just gut reaction assumptions where they cannot prove that their theories are entirely true so instead they cherry pick some universities as a part of a national trend that leads to something that has not happened. The SJW's and Cultural Marxists became the new Obama for the right wing to complain about with new conspiracy theories that would not happen.  Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8AcmzqFdPM"
"Contra. You are a legend."
"Does anyone else think that Professor Peterson is Ray Barone from an alternate timeline having attained a college education"
"contrapoints is what you get when you cross a left wing video essayist with David Lynch's daydreams"
"A pretty good start. I agree that Peterson's 'neo-marxist post-modernism' is a useful straw man: extreme relativism and the idea that 'everything can be reduced to power' are in no way reducible to postmodernism or the neo-marxism that prefers  race and gender as the proper oppressor/oppressed axes rather than class. However, the fusion of those two strains of thought are the vector by which identity politics achieved serious standing within academia, which I think is what Peterson is really getting at.  Critical theory, especially, adopts the fundamental premises Peterson is most bothered by. Also, I don't think he's confused enough to believe these ideas pose a unified, coherent, and deliberate threat (although some of their proponents are deliberate about it - I've met them). However, both the denial of grand narratives and the reduction of cultural ethical analysis to which group has more power are still influential, and the both pose serious threats to Peterson's prescription of individual meaning as an antidote to the existential struggle of civilizations against the threats of nihilism and totalitarianism.  Peterson's pretty wishy-washy about details: to understand him you have to extrapolate the premises common to his assertions, which I generally think I have (I'm also a pretty right-brained thinker). Bottom line: he sees a nascent threat in identity politics to the grand bargain that holds 'western civilization' together: the idea that the group is important because of the individual (not the other way around), and that justice to individuals of a wide variety of identities must derive from that - the sacredness of every individual and their struggle for meaning and connection to one another."
"Wow the last 30 seconds of the video... wtf, so scary!"
"I agree with you that Peterson is not a classical Fascist. But, he is a proponent of Genocide. His self-help confidence game end sum is genocide like in Rwanda where he uses coded language at first, appealing to sensibilities and reducing fears, then as is eventual with genocidists the script will flip as he is doing now where the coded language dissolves and it's Feast of Saints with tactical nukes, AR-15s and weaponized Christianity. The whole Marxism gag is a Bouroughsian sham playing to the base fears of generations of ppl fine tuned toward hatred of collectivism doped up on selfish genes and Friedmanite snake oil Capitalism while their lives are mediated and prescribed by the collective boards of shareholders of the Mega Evil Corps. He is a master at syncretic synthesis. Like a WVA Pentecostal snake handler, he knows what the crowd wants to hear based on their fears and he screams now a clarion call of exterminism for the sinners, the nonbelievers, the icnonoclasts, the blasphemers and those pesky socialist professors that won't let him sit next to him in the dining hall because he smells like stinky stale cum from jacking it to his Lenin Wallpaper. He is further evidence Western Society is at once boring af and doomed to self-immolation, because as I mentioned Rwanda earlier...their genocide started with a few Petersons-esque types on the radio and the normalizing of exterminism. All the self help con aside, his goal? Genocidal leveling for fun and profit."

"Contrapoints, thank you for a very entertaining video! Fun-sightful as usual!As a person who's pretty far to the right than you, I'd suggest that you have it wrong if you categorize people into 'those who care about injustice' and 'those who don't.'  In my experience, compassion is equally present or absent on both sides of the debate, and it really comes down to a conversation about how historical wrongs are made right. I think those of us on the right have a responsibility to sell a much better story than we traditionally have, and I think people on the left have to answer some of the facts that seem to contradict their worldview.  We have to show people that we're not all just a bunch of money grubbing reptiles, and people on your side have a resonsibility to deal with the evidence that much of the social policy that purports to help a group actually does that group harm.  I love your stuff, but when I watch it, I'm sometimes reminded of that quotation (Thoreau?) 'if I new for certain that a man was coming to my house with the aim of doing me good, I would run for my life' (or something like that).Take care."
"This was very interesting Contra, and while I disagreed with most everything you said it was very entertaining to see a differing perspective"
"I am a HUGE Peterson fan.  I also really loved this video.  Thanks for some thoughtful and well researched points, you just did a better job than all of the mainstream media and TYT combined."
"Maybe I'm out of my depth, but it seems to me you don't need a grand overarching narrative for a neo-Marxist view of the world. The people economically at the bottom just need to agree that they have the commonality of being oppressed and assign those at the top the label of oppressor - NOT BECAUSE THERE'S OBJECTIVE TRUTH IN THAT, but because this is how they can claim power. In the same way, women can agree on being victims under sexism and claim power from men, black people can agree on being victims under racism and claim power from white people etcetcetc. This becomes a kind of substitute for an overarching narrative about the human condition, whereby your identity becomes an aggregate of these different group belongings you have. This is how I perceive intersectionality, and it solves the problem you pose at 17:16. Leftist activists typically don't ever actually grapple with that.  Power struggle isn't a grand overarching narrative; it's the absence of a grand overarching narrative that leaves power struggle as the only option left. As you lose concepts of truth and individualism, you can't really reach across identity borders and converge on anything or cooperate, hence why people tend to die en masse when you act this out. That's Peterson's problem, and I didn't really see you answer it here."

"I would say her definition of postmodernism is a bit off from my understanding, but she had fair criticisms.  Peterson uses a lot of rhetoric in his speaking to imply things but then doesn't back them up with an actual claim.   I agree with peterson that the way postmodernism is being applied in some spheres of the left is pretty questionable (like at some very left leaning universities), and I think it is fair to say that postmodernism is a tool for those who seek to exploit identity politics as a means to elevate their own power (which is where I would differ from contrapoints).  But that latter mentioned subgroup of people is in zero way representative of all identity politics and are really the opposite of activists because they seek to use a rights movement to their own advantage rather than to help a group that is being oppressed. Along with that gross generalization that he often touts as some grand realization as the problem with our society, he also tacks on yet another generalization with that group he has manufactured by labeling them as  'neo-marxist'.  Obviously there is a correlation of the radical left with being both socialist and caring about civil rights, so he uses that to claim that somehow those are interlinked ideologies, which, as contrapoints explains, is obviously not an overlap that exists in those philosophical definitions. The result is peterson generalizes about pretty much all identity politics activists, labeling them as self-absorbed and then somehow as all being neo-marxists. And even then  when he pins a strawman on so many people, his attack of marxism is incomplete, almost as if he knows it's a strawman and just pins that tag on them because he knows a large number of people oppose communism and its violent history, without him needing to argue against an ideology at all .  The only things I agree with peterson on is that postmodernism is riddled with problems in nearly any practical application (which in no way is a novel criticism) and that you shouldn't have a child and then leave it with a single parent."

"All good points....so I guess there’s NO chance that idealistic student radicals will get the vague notions of relativistic second-language-interpreted-post-modern thinking mixed up with social-media-driven-identity-politics along with the feminist tradition of applying the theories of Marx and gender-class-struggle to create some sort of confused ideological intersection that is populated by unquestioned biases towards forcing equal outcomes on society to level the playing field, even though the “inequity” is based on a distribution of different types of players with different abilities, and different interests, rather than being based on actual inequality in the opportunities people are allowed to pursue (it’s amazing how a little sarcasm and run-on sentences can save on punctuation).  No worries...as a white male, I have a backup plan. Rachael Dolezal proved that minority race status can’t be acquired...although shame and ridicule can be, right Rachael? But without even going through hormones or surgery I can claim I’ve been misgendered and poof! Not only am I a woman but I am a special minority woman! Tada! Here I come to enjoy the woman’s locker room at the Olympics. By the way...what are the equity police going to do when they notice there is an underrepresentation of natal female-to-male trans athletes competing in the Olympics or when natal males-to-female trans athletes start to dominate women’s sports? Welcome to the new world of patriarchal-matriarchs.   But you can just ignore my cis-gendered over-caffeinated ass. I’m just spouting neo-Petersonian nonsense with a hidden agenda cobbled together from racist, sexist, homophobic memes that are being fed to me by attention seeking algorithms in the rabbit hole I’m currently in. So....anyway, point being, Peterson may not be pointing to a cohesive and coherent ideology on the left. He may be pointing to a cluster fuck of ideas that causes empathetic and well meaning students to surround buildings where he speaks, pound on the glass in mobs, bring wire to strangle him and shout that they should block the doors and burn down the building with a few hundred people inside. Maybe something like that.  Oh, and Newman tried to straw-dog Peterson’s argument but she’s a victim of his tricky shell game argumentation style? Really. Speaking of straw-dogs...he’s not advocating lobster hierarchy."

"Disliked for hating on Mao"
"Sorry Contra, but I believe you are to an extent unwillingly biased. You always present anti-marxist arguments and very often omit the Marxist counterarguments to them, which I believe is very harmful for your more centrist audience who never has a chance to hear those.  For example, the Marxist critique of Foucault was that his ideas, which neglect the importance of economic power in power relationships and systems of oppression, are useful for capitalists as they unreasonably divide the left over non-arguments and make their adherents passive and nonerevolutionary. How do they do this? Foucault basically claims that doctors have just as much power over mental patients as corporate lobbyists have over governments and those governments over their citizens - he puts so much emphasis on the fact that there are oppression systems unlinked to social classes and economic power that he fails to see that those oppressive systems - currently capitalism, historically feudalism and variations of it - affect ALL OF SOCIETY, not just a small group, and to a far greater extent (your doctor and teacher might have some authority over you, but they do not have the authority to send you to die in a war for oil and the profits of defense contractors...) Needless to say, doctors teachers and any authority Foucault names is ultimately also exploited and ordered by the capitalist rulling class or its agents (lobbyed governments or criminal justice systems), a hierarchic inclusion he also chooses to ignore. Marxists do not disagree in the least with Foucault's plea to fight for the rights of oppressed peoples who are not working class or opressed economically, but on the other hand Foucault proposes a model of looking at the world in which systems of oppression exist more as isolated vacuums rather than interacting with each other in a hierarchical structure topped by the capitalist elites, and it is this naivite of his and outright denial of factual reality that marxists oppose. (His flawed ideas are still used today in procapitalist philosophical arguments) Second, Marxism is also a 'skeptical' ideology in the sense that it based on objective observations of economic relations and their historical evolution, not just a 'grand narrative' that the postmodernist skeptics easily labeled under 'unfounded speculation'. And last but not least, Marxism is at its core a political ideology advocating a democratic way of economic organization (collective ownership of the means of production) that would make answering crisises of the modern age like robotization of industry or climate change actually possible! No matter how many mistakes Marx would be proven to have made in his historical analysis or political predictions, Marxism is still as of yet the only economic alternative to capitalism and the only economic system conceived by humanity that is actually equiped to tackle the aforementioned issues... EDIT: I'd also like to make it clear that I love most of Contra's content and even in this video I agree entirely with her debunking of JPs 'the left is a monolith' mumbo-jumbo - I just think she doesn't represent correctly the arguments communists (marxist and ancoms) make and this might lead her centrist audience to remaining economically centrist and not being challenged in that regard, which is a shame and a missed opportunity..."

"Yeah, I used to like Peterson until I started to notice how he would basically shill neoconservative views among his Jungian/Neumann ideas. I'm from the Terence McKenna crowd. We like Jung and Peterson is well versed in Jungian topics. However, Peterson is uninteresting apart from his Jungian beliefs. All of his other shit is plain neo-conservatism. So, as an early supporter of his (over 1 year ago) I formally disavow Dr. Peterson. This was a decision I've been mulling over for a few months now."
"Really glad there's a sensible discussion. I like Petersons arguments (excluding the transgender Stalin comparisons), which are most of the time based on research and are presented in a really entertaining way, though I'd definitely call myself left. But I absolutely see your point, that these arguments will be used by the wrong people.  Thanks for the video from Germany!"
"Brilliant. It’s great to see a leftist on YouTube not taking part in the bullshit thought policing,  anti white/European culture and other egregious rubbish usually seen on YouTube, and concentrating on the gigantic shower of shit coming from the right/alt-right/‘sceptic’ community that is actually dangerous. We know this from experience. Although some professed leftists in the past killed millions, nobody ever ended up in a gulag or gas chamber for demanding to be called Xe as a personal pronoun. On the other hand, the nativist, tribal, anti-foreigner bent of twats like Benjamin has directly lead to millions being exterminated or killed in wars. You go girl. I may not agree with much of your politics (I assume) but I certainly agree with your use of intelligence, research, knowledge and humour to call windbag shits like Peterson out."

Or tubing past each other, responding past each other...or......something like that. Great video keep doing your thing. :D. FYI politically im a Imperialist for the other commentators."
"'The problem is that all this life-coaching is just a Trojan horse, for a reactionary political agenda. Peterson advocates ethics of self help, not only as a guide to private life, but as a replacement of progressive politics - which he characterisez as totalitarian and evil'  This is why I can't help but feel that Jordan Peterson is dishonest. He mixes his good self-help intentions with political activism, that actually might have the consequence of making life worse for others."

"I don't 'get' Peterson. It wasn't even hard. I read what he writes, but without assuming Western Imperial Europe is the apotheosis of humanity (including all societies they hadn't met yet). Or his over-arching assertion 'male' and 'female' are fundamental. Bacteria don't have boys-only treehouses. Fish don't even have sex, so you know they can't be trusted... I'll stick to sass and glitter. Plus, I can't take an elitist seriously with a Canadian accent. It feels biologically wrong."

"About using the lobster argument to justify Monarchy or any 'unjust' hierarchy... This is a misunderstanding of what Peterson has said. He didn't say anything positive or negative regarding the mere existence of hierarchy, and says under any system of government, Communism, Monarchy, etc, you see the same phenomena (a small group rising to the top). SO WHAT HE'S SAYING IS... 'merit based' hierarchy is preferable to an engineered hierarchy. An argument against Monarchy, and Peterson uses it as an argument against social engineering."

"Speaking  of Buddhism CW Huntington Jnr wrote a book comparing the writings of Chandrakirti an 8th century scholar at Nalanda University with post modernists and philosophers called the 'Emptiness of Emptiness' - the teaching was for the cerebral types who when they heard Emptiness got thinking about the void and everything being relative and got them to re-engage with what was actually being taught which is basically that the conceptual mind has some serious limitations so reifying concepts is a lil stoopid - feelz over realz people. ala Jordan though - One thing he is getting at, though not explaining well, is that post modernism is combining with ideological fervour to produce a new breed of narrative helmet wearing students that decide to wear them permanently - rather than a series of costumes to play roles and perspectives, the creative use of critical lenses that you take on and off,  'they' just keep them on. If you are going to do that you have to acknowledge at some level your life is an experiment - a George and Gilbert. Anyway Jordan is saying these relativist helmet wearers are destroying traditional archetypal structures which reflect lobster realities and its not healthy, its going against the grain of social and biological evolution. Zizek says he is mystified by how violent and psycho Stalinism was - I'd argue that its because there was no structure and violence both physical and psychological can act as a proxy for structure - so if you tear down archetypal structure that has evolved over the last .....thousands of years the vacuum left behind is not fun for the plebs. So rather than pass out helmets that say gender can be highly fluid (which if you think about it could be seen as reflecting latent patriarchal features in social structures) Universities could say instead - here is some wonderful hats, have a walk in these shoes - go slowly at first in those heels - Peterson's cause appears ultimately clinical which in a way exposes relativity - its about health rather than ultimate 'reality' which brings us full circle to the fact that Post modernism ultimately owes more to Freud than to Marx, the creative engagement by people like Foucault is about psychological journeys - cultural therapy - He didn't articulate it so directly as Derrida and Lacan  but in 'Foucault the Legacy' he talks about how his work was about unearthing truth rather than presenting it. Most post modern thinkers like Foucault have fudged this bit but it pops up occasionally."

I wonder, what counter argument do you have against Peter Singer's Animal Liberation?

"Drawing from my memories of being a smug 'classical liberal' who probably would have been drawn to Peterson had I not smartened up long before he became popular, I think I can reconcile post-modernism and Marxism, at least from his point of view.  Both are skeptical of the modern capitalist system and the class hierarchies it creates.  I think that's really all there is to it.  Incidentally, I'm not a Marxist, and that's because I have an anthropology background which makes me kind of skeptical of a lot of these universalist theories about human society (whether they come from the left or the right).  But I do agree that capitalism sucks, so at least when it comes to practical political matters, we're more or less on the same page."
"Also I just feel like Peterson is behind. I don't think the new terms have quite solidified, but we are kinda moving out of postmodernism...Especially because irony is trying to be replaced with sincerity...and there has been criticism of postmodernism from people on the left since the freaking 90s.  (probably before then too !)  My background is more art, but we kind of stopped having art movements..and there is a famous paper written about it called 'The End of ARt' by Arthur Danto ....It's all really confusing though , because even art made during the postmodern period didn't really follow the tenants of that always ....  Anyway ,at least in art, it seems to me  like postmodernism is marked by a lack of belief in originality and individuality. It is rooted in experiences within  capitalism because the tying of us as people to products just made it blatantly apparent that a lot of our identity is manufactured, . This skepticism is mostly demonstrated in simulacrum and appropriation art,...but there are echoes of that throughout art, even today.  Especially art of the 80s when postmodern really came into vogue. There was a lot of more people  constructing art out of pre-constructed  images to create a new meaning .. I guess like 'remixing' in a way.   I guess I would say the change that has happened is that there has been a shift back and a reclaiming of the individual, but it's not really a return to modernism per say  . I'm not really sure what the opinion on originality is...Probably that it doesn't matter.   This is just random mumbo jumbo thoughts. I have not had a chance to talk art much with people I know in real life V-V."

"Loved the video. Unfortunate that argument didn't get past wordgames though. I think its wise to assume, going into a conversation that each person is likely to have vastly different definitions of words going in. Saying 'this is what the words you're saying actually means' is never very convincing to someone thats using them since its actually communicating that we're trying to do with words inevitably failing for that.  At the same time you cant exactly ask Jordan to define terms either so since you brand yourself as an academic thinker it would seem quite off brand to go on the, feels train of what Jordan tends to be travelling on. You seem to tend to dismiss this by caricaturing it as petty with the offhanded comment about him reacting to protests.  Hes, like, trying to communicate a feel. The things he likes about society are being degraded. 'The west' obviously just becomes a shorthand for 'The things he likes about society'. When he talks about these postmodern neo-marxists, thats just the label hes  inventing for the people that are actively attempting to degrade 'The west'.  Thing is, there are obviously many people that this resonates with, which either implies that its so vague it encompasses anyone who doesn't like those hes labelled or those seeing their own idea of 'The west' being degraded.  It would be a mistake to immediately jump to something like racism/sexism to explain this thing that they all see the west as, but those hes labelling also do seem to be trained to think that is actually the reason that people oppose them.   Now, after all this all the actually specific things that he says go unnoticed. The substantive things that seem really should be talking about is the threat to free speech that the people he is labelling portray to him when they try to de-platform him, others and demand him to use certain words. He doesn't seem to care at all about which words they are, so framing it as a gender issue seems dishonest to his listeners and so emboldening.  Seems the Marxist part is simply anti-capitalist elements do you really think he seems not to talk about Marx, rather the various communist disasters that have happens because of them. So him, as well as many other people see those who rally against capitalism within universities as his enemy.   So, this label... Its a group that he lumps these people together: Anti Capitalists and Gender activists(due to the oddly conservative censorship). And due to the ubiquity of among universities, implies that it is planned, seeing it as a growing ideology to depose capitalism and turn 'The west' Communist. So brands them guilty of blindly working to create Stalin's Russia again as he believes that communism will always become that due to its track record.  Now... You are sorta a... Anti capitalist gender activist from academia so... Dodging his brush seems difficult. Seems to me the only thing left for you to actually argue would be what you would actually want post capitalism and why it wont become all the thing him and his followers fear."

"Good video, I particularly enjoyed your explanation of Peterson's rhetorical strategy, which often feels like an overlooked aspect. His more vague statements (and the clear extreme ones) seem to be courting a lot of far-right and reactionary individuals. I think my most charitable reading of Peterson is that he is an opportunist trying to make the most out of his 15 minutes, purely for personal gain."
"I hate Peterson lol glad u did this Contra"
"“Got famous for sounding the alarm on how protecting trans people under Canadian Human Rights law, shall surely lead to Stalinism.”  That’s a bit biased of a nutshell, don’t you think? If you can go to jail or get fined thousands of dollars for not calling someone xe or xir that’s clearly a problem. Would most people be making demands to be called xe/xir and taking it to court? No. Is it still a problem despite that? Yes."
"I like the topic, and it's a great video, but I find it really hard to follow along because of so much use of language I'm not familiar with."
"Can we be friends, though?  I hope so.  The intellectual games are fun and all but it's all gotten way too serious, personal and tribal.  I would hope that Contra fans and Peterson fans are both decent enough sets of people (some overlapping like me!) and not crazy ideologues that we could actually see eye to eye, still able to disagree but get along.  I would like that.  It would be a nice example against the hysteria that plagues everything these days."
"I'll have to re-watch this because I'm a big fan of Contra, but my sense of what Peterson is doing is giving the problem a name ('postmodern neo-Marxists' with an emphasis on 'identify politics'), but he doesn't do it to evade the complexity there (e.g. he'll even point out that one of the central claims of postmodernism is correct). He is simply articulating what ideological influences are in play on 'the left' as a mere starting point.  But where he goes from there is into the psychology that underlies people drawn to different/opposing ideological and political orientations.  He also goes on to explain how memes and ideologies become animated in 'the crowd'; this happens spontaneously even among a disparate group because each person holds a fragment of the broader ideology, and once a crowd forms, the ideology acts itself out.  He doesn't claim there's, for example, an identity politics 'dogma that must go unquestioned' -- but that the ideology will act itself out even in a disparate group (because what unites people drawn to 'the left' are some consistent and scientifically identifiable psychological traits).  His argument about identity politics is more that by playing a different game -- with a focus on the individual, who has a responsibility to bear (including to cultures and communities) -- you don't end up with competing, polarized identity camps."

"Jordan is a guy who wants to live and let live. He doesn't care that you dress like a woman and speak in a strange octave. He just doesn't want to be told that he needs to use words that you came up with and insist he use lest you be deeply offended.   Why don't you strange people understand the whole 'live and let live' thing. It is baffling to me."
"If you say Jordan Peterson's name 3 times in a mirror at midnight, he shows up, and tells you to clean your room."
"I bought his book because of this video and frankly the repeated claims from some young men and teenagers that his ideas are groundbreaking and vital. But to what I am sure is the surprise of nobody I'm not particularly impressed. He seems to have a habit of taking certain scientific principles, drawn from the hard sciences, and haphazardly attempting to apply them to complex psychological and sociological concepts and behaviors without establishing a coherent basis for comparison.  I will certainly acknowledge that there are many people who desperately desire the guidance that perhaps they had as a child.  Feeling lost and abandoned as an adult, particularly as a young adult or one who has recently lost a parent or spouse, is commonplace. But following any singular persons example blindly creates a risk of inflexibility in an ever-changing world and a resistance to that same change which is ultimately where I believe much of his resistance to what he calls blah blah Marxism comes from.  You're never going to read, or at least I've never found one, a self-help book that advises you to become comfortable with the uncomfortable simply because the kind of person that writes a self-help book is the same kind of person who reads self-help books. In other words it requires somebody who was fundamentally unhappy and in desperate search of answers to engage in the amount of thought and work needed to write a self-help book.  The bare truth is that everybody is unhappy from time to time but most of us are able to shake it off without reading a self-help book or taking up a new school of philosophy.  Or at least not taking up somebody else's school of philosophy when we already have one. I think what makes his book popular is that there are so many young men who simply have no philosophy of life or sense of identity and Jordan Peterson books provide a ready-made identity. It takes all the effort out of self-actualization and personal development."

"I laughed my ass off at the 'Daddy' stuff.  Some great criticism, it is important to clearly define what it is we are arguing against and not miscategorise things or people (which is unfortunate since Peterson himself loathes being mislabelled as 'alt-right' or 'far-right').  One issue I have is with the way you introduced Peterson, '[He sounded] the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law will surely lead to Stalinism.'  That's a fairly dishonest representation, and while I assume it was tongue-in-cheek, it glossed over the wider issue that Peterson was protesting against: compelled speech.  How does enforcing the use of arbitrary pronouns by legal threat of fines or jail time 'protect' trans people?  What are trans people being protected from?  Figuring out who the transphobes are?  Because now they are forced to use your pronouns out of fear.  Protected from being irritated by someone being an inconsiderate asshole?  I don't think we have enough prisons to deal with that!  Isn't it a little dangerous to start giving the government legal authority to police conversations between private individuals?  Doesn't that sound a little like life in the Soviet union or East Germany?  (And no, death threats are not part of a conversation.  That's not a counterargument.)"
"Fucking beautiful deconstruction of Peterson."
"I really like your stuff Contra but you're being obtuse in defining postmodernism one way and saying SJWs are against that. You'll hear we need more POC in positions of power AND that race is a social construct. By the way I'm surprised you didn't mention how obvious it is that Peterson himself is using postmodernist thought in the way he talks about religion."
"And, uh, what exactly is so wrong about being Scottish? Hm?"
"Thank you for slogging through his tripe.  You have greater patience than I.  Your conclusion about the way he buries the controversial within the mundane so that, if you call him out on where his underlying, implicit ideas lead, he can accuse you of misrepresenting him, while everyone who agrees with him already can just accept it without challenging it (because why would they?) is very astute.  Essentially, he's the King of the Dog Whistle."

"Okay, so she starts the video out with saying that she doesn’t care about reason or truth. I’m not sure if she’s being facetious or not, but at least I know where she stands. I disagree when she says that Peterson has politicized himself. Inadvertently, perhaps, but I think that liberal media in general saw that he was pointing out something that he saw as inherently wrong (bill c16) and instead of arguing their side in support of it, they decided to paint him as everything the left isn’t (alt right) because it’s much more palatable for society at large to judge the validity of an argument within the confines of good/bad red/blue instead of dissecting or criticizing a nuanced supposition. The left did themselves no favors in lampooning him, as any one with half a brain and paying attention immediately noticed the disparity between what he actually says, and what his detractors SAY he says. I think this in it of itself is what blew him up into the politicized space in which he resides today. So yeah. Don’t necessarily think it was purposeful on his end. She also mentions that his philosophy targets lgbt rights. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen him reiterate this over and over, but his position is that any compelled speech LAW, regardless of who it is claiming to protect is wrong in it of itself. Nobody has a right to be called a specific name. My name is Jonny but it is not my right to be called Jonny, nor is it my right to be called him/he. He calls trans people by their preferred pronouns and treats them with respect without a sword of damacles hanging over his head out of his respect for people as individuals. Okay, next point. If you look at the underlying philosophy of postmodernism and Marxism, you can find parities between them and what’s going on currently in society. On the Marxist end, you have an amalgam if people who believe they are disenfranchised and oppressed only for their identity. They perceive people in positions of power as people who aren’t inherently more competent individuals, but as descendants of those who created a hierarchy of power so that only they could be successful within it. So that’s the proletariat/burgeiose comparison that marxists make. What postmodernist philosophy does is fuel a justification of “flipping the table” of society, as it were, since from a postmodernist perspective, objective truths and competence hierarchies are nothing more than manifestations of the opinions of the powerful. You see this narrative in society. You absolutely do. IF you are looking for it. The actual danger it represents or the provocative nature in which Peterson presents it can be questioned, but you can’t deny parallels altogether. Postmodern neomarxism isn’t a new philosophy Peterson is warning about, but is rather a pairing of a claim, and a justification for action to rectify that claim.  She makes another point, stating that “The very idea of people requesting pronouns to suit their individual needs is exactly the kind of thing a person who values individual liberty over collective dogma should be on board with.” She’s totally right here, and Jordan supports this idea. A government imposition of a law requiring you to use specific words to specific people isn’t an individual desire though. It’s a collective one. The government is a collective. Jesus, this is what Peterson has been saying all along. She agrees with him too, but she doesn’t see why his original argument argues against a collectives order, not an individuals request. Okay, and to comment on her final point. Jp has never argued that western culture isn’t a homogenous mixture of ideas. It absolutely is. I’ve never heard him attempt to defend western values as only based in judeo Christian suppositions, but you can argue that those suppositions are most prominent when looking at the underlying substructure of our society. Our way of law, for instance, is a residual of judeo Christian philosophy. That all are equal under the eyes of god. Aka all are equal under the eyes of the law. It made peasants equal to kings. It completely changed the way our society was structured. That would have been a radical concept prior to the west’s adoption of it, and to undermine the importance of such a philosophy and its current implementation in modern society doesn’t serve any real purpose. It just is what it is. Again, he’s never argued what she’s saying he’s arguing. That the west is ONLY built on Christian precepts. But a majority of it is. I thought she was reaching a bit with that one."

Life is meaningless and I try to consume as much as possible to get some happiness out of it. As long as SJWs or conservatives stay out of my way, I don't fucking care what you do.

"What is the “lobster hierarchy” meant to specifically refer to in humans?   If not race, sex, gender identities alone — I assumed just meritocracy of who is most physically or mentally fit for different tasks and roles in society. ?   Btw, what are some of different sects of Feminism’s views on meritocracy ? An impression I’ve gotten from Some millennial feminists is that valuing people for positions based on merit is problematic because occupational positions have been established in ways that are more suited for classically masculine traits, so that’s why men and women with classically “masculine” traits like directness, comfort with disagreeableness, and lower sensitivity to stress are more fit for higher paying jobs in hierarchical occupational systems. (at least this is the most generous coherent synthesis I’ve been able to put together from what I hear people shouting about)  Of course the standards of merit differ depending on if it’s the top possitions of primary school or university hierarchies, or a military hierarchy, or an entrepreneurial, or a corporate hierarchy, or entertainment or artistic hierarchy... and I see standards for employment changing to different degrees in different fields, either to be more promoting of classically “feminine” qualities, or a “PC” version of it, Or just expanding to be more inclusive of diverse personality types.  Is personality profile the “lobster hierarchy” that Peterson would argue should be adhered to? And if so, I guess a dilemma is how to figure out if the systems for which our merit is relevant are the most useful system for our success.  Have other systems of merit been tested? I imagine it’s still dependent on the greater context of the culture and international economies in which the standards of merit are relevant.  Maybe if humanity becomes very different in the future and the qualifications for the highest paying CEO-type jobs can become very different, then maybe the women and men, and those that lie betwixt, who may be very nurturing, high in agreeableness, and highly emotionally sensitive to stressors will have the most merit for the top job in that system.  (though maybe we won’t need occupational hierarchies or money by that time)"

"Thank you for making a video with actual honest criticisms of JP. If you make another, I have a couple of questions I hope you might address.  First, my understanding of his description of what 'postmodern neo-marxism' is centers on two things. The first is the history of Postmodern philosophy being tied to or even co-opted by Marxist philosophers around the time Marxism fell out of favor once the atrocities of the Soviet Union started to become well known. I know I've heard him address the 'grand narrative' conflict, but I can't bloody remember how.  The other thing is how the left seems to be very concerned with equity as a measurement of oppression; the idea that if CEO's aren't 50/50 women then it necessarily means the cause is women are being oppressed. I'm unaware of this divide in the left that you are speaking of between postmodern and identity driven philosophies. Do they also disagree on this? I must admit, being a SJW in the past I was also unaware of any such divide. Left wing media, at least, seems to universally push the equity narrative. The idea that JP presents, that in a free society differences among groups are more likely to be amplified, makes a lot more sense to me than the claims of rampant oppression that I just don't see.  Second, I don't think this idea that the left is a 'homogeneous force' necessarily comes from being too far to the right. Outside of academia the differences in the schools of thought get muddied. For the average person, if your exposure to the left wing is Jezebel, Everyday Feminism, The Mary Sue and your interactions happen via Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, then what you see is largely a muddied mess. I think the thing is is that non academics who are part of this muddied mess are the people who end up running things like HR departments or running for public office.  This has led to very real concerns, from documented politically biased actions taken by social media giants to control the narrative to the incredibly overblown response to incidents with people like James Damore and Lindsey Shepard. I find it very hard to argue against the idea that extreme left wing ideologies hold a lot of institutional power, and the people wielding this power aren't academics keen on distinguishing between the different philosophies that academics might concern themselves with. These aren't thought leaders in the field. They're people who read an article on Everday Feminism and want to apply it to their HR practice. The left wing can't divorce itself from the monsters it creates any more than the right wing can. The problem is that white supremacists are effectively powerless. Radical left wing ideologues run Twitter."

Still have found value in considering his arguments and worldview, inspiring me to better shape my own in relativity.  His characterizations of “the Left” were what mainly prompted me to research and evaluate more specifically which ideologies my views align with. (to be safe I think I’ll refrain from embedding my identity in one ideological label for now... since I don’t want to stunt my development, but I’m not at all ambivalent about my current views either) The Dr. is a very mixed bag of intriguing insights and (I think) wrecklace activism to prejudice unsophisticated masses in this university of YouTube who mostly haven’t learned how to carefully consider multiple views and suspend judgement until fully comprehending. (at risk of sounded arogant — since I’ve been improving at this myself over the past couple years of the social/political polarization.) But if You weren’t the Only person I’ve ever seen countering his arguments from “the left,” maybe there could be a more productive development in reaction to his ideas, instead of the hyperactivists just putting on a hysterical show for the cameras and feeding the trolls and right-wing propaganda. Wish someone like Contra Points were the one to get a high profile interview with the (non-manakin) Dr. Peterson, instead of that Kathy Newman who staged such an embarrassing debate/interrogation, or whatever that was supposed to be. I’d probably demote or fire her for being so bad at the job, and setting back their social agenda even further by being so agregiously unprepared, just picking at superficial stuff with transparently dishonest tactics, when Peterson’s philosophical hypocrisies could have been questioned instead. The Atheists are much better at debating with him, because they aren’t afraid of questioning his relation to his religion. But questioning someone’s religious beliefs still isn’t PC enough for “liberal” tv. I guess?"
"God I hope he sees this"
"JP 'fan' here. I enjoyed this video, like most of them, for the roleplays, costumes and decors. It's also interesting to hear a critique of him in this silly way, calling him your daddy and yourself a degenerate. It's a good thing to bring him back to a human form like we all are and not elevating him to godlike like some are doing. I think that most of your disagreement with him comes from JP not saying anything he doesn't believe to be true. It's unfair to says he's doing this out of malice, or to assume his words could be interpreted in an harmful way by some group of people. Your content can also be interpreted in an harmful way by the viewers of your video too. He's different from some conservatives youtubers in the sense he's not trying to win arguments, influence people or gain status, but to help people, genuinely, by telling what he believe to be true and let people think for themselves. That's why he can seems in the channel 4 interview to be so much up to interpretation. He most of the time not condescending or arrogant, or sarcastic or calling people out or playing politics. It's refreshing."
"Finally some valid, coherent criticism of Peterson brought forward in a reasonable manner. Some of your left-identitarian commenters however, aren't much better than right-identitarian Peterson, though they are highly convinced of the opposite."
"Brilliant !"
"Great video, thanks Melon for retweeting it. Great points made at the end, really strong ending. I really dig Peterson, and his lectures on Personality and the Maps of Meaning ones are dope. Worth a watch IMO. And I have his Biblical history ones pending cause they seem to be good. What I don't like about him is what you mentioned in this video, absolutely AMAZING point, which is that even though he technically isn't alt right, it's clear that there's hella implication and underlying shit behind many things he says. But the thing is that most of the bullshit he says is in his interviews, in his lectures it seems like he's really educating. That's why I hate as well the comments that say 'why is this guy a professor'. Well, because he's fuckin smart, and teaches some good shit in his lectures that's why LMAO. A lot of your criticizing is meh, I do think that he's right with his judeochristian shit or whatever, ok, you're right, western culture isn't 100% church but fuck, it had been for 2000 years and people DO overlook that shit like a lot. In the same way that I (unlike Peterson) can see how the alt right is hella pandered by some of his shit, I can see that some people from the left (notice how i'm not saying 'alt left' or radical left, like just regular left leaning people) are like hella blind to this. And I'm not sure (maybe that's the problem, he kinda leaves room for interpretation) but I've never interpreted his crusade against post modernism to be a crusade against basically the whole left, he himself recognises he's a right wing person, he knows political orientation is correlated to personality traits and his traits are clearly right, and he doesn't hide that. He just seems to dislike being called a fascist. Mine for example are left leaning, and i do lean left in the political spectrum. The way I interpreted his thought, to put it in one line, is that basically the Q in the LGBTIQ+ is like the worst because it is postmodernistic and thus like non sensical in a biological sense (which IMO makes a great point). And I fully support gay rights and trans rights, and empathize with those collectives and think that they should get visibility.   Sorry for this wall'o'text, usually I try to make shitty jokes and short comments but I've really been impacted by his lectures and I do think he's a good person to exist and that his lectures should be popular, he's probably my Daddy lmao. Shame he kinda panders so much to the alt right and doesn't give his real views on some shit."
"I've got sick of talking about, and hearing about, Jordan Peterson after arguing with so many fanbois who don't  know anything about Marx, Post-Modernism, or pretty much anything. Only for it was you I'd have just passed it up; I'm glad I didn't."

"Beware the authoritarians, they're coming to take our authority!"
"+Contrapoints it was a Channel 4 interview"
"Perhaps not marxists but the west will go in full collapse soon or late"
"@2:09 CHANNEL 4. Not BBC.   It's a very small thing, and I hate to be that guy, because I try so hard not to be, but The British (Well, English, ask me some time all about S4C) fourth TV Channel at least holds to its original Remit of Representing for Women and the unheard voices in its news, if nothing else.   Also, ACTUAL political coverage on BBC news these days is a joke.  But yeah, A thousand apologies for being the pedantic jerk that nobody likes."
"26:03 Natalie with the deep cuts"
"Western society has been officially white and male and the slave labour of minorities, women and the poor and marginalized made it possible, such as it is. The philosophes had watered-down influence, and the French and Russian revolutions still exist in  the expectations of the citizens of those countries, but neoliberalism lives nonetheless. The Greek philosophers were interpreted as supporting the right of elites over the dangerous 'rabble'. The all-male church supported the 'divine right of kings', who were always white and most often men. But the tide has turned in this educated time and past injustice stands out like pentimento. It must be addressed if only because it is no longer viable, as well as unjust and inhuman, and the effort to maintain the system and myth is undermining what democracy we have, and even the illusion. And maybe worse."

"The lobster argument falls flat on its face anyway because it's inappropriate to base human behavior on an animal with an incredibly different evolutionary lineage. Like, we're talking about an animal that hasn't had a common ancestor with humans since backbones started to evolve."
"I love these videos but even I had to stop and rewind sometimes to process the amount of dense info being presented. The spacing between arguments could be a little more frequent and shorter, or rather, more abrupt interruptions instead of extended mini skits. I get that you wanna talk about basic concepts quickly and enjoy doing skits, but rushing the content you deemed necessary for comprehension while dragging out the cognitive breaks/jokes is counterproductive to education.   If I am having trouble keeping up as one of the liberal sjws that this caters to, I can't imagine how lost or uncomfortable this might be for someone who's less engaged and trusting that this isn't a waste of time. Especially if they have an unconscious discomfort with sexual liberation or LGBTQ people.   And just as personal preference, I kinda miss the 'armchair philosphy' snubs. We need more faux-intellectual jabs. Everyone loves making fun of those!"
"wow! 2,592 comments! I better keep this short then! I think there is this myth being pushed in intellectual circles on all sides of the political debate that in 'The West' we somehow live in 'Post-Industrial Societies'. Thanks :)"

"So Jordan calls everyone left of center 'postmodern neo-marxists' and compares them to Stalin.  Just as the left-wing calls everyone right of center 'far right/right-wing extremists' and compares them to Hitler.  Seems like it all boils down to that both sides hate eachother too much."

"(take everything I say in this context with a grain of salt since I did not get around to research every detail of Petersons Statements) I think the breakdown of Peterson at the beginning is sort of unfair. While I know that it is, of course, hyperbolic it just seems misleading, at least in my interpretation of what I heard from Peterson. I believe Peterson stance, which got him famous,  does not take issue with the protection of Transgender people but with forcing specific lingo i.e gender pronouns on people through legislation."
"hELLO DAVE"
"Will Contra be my daddy?"
"I love that she speaks to people from a tub. this isnt the first time shes done it and aside from being funny its actually a clever rhetorical device. its disarming and gives of a feeling that she trusts the person shes conversing with enough to be vulnerable in this way. I love contra."
"Asking for a pronoun would not agitate the professor but forcing him to say it with a sword of law dictating that he would go to jail if he did not would ... and rightly so."
"Gender, Race and economics are hierarchies like lobster hierarchies. Take a look at tennis or sprinting or trans women who fight with other women in wrestling there was 1 victory in a long time that went to women. Men are physically strong. In that there is gender hierarchy. It is there naturally."
"What would you do if the statement is 'The same hierarchy that dictates animal alignment also is reason of the state of female representation in government?'  You are OK with hierarchy in A then why can't that explain hierarchy in B? You are splitting hair only to confuse not to inform.  You premises are also nonsensical."
"Oh man,  great video."
"Loved the video, I watched a couple from you a while ago and hated them but this was actually great, lots of laughs. Cheers"
"It is funny when the marxists and post modernists unite in deception of normal people since they want the fruit of capitalism without contributing but say that they are in battle since they are logical opposites. If logic was important to these people they would not have schools of thoughts.   Calling logic logically invalid is only possible from an immeasurable fleeting impulsive point of view and that POV will not hold in real world scenario if you consider any factor that distinctly does not come from your own reference or inner world. In your head you can have a logical frame work that listens to you. You talk to other people they might have something you don't agree with.   You have to attract the right people and that is how you maintain the supply chain management of risk reward relationship ..."
"That was a hell of postmodernist counterpunto"
"Came here from a shaun vid, dunno why I hadn't seen your stuff before... Makes me SO happy that I'm not alone in thinking JP is needlessly revered, even dangerous and fallacious at times.  Also you're legit funny and entertaining! Time to watch everything you uploaded including all the old stuff you probably don't like people watching! Lacked a fashionable decadent girl on my subscription list anyway, it's pretty much a bonus you're really smart too.  Now, wanna go huff some poppers and try on miniskirts? You can borrow mine."
"fantastic stuff"
"This gave me some new perspectives Peterson simplifies more than I thought he did, I think that's because I was filtering his wiews through my own PD: I still find your style *very* disturbing and we disagree on a lot of things, but I can't help but like you anyway"
"The best, most comprehensive takedown I've encountered yet on JP's garbled reactionary psychobabble. Also by far the funniest. Thanks for this Contra you are fucking awesome!"
"I can see why you dislike hierarchy Contra. It’s hard to be a man. Much better for you to assert your dominance in the gender bending leftist claptrap hierarchy."
"So, what is going on with your voice? Are you editing the pitch, or are you just really working at sounding more feminine? Even if you were on hormones, which I'm not sure if you are at this point, that wouldn't effect your voice much.

"Channel 4, not BBC!"
"wow your videos are fucking infatuating and i'm just disappointed this isn't like 12 hours long holy shit"
"The ultimate rebutal to Peterson is simply pressing him to actually show his stances on things and talking about it and it's incoherent contradictions both internal in his own theory and with the real world. Has Zizek debated this clown already or I dreamed this?"
"You could actually call him for a podcast and I think you would be a real conversation with him ... When you talk to him alone in front of a camera. It [unfortunately] seems exactly like you are afraid of him. Just like channel four 'so what you are saying ...'"
"So Basically JP is vague as fuck and relies on an uninformed crowd to foster his ideas. By doing this he can pretend to have no sides and thus be 'neutral' in any debate."
"Trans gender people disagree with you. They also agree with JBP. Sucks to be you."

"I am a YUGE Peterson fan boi, but I think most of your critiques are 100% valid. That being said, unfortunately there ARE postmodern neomaxists in practice despite the theoretical incoherence. Lots of quarter-educated 'woke' SJWs are out there who think they understand their squabbling academic professors and make life miserable for anyone who wants to make a joke on twitter.   That being said, the reason they exist in HR departments and corporate worlds are because the classes are now less economic.   Being a homo-fag myself I also worry about the backlash. Just as there are a bunch of morons thinking they advocate progressive politics, there's an equal number of them on the right, but I think Peterson helps temper their rage."
"The point about JP baiting Cathy into arguing around 21:00 is reaching IMO. He's done a bunch of interviews with both people who support him and those who don't and it never went like that. It's not impossible, but more likely is that he was just trying not to say anything that could sound controversial."

"How is Christianity 'individualist', anyway? It lays out a pretty strict path of righteousness to follow, preferably in a close-knit community of fellow believers, sharing labour and resources. Is this just Evangelicals projecting their 'personal relationship with Jesus' thing onto all of Christianity throughout history?"
"Wow, so Jordan Peterson is the probably the reason that I found ContraPoints. Some years ago I was doing my Birthday Tradition of arguing with people over social media, and a 'friend' of mine got really personally hurt by my ideals. He tried showing me videos of Daddy Peterson particularly the very long Joe Rogan interview to counter all of my ideas. When I criticised and blasphemed against Daddy Petes, that was the last straw into a full out abusive wave of ad hominems and he linked to a video of ContraPoints. I don't remember the names of the Roommates featured in that one, but there was the super left roomy all decked out in camo/military gear that was intended to be a representation of myself. Which seemed pretty accurate and with which I didn't really feel the need to argue.  When I criticized Daddy Petes though, it was as if I was personally attacking my Facebook 'Friend'. I just remember how absolutely amazed I was at how easily it was to hurt a persons' feelings. I had no intention of it, but you'd think my candor was filled with deadly toxins.   Anywho, even though someone was trying to use your vid as a weapon to, I guess. . . shame . . . me?. . . It filled me with a sense of hope, and put me into a very good humor, it made wasting that couple hours of my life watching Joe Rogan and Daddy Petes finger bang each other actually worth it."
"Wait...Peterson *does* realize that the Bible has *archetypes* that fight against oppression like Moses and Jesus, right? Right?"
"Facists have come out and said (on their forums and such, and this is decades in the making) that because they think they left has infiltrated academia and have used the position to indoctrinate young people, then they (the fascist and hard right) must also do the same. Even not knowing that, I think there is a leftist instinct that sets off alarm bells in the brain when they hear someone like Peterson. This is why I think some see him as a kind of alt right Trojan horse.. because he would be the perfect person to fulfill that infiltration role. Paranoid? Maybe. Petersen may not be that wolf, but those wolves will resemble him when they are revealed. He is a scaffold for worse people to climb up and build from."
"When he says Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back, he means it."
"Wtf is this ?"
"Though I agree with your arguments against Peterson, it's more important that you made the argument at all. As you discussed in the beginning, too many leftists or moderates refuse to tackle the direct core of his messages and philosophy. And this is why you are our eternal queen."
"Postmodernism has basically shattered this World's philosophical landscape and now a myriad of ideas are up for grabs for any ilk to assimilate into their own schema. We have now entered the Age of Meta-Modernism where those shattered ideas are now being reviewed, kept, discarded, and/or intersectionalitifiedblahblahblahblah. It's anyone's game in this world of unfettered information access. The wise will know not just which ideas to utilize, but know to actually apply them and prove their points. Also, CP, you are at the same stage I was when I first read Derrida. He's useful, but yes, very difficult to decipher. The best way I can sum him up is thus, 'Words are not sufficient for communication'. But yeah, even that phrase turns itself into an oxymoron which makes Jacques all the more frustrating."

"You are soo stupid to even recognize your stupidity. Jordan is great, you are still as what he calls a little child who thinks himself an adult. You're not funny at all by the way. Youtube has not been created to be poisoned by your trashy transgender emotions. Go cry alone."
"protecting trans gender people is not what people are concerned about. and that alone is not going to lead to stalinism at all. its the policing of speech and the notion that being offended gives you some sort of authority over other people. Peterson even says he has no problem using someones preferred pronoun, and neither do most people. even people that are made uneasy by the trans community are polite enough to be civil."
"'Do not do black face' says the man in woman face. And THAT was as far as I got. You are a hypocrite and a zealot mate. Brainwashed. 'Woman' is NOT a feeling... and you veer far to close to overt drag-queenery as to be taken seriously."

"Please, make a video on ''The West''."
"What kind of douche conversationally uses the word 'utterances'"
"Fun"
"JP was opposed to bill C16 because it restricts freedom of speech and it allows the government to enforce punishment on civilians for 'hate crime', without clearly defining what constitutes a hate crime - He was not, and has never been against human rights or the rights of trans people - in many interviews, including the one with Cathy Newman which you watched, he states that he is perfectly willing to address trans people by their preferred pronoun. Starting the video with this deliberate misrepresentation of JP's stance ruins an otherwise thorough response which you obviously spent a lot of time and effort making.    If you want to see what he was worried about, just look at the UK. Hate speech laws have run amock. And it's only getting worse."
"Blessed are we"
"I liked the comedy in the video and the effort you put in. The criticism at times is just and other times seems to be a misinterpretation. Such as the thing about patriarchy and the lobsters. I’ve never heard him defend hierarchy he’s simply said they’re inevitable, and that’s his thing, saying a whole lot but meaning very little, and backing it up with an unarguable truth. Kinda like a boxer who fights defensively."
"Peterson's attempts to characterize the right are just as incoherent as his attempts to characterize the left. He fetishizes existing social hierarchies as natural and thus good while simultaneously railing against leftist 'authoritarianism,' positioning himself as someone who takes issue with power only when it advances agendas he doesn't like. He also draws heavily upon evolutionary psychology while paying lip service to 'Judeo'-Christian ideas about the divine spark of man, presumably leaving it as an exercise for the reader to figure out how he reconciles a belief system which explains all human behavior through scientific discovery with a belief system that clearly separates man and man's behavior as spiritually and morally distinct from all other animals. You're right to call Peterson's approach to philosophy over-simplified. Peterson tries to tell a grand tale about the entire history of western philosophy, and like many overarching grand tales it falls apart when you examine the details."
"Confession: I'm a Peterson fan and I love this video"
"Hold the phone I'm pretty sure your allowed to talk about the Marquis De Sade's reforms as long as its listed under education"
"Peterson is doing nothing new. Reactionaries have more or less done the same thing he is doing for the last century. He gets away with it in north America because the rich and powerful have been very effective at dumbing down society there."
"13:11 I prefer fops over neckbeards any day. But srsly, the biggest problem with leftists is PRECISELY they can't form a large stable group. They always fight each other in destructive ways."
"One of the more interesting things about the response to this video will be seeing how many 'battle of ideas' enthusiasts refuse to even watch it because the presentation style is so out there"
"I struggle with how I'm naturally inclined towards the postmodern way of thinking that categories and absolute truths are in fact bullshit, but I also have to acknowledge that categories are necessary in a practical sense. The best philosophy I've found that really sums up my feelings is (if I'm remembering the name right) Phyrricism, the central tenet of which is 'Nothing can be known, not even this.'"
"Why not Zoidberg"
"Thank you contra, I will fuck my enemy from now on :D"
"And now, everyone will know my orientation when spotting my bisexual manicure. THANK YOU FOR THE OUTING, CONTRA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"Tbf, if I hear 'postmodern neo-marxism' it makes me think of the so-called post-marxists, like Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and John Holloway. They've all been pretty influential since the 90s, but are nowhere near hegemonic and for sure don't have any sway over HR departments. The general post-marxist project could maybe be described as one to try and take on board some of the critiques of post-modernism (most of them have a boner for Foucault) but still have a viable political project. I'm not sure they manage that, but their contribution is a big one.  Still, that's completely not what Peterson is talking about."
"Your videos are so hollow. You complain about left that it doesn't give any answers. But you not only don't give any answers, but you can't even conclude your video."
"Did I just wasted 23 minutes waiting for one (1) argument that relates to something Peterson has said? Yes I did. But hey, I made it past the 'nonbinary = transgender' bullshit argument, so I have to pat myself on the back. That's a D, see me after class."
"THANK YOU! Unfortunately, not many of the people who need to see this video will ever discover it..."
"My 25 criticisms of this video:  1) ContraPoints attempts to de-legitimize the idea of a 'marxist conspiracy' as one of a Nazi origin -- not once, but twice -- completely ignoring the fact that the Cold War occurred, and for 30-50 years, real countries were overthrown by marxist activists only to degenerate into totalitarian regimes. Add on the fact that we know countries like the Soviet Union actively exported marxist ideology to the West (the anglosphere and continental Europe), and you've got a legacy for this kind of thing that ContraPoints just sweeps under the rug.  2) Jordan Peterson is not responding to a 'localized' problem, as I will have demonstrated by the end of responding. All available evidence points towards the fact that 'the problem' is not localized, but has increasingly spread from universities in the greater anglosphere to pretty much every part of life in the west. It's more and less present in different fields, but it's hard to find anywhere where it's not to some degree present. ('end of responding' meaning end of 25 comments I jotted down on paper while listening)  3) His ideology has never targeted gender equality, LGBT acceptance, or civil rights. JP has a long history of helping female clients (he's a clinical psychologist after all) be more assertive to pursue more administrative jobs. He's never expressed a comment about transexuals outside of the context of compelled speech. He's never said anything bad about gay people. He's never complained about the civil rights movement.  4) Providing optional, voluntary advice in a voluntary text isn't 'telling people how to live their lives.' This is a gross misrepresentation, and is exactly what I mean when I say that his critics can't help themselves but to misrepresent him.  5) ContraPoints forwards the idea that the left is mostly concerned with telling you not to do things, and the right is mostly concerned with telling you to do things. They then mention 'use the right pronouns' as an exception to that description of the left, but still insists / implies that someone like Jordan Peterson is more concerned with telling you how to live your life.  This in particular is a rather vile misrepresentation. Jordan Peterson's entire case in Canada is about being told what to do with the force of law. ContraPoints never even mentions this, but chooses to skim around the issue and leave it as 'doesn't like trans people,' again, something that given ContraPoints obvious intellectual capacity, seems simply dishonest.  To put it simply: JP's rules are optional advice in a voluntary book, and they don't carry the force of LAW like he battled against in C-16.  6) By ContraPoints own admission, 'we spend 4 years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad' ... the first time ContraPoints actively contradicts herself, but certainly not the last. See 1) above: she lends strong credence to the idea that marxists actively work to inculcate a purely negative/destructive ideology among universities / western society at large, etc.  7) Jordan Peterson has never compared transgender activists to Stalin. He has said that many of the same principles behind supporters of bill C-16 are the same principles that Marxist activists (like Maoists) had: pro equality of outcome, anti- equality of opportunity, for instance.  8) Jordan Peterson has consistently disputed the idea that actual transgender people have complained about his resistance against Bill C-16: by his own statements, he received about a dozen letters from transgender people while he battled C-16, and all but one of them supported him. His criticisms are mostly reserved for non-trans transgender activists who have taken it upon themselves to be offended for others, and have used this to justify their rather totalitarian methods.  9) The correct formulation of postmodern neo-marxism is not 'it's out to destroy us all' -- but rather, 'it's out for orthodox control because it believes itself to be righteous and incorruptible, and this very belief is precisely why it will destroy us, contra what its proponents believe.'  10) JP's core concept of neo-marxism / cultural marxism is the Marx dichotomy (oppressed vs. oppressors, totally distinguishable from one another, purely one or the other) applied to cultural concepts like race, gender, etc.   Postmodernism is defined (originally) as the antithesis of grand narratives, which marxism / neo-marxism appear to be.  11) Peterson himself acknowledges the apparent contradiction of the two theories, and has wasted no insignificant amount of time thinking about how the two have come together. I could link to entire 40 minute lectures, but here's the spark notes:  A) They have a natural reason to ally because postmodernism spent a lot of time criticizing status quo modernism (western liberalism), and so did marxism.  B) Although by no means without exception, there's an increasingly consistent track-record to this alliance, especially as marxism died and neo-marxism / cultural marxism replaced it (late 90s - today). That is: postmodernists, despite being 'anti grand narrative' have surprisingly little bad to say about marxist thinkers, and were some of the last people to condemn Stalin (some postmodernists never got around to it at all.) Most ended up reserving almost all of their 'anti- grand narrative' mantra for the early modernists: chipping away at science, the capacity of reason to properly distinguish categories, etc.  C) Hence, at some point in the late 90s, a transformed neo-marxism / cultural marxism took on an increasingly postmodern deconstructive lens towards western liberalism / capitalism, and was increasingly unable to cast this lens on itself.  12) Cultural marxism / postmodern neo-marxism and marxism are not the same thing -- this is to ContraPoints' argument that corporate HR departments don't have marxist sympathizers: well duh. As JP will tell you, the failure of the Soviet Union spelled the transition from marxism to neo-marxism / cultural marxism, and this new thing (which has almost nothing to do with economics) is what has infected corporate HR departments.  13) ContraPoints claims that 'sophisticated debates on identity politics' are ongoing in academia. But if they simply can't or won't admit an opinion like 'identity politics is bad' -- then it's not sophisticated at all. The question being posed as eliciting 'sophisticated questions' are things like 'how oppressive is the patriarchy?' -- they have no patience for free exploration of questions like 'does the patriarchy exist?'  14) Once again, 9). JP isn't suggesting neo-marxists want actual destruction. He's suggesting something closer to the idea that only the destructive element of their two-part grand plan of [1] destruction and [2] reconstruction even works.  15) JP *isn't* against progressive principles or goals. He's most openly taken a stand against a certain kind of framework for justification, or the methods his critics are often willing to employ, as they demonstrate something corrupt or sinister about their underlying operative psychology. E.g. willingly attempting to control speech.  16) ContraPoints enjoys leaving the book intentionally open on what JP's actual motivations are. They're clear enough to a couple million people: he's not trying to weigh in on progressive politics. He's weighing in on the force that has corrupted progressive politics, and the sort of methods / behaviors that this corrupting force has produced.  17) No, Jordan Peterson didn't play an argumentative game with Kathy Newman -- that's what she did. What he did do is deny being tied down to a strawman, because everyone would. He stands behind the idea that biological differences might produce a biological gap in, say, average earnings between men and women. This says nothing about whether or not that gap is good, (although JP and I are united in prioritizing equality of opportunity at the expense of equality of outcome) and only speaks to the fact that once you eliminate all discrimination in the work force, you shouldn't expect the wage gap to disappear. Again, rather pernicious of ContraPoints to merely paint Kathy Newman as 'made to look bad' by the tricky tactics of doctor Peterson. Everyone with half a brain knows that she was playing argumentative games, and JP wasn't having it.  18) The lobster idea isn't about 'patriarchy' per se. It's about the reality of a certain kind of social hierarchy, not just any will do (a point ContraPoints simply misses) -- namely, a competence hierarchy. The point, of course, is that the reality of a competence hierarchy as a biological fact undermines theories that pre-suppose that all hierarchies are simply power hierarchies.  Moreover, ContraPoints mischaracterizes JP again by missing this point: he consistently and regularly criticizes pomo neo-marxists for attempting to reduce every hierarchy into a power hierarchy: e.g. they'll suggest: 'if you're successful, it's because you used power to get to the top.' This is something JP explicitly denies, in favor of the competence hierarchy model: 'if you're  successful at the top in a stable position, it's because you're competent and everybody else recognizes this. Now people can emerge towards the top through power and corruption, but this rarely produces stable power.'"
"mommy you're back"
"Marxists think post modernism is reactionary!"
"I enjoyed this discussion very much. Thank you! I wish I knew how to debate/argue like you. Your use of humor is great. I can't even debate my 17 yo without losing my mind. Kudos to you."
"These ideas aren't so incompatible. All of this analysis assumes that people with a political voice and/or opinion these days are straightforward with their thinking and understand where contradictions in their beliefs show up. If right wingers are contradictory all the time and make 0 sense when they talk about political issues like gun rights or abortions, then the left probably has its due somewhere... perhaps the contradictions are veiled in postmodern academic jargon?  I would think everyone against identity politics and current mainstream feminism understands that there are contradictions among people who believe these things. The whole point is that Peterson does NOT believe in postmodern marxism because he understands that there are deep contradictions. In his interview with Camille Paglia he explicitly says that he has a hard time reconciling why those who follow a postmodern way of thinking have latched on to Marxism when it appears contradictory. So I really don't think you're giving him enough credit for evaluating his own beliefs and statements.  The way I would imagine a Peterson perspective understands this is to assume that grand narratives are somehow essential to human nature. As much as postmodernists have pointed out the failures of grand narratives, current political views understand this as criticizing PAST grand narratives. Future grand narratives like future is female, intersectional, queer, etc. are all still options (among many others). I mean some Tech geeks think the singularity is going to be the savior to all our problems. Marxism offers a way of cutting apart a system and dividing society into two classes where one oppresses the other. As a political agenda, marxism is a set of ideological tools (it was used to write the communist manifesto) for re-organizing or breaking apart society. In that sense, postmodernism and marxism seem similar.   Edit: I'm going to overgeneralize here, but this is what I think his argument is in short: Where postmodernism says 'all grand narratives suck, you may as well not do anything, there is no ultimate purpose, go ahead and live for nothing', Marxism is able to say 'no not nothing, we should live to create justice for the oppressed.' Postmodernism believes that the 'purpose' or goal of life has been created artificially, and so bears no ultimate authority, while Marxism uses this as a means of overcoming the current state of society for the purpose of creating a something better, presumably based on a rational, ethical understanding of the world.   It's funny that your criticism is often that his position is 'vague'. He explicitly is refusing to be pinned down by labels other than his own choosing. He has defined his positions explicitly. He's said before that he's a proponent of Classic British Liberalism."
"Please do the Rubin show... not sure if I want this for the potential good conversation or the potential chaotic drama... hopefully the prior... actually a conversation with someone smarter, across the divide,  may be preferable... no offence to Dave."
"I love your style, your videos are hilarious and entertaining and interesting and just cool. Thanks for making them!"
"Postmodern philosophy seems quite complimentary to Marxism.  If you want to guarantee better humanistic outcomes from social change (revolution), it helps to have a very good understanding of all the ways the shifting power dynamics could make it go horribly wrong."
"This video repulsed me in 17 different ways.    Subscribed."
"Me at the beginning: Huh, Contra has changed her style slightly. It's a bit more restrained. Me at 2:38: Oh wait, no, there's the acid trip..."
"abolish hierarchy"
"There is a couple of points I'd like to make, and I'll try to make it into a cohesive comment, but bear with me. Peterson's naming of the post-modern neomarksists might be unfortunate, but what connects marxists, postmodernists, and some activists is that  they all want to dismantle the 'system' and institute their own. For marxists it's capitalsm, for postmodernists it's all social naratives, and for some activists (let's call them SJWs) it's the patriarchy.  The problem with dismantling the govermental system is that the current system, good or bad, was developed organically in incremental steps, and with the world as complex as it is you can't claim to know all the effects of the changes you might institute, so any big changes are very dangerous. The only safe way to change the system is to look at small individual problems and adress them one by one, any ideology that claims to know how the world should be is lying and any man that subscribes to such an ideology is dangerous. University professors that subscribe to an ideology can infest a lot of people, and Peterson claims that a lot of them do which is really dangerous if true. So the problem with SJWs (people who want to dismantle te patriarchy) is that, a system is patriarchal only while it favors the males, it can stop favoring males, so we shouldn't attempt to dismantle the system, we should find issues in the current system and try to fix them until the system is egalitarian. Now, the normal leftist activist is advocating for small changes that he thinks will fix specific problems, but SJWs approach the problem on the 'down with the patriarchy' level. And this ties in with the identity politics. Helping the disadvantaged population and giving them more ways to climb up the social ladder and better chances for a good life is a noble cause. While today the difference between the races is still very pronounced it is mostly a leftover from previous severe discrimination, there are issues in the legal system but most issuess are of the social type. Between genders the differences are much lesser, with young women earning more than male peers and performing better in education. Telling this groups that they are opressed is not as productive as it was 70 years ago, dividing the public into two groups facilities a us vs them narative (which 'down with the patriarchy' is part of), instead everyone should work together to fix the issues with the system. White people don't gain anything if black people are disadvantaged. My take is that you can't expect all one million people to understand what they should be protesting, and the only way to get people to protest is to fire up their emotions. But you shouldn't need to protest for stuff that everyone can get behind, you should have a politican representing the will of the people and enacting changes, if there isn't a politician that supports a popular belief then you are really opressed by the ruling class and that is what should be the target of the protest.  Unrelated to the above, a big part of Petterson's appeal is that he seems very honest and like an extremely good person that wants to help other people. He often gets emotional when talking about the plight of the common man or at a story about a specific person. I believe that he was unfortunatelly too exposed to the SJW part of the liberal spectrum and now has a narrow vision of the left. Also as you said he doesn't really hold political positions as much as he asks controversial questions, which are sometimes controversial in a certain context but are mostly valid questions that don't really get asked that much."
"Abandon hope all ye who maketh a comment in this section."
"So I actually just encountered Peterson meaningfully about a week ago, strangely enough, though I'm pretty sure I saw him, rolled my eyes and kind of ignored him before that (probably ignored his shitty self help book before that, too). From what I can tell, he relies on bullying his interviewer with very fast, aggressive, overwrought speech that really doesn't say anything, full of dogwhistles for the beleaguered and oppressed straight, white, Christian cismale underdog. When an interviewer gets aggressive in return and he gets to claim victimhood, it's only better for him with his audience of cheering neckbeards who believe they, too, are victims of these women, LGBT people and commies.   Then there's interviews like when he says in order for sexual harassment to stop, women need to stop wearing makeup in the workplace, and why do women wear makeup if not to be sexually provocative? And when the interviewer laughs at him, all of his little followers get to say LOLOLOL INTERVIEWER STUMPED LOL as if they can't possibly comprehend that women aren't there for their benefit and the interviewer laughed at this dude because what he said was absurd. This guy has mastered interviews. No matter what he does, he wins."
"13:00 what are Hume's arguments for that?"
"I'm glad I found this video. Many Peterson critics on the left seem to think dismissing him as a reactionary and self-help conman (and making lobster jokes) is enough. You took it to the next level and really deconstructed his vague, flawed argumentation and bad faith debating tactics, while still giving him his dues where he merits it (I do think his self-help lectures contain a lot of sound advice). But yeah, his infantile political logic of 'everyone I dislike is Stalin' is an ambrassment."
"Jordan Peterson doesn't argue that post modernism and marxism don't originate from the West. He argues that they are anti-west because they stand against fundamental western values like individualism and liberty. Some ideas can originate from the west but also be anti-west at the same time."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF4PS6sVn3w"
"also  holy shit, the very end of this video was just pure gold."
"god i love u..."
"Contrapoints is practically the savior of entertaining commentators on youtube who remark on modern social phenomena, and I'd say probably the best for the sphere she inhabits. She's spearheading a counter movement to the strong right wing presence on youtube which influences a large group of disenchanted people by telling them that the left is what is causing every problem. I really see hope for the future in people like her, and I think in every time period there has been amazing glistening gems of dignity in all the interminable shit that manifests itself in humanity."
"Who are the 'other white guys who talk about lobsters'?"
"I mostly agree with this video. But I think when Peterson talks about 'anti-westernism' he means people within the west being anti 'western values'. Not people from outside the west with anti 'western values'."
"I hope more watch theses and that my brother checks out your series. Anytime  'any' left leaning conversations come up, he uses Jordan Peterson as some kind of example of saying 'you guys are oversensitive, stop making mountains outta molehills.'"
"Great video! I think this is one of the most charitable cases against Jordan Peterson. However, I think what Jordan Peterson is trying to say is that post modernism deconstructs history and utility and Marxism replaces it with a strict narrative of power dynamics between groups. Also,  I don't think his claim is that this is done to destroy 'western civilization' but that the deconstruction and dismantling of 'western civilization' may be a byproduct of that. If we cease to stand on the shoulders of giants we remain midgets. I do believe Jordan Peterson is intentionally unclear on somethings like metaphorical truth. I also totally agree with your point on his selective distinction of the west."
"Great video as a fan of Peterson I'm glad you addressed his points rather than try to paint him as a facist, racist, sexist etc. I do agree his idea of the 'marxist boogieman' is a bit fantastical. IMO what we should be doing is depolarising politics and shifting away from us vs them mentalities that people on the left and right promote. And yes whipping neckbeards into shape is exactly what he is doing with his self help work."
"<3"
"SO basically Peterson is just another bigot like nearly everyone in the youtube 'skeptic' sphere that doesn't say much but says it eloquently enough to full the simple-minded and ignorant masses. umm like we say in France 'Au pays des aveugles, les borgnes sont rois'.  BTW, I tend to avoid conspiracy theorists who pretend that there is an evil group that controls the world/society and aims at destroying a group of people seemingly for no other reason than they just love power, especially when those theorists are putting many people with different interests and goals, who don't even agree with each other, in one basket. That's a very tribalistic way of manipulating people who already don't know much about the so-called 'oppressors'. That's why I have always been very skeptical of that Peterson guy."
"The right always has to shield its words and intent behind vagaries and intellectual smoke and mirrors because if it knows that if it honest intentions were stated plainly it would be indistinguishable from any other hate group."

"Ok but there's so much more to Marxism than the bourgeois-proletarian binary. It's a comprehensive analysis of class struggle (including peasantry, aristocracy etc etc) and has been advanced primarily outside of 'the West' (see the USSR, China, Vietnam, Korea, Cuba, Burkina Faso etc), even if it had its origin there. It's a call to action and that action will be the downfall, not of the actual workers living in 'the west', but of its domination of the rest of the world. There's no need to be shy about that."
"That clip in the end!!"
"14:30 oooooh my god I almost threw up! Not because of the hideous face that suddenly appeared (well, maybe a little) but mostly because I'm a native French speaker and I have never heard someone pronouncing Michel Foucault's name so wrong!! OMG so he can't read and he can't even google-translate-check his pronunciation. lol"
"Natalie, I so so appreciate you tackling Peterson. I've seen video after video featuring Cathy Newman and commentary about how illogical feminism is. I immediately thought of you because your approach is always easy to follow, rational & compassionate as well.. 💙"
"Good video Contra. I did call bullshit a bit on a couple of things but the only real criticism is that you still managed to at least slightly misrepresent the issue with the trans pronoun situation/legislation in Canada. Otherwise I appreciate the thoughtful and challenging analysis/criticism."
"Absolutely brilliant!!!   I am going to watch this again and again."
"WE WANT KNOWLEDGE! Oh please, teach us senpai!"
"just because some ideas are 'incompatible' on paper, doesnt mean they are in the minds of people( like the concept of postmodern neo-marxism). People live and think in paradoxes. So Peterson many times said that he knows, that pm and marxism are  theories, which are not compatible with each other, but in the minds of many leftist they form an 'unholly alliance', and you can see the products of it beeing acted out.  The problem with pm and marxism is that they lack ethics. There is no marxist 'ethics' or postmodern ethics. There are no pattern of behaviour, no 'ethical-mythical-symbolical' stories for the everyday, for the day 'after the revolution' in marxist thinking. People are mostly creatures who play and act out stories. Marxism doesnt have the power or even content to give people stories or deep symbolical-individual meaning."
"A liberal that can communicate coherently? The fuck is this? subbed."
"I was a business major not too long ago (graduated in 2011), and never once was I told that 'capitalism is bad', nor did I come across any business, marketing, finance, or economics lecture or textbook that was even minimally critical of capitalism. Did things change that drastically in 7 years, or is not completely felating capitalism as an economic theory every chance we get the same as being 'critical' of it?"
"Contra, you just made into my list of people who I would like to sleep with. And you are among the top 3. Way to go with your looks."
"Girl your face is perfectly painted. I'm so into it"
"Excellent video. But you made two strawmen in the game. Peterson does not necessarily mean marxism, when he talks about post-modern neomarxism, he really seems to mean the identity policital streak that comes mainly from Foucaults hierarchical power dynamic theory. The only real marxism there of course is the idea of systematic oppression of groups, which isn't really marxist at all. And yes, I know that I'm kind of vague here, so bare with me. The second one is how you describe 'the West'. Many people might think of 'the West' as the intellectual traditions of Europe and European-descended peoples and countries such as the US, Canada, Australia. But in academia 'the West' isn't that clear-cut, i have heard definitions that do not go as far back as ancient Greece, but to the age of enlightenment, because only then did the defining features of what the West now represents take shape. And I personally share the latter definition, because Christian Europe during the middle ages was pretty much the antithesis of what 'the West' as a group of countries that share similar values, defines today."

"I'm a JP fan but I think you gave a charitable, reasonable critique even if I still disagree with some of your conclusions. For example, I think you kind of built a straw man where you mentioned the Cathy Newman interview and talked about JP's claim about biological differences between the sexes. That is a huge oversimplification of what he was saying in that interview. You also didn't really address his direct criticisms of Derrida, which are specifically about interpretations of a text. However, I do think JP goes too far at times and becomes hyperbolic. I wish he would have discussions with people like you on the left. A conversation between you and him would be really interesting. I still have hope that dialogue can occur and that we can get away from viewing these sorts of critiques as one party DESTROYING another. Ps - just watched the final part, omg if you could get on The Rubin Report that would be epic (if you'd go on)"

"ContraPoints you're a genius tranny."
"Exactly nails his rhetorical strategy, which is at best disingenuous.  It has always seemed to me that Peterson is fine (ish) when he's talking about his own field (although his work is shot through with the naturalistic fallacy), but he's just absolutely winging it when it comes to political philosophy and political science - as Natalie shows, he doesn't understand it, and is simply peddling a hotchpotch of conservative cheering points for mass appeal."

"Thank you so much for this Nat. Now when I get into an argument online and someone mentions post-modern neo-Marxism, I can point them in this video's direction instead of spending a whole bunch of time trying to explain why they're different and that Marxism is a modernist philosophy."
"Weird, I actually know people who call themselves Marxists, work in academia, and espouse postmodern feminism and identity politics. Just because there are disagreements with in a school of thought does not mean that the school does not exist. If it did you could use the same argument to say the far right does not exist because they disagree on questions like Israel, the free market vs state welfare, etc."
"Peterson fan here. I enjoyed this video, it's refreshing to see a good characterization of his views, etc. I think I can clear up what I think is your best point (on Postmodern Neo Marxism). The 'Postmodern' here refers to what you might call the Postmodern condition, NOT necessarily just the tenets of the philosophy.    Specifically, this is the state in which absolutely nothing can be held onto for any meaning or significance whatsoever. I have my suspicions that it has increased with the sheer abundance of conflicting information, but I digress. This might also be called depression (btw, I think it is telling that it is the case that student mental health is in decline), and this cannot be sustained for very long without going insane, killing yourself, or finding some higher purpose. Now it seems to me, that in this base, 'zero' state, the most obvious and clear path forward is going to be making use of and paying attention to, animal, basic, motivations. At least they have some meaning: 'it would be good to eat, and not die'. So after feeding, and sleeping etc. taken care of, the next motivational layer up is going to be something like the feeling of tribal motivations, and hierarchy position, that are facilitated by the primordial parts of the brain (e.g. the 'lobster' parts).   And this is where the 'Neo Marxists' get stuck, I think. Marxism rather nicely legitimatizes tribalism, and this is basically as far as higher purpose seems to go with many Neo Marxists. This may be all the similarity there is between Neo Marxists and Marxists. Then why use this term at all? Well, I think it is because many of the underlying motivations are the same, as well as the expansion of the 'class struggle' into race and gender domains.  As for the 'cultural Marxism' conspiracy, well my friend Yuri Bezmenov can tell you how that was true  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qkf3bajd4&t="
"Peterson wasn't complaining about 'a law protecting transgender people' there is no 'protection' in a law forcing people to use fallacious descriptions of reality.  your pronouns are YOUR pronouns.. meaning you can call yourself whatever you like, but you don't have jurisdiction over other peoples use of words.  That pretty much is Stalinism.  but yea Peterson is a bit of a dick and totally doesn't understand socialism and has waaay too much of a boner for capitalism. but he was right about the pronouns thing."
"I am going to see Jordan Peterson & Dave Rubin Live next month. I am giving you this opportunity to ask him a question simply because I don't have one of my own. If you have a question for him now is your chance. (Serious)"

"Also, I don't really understand why people can't disassociate Peterson's Psychological ideas, from his Political views. I have found help in some of Peterson thought (a few years ago, through youtube videos. I haven't read the 12 steps book, cus WHO HAS THE TIME??). But that in no way influences my political or moral ideologies?"
"Just gotta say it. Your voice is beautiful."
"this video lacks spooks, sad!"
"I had seen several responses to Jordan Peterson's shit, so, to be honest, when I saw the thumbnail of this video, I thought to myself 'oh, another one? Really?' I wasn't sure about watching it, but boy, you did an outstanding job, this is not only another leftist response to Jordan Peterson. This is THE fucking leftist response to Jordan Peterson. I think I hadn't seen anyone calling Peterson for his very well disguised non-sequiturs, and you also managed to decrypt his real message. Not only did you explain how nonsensical his claims about 'postmodern neomarxist' are, but you also used them to prove how Peterson must surely think (a quite far right mindset). This was amazing."
"Not fuck. Smash!"
"the thing I hate the most about Jordan Peterson is how post modern he is. He's preaching gnosticism to christians and begging for money all the time. He doesn't really produce anything also."
"haha that pcp comment cracked me the hell up !"
"I like your voice. It's relaxing."
"Bisexual manicure, LMAO!"
"The only thing I'd point out is Peterson's problem is more with Gender Fluidity ideas, specifically in relation 'invented' pronouns. To I think to say he has a problem with Trans people is unfair, unless you don't disassociate the two... not saying he's or wrong, but that's my take on it."
"How is this scam actually a professor in Canada? I thought the Canadian education system is 'good'? Or is he good at his field but prominent for a field in which he has no expertise?"
"Lol Marx and Engels are 'Our boys' at 13:23."
"Gee it's as if postmodern neo-marxism is a bullshit buzzword combining scary words that's used to scare young conservatives and liberals into avoiding ideas that might challenge or expand their worldview. Just like all the other buzzwords they rally around.  'But how do you resolve the deadlock between JayPee being wrong about something and him being an authority figure that does the thinking for me?' The answer is that it doesn't matter. They come for the self help tips and stay for the ramblings about how mixing white boys with people of different genders and races is bad for western civilization somehow. Or the other way around depending on the individual."
"You look amazing in this video. Obviously you made great nuanced points that really got to the root of Peterson's ideology. But also holy shit you're gorgeous."
"GO ON CHAPO TRAP HOUSE!"
"I think 'Post-Modern Neo-Marxism' sounds like a mishmash precisely because it is. I was a leftist for a long time, and in retrospect, very few of my fellow leftists were students of the relevant philosophers; most had simply latched on to a popular movement and were happy to parrot its talking points, without the grounding in philosophy. Eventually the left became deeply intolerant of dissent, and thereby further cemented its spiral into chimerical lunacy. So it's become in actual fact an amorphous blob of inconsistent rhetoric, and 'Post-Modern Neo-Marxism' is about as good a label as any, under the circumstances. You seem well-read, Contra, but most of your comrades aren't."
"what the fuck is this?"
"Have y'all seen Matt Dillahunty 'Atheist Debates' talk with Peterson? I've only seen Dillahunty talk about it post-fact, but it sounds real interesting.   Seems like Peterson relies on the 'grand narrative' and is a Modernist kick-back to the PoMos (but also wants you to know that he's totally not a commie). His description of truth however, sounds somewhat post-modern and perspectival. Also, sounds like he doesn't understand art (but that's fine, it's real tricky). Finally, 'no morals without god' *sigh*"
"You don't understand Peterson. He's actually the smartest intemallectual of modern times. The last defence against SJWs and Marxist, post-modernist pronoun-overload... feminism... uh... safe spaces and... other soy boy things.  U just don't get it."

"oh i love it so much when you deconstruct concepts, please never stop"
"There is a postmodern twist to a lot of leftist identity politics. The whole notion that, because you say something “as a lesbian trans chick of color”, no cis white male can argue against you, because they don’t share your experience. It’s the belief that there is no ultimate truth to be communicated, so we just have to take the claims of anyone who belongs to a group that is considered marginalized at face value."

"I thought of an ironic way to view how Jordan Peterson got famous. So he claims the government enforcing transgender pronouns impinges on free speech. This may be true, but here is a fun thought experiment I just thought of: I am sure there are situations where people are supposed to refer to Dr. Peterson as a doctor because he has a PhD. Some of these may even be legally binding situations. So imagine we lived in an alternative world that didn't value academic achievement at all. In this world, a social movement calling for the representation of 'educated' people rises up. The movement gains such momentum that the government forces people to refer to these educated people as 'doctors'. Does that destroy free speech?"
"“I make youtube videos because i enjoy mood lighting and set design” made me cackle"
"This was a humbling video. Thank you."
"Subscribed. Absolutely love this video but there’s a few subtle but important errors in it. For instance, Peterson doesn’t argue in favour of hierarchy as you suggest. He even says explicitly that hierarchies are often cruel and unjust. He also warns that simplistic attempts to dismantle hierarchy can be disastrous - past attempts at communism as obvious examples. He’s arguing essentially for gradualism.  Agree with you about his somewhat simplistic view of Judeo-Christian and Western values, but that’s a side issue IMO."

"This is all fine and you made good points (especially about his rhetorical moves), but I do think you are missing some of the unique aspects that bring this beyond either self-help or a veiled argument for conservative values. The linking of evolutionary psychology with mythological/biblical stories in the analysis of what leads to a satisfying life and a successful society is profound. It's not only JPs thinking, but he's put the picture together most coherently. Also, the 'protection of free speech' thing is not just a ruse--it's really important to him (and me and many others). the policing of speech by institutions and the 'de-platforming' of protestors is frightening and dangerous. Thanks for doing this in-depth (in-bath?) analysis and taking him seriously, your attitude is appreciated."
"Just stumbled upon this youtube channel the other day, and Holy Shit it's my favorite youtube channel of all time hands down no contest <3 <3 <3"
"How about not disowning anyone?"
"Truly Great video!  However you seem to miss the point that Peterson sucks alot from Stephen Hicks's book 'explaining postmodernism' in regards of postmodernism as it is today. That is why he's statements concerning PoMo are so odd, but there is reason for it: 'Neo-Marxist Postmodernists' uses tools of postmodernism as long as they are trying to disregard views of their opponents, but once they are on winning side they ditch their postmodernism and become modernists. They are not 'honest' postmodernists, but more opportunistic postmodernists using it as a smoke screen to advance their cause. This is why Peterson's views seem such odd jumble, but are at large coherent. Whole another discussion is if Hicks got it right, i can't disapporve his statements in any large scale.  Then the whole another thing is that Jung, whom Peterson quotes and also sucks in alot, is in essence a postmodernist. But Peterson, as many jungians do, read him as modernist (same could be said about Freud). And there are plenty of people who know Peterson's thinking and as well as Derrida relate him very closely to Derrida. This is my main issue with him and his attacks at people like Foucalt and Derrida, and i can't help but to think that he is projecting something of his own into them.   So there is this odd twist which drew me away from Peterson, unconsciously he is PoMo himself and this shadow of his he projects to others. (well there is also this drive to mass-prescribe Big  Five Tests to everyone in order to crystalize one's personality, which i don't like a bit)"

"Making Richard Rorty a poster boy for post-modernist philosophy is a very strange idea. His genesis is in Pragmatism, so he held that whether there is truth or not is not important as far as we can get pragmatic results. Most probably there is, but we just never know so it is better not to hold any absolutes. So, he opposed any absolute ideas, including that held by Post-modernists that there is no truth, only constructs, from which other post-modernists derive a wonderful idea that if there is no truth, then all constructs are equally false and equally true and you get your Luce Irigaray, who IS the person you should think of when people to the right of you complain about post-modernists.   I agree that Rorty is easier to read and understand, and I personally think he is one of the most underappreciated thinkers of the 20th century, but he is just not that post-modern."
"Q - does it take a lot of effort to put your voice on like that constantly?"
"I think you've covered pretty well why a lot of young people like Jordan Peterson. Hell, in my reactionary anti-SJW days I was a lot like those people: in need of guidance and under the impression that society had alienated me, and that the progressives were responsible for it. What he did was appeal to those needs and give me a grand narrative to replace the old one, and because I wanted to hear him out repeatedly, it was like a voluntary indoctrination."
"*Channel 4 interview. UK don't have just a single broadcasting channel."
"Petersons Deepak Chopra impression is frankly hilarious I think really he's a puritan who hides behind fancy speak, when in reality he's a religious quack this became painfully obvious if you've ever seen the first time he went on Sam Harris podcast where he wasted what felt like days trying to make an atheist believe that goodness is a spiritual form not a physical one."
"Jordan Peterson is the new Dr. Laura Schlessinger https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060976497/noxsolutions-20/ref=nosim"
"I'm also a fan of Peterson, and I valued this take. It was a thoughtful and pretty fair critique. It was a big undertaking--he has hundreds of hours of and pages of material expressing his ideas. For that reason this discussion often drifts towards a critique of his followers, of which there are a lot of terrible and irresponsible representatives who warp and add poison to his messages. Likewise he attracts the worst of the leftist protesters who do an equally terrible job representing an opposing side.  Peterson does talk about postmodernism quite a lot and I too find it somewhat hyperbolic and paranoid. I think he is heightened to that topic because of his experience in academia, but I believe him that there is some fishy ideology making its way through humanities departments in the universities. His hyperbole also stems from one of his common talking points which is that, historically, totalitarian movements have emerged amidst free societies like our own. He's never argued that trans-activism as a whole or protections for trans people will lead to totalitarianism, but he calls out specific activist efforts that are driven by dangerous philosophy (even if the intentions are good).  Anyways my main point should be that it's a shame that so many miss most of his great ideas to focus on him vis a vis the viral political stuff. The Maps of Meaning series is a fascinating and mostly apolitical piece of work, which you can take to heart or simply enjoy as some fun cultural theory akin to an analysis of hidden meanings in a movie."

"I might be wrong here: I havent really read JP nor do I really have any interest in defending him, but stil; trying to make sense of the concept of postmodern neo-marxism. The point is maybe not that it is a consistent philosophical system, even if the particulars of the concept are - the point is perhaps that he is designating a type of psychological world-view which combines marxism and postmodernism in action, but not in theory. That is, it is more of a psychological thing than a 'rational' thing. Postmodern neo-marxism them maybe refers to 'People who see themselves as progressive, deny all criticism as being fake 'universal values' but still espouse 'progressive values', in contradiction. I think JPs point might be that it is contradictory, which is part of its problem (then there is the question if this really exists. In some way, maybe - but if it does, it is at odds with both marxist and postmodern political goals). So no one needs to 'believe' postmodern neo-marxism - but they can be influenced by the worldview in their actions. Subconsciously. Maybe it could be seen as a psychological illness?    There are issues with the concept meaning this of course, but maybe its a bit more coherent."
"I greatly appreciate the engagement in the discussion JBP has been parading, the left has desperately needed an intelligent answer to his assertions. In the tradition of rhetoric and debate id like to address the points brought up in this video. (and ill admit im not unbiased I am definitely am coming from the Professor’s camp)  1. JBP actually uses Post-modernist, Neo-marxist, and Cultural Marxist somewhat interchangeably because they are the driving forces behind the cultural and political exaltation of equality of outcome. His point is that all three of these ideologies – in spite of their varying premises – end up pushing the same politics. They all proport that the current system and current hierarchies are inherently bad in one way or another: Marxists: Evil Capitalists Feminists: Evil Men Postmodernists: Evil everybody for supporting constructions we just randomly made up Perhaps in an extreme leftist culture their differences may start to manifest, but for now   they are more or less in sync. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnOUFS3lUpE  2. Marxism and Full Communism isn’t totalitarian -- its anarchic by definition. Marx’s utopia features an ideal world “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”. However these postmodern (ill stick to this as a broad term) manifestations try to push their agenda through government in an almost Orwellian fashion. This is why he calls them totalitarian; the world has seen forced equity and its not pretty. If a bunch of anarcho-communists want to start a commune and indulge in their happy utopia with out bringing down the rest of society with it JBP + crew would welcome them to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h_mMVwQnAk   3. Calling Marxism a “Western Philosophy” treats the term “The West” like we are talking about a geographical location instead of an entire worldview structure that has evolved over a few thousand years. “The West” refers to worldview structure created by the amalgamation of the philosophy, intellectualism, and logic of the Greco-Romans with the Golden Rule, moral absolutism, and yes, the Divinity of the Individual. These values were inserted into the Greko-Roman mindset with the Judeo-Christian tradition as the vehicle, however in spite of JBP’s affinity for Christendom per se Daddy never claims these are strictly Judeo-Christian values. Instead he simply asserts that we have used our own objective rational empiricism to where we as a culture no longer believe in a God for better or for worse. Enter Nietzsche proclaiming “God is dead!” not as a claim of eureka as is the common interpretation, but rather of doom. Nietzsche was asking “Now that we have eliminated God how do we keep our underlying moral assumptions valid without crumbling as a society? This is the ultimate question that JBP is trying to contend with and his criticism of the atheists’ and the left’s answers is that it will exacerbate the crumbing of society – not keep it in tact. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgBuOQL1VYY    Why do we as a culture and individually value each person with the assumption they have inalienable rights? The Atheistic answer that you value each human individually is generally “I have value, therefore I should value my neighbor” is completely arbitrary and one could just as easily conclude “I have value, therefore im going to put my own needs before anyone else’s because God is dead, Life sucks, and thanksgiving is about killing Indians”. The other answers put forth to this question by the left are even worse in comparison. Ultimately JBP turns to psychology and the Jungian principle of the collective unconscious. He asserts that true meaning is derived straight from responsibility, and the bigger the responsibility, the larger the sense of meaning you will feel. Since we are responsible to varying degrees for every action we take, insomuch as it affects us and the world around us, everything we do has some either positive or negative meaning. Ultimately meaning comes from every individual doing what he can to take the chaos around him, order it and therefore better the society. JBP’s common analogy is to go out and slay the dragon awaiting you and bring the treasure back home to share with your community, they will hail you as a hero, and reward you by raising you up on the societal hierarchy because you have earned it. JBP asserts that the Hero Myth architype has echoed throughout history because it explains the human condition and what we each need to do to find meaning in life. The Reason the Individual is divine is because if everyone if left free to find and slay their own dragons in society and there is a mechanism for society to reward them for sharing their spoils with us all society as a whole and each individual will be better off and become prosperous – hence capitalism.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvFlWSgo60M"

"ContraPoints, I've enjoyed your videos for a long time but I'm becoming more and more viscerally uncomfortable with the fact that when you make specific, targeted responses to people with whose views you disagree, you sarcastically sexually harass them. I don't understand the point - that's not true, it's obviously to make the kind of person who would agree with Peterson, or Peterson himself, uncomfortable, and to play with the decadent stereotype of degeneracy that they might project onto you - but it's also just uncomfortable in general, and detracts from the points that you're trying to make.  It might just be that I'm a fuddy-duddy, but it's just... even if it's tongue-in-cheek, it's still sexual harassment."

"hmm, I guess if your view of leftism is 'the strongest, most radicalized voices, blended together alongside Tumblr' then it would make sense for one to think that:  1) Leftists (TM) think that social structures, like gender and race, are purposefully created by the ruling white cishet class to subjugate the world 2) According to Postmodernist Neo-Marxists, all such structures, since they come from a position of power, must be abolished (here is the 'postmodern' part) 3) The way to abolish it is to rebel, by imposing our clearly superior queer leftist degenerate viewpoints, rising up, getting into power, and suppressing the evil burgeois cishets (here's the 'Marxist' part) 4) We're already doing it, and you can see it because universities, Liberal Media, and places like Tumblr, will tolerate and/or actively support this viewpoint. And as we all know, the only media people actually listen to is universities, Tumblr, and Liberal Media.  Honestly, I can actually see how someone could come to believe such an elaborate strawman.

It's a metaphor for how there are some things in the universe that we may never know, as true knowing may be impossible, and the most we can know is what we don't know, you know?    I don't know."
"Contra has misunderstood the lobster argument. JP’s point is indeed that you can’t hope to abolish an economic hierarchy because forming that kind of hierarchy (as well as social power structures)is literally stitched deeply into our brains.  This is why the claim to seek to abolish them is both Marxist (for the obvious economic reason) and post-modern, because it requires denying science (that there is a truth about how our brains operate). Also why he thinks post modern neo marxism is dangerous - because trying to deny a powerful human drive reliably leads to conflict."

"You didn't actually address JP's concept of post modern neo Marxism. He's not referring to a coherent philosophy which unites the left (that's a strawman), but rather a political strategy. The neo Marxist part goes like this: 'we are oppressed and we demand equality.' Then, instead of addressing counterarguments, you pull out postmodernism and say: 'your logic is a meaningless social construct being used to silence me.

Left wing academia controls the ever changing and increasingly extreme standards of political correctness and no one outside that relatively small circle (including marginalized people) don't get any say in it. Whenever any gets in trouble for not meeting those standards they are enforced regardless if anyone within left wing academia may have some reservations about them"

"'No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies, the hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender, race, and economics within our own society...' How are you gonna do that without oppressing individuals and engaging in the exact discrimination with which you presumably disagree? And with what do you replace those hierarchies?  Peterson's point is that people seriously argue those hierarchies are social constructs and thus can be easily dismantled. He thinks they're ingrained biologically. His evidence is that hierarchies are seen across the entire animal kingdom. Where's the evidence that they're unnatural?"
"The very first claim ContraPoints makes about Peterson is wrong. Right off the bat. 1:27 '...protecting transgender people under human rights law shall surely lead to Starlinism'. No. He never said that. The whole lobster queen theme is a representation of what Cathy Newman said, not what Peterson claims.  Peterson has, and continues to deconstruct the left."

Contemporary fringe left politics relies on the absurd notion of 'personal truth'."

Big Fan of Yours as well. This video was funny, and a pretty poignant critique of some Peterson's political viewpoints. He spends so much time railing against the left, and his perceived view of it, that it's almost as if he's ignoring the festering pile of authoritarian nightmare that has been piling on the right in recent years. Yes, activists on the left can be annoying and over reactionary, but when compared to any groups on the alt-right, I know who I'd rather spend time around."
"HOLY SHIT! I JUST REAKIZED THAT THE ALT-RIGHT IS TO 'YOUTUBE SKEPTICISM' AS MARXISTS ARE TO 'SJWS'"
"Post-Modernism does have a meaning and it's not *as* complicated as people seem to think it is. Post-Modernism is basically a philosophical movement that believes there is no inherent objective truth or meaning at the very least there might as well not be an inherent objective truth. Post-Modernism is a philosophy that reality is meaningless and thus we can create 'our own truth'. Any political movement or work of art that is shaped or influenced by Post-Modernist ideology is Postmodern.   What Post-Modernist don't want to understand is that they can't force other people to embrace their personal 'truth' and expect to be taken seriously. If everyone has their own 'truth' what makes a non binary demi-girl's 'truth' any more legitimate than anyone else's?"

"Compelled Speech has been an age old problem for humanity. You've just bought into the bullshit because they framed it as 'helping the oppressed'>. Which, just so you know, is how it's always been framed right before it's used to actually oppress people. People like you are just obsessed with the fact that it was in regards to a law you think somehow makes things better for Transgender people. The fact that people like you never mention the fact that several popular transgender women came out in support of Peterson's opposition to COMPELLED SPEECH <Not laws protecting transgender people, which is something you love to conflate> makes it obvious you aren't willing to have an honest conversation about this topic. Because you aren't willing to have an honest conversation about the topic your opinion is completely poisoned.  I guess it's just easier to rile up your crew of crazies if there is a white dude to attack. You know your argument is so weak that you wouldn't dare challenge someone like Theryn Meyer.   You are a group of people that wants to deny the very reality that surrounds you so it really isn't a stretch that you would be disingenuous or outright lie about your oppositions motives.

"As a fan of Peterson, thought this would be a hard watch. Pretty easy to watch, you are hilarious and insightful. Really love and admire certain postmodernists, so his reduction of them has always bothered me. Wish more intellectually capable people would challenge his ideas.   Don't want to undercut my compliment, but this is my observation as a fan on the inside of the 'other side': You underestimate how bad things are for young men, to a degree, so does Peterson. literally 2/3 of my close male friends have been molested or raped (half by women), and they have NO idea how to deal with it. Peterson gives great advice on dealing with trauma, deep advice I don't hear anyone but obscure psychologists give. From the inside, I don't see people being converted to fascism or even conservatism, I see two groups: The already fascist/conservative who haven't been pulled left by Peterson, and those who are more open minded who are in fact pulled in a more moderate or even left direction. Getting your shit together has an effect on your political philosophy. Peterson IS whipping the neck-beards into shape, not all of them, but keep in mind that he likely isn't creating them, they already exist."

I think he was trying to use this to do Christian apologetics.  It just came across as very dishonest and hypocritical.  If some college kid redefined truth like that to support Marxism, Peterson would have lost his mind."
"It's good to finally see this discussion get the seriousness and respect it deserves. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"Is it just me or does the wallpaper look like angry rabbits?"
"Conservatives like clean, simple to understand narratives. They don't care if these terms have their own meanings and schools of thought that often contradict or criticize one another. Peterson uses 'post-modern Marxism' as a dog whistle for the right, a catch all term to denote evil and degeneracy. It's an easy way to straw-man these ideas without having an honest discussion about them and also as a means to flippantly disparage and dismiss the left."
"I lost it at “so much for the tolerant Jacobins.”"
"This was definitely a great breakdown of Peterson’s mostly incoherent shit. Lobster Queen snatched our wigs too."
"i love you"
"OMG STRANGERS WITH CANDY!!!!"
"'I need better roommates.'  *raises hand* Ooh! Me! Pick me!"
"You introduced JP incorrectly within the first sentence, he was (is) against compelled speech laws. He's not against basic human rights for trans people."

"I love how you have such a great mix of funny bits and thoughtful bits in your vids. Always leaves me feeling warm and fuzzy after. ❤❤❤"
"i'm a fan of jordan peterson and a fan of contrapoints, for different reasons obviously. still, i very much enjoyed this video intellectually and for entertainment purposes, in general. plus, i appreciate and respect the fairness displayed throughout this video.   oh, also, i will never be able to look at jp the same way again with all that daddy shit.. bahaha."

"Natalie you released your Autogynephilia video the morning of my previous exam in a high-stakes tox course, and now you're releasing this one 12 hours before the final test, are you TRYING to sabotage my future with your *trans ideology* ?????"
"Thanks daddy🤣"
"That Rubin clip at the end gave me more chills of anticipation than 95% of Marvel Movie after credits scenes."
"i live for your always sunny references"
"Try to show more of your legs on the next vid... I mean, really well put, you have good points, great video!"
"Depends on what you mean by wanting more representation or 'equality'. To what end? Should that involve discrimination (quotas)? Unfortunately SJWs constantly work towards and implement discrimination policies (such as race/sex quotas). We keep hearing from the left/SJWs that women and minorities are being oppressed and the solution is discrimination policies/laws in their favor even when in reality they aren't being oppressed. Forcing people to use transgender pronouns isn't protection, but oppression. There is a seemingly open hate towards white men in the media, Hollywood, and especially by SJWs. Screw the race bigots who have a problem if a white male is in charge of a company or government position or a star in a movie. How about you do you and me do me, but when it affects me, my children that go to public/private school, or my church, that is when it crosses the line."
"Wow I can't tell if this is purposefully dishonest or stupid"
"Lol oh daddy"

"Love you!"
"I'm not sure how anyone on the left is going to top fucking Jordan Peterson in effigy."
"In my experience a good way to approach the problem at 20:35 is to ask them to unpack what they mean by xyz. They'll either expose their ignorance or come off as indignant and both are preferable to the calm demeanor that's won over Peterson's fans. Don't give them time to build a tower on a foundation of half understood concepts."

"So dishonest. Too hipster for life."
"I hate Peterson, but when I imagine what I would think of a video in which some Gamergate bro filmed himself taking a sexy bath with a doll made up to look like Anita Sarkeesian or Zoe Quinn, it would seem pretty gross to me. I'm not offended; just food for thought."
"wow, production and script wise well done!  plus well done analysis! loved it!"

"finally someone explains why 'postmodernists' like me hate idpol"
"i dont think Peterson have problem with the left, he have problem with the extreme left and since the left didn't try to dissociate itself from their extreme leftist that pander identity politics and deadly ideologies its easy to mistake that Peterson seems particularly critical about the left.  hierarchies is something that is natural, that is a fact. it is not a product of the corrupt patriarchal western culture. he states that inequality is a problem but it will be more catastrophic if there is an equality of outcome. unfortunately mankind haven't found an ideal solution to alleviate the problem. regarding the west i can understand why he uses that word. i think it is difficult to find something that represent the idea of liberty individualism and judeo christian values. do you have something more representative to actually represent those ideas? again on the gender pronoun, he didn't oppose it he is against the compelled speech represented by the bill C16"

"hahaha great. some things from peterson arent that bad however.  i still love you. someone so magnificently flamboyant cant be a dirty communist 😂"
"Am I the only one that thinks Peterson has a passing resemblance to Enver Hoxha?"
"I find it odd when people claim marxist or communists deny any inherent differences exist between people. Take this famous quote from Marx: 'From each according to their ability, and to each according to their need.' Isn't that a clear admission of differences existing? It doesn't say 'From everyone the same amount and to everyone the same amount.'"
"I think you should watch the Max von Sydow films: 'The Seventh Seal', 'Flash Gordon' and 'Intacto'. And wonder - 'do you feel lucky punk?   ...Well do ya!!!'         (y'know should you only orgasm if you are lucky? - is this why masturbation is wrong?)  (yes, I have no idea how to use grammar and punctuation - I was never taught these things as a child growing up in the BBC)"
"Great video! Just one thing I want to point out. You say here https://youtu.be/4LqZdkkBDas?t=1505 that requesting the use of personal pronouns is the sort of thing that an individualist should support, implying that this was what he had been disagreeing with. However, whether or not it was a correct interpretation of the law, his original complaint was that the government was using legislation to compel the use of personal pronouns."
"Yaaaas"
"Great video. Thank you for the insight. By the way the interview was on Channel 4 here in the Ugggg Kingdom ;)"
"P I N K F L A M I N G O R E E F E R E N C E"
"The reason he says to clean yourself up before you criticize the world is because you won't be competent enough to address the macro problems until you're comfortable with yourself. I don't think it's any surprise notoriously insecure people are the ones who have a problem with this statement. You never make any strong assertions as to why this is a statement of contention. I don't believe you actually read his material, or if you did, it was with a bias you were unable to shake, as it would shatter your delicate psyche."
"Are you against slavery? Well, did you know LOBSTERS HAVE HIERARCHIES TOO?"
"I'm not afraid of anything. I just took some pcp"
"damn I forgot. thanks for the reminder."
"Oh look, another fear-mongering bro afraid of the changes currently underway in Western society. Great video!"
"I'm glad that you put 'Judeo-Christian values' in quotes because it's really not a thing at all, the term seems to mostly only be used unironically by people who want to ignore that Jewish values often stand in opposition with Christian ones."
"feels over reals all the way"
"You're so fucking great, Natalie, what the fuck. Your videos are so well done and Jesus that make-up and those costumes and that set and those ha-has and omgomgomgomg"
"I disagree with almost everything you say, but at least you make a coherent argument for your side.   Still gonna shred you over this video."
"Are they still sexual undertones if it's the whole video?"
"LONG LIVE THE LOBSTER QUEEN!"
"The lighting in your videos are freaking amazing."
">20th century mass murderers still sprinkling in that bourgeois propaganda i see, contra"
"I feel that if you take out all of the big 'smart words' and phrases he's using like 'posturing', 'post-modernism', 'doctrine', 'underlying drive to power', etc., he would basically just sound like TheNoBullshit, or an angry 14-year old twitter troll. It's a clever mask, but luckily some of us can see right through it for what it actually is: sheer stupidity and ignorance."
"I had never heard of this JP fella until the other day when someone mentioned him ... maybe it was on the David Pakman show? But now that I've seen a few people make the rounds talking about this dude, I can see that he's sort of the typical right-wing caricature of a person. Maybe it's just me, but pretty much every big 'icon' on the right seems like a fictional character played by an otherwise out-of-work actor. They're either incredibly uptight and have a posture and expression like a broom handle is shoved right up their rectum 'til it touches their brain stem -- and give off the aura of someone who kicks dogs and would love to have child labor be legal again. Or they're some over-the-top lunatic who screams and shouts about conspiracies the likes of which you'd only expect from a poorly written story about an asylum. Only a few seem like actual people (they're just complete assholes).  And I assume that these sorts do appeal to a good number of individuals, but it's beyond me _how_ people find them credible / believable. Even when I am not familiar with the topics they're twisting to support their agenda, the things they say always catch in my ears like a discordant note, making me instantly think 'this person is lying. I don't know about what precisely, but there's something insincere or false about what they're saying.' To me, it's sort of like the Uncanny Valley effect, but for ideas. I might or might not be able to put my finger on it, but I know something's wrong. Or maybe it's some sort of body language that I pick up on.   It's frustrating when I see people get sucked in to these terrible philosophies that are really just about undermining liberty and societal improvements to keep a status quo of power concentrated purely at the top and blind obedience on everyone else -- where the whole structure is about constipating progressive thought to maintain stagnation regardless of the long-term effects."
"Is Jordan Peterson a cult thing? He came out of nowhere and his followers seem to worship him(see comments in this video for reference)"

"surely Him from powerpuff girls is the lobster queen"
"I am a bit embarrassed, but I did reflexively stand up to God Save the Queen."
"Can someone tell me who is the man Contra has in her background? Seems so familiar"
"I think at every public appearance, someone needs to refer to him as 'Mr. Peterson.' If he gets irritated and insists you call him Dr., then you say what's wrong? Do you have this title you prefer people to refer to you as, and it bothers you when someone misidentifies you purposefully?"
"How can you claim that Cultural Marxism is BS when you objectively are a Cultural Marxist endlessly banging on about identity politics? I have no doubt that should you gain power then we'd all starve. I think your videos are the best version of what my enemies say, hopefully you will one day realize that you are on the wrong side."
"1:19 -> 1:23 I stopped watching. Nothing more needed to be said."
"Cool video. One thing I wonder, is identity politics of marxist or postmodernist roots?"
"I have a lot of lefty friends who actually believe in Marxism and Communism. I've also seen a lot of professors from certain universities believe the same. I would say it's a valid fear on his part. I'd also steer away from calling anything a conspiracy, because it dismisses the belief by making the audience think 'conspiracy? Only nuts believe in conspiracies el oh el'. I usually just say 'belief' instead."
"Peterson is right! We all know the USSR was authoritarian because Stalin insisted on using gender pronouns."

"I came here out of sheer curiosity, and even if I don't agree with a good chunk of your points, I cannot deny how much work and dedication went into your research and the video overall. Fantastically made video, even if we're not seeing truly eye to eye. Keep up the great work"
"And, to be fair, even if one quibbles with the analysis, the set design and lighting is simply goddamn unimpeachable."
"The last part of the video reminded me of the Eurovision song occidentalis karma from last year. Cheers!"
"This is hilarious and refreshing and about time. But while Peterson might attempt to argue that unarmed US black youths who are getting shot on a regular basis by police, and women who get paid less for the same work are delusional when they put their misfortune in large part down to just being 'black' or 'women', post-modernists didn't argue that these categories did not exist in the minds of people in a position to act in a way detrimental to the very real and existent people on whom they attached these labels, 'black' and 'female', but only that the categories themselves were delusional and led to real and actual harm and injustice."
"You're the only youtuber whose videos I watch the moment I'm notified every time."
"Disappointing that you don't really say anything profound, noteworthy or original in this video. I don't mean to be insulting but I was expecting a lot more from you. The costumes were nice tho."

"Fantastic video. This video explained and helped me to finally understand a number of complicated and convoluted ideas that I had trouble grasping, even after reading or watching videos about them elsewhere. Additionally, your execution when explaining these difficult philosophical definitions in a clear and concise way is so freaking entertaining that I was glued to my screen from beginning to end. Thank you so much for the time and effort you put into your videos. I feel lucky and grateful to have found your channel recently and look forward to watching your previous videos. Keep up the great work!"
"Any chance that daddy jeep will watch this? 🤔"
"I love that you are able to laugh at the quirks within SJW reasoning. One more reason I love your work, even though I disagree with you frequently."

"I'm not intelligent enough to become a part of this debate, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoy your sass in this video."
"'OTHER WHITE GUYS WHO TALK ABOUT LOBSTERS'  IM FUCKING DEAD"

"“I need new roommates”  I volunteer myself!"
"hey, can you link / recommend some good debates where 'leftists' argue about identity politics etc? I'm in the far-right echo chamber, apparently"

"I don't know how, but I ended up on the floor about a minute in laughing my ass off. This is gonna be a good one. Clock me, Amadeus."
"Omfg this was hilarious"
"Funny you target Peterson, while jihadists throw people off of buildings. The Left is obsessed with 'possible' oppression, but have no problem watching the West get smothered by backward cultures who have no egalitarian leanings whatsoever."
"I can die happy now that Sweet Mother Nattily has roasted Derrida"
"*Standing Ovation*  It's about Goddamn Time someone explained in detail why Peterson is such a fraud!   But I disagree... I think he is a fascist."
"Jordan Peterson is now everyone's whipping boy.    TJ Kirk, David Pakman, Kyle Kulinski, Dusty Smith,  then Matt Dillahunty no less."
"Peterson is very good at countering the destructive Left. Some of us would like to avoid heading off the edge of a cliff into your dystopian future. Again, why not debate people who have these views, CP?"
"This is wonderful."
"20th century's mass murderers The tankies go off"
"The left doesn't tell people what to do. This is the most banal 'counter point' I've ever heard. When u tell someone u can not not cater a gay weading you have told them they have had to accept gay marriage. When u can not tell trans men to use the mens room u are telling them they must endorse a very strange and destructive psycho therapy."
"I should put Dragon of Chaos on my business cards."
"Not even 2 minutes in and already there's a lie. Peterson said compelled speech like gender pronouns under penalty of legal action is bad, not that 'protecting transpeople' will lead to Stalinism. Also, how could you go through this whole rant about Peterson's ideas about postmodern neo-marxism without actually looking at one of the many quotes where he explicitly defines it"
"i love u"
"Ur being way too cute (by half). Either he has valid complaints about the left or not. He does not limit his criticisms to small mediocre corners they are universal observations. They are either valid yes or no so why fluff up your observations by pointless critiques?"
"I fear I'm gonna get pretty annoyed by this as a Peterson fan, but I respect Contra enough to hear her out. She's one smart chick."
"Who is dave at the end?"
"Amazing work, and great points!"
"Jordan is more robust than 'self help' and he's not an especially good public speaker I mean the voice alone would preclude that. He's smart and he's interviewing better because he's done so much of it but this is new w/in the last two years. The first year was hard on him. He didn't look well. I don't see why sixty minutes and the bbc got their pants twisted about him. Tell me what he does that Chris Hitchens didn't due a lot more obnoxiously."
"Yeah Jordan Peterson exaggerates on so many points about how the fascist left is taking over the world, but you also lessen down the impact those irrational radical leftist people have.  You just gotta see who our president is to understand the influence some stupid super right politically leaning people have , even though most people in the right would identify as moderate right they were still influenced by these alt right people or identify with some of their ideologist. The left is no different (I blame this two party system), those few nutjobs who don't believe there is a biological differences between men and women are usually the loudest and do influence the rest of the moderate left a lot more than you seem to believe. 'no one has ever said that every hierarchy is the product of western patriarchy' I don't know how you could truly believe this, do you intentionally blind yourself to these radical leftist? they are usually the ones with the most attention (because drama sells), or do you not consider them left leaning just because their ideology is more extreme and not fact based?  So yeah Jordan Peterson seems to encompass the radical left ideology with all leftist ideology, but you seem to think those radical have no influence at all in current politics. Which again, you just gotta see where the right leaning politics is heading, to figure out the power and influence these nutjobs have."
"Thanks for letting me contribute to your set design :)"
"Holy Fuck! I thought that was actually Peterson on the bed."
"Thank you! You and Jordan Peterson are two of my favorite YouTubers, so I've been waiting for this for a long time"
"OK, after watching the video, the only criticism I have is that... really? THE LEFT doesn't tell people WHAT TO DO? That's **why** we are the left, we think everything and everyone's wrong and they need to change. I cringed a little at that lack of self-awareness."
"Wow contrapoint"
"Channel 4 not BBC holy shit people outside the UK don’t get this . BBC news sucks channel 4 is actually pretty good"
"I love that Jordan B Petey speaks like an Aphex Twin track"
"The Lobster argument is fucking stupid. You could pick literally any species with any social organization and as long as its older than (insert literally any human organizational structure here) you could compare it and use the comparison as an argument for it. If this is the kind of shit thats actually fooling people, than a large portion of people are much dumber than I previously assumed."
"Either You don't understand postmodernism or are deliberately downplaying why it's so pernicious and ineffective as an actual lens to view reality by. Either of these two implications don't reflect highly on you."
"I disagree with a lot of this but it's refreshing to hear the man's ideas be directly challenged"
"Wow. That was well done. Weird. But well done."

"We don't want to destroy Western culture, we just want to strip it of its colonial plunder."
"Marxists have no real concern for human progress given the ample historical evidence of this philosophy when applied. Peterson should simply say he is opposed to people on the far left and right, known as the ‘Ideologically possessed’. There, and he makes sense again entirely."

"To say that identity politics and postmodernism are different misses the point. Deconstruction is FOR something, not a tool in a vacuum. No one just goes around deconstructing, they do it to destabilize the dominant order for specific political goals (so this is how they are all the same). You do rightly point out that with no foundation those different political goals will now war with one another (this is how they are different, they now vie for power)."
"Are you a man?"
"About biological differences between men and women and their implications in the conversation about women occupying much less top positions than men: Mean IQ of men and women is almost the same but male IQ-distribution is flatter. Top positions require high IQ. There are more men with high IQ than women because of said differences in flatness. Hence, you actually should expect more men at the top in fair individual meritocracies.  That's nobody's fault and we simply gotta deal with it. While keeping our meritocracies in check, of course."
"Great as always! I really appreciate your snappy. concise overview of Modern philosophy -- especially how you nicely distinguished Early and Late Modern philosophy from one another. But of all the Early Moderns, Spinoza deserves a shout out."

"I'd kill to see the two of you debate. You and Jordan are the only Youtube people I watch consistently atm."
"God save the Lobster Queen!"
"Not sure if you are misunderstanding Peterson's argument about Postmodernist + Neo-Marxists or purposefully mischaracterizing (I hope not because that would be sad), but he isn't arguing Uni Professors and HR departments are actively seeking to destroy capitalism.  The argument is that their political views and actions stem from the same Marxist theories that led to Communism, which is an inherently unstable system. He is saying that it is a path we do not want to go down beacuse it has never been successfully navigated and has only led to death and destruction."
"You restore my hope in humanity"
"this was great."
"I SERIOUSLY disagree with the view of Marxists being displayed here. If you are a true marxist, identity politics are as much of an issue as class struggle, more than that, they are INTEGRAL to class struggle."
"NGL, this is probably your worst video. The first reason why is that you forgot to address the `neo` part of postmodern neo Marxism, which makes Peterson's ideas more cohesive. The second flaw, is that like with the Violence video, you fail to come to a clear conclusion to the video essay, leaving it feeling flaccid. I found this video to be entertaining, with a few good points, but without a message to synthesize them. Please accept this constructive criticism, and continue to make videos."

I don't actually like this communist idea at all and I may be cutting this dude kinds short as I've yet to look into him but nothing he said had me compelled to examine closer into the issue especially not being a big fan of identity politics already and the rest was just kinda filler talk. Oh well I'm thinking some people feel scattered and need a leader of sorts and he comes across as having an organized plan"
"Daddy is my favorite philosopher"
"Amazing."
"'...ContraPoints. Have you heard of this YouTuber?' 'I--seen the name come up once or twice on Twitter,' Dave said, probably blushing"
"Nope, sorry, you give this charlatan way too much leeway, 'postmodern neomarxism' is basically the same bullshit as 'cultural marxism', there's no such thing, it's all fascist-talk. Reactionary politics is just fascism with a thin veneer of respectability. This is just the fascists' tactic of getting a foot in the door. Even with how much you criticize him on his nonsense rhetoric about marxism and postmodernism, you have already swallowed way too much of the crap he spouts, his so-called 'self-help' advice is meaningless, pretentious, condescending moralistic preaching and his views on 'the left' are just those of a far right demagogue, except hidden under a veil of pseudo-intellectual sophistry."
"I didn't agree with everything you said but you are always very creative and you never seem to strawman anybody."
"POST MODERNIST MORAL RELATIVIST  CRITICAL THEORY ESPOUSING CULTURAL MARXIST NIHILISTS"
"Foppington is a right queen; holy shit all the detail in the costume. I had to stop the video after a laughing fit triggered at 14:13. Where on earth is Jim Sterling's claw hand cameo?? Was it too obvious?   Also, that is one of the best brief summaries of modernism and post modernism I have ever seen. Thank you."
"Way to class up the youtubes. Daddy's proud of you for your willingness to dive down into the belly of the beast to revivify your dead and flawed father(s). You really did a number of summarizing Peterson but to extend the charity a bit further, recall that Peterson's own feelings of being under fire from the left stem from his personal experience and his place within an academic environment, starting with fear of nuclear war, driven by ideology to feelings of leftist oppression via policy that attempts to create authoritarian rules that cannot be reasoned or challenged from the individual standpoint, which, ultimately leads to a state of ever escalating violence unto pure chaos. Peterson's doomsday fears are driven by an understanding of the psychology of ideologies along with an understanding that these ideologies are only limited by the scope of their political power to impose force upon dissenting individuals and all of socieety, which is bad for anyone with a need to be heard or a desire to exist as they are. We can see the intent of these ideologues especially in their tactics of wanting to authoritatively use violence to suppress dissent of opinion (which Peterson cites taking place on both sides of the political spectrum). Peterson's focus on the left however is driven by the corruption of academia by the left, his home turf, which he then takes as his primary point of critical focus in an effort to counter what he sees as an incessant ideological possession via the naivety of youth happening in the institutions that should be focusing on revivification rather than a total condemnation, according to Peterson. Peterson seems to appreciate Buddhism and does wonderful religious comparisons betwixt Buddhism and Christianity and sees the critiques of Post-modern Neo-Marxist in both what they have wrought and what they intend to bring about via a critique which is more so an expression of contempt for humanity rather than an attack on only Western Civilization."
"Camus <3 I would love talking a bit more about more abstract philosophical questions instead of the never ending debates on how to run economics. -_-"
"Why does Peterson shave? Is it to arouse his male audience?"
"I see you pulled off a Marvel ending, well done"
"YAS. Been waiting for this."
"great video as always but queen your makeup and wardrobe... you snapped!"
"at 19:38 you say 'he uses the term postmodern neo-marxism to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force bent on destroying western civilization. When in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons who can't stop squabbling with each other over every other god damn little issue.'  Thing is, the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling buffoons who can't stop squabbling with each other over every other god damn little issue is literally why Peterson thinks they're force that could destroy western civilization.  I don't think he believes they're a group of people who're knowingly working together as a 'philosophical force', he just sees a bunch of precious emotional people causing shit because they don't like that life is how it is (like how you can never be a 'real woman' if you were born male. At least not until we develop techology capable of entirely altering the biological structure of an organism such that it's indistinguishable from something born that way I guess, but i digress.)  Also I feel this video misrepresented why he's been thrust into the limelight. He's said himself that he's happy to call people by their preferred pronouns if they tell him what they are. He has absolutely no dispute with it broadly speaking. I can't say if he personally thinks that's stupid or not, but he'll do it out of respect for how you feel regardless of his personal opinions. That much he's actually said. His problem was it would be mandatory for him to do it and it would be punishable if he didn't. He's entirely against forced speech. If he chooses to show you respect or compassion in the form of him actively choosing to use your preferred pronouns, then he will and you should be thankful that he cares. He doesn't have to do that, your life isn't his and your desire to be have been born a different way is not his burden to carry. But out of compassion for how you feel he's willing to refer to you in a way that makes you comfortable. He's just not willing to also make the factual claim that you're a man or a woman when you were born with the biological makeup of the opposite.  You can come back to what i've said here with a bunch of shit about gender and how gender and sex aren't the same thing, and that's fine. But if they're not the same thing you should have absolutely no problem whatsoever with someone saying you're biologically (in your case) male.  Also flipping around pronouns doesn't mean he's treating someone 'like they're a woman' or 'like they're a man'. I at least don't treat people 'like they're whatever genitals', i just treat them the same across the board and I might make concessions for certain individuals I care about who have a different circumstance, if it's not too much hassle for me and my own stress levels and shit.   I've rambled a bit, not quite made an exact point. But what I'm getting at is I think you've misjudged what his position is.  Just to clarify, I've read his book and I don't necessarily agree with everything he's ever said, every decision he's made or his opinions or claims about certain things. But I do like him. I feel like he's a genuine person who really cares. He's walking a fine line of exploring ideas and a little bit nuts, but he's clearly a person who cares and I'm willing to believe that's not an elaborate act or something on his part.  I've enjoyed this video, but I do feel it's not presenting Jordan in an accurate light.  But it is a fair interpretation of him in the sense that, if this is what you honestly got from seeing him talk and reading his work, then I'm sure others did too.  What I'd really like is to see Jordan himself respond to this video from start to finish (ideally in one of those response videos that shows clips of you and then he responds to what was said there.) Not some Jordan Peterson owns Contrapoints shit. I'd just like to see how he'd clarify his points about things and whether you'd change his mind on anything.  Please try to get Daddy JP to respond."
"Very nice video, thank you once again ContraPoints! To what's been said here, I'd also like to add that JBP also often says obtuse nonsense alongside any general points he is trying to make, and comes out with way too many absurd absolute statements: just recently he said the *only* way to successfully stop smoking was to take shrooms, that rules-based systems *never* work or that you have to be a murderer to be a true atheist, so most atheists *aren't*.  Good night and one more thank you, let the degeneracy commence (goes to bed)! =8)-DX"
"this is, by far, the best critique of JP i've seen on youtube, congrats mommy"
"correction: Newman interview was for Channel 4 news...not the BBC. Channel 4 is a separate entity from the BBC."
"Thanks Contra, gonna go give myself a bisexual manicure"

"YESSSSSS FINNALLLLY THANK YOU!!!"
"Contrapoints is a two bit failed academic."
"So you mostly like JP and I can live with that. Would be interesting to see you debating."
"This is now the best response to Jordan Peterson. This one is number two though, and this guy deserves more views https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU1LhcEh8Ms&t=3s"

"Man. Fuck Jordan Peterson!"
"More like Jordan Penison"
"De Sade, Stirner and Derrida are my boys, give them some slack, you moralist lobster queen (it could be interesting if you did a video in the future in regards to the issue of egoism vs altruism, in regards to the views of Max Stirner, who is kinda related to the post-modernists)."
"Youuuu R beautiful darling 😙😳"
"thenks mather for my life"
"There are a lot of points that you make that have nothing to do with the points that JB was making. Although I can't say I care for his conservatism I think that at least he has some valid criticism. For instance the thing about Biology. We know for a fact that there is a biological basis for behavior and neural make up greatly impacts behavior. We know that men & women have different neurology and therefore different biology. There is no objective way to look at the science and not conclude that men as a group and women as a group will behave differently. They will enjoy different things and pursue different hobbies and interest, when looking at them as a group (caveat). JB even goes into the stats and concludes that even if you controlled for other social factors there are certain things the different sexes prefer or very simple task or traits that have a sexual preference such as Height, hearing in the higher registries etc."
"Also who is the guy in the Rubin Report that mentions Contrapoints?"
"Okay but the Bisexual Manicure is a motherfucking game changer"
"Will you tweet https://youtu.be/4LqZdkkBDas?t=28m16s to Dave Rubin? =P"
"Exactly, every criticism of Peterson is a straw man. Like sure Cathy Newman was massively uncharitable in that interview but did he actually say anything? Is he really just here to talk about lobsters?"
"The best response to Peterson and I say that as an admirer of JP. Although, he has said himself he doesn't understand why Postmodernist and Marxist outlooks seem to usually be held together when they contradict each other, so he's not blind to this. Also, for PoMo-Marxism vs 'the West' he means Enlightenment vs Counter-Enlightenment forces. The counter-Enlightenment have been banished to their only safe haven left: the ivory tower of academia, where with tenure, they cannot be challenged and have thus become deranged and pathological and are brainwashing naive students. TL;DR, read 'Understanding Postmodernism', it's where he gets his ideas on PoMo from."
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this video. Once again illustrating why you are actually my favourite youtuber. I have maintained for a long time that while some of Peterson's other work is actually quite good, his philosophy and grasp of postmodernism is actually clapped."
"you had me at 'So Much for the tolerant Jacobins'"
"26:25 irony at its best."
"Yes! YES"
"Two thoughts:  1.) All of the modern Right, whether it's JP or the alt-Right, have an intellectual achilles' heel regarding 'the West'. 'European', 'English', 'white', or hell even 'Christian.'  They take  these arbitrary categories and attach intense significance to them.  I think the most effective way to break down their worldview is simply to attack these notions explicitly.  Obviously the die-hards Rightists won't care, but it will be effective at keeping new converts out.  2.) I do think that the Left is missing an intellectual center, and I do agree that it's being filled in with people like Contra.  I mean, the modern Right has laid multiple foundations of bullshit that are collapsing as we speak, but I think it's time that the Left really sat down and gave a serious critique of itself.  A critique that came from how we understand ourselves and not in how the Right wants to misinterpret or misrepresent us.  I think that there are real issues with identity politics.  Although I have to be honest, after watching this video and seeing Natalie really tweak some types of people on the Left in this video, I think Natalie may be ready to do just that."
"I feel like Peterson is overly alarmist. Postmodern neo-Marxism doesn't believe in any objective truth. It's all about storytelling and anecdotes over hard evidence. Secondly, academic Marxism is merely the observation of class and society. You can easily be a capitalist and use Marxist analysis regularly. Neo-Marxists mix Maoism with 60s New Left views. They're not this scary bunch of totalitarians as much as they are old hippies.  Furthermore, Marxism has influenced not only virtually every ideology left-of-center but even some center-right ideologies like neoconservatism and Christian democracy. Not everybody who says, 'lets look at how this impacts the working and middle classes is automatically a Stalinist. And not every communist is even a Leninist to begin with. Democratic socialism and anarcho-communism both exist as alternatives of non-authoritarian communism.  I feel like Peterson is mostly somebody who read bell hooks and Catherine MacKinnon and disagreed with them. They're the only two names which come to mind in terms of very strict intersectional feminists and also the two who wind up being quoted by activists more than anyone else. I feel like a lot of media figures began being influenced by them mostly as a means of avoiding being fired for not kowtowing to the politics of internet outrage. Keep in mind that outrage culture was also influenced by a number of far-right trolls who wanted to push the left as far to the left as possible using fake accounts. Even then, social justice Tumblr is far more influenced by hooks and MacKinnon while woke Twitter is far more influenced by Noel Ignatiev and Ashanti Alton. I feel like the media moved way too far to the left as a result which caused a backlash that led to Trump. Part of it was fear, part of  (The Russians also later got involved in impersonating progressives and they deserve every bit as much of the blame as the /pol/ trolls.)  Keep in mind that things have cooled down from where they were in 2013-2016 and most of the outrage I see is on the right despite them winning both state and federal elections. The extreme left were always a paper tiger who people took seriously and falsely thought were a majority."

"What can be said can be said simply Petersen has hit on a need,  a preference and  thus a demand. Modernism = the project ff rationalism 'Progress' need : everything that heroic modernism left undone or misdone. or fucked up. Complex problem.   preference : someone else to blame (simple belief, complex problem)   Can influence  opinion by vagary, equivocation, misdirection, false appeals to self as an authority . . . Gets applause money affirmation Keeps going#  Petersen is to YouTube Troll/punditry what the   The Gatestone Institute is to islamophobia. namely  Better set dressing,, same shit.  #surprise  So to your video a big yes but with  big but  Equal and opposite criticism  can be made on the left. Namely addressing the preference not the need  Left and Right  and critical rational discourse are part of the same modernism they aim to or end up in critique of.  #surprise  A major need is to stop the rowing  so fix the discourse by taking care of the individual people engaged in  same. That's a common sense proposal, not an analytic conclusion."

"1) multiple pictures of Deleuze and Guattari, yet no mention of the makes me sad (come on, the first body to be commoditized was the anus). 2) reading Derrida currently and I'm not finding it as bad as people say. 3) what do you have against Scotland?"

"Loved the video. I find the exclusion of the fascist undertones a little disappointing. My quick run down of that would be he uses the term cultural marxism constantly, argues in favor of natural hierarchies using the Pareto principle in almost the exact phrasing of Mussolini, uses his book Maps of Meaning to identify reason and order as masculine and chaos as feminine has an fixation on Jungian psychology which has some unpleasant links to nazis. Combine all that with his claim that he extensively studied fascism and nazis along with his aggressive anti leftist positions I become concerned that the fixation of the alt right with him isn't accidental in the slightest. It all wreaks of dog whistles to me. I can grant that it could all be accidental. That he fears the slippery slope of trans pro nouns to gulags but doesn't see a slippery slope to fascism in there but it stretches my suspension of disbelief pretty hard."

I was starting to wonder what I had done to deserve this treatment when I'm actually just looking for some John Fahey song or some old David Chappelle joke. (Yes, I am a postmodernist, I guess.)

You mention you don’t care about the topics he covers and criticize a phrase he made up and loosely compare it to others from nazi propaganda.

"Hello Contra! Just to say, I've been a long time fan of your content and your amazing self in general, and I'm really happy you decided to do a video on Jordan Peterson. I've been following and subscribing to his stuff for a while, and found myself agreeing with some of what he said but also equally found myself suspicious of what overall message he was trying to sell to his audience in terms of his MO. You basically nailed on the head some of the things I was thinking, but orders of magnitude better and I'm extremely grateful. I'll try buy you some champagne glasses via Amazon wishlist to support you in some way."
"also, what lights do you use and where do you get them? i want to make my room as surreal as yours"
"okay this explains the customer who kept trying to convince me to stop my transition with these arguments and saying 'I am just trying to have a philosophical discussion' (I was trying to explain to him how to help his plants overcome root damage)"
"SHEEEEEEE"

"Leftist content on Youtube gets almost too weird now. First Hbomb with his naked birth scene out of a painting and creepy monolouge thereafter and now you on top of Jordan Peterson calling him daddy.   I genuinely don't know which was harder to watch without pausing."
"#LobsterTime!!!"
"When Petersen says 'Neo-Marxism' he probably means the Frankfurter Schule a.k.a. Adorno, Horkheimer, Habermas, Markuse etc. Neo-Marxism is different from Marxism, because it takes marxist principles and reapplies them to the culture as a whole e.g. the concept of the 'Kulturindustrie'."

"I'm pretty sure you could have asked Jim Sterling for a better lobster mask. He has a pretty great one that he didn't use in a while."
"Who is Peterson, that does not know his history?"
"Good video, only really had a problem with the pronoun thing (from what I understand Peterson is against the legality of speech not mis-gendering people) but the bit about hierarchies was pretty on point, one of the only genuine and hard hitting criticisms I've seen of JBP other than his nonsense about religion."
"I dislike that everyone who makes a video about Peterson from the left comes back to that interview on Channel 4 to criticize the host. Peterson is using the Sam Harris method, he says either things that are obvious in a clear fashion or things that are controversial in an extremely vague fashion, and when he's criticized for the vague shit, he turns back to the obvious shit and pretends that's what he's criticized for. Did she do a bad job interviewing him? Yeah, probably. But that's literally the objective of this method of discourse: that people who attack the non-obvious opinions enter the vagueness and appear confused before an audience because they have trouble pinpointing the actual points."
"I'm Sorry, but either I have misunderstood you between 22:00 and 22:45, or you are seriosly strawmanning JP there. I think his point is that there are hierarchies in nature (e.g. in lobsters), therefore the hierarchies in human societies are natural as well (or at least some of them and/or at least partly). Obviously, this is quite simplistic, and just mentioning lobsters does not tell us anything about humans. In fact, I would say the interesting question is to what degree human hierarchies are the result of biological preconditions and to what degree they are not, and, once we know the answer to that: What do we now do about this? Accept them as 'god given' (Atheist speaking here), try to counterbalance biology with societal norms, something I cannot think of? However, I don't think his point is 'There are hierarchies in nature, we cannot do anything about those, so let's just stop to even try to do anything about the human ones!' I think his argument is that some of the hierarchies in humans - and I would say it's pretty clear he mostly means the ones involving gender - are the result of biological differences, and not 'artificial' social constructions. Now, it would be great if he would actually provide any conclusive evidence of this, and not just point at lobsters instead...  Disclaimer: I have not watched enough of his stuff to exclude that he does not at least try. My (admittedly) superficial understading of the relevant science is that we could not really make any definite conclusions at this point anyway.  Also, I do not agree with 'the Jeep' in any way, but (to misquote someone) 'The most infuriating thing is a bad argument for a position I agree with' ;-)  PS: I briefly tried to see whether someone else pointed this out, but there are already to many comments (>1000), so I'm sorry if I'm repeating something.  PSS: Nevertheless, despite that, a well done video as usual :-D"
"This is the kind of response that I've been waiting to hear from my circle of left political talkers. When it comes to the interviews, Jordan Peterson is able to use language to muddy the waters of debate to make it sound like he's making brilliant points. When you take a step back and analyze the arguments and phrases that he uses, they shouldn't even be mentioned. PomoNeoGroucho is just a call sign and a bubble term that people can put whatever they don't like about the left into. Yet I still think it's okay for him to be out there to call out when the extremes of the left and the right are pushing too far. I just hope there's enough people out there to rein him in when he starts talking about the Gulag."
"so if we have a hierarchy where the left is at the top and the right at the bottom..."

"JP really needs to watch this."
"The easiest way to sell snake oil is to bundle it with some actual medicine; half truths that can be made whole with the snake oil. Never make a clear line in the sand, and no one can ever say which side you’re on. JBP will say in response to “can men and women work together” some bullshit about women wanting to look attractive, wear make up, the psychological responses this has on men, etc. But he never says yes or no. He implies ‘no’, and he gives ammunition to those who believe ‘no’. He hands a bunch of half truths about the psychology of make up, and it’s hard to argue that what he’s said is wrong. And if you attack him for being on the side of no, well, he never said ‘no’."
"Could anyone who 'actually loves JP and disagrees with Contra' please articulate what exactly it is that they disagree about? I've yet to see any JP fan make an argument beside 'you don't understand JP and you took him out of context'."

"Overall, I'm not like, extremely bothered by his existence, but I am really annoyed by his popularity. I'm not a fan of reactionary politics, really from either side even though I agree with the left more often, because I feel it tends to make arguments into shouting matches and people start treating those with other opinions as 'enemies' whom they feel they can't reason with. Like, if Peterson was a right-winger who thought that political correctness stifled freedom of speech or something, then, whatever, we can discuss it, but he goes and makes it into some weird Marxist-world-domination conspiracy theory and... it's tough to argue politics with people who are just _so_ far removed from reality. Also, he's religious, so... see previous sentence."

"damn, contra's makeup is on point... but is it just me or has Peterson's moment in the sun dissapated? if it hasn't it's definitely seems to be less talked as of lately."
"I'm a lobster who was subbed to you long before I knew who JBP was. I think you are probably right about Peterson's idea about the left being a little jumbled. Although, I think that you paint him as someone who is further to the right than he really is. Note how JBP says that he's for equality of opportunity, he's still an egalitarian. He cites himself as being high in openess (personality trait) which is why he has a lot of sympathy for the left and he always notes how both the right and the left are useful for soceity because they view the world differently. This is why his belief in free-speech is as strong as it is.  Furthermore, the chilling effects of postmodern feminism shouldn't be taken for granted thanks to the firing of people like James Damore, the inquisition of Lindsay Sheperd and the mess that happened at Evergreen college w/ Brett Weinstein. You kind of write off the idiots who make these debacles happen, but they're what makes discourse between the left and right so conteneous.   I think that you guys would have a great conversation together as people who can have a conversation and not become savages, please do so that we can all learn. Thanks a lot for making this video, I cannot wait for the next one."

(Seriously though, this was such an insightful video and it made me understand so much more about not only the logical fallacies of Peterson's arguments but about my own views regarding the various nuances of current feminism: I found myself agreeing with so many different aspects of both traditional and post-modern feminism, many of which I had never been able to articulate before today. I've been subscribed for more than a year and a half, and I realize now that I haven't given feedback as frequently as I should have. Will try to fix that, but for now, WELL DONE!!!!

"All hail Contra! The Dark Mother has spoken!"
"thank you for destroying jordan peterson. no really. ive been saying forever that his entire formula for debating is to make 2 barely related statements, one of which is something most people would think is obviously correct (though is often subjective/his opinion), and a second one that is so absurd it provokes a counter-argument even if its not wrong. then if the person even TRIES to debate what he said he can say theyre arguing fact or twisting his words. ive been saying forever that he just manipulates the conversation and the person hes debating into playing his game meanwhile hes not actually making any solid points. ive had such a hard time explaining to people what i meant by this for such a long time but you did a perfect job in capturing what i meant. i hope i can share this video with people who for some reason think jordan peterson is an intellectual debate god who cant be proven wrong and they actually watch it. its such a solid and well put together video."

"JPs point is that people are mostly driven off biologically rooted concepts and thats why the world is the way it is.  Everyone on the left dislikes it because they want it to be a social construct by either the capitalists or the patriarchy etc.  Peterson is also an existensialist and recoginzes that life is suffering and not fair but views left wing attempts at gaining power as tyranny because of the lefts histroy in communist countrys and he is right in saying that modern leftys are motivated by the same base priinciple as the old ones i Sovjet"

"Really liked this. I've seen quite a few Peterson videos and he has a lot of good ideas, many of them very reasonable. Of course, he's not right on everything, and seems to make a number of errors in judgement and fallacies regarding genders, trans issues, and social roles. Nearly all (okay... absolutely all) opposition that I've seen to him have relied on strawman arguments, tu quoques, and ad hominems. You've actually addressed and responded to his declared positions, giving good arguments (something that should be standard practice). Love your sense of humour and looking forward to more videos."
"Loved the video contra, but the interview was from channel 4 not BBC 😅"
"The best lit bathroom in cinematic history"
"Jordan Peterson is the kind of person who listens to Archive's 'Bullets' on full blast."
"It's still hilarious to me, even after hearing it for years now, every time one of these supposedly great thinkers of the right talk about how 'authoritarianism' is bad, and then turn around and defend heirarchy. Especially when, as Peterson does, they claim to argue from a position of authority."
"Even though I disagree, I do consider your points to be well-articulated, humorous and logical. However no matter Peterson's fallacies I believe that a conservative moralistically structured society is much more stable and produces overall more content and fulfilled individuals. Creating an extremely morally lenient liberal society causes dissatisfaction amongst the populus as can be seen nowadays. The people want and need more than just bread and circuses. Purely material hedonistic pleasures bring only short-term pleasures, long-term happiness is found in a stable hierarchically-structured morally sound environment, where not every whim of a person is immediately fulfilled lest they become spoiled, decadent and will not develop as individuals, but rather will stagnate by living only to fulfill their lowly base desires. (This is also a big drawback of our current consumerist capitalist system, which I never was a fan of.)   However stability is a good thing, individualism is also an amazing concept but even it has its boundaries - such as not allowing collectivist ideologies to suppress individualist principles themselves. You certainly should have a right to discuss your opinions, but forcing your collectivist policies into law is dangerous because it could suppress the very individualism that allowed them to exist and be freely discussed in the first place. Just like there are basic human rights, there should be a basic organization of society that cannot be changed or intruded upon by new-age notions, for stability, prosperity and peace in the future. Traditionalism is sticking to traditions that have proved themselves over the centuries and millennia of human civilization and they've worked for so long for a reason."
"Contra makes me question my sex"
"when you get a notification that contra posted a video AND its a JBP takedown....you drop everything"
"He does not carry an 'ethics of self help'. That is absurd. Orthodoxy is all about purity testing what people do, so the left does tell people what to do.  Compelled speech is in fact justified in Stalin's context with the same reasoning as C-16. Words beget prejudicial motivated violence or are themselves assaults of violence. This is a false violence for Trans activists  in as much as it was a hyperbolic claim for Stalin's political party, it was bad look for both.   It is hard not to see how Education is being supplanted by political ideology. Address Heterodox academy for more examples. He is against Deconstructionism and structuralism which he calls postmodernism, he is against all forms of epistemology, philosophies, economies, or frameworks of collectivism which he calls Marxism. Hence Postmodern Neo-Marxism.  'The West' is the effects both direct and indirect, of the Enlightenment movement coupled with liberalism and British common law, he uses it as short hand.  So, so many people on the left, refuse to address multi-variat analysis regarding hierarchical disparities and instead cudgel non-believers with pathetic examples of said nuanced disparities as direct examples of bigotry. Hope that straw man's glow is nice and warm for you."
"YES"
"I think an individualist can be both an individualist and oppose trans pronoun law on the grounds that it becomes mandated under law.  Personally i would do my best to refer to anybody the way they want to be but wouldnt support a law requireing me to do so. Particularly C-16 due to its vagueness"

"A Hbomb and a Contra video in the same week? This is amazing."
"In my eyes the only similarities between activists and marxists is the fixation on identity and a general swing to left wing economic policy.  And from an outside perspective they may seem one and the same. Obviously thats not true but at some level its an understandable mistake.  Obviously some people (and quite rightly in my eyes) have issues be both of these things but its not quite right to group them together because of that."

"I love you"
"I would push back on the marxist/postmodernist divide, your interpretation of the divide is just academic but normal people have no problem holding inconsistent beliefs. Just read the articles published in Berkeley's student journal where Antifa explained the reasoning behind the protest against Milo. Postmodernism to these people is not so much a philosophy as it is a tool used to undermine their opponent's ideas, however, it is used hypocritically as they will not subject their own beliefs to the same scrutiny.  And I think this really goes down to the biggest issue which is the distinction between what a tiny minority of people writing books think, and how those ideas are interpreted by the average student. It is trivial to find examples on reddit and twitter of people who believe what you claim 'nobody believes'.  And what the average people believe matters a lot more than the actual ideology, the immigrant who got his store window smashed by some confused edgy Antifa kid doesn't care about what some clown said in a book 50 years ago. What matters to him is that somebody smashed his window and cost him thousands of dollars in repairs and/or lost business."
"Robert Sapolsky on hierachy"
"You forgot disabled folks in you list of degenerates :3"
"Yes!"
"He's just a reactionary in every field he's present in. He can't teach psych because he doesn't know how to read a psych paper and understand what a correlational study is or how idk a prefrontal cortex and differing brain structure basically defeat any of his hierarchy ideas; and he can't teach politics or philosophy because his politics and philosophy are based on surface level ideas and reactions to being told that he's actually not smart. I think the left refuses to entertain him because their is nothing of value to entertain that someone else hasn't already done better than him. His self help as you said is just a bunch of common sense drivel that essentially copies every other self help book. There is no intellectual there, If he's an intellectual than every fucking college student is an intellectual."
"So THAT'S where the right is getting their sneering 'I don't subscribe to postmodernism' talking point. It seemingly popped up overnight, then was everywhere. The right is excellent at falling in line, adapting the same arguments and buzzwords, etc."

Also many many many people say that everything is because of modern patriarchy. They also literally say that everything racist sexist homophobic etc,because of said modern western patriarchal system."
"At first I was like 'not you too' about the Cathy Newman interview. It's not her fault Jordan Peterson sounds like he's saying those things she thought he was saying. I'm glad you cleared that up towards the end.   That said, you went easy on him. Didn't even scratch the surface of his bullshit."
"I love Judith Butler so much."
"Well, this explains incoherent comments about Post-modern protests.' Like, what makes it postmodern? Does it exist in liminal space? Does it deconstruct itself?    Anyway, Peterson basically stole his critique of postmodernism from non-Marxist leftist Nom Chompsky , but inverted the conclusion. Perterson says that post-midernism is destructive to wetern civilization, while Chomsky dislikes it because it does not chalenge the currrent power structure enough."

"JBP's term 'postmodern neomarxism' always felt like another, equally nonsensical way of saying 'SJW' and I am much less clever than Contra. I knew nothing about the definitions of 'marxism' and 'postmodernism'.  Does that mean JBP is, in intellectual terms, full of nothing but hot air?"
"YESYESYES!!! Before I even watch this, I'm excited. This video needed to be made. I find it crazy that Peterson is on the sunshine list in Canada (ppl in the public sector who make $100,000 plus per year) but yet people still give him $40,000 a month (or more now) on Patreon. Just...why?!"

"Betwixt ladies and gentlemen? Don't mind if I do."
"Why does Peterson sound like a text to speech program"
"I vote for cake!"
"I'm a Christian and Peterson does push some very specific kinds of Protestant moral thought that I learned all about in private school in junior high. He's actually not very popular in Christian circles, weirdly enough. Probably because a lot of Christian circles have either become entrenched in identity politics of a different kind ('Christians are being discriminated against, I swear!') or ignore the existence of any real social conflict in favor of pushing a very vague and plushy 'loving God' who acts like a cool youth pastor. So because a huge portion of modern Christianity (at least in America) is either apolitical or trying to protect their social identity and standing (both of which are actions of a group that is in power and afraid to lose it), Peterson hasn't really found an audience there. He probably will find that audience as soon as he comes out in favor of some Christian pet issue like the historicity of Jesus or taxation of churches or something."

"You touched on the central contradiction of Peterson's ideas. On one hand he is very much a traditionalist with traditional morality. On the other hand he uses 'redpill' evolutionary behaviorist ideas when it suits him. This is the issue. To understand Peterson don't just listen to what he is saying. You have to, quite frankly, look at his motivations for why he is saying it. Like all traditionalists/old school conservatives, he essentially believes in the superiority of the white (yes its racial) system that has been under assault since the 1960s. Post-modernism to him is a repudiation of a morally superior conservative order.  The contradiction comes in with the lobster brains. He falls back on evo psyche when he can't ignore the obvious immoral acts and systems that were in place in the traditional order. When the slavery and sexism and exploitation of the old order comes up, morality fades from his philosophy and hardwired lobster brains rises to the surface. Really he's no different from rightwing sophists like Tucker Carlson and the godfather of rightwing intellectual bullshit, William F Buckley."

"thanks for the nails tip :D"
"With all those PhDs and books and papers... its all a wonderful guise for being a bigot, without using the same old dog-whistles. Jordan Peterson is the best representation of the anti-intellectual movement's intellectual."
"Peterson's rhetorical strategy is weirdly the mirror image of the alt-right. Instead of always playing offense, he always plays defense. If you stay back, he uses hadouken. If you approach, he uses shouryuken. He never takes a risk and uses Hurricane Kick. He never says things that are falsifiable or attackable. He refuses to have a dialogue.  I have been playing too much Street Fighter, yes."
"Re: 15:45 (and 17:00) It's possible that a majority of those whom others would identify as 'post-modern' (or who'd themselves identify that way) do not accept (or aren't even aware of) this central tenet (i.e., that 'there can be no grand narratives'). In fact, it's probable.   Academic whateverism and real-world whateverism are always different things (e.g., any coffee-shop feminist and Andrea Dworkin are as different as can be, and the former might know nothing of the latter).   Re: 17:45 'Why does everyone think that Identity Politics is post-modern? There's nothing post-modern about it.' Because nobody knows what words mean anymore, because academia has failed everyone.   Re: 19:35 'There are sophisticated debates about this going on within leftist academia.' Well there'd damn well better be. Because from the outside, it just seems like everybody's jerking each other off in mansions bought with grant money. This, while confusing edicts are sent to the outside society about how people are supposed to conduct themselves.   If 2016 taught anybody anything, it's that there are multiple dialects of American English not distinguished by pronunciations, constructions, or vocabulary, but by semantic interpretations alone."
"Contra, I love you."
"Flawless and beautiful!"

"Well I thought your video was humorous. I don't agree with anything you say, but you're funny. Jordan Peterson and you should have a debate. At least you could make it a comic debate. As far as the ideas that Peterson espouses being dangerous to you, I think you're wrong. Yes I agree that the postmodern neo-marxist ideas being taught on college campuses does pose a rel threat to American freedom. Such as the threat to free speech, self protection, pretty much all civil liberties. Western judeo-christian ethics are where the ideas of individual freedoms are derived and our constitutional freedoms are derived. And yes marxism is dangerous as history demonstrates. And Peterson never said that the left made sense, on the contrary, they're are pretty crazy."
"Funnily enough, Peterson writes and speaks just like a stereotypical postmodernist: • _Dances around a particular topic without saying anything concrete_ • _Mixes academic jargon with vague and esoteric prose_ • _Dresses up trite truisms as if they're profound insights_  The above allows him (and postmodernists) to sound deep and enlightening to fans without actually saying much in the way of substance. And when called on saying something authoritarian, it allows him to claim the accuser misunderstood him.   For all his alleged veneration of the Enlightenment tradition, Peterson has more in common with Derrida than with Diderot."

"You know, had I been aware of the lobster queen a couple of years ago, I would have nominated her to be on the Canadian 10$ bill.   This was exceptional Contra. That little thing right leaning people seem to do; making descriptive claims and denying any inference. You can actually, logically, make a normative claim for them. This is technically not an ad hominem or strawman as it's an exception and forces clarification. I usually ask for intent and if they don't give it, then use abductive reasoning and tell them if they don't like it, to be clear in their motivations."
"Ironically, Jungian psychology and all the other esoteric things that Jordan Peterson talks about actually indicates that we are supposed to be progressing more toward a reintegration of the esoteric feminine principle back into the social structure. This is diametrically in opposition to Peterson's agenda to shift back toward the patriarchal. In fact, it is imperative that the esoteric feminine be reintegrated. An esoterically patriarchal society is only sustainable in so far as humanity is pre-industrial. When humanity enters the Industrial Age then it becomes imperative for the esoteric feminine to be allowed back into our collective consciousness or we become cancerous to the planet. The esoteric nature of the masculine principle is growth and transformation. But past a certain point that growth and transformation becomes a cancer to the planet.   This is why Feminism and other progressive movements have brandished themselves over the course over the past 100 years. On some level, we have intuitively realized that we are out of balance. So, many progressive causes work to achieve this balance. Unfortunately, there are many defenders of the patriarchy that believe that progressivism is a mistake and something unnatural. They are the ones unconsciously advocating creating a deeper disparity between the esoteric masculine and esoteric feminine. And if that imbalance reaches a certain point, it could spell disaster for the planet. The imbalance is already causing tons of destruction to the planet, wars, income inequality, gender inequality, rigidity with regard to gender role and sexuality, exploitation of women, children, and animals, and so much more. Jordan Peterson is the poster child for advocating for the exacerbation of this imbalance. And it's disturbing to me how unconscious he is and his followers are to these deeper structures. So, even though progressives aren't usually aware of why their viewpoints work out better on deeper levels, their views are intuitively more in alignment with the shifts that are occurring in the system of humanity. Jordan Peterson and all others advocating for reaffirming patriarchal values are out of alignment with the shifts."
"What I hear when I hear 'Postmodern neomarxism' is probs the right wing view that people have to have meaning in life. Postmodern people have no meaning since they are smart enough to realise everything is dumb and pointless. The marxism means viewing people as distinct social and class groups. So what you have when he describes that is someone who thinks there is no inherent meaning to anything and view the world in terms of groups and collectives. Right wing people often use some sort of non-existing thing to justify why they wake up in the morning. Cause god, my family, for humanity etc etc... They view the left as people without cause for their actions. Combine that with viewing the world as groups that should all be equal and you have people campaigning for the right for a corporation to sell a 'female viagra' that gets women turned on enough to orgasm but the problem is its super inefficient and knocks you out cold when mixed with alcohol. Basically he's saying people who don't think before they act for good intentions will be the end of us. Partly I can agree. The left should emphasise things like empathy and efficiency so their goals have somewhat tangible anchor points."

"I don't like the characterization of anarchism as being against 'unjust' hierarchies as this makes it appear less radical than it really is. Every ideology out there will justify some hierarchies and reject others, but anarchism is the only one which rejects the subversion of creature to creature per se. I think it's more effective to say that anarchists are against domination - in the weberian sense - than against hierarchy or authority, as each of these have very ambiguous meanings. The just vs unjust authority/hierarchy argument is really just a way to muddle the distinction between domination and natural differences, making it difficult to actually support. It suggests that some subversion is ok while others are not, which is a fundamental distraction from the actual insight of anarchism."
"Pausing the video at 5:38 because this is a classic ContraPoints moment."

"I have 2 comments.  One for you as a person (<3 you) and one for this video specifically.  Video first:  As always you've created a great video with great points in a well thought out and easy to understand format.  Keep doing the great work! :)  You personally:  I've been a long time follower, but I rarely comment.  Just wanted to say how awesome it is to see you really coming into your own.  I don't know if this is obvious to everyone, but to me it seems you are very clearly getting more and more comfortable in your skin and with yourself.  You seem happy (or at least happier) and healthy (or at least healthier) and I love it!

"Your interpretation of the lobster issue is incredibly uncharitable.   His point (as I read it) is simply that hierarchy in terms of wealth is inevitable, even given no structural bias. This is fairly incontrovertible, unless you think that structural bias exists among aquatic crustaceans. Thus, the point that follows is that even following the removal of structural bias, one would still expect to see hierarchy and inequality of wealth. This is not, as far as I can see, commonly acknowledged by many on the left, and the expectation appears to be the removal of inequality, rather than merely the removal of structural biases."
"it’s rare to find someone who has even a passing understanding of anarchism who isn’t an anarchist. thanks for that"
"Peterson has only one real talent and that's selling books. His philosophy is a hodgepodge designed to appeal to his consumer base of white dude pseudophillosophers. He's Dr. Phil for boys. He doesn't actually want anything except the steady stream of money and trim that he's already got going. He deludes himself into thinking that he's doing my job,but he's woefully underqualified and only a liability to those who would like to see the Left make peace with masculinity and find some unity. What he so keenly fails to comprehend while he's scoring impressionable coeds who think they finally found a smart dick is that any effective advocacy for men's rights or social unity/effectiveness has to involve women,cis or trans."

"I go out of my way to find opposing political opinions and subscribe to them all in an attempt to listen to as many perspectives as possible.  The only way reason will prevail is if good arguments are challenged.  So my hat of to you for doing just that.  I don't think you did a perfect job of representing JP's view though. (Not that Jp's description of the 'postmodern neo-marxist is all togheter very accurate either)  Petersons main point is that the moderate left has not disowned the radical left, and that the political climate is turning into tribalism. The best andidote against that is individualism, according to Jordan Peterson. I happen to agree with that.  But i subscribe to you for a reason. I respect and understand your opinion."

"Peterson seems to advocate 'feels over reals' too when he talks about metaphorical truth being 'truthful enough' for human survival and scientific truth being irrelevant (I saw it somewhere on YouTubes). He has a point, though the idea of leaning towards 'God did it' being good enough for some and not others bugs me; it sounds elitist, let the great unwashed have their beliefs. As he would have it 'Feels over reals' is functional. Pfft fuck that Thatcherist, traditionalist crap. This is Post-Modernity, we all (kind of) have access to information:- to 'reals' mother fucker."

"I like to hear both sides, too bad I cant get my time back for this"
"Such an enlightening video (so to say)! Thanks, Natalie! <3"
"I think when Peterson talks about Postmodern-neomarxism as a 'slight of hand' he means that many of them used to be Stalinists and Maoists and simply switched their veneer after the Gulag Archipelago was published. Chomsky made a similar point when asked about the Postmodern critique of science."
"I love you."
"Nice!"
"I WAS JUST THINKING HOW GREAT A CONTRA VIDEO ABOUT JORDAN PETERSON WOULD BE YESTERDAY AND NOW IT’S HERE"
"A triumphant return to form!"
"What Jordan Peterson does is state a very basic truth then draw demented conclusions from it. It’s a clever little trick. You state something controversial in the form a question then state an obvious truth to support it.  The points he tries to make are parlor tricks to fool idiots. Peterson is an example of what happens when a person finds himself being praised by the extreme right wing, and then panders to them when he realizes he can profit from it, thus sliding further into fringe arguments himself. Make no mistake Peterson has an agenda he hides it behind the idea of he is only asking questions.  He has figured out how to turn the rage of young mostly white men into money, so it's in his best interest to stoke the fires. He pretends to not know what he is doing then after he provokes an attack his followers just donate more money to the tenured professor who already makes over $175,000 a year. Con Artist comes to mind.....  He's making around $750k a year through patreon  J. Peterson - 'Rules based systems don't work.' Also Jordan Peterson, 'Summary of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan B. Peterson'   95% of his fans are Ben Shapiro sycophants that cant stop crying about 'Da S-Jay-DubYAS'. Every single issue he and his cult go off on is some overblown bullshiat that they use for an excuse to be the pieces of shiat they are. His cult is made up of idiots that got friendzoned to death and cant deal with societal progress of any kind. They have gone full “get off my lawn” grampa mode before they hit 30. His go to whine is over the 'radical left'. Another overblown boogieman used to perpetuate the “both sides are bad” myth. Peterson should be disregarded as easily as flat-earthers."
"Literally until you pulled the thing with his face on it into the tub, for some reason I was convinced it was H. Bomberguy wearing that paper cutout as a mask."
"It literally takes 45 seconds of Googling to figure out that Postmodern Neo-Marxist is an incoherent term. It's like calling someone an Authoritarian Anarchist or a Neo-Femenist Traditionalist. Those terms only make sense if you're using them as a synonym for 'the bad people I don't like.'"
"I'm pretty sure I saw ContraPoints dress as Razorfist on the street a few days ago. I was disappoint to find her running away after I noticed her. Probably my fault for looking a little like a young JP or maybe they were having a special at Grand Central or some place in the Inner Harbor."
"Oh god the amount of sexual intimidation im experiencing is probably against TOS"
"What eyeshadows are you using? They look very pretty!"
"Magnificent."
"Hilarious bit with the mannequin Contra. But once again I have some disagreements. Peterson has repeatedly addressed his view of the paradoxical union of postmodernists and marxists. If anything you should criticize Steven Hicks’ analysis, which is what Peterson likes to use as reference. I was surprised you failed to mention this."
"That interview with Peterson played at around the 2:10 mark is not from the BBC. It is from Channel Four."

"A 'Jungian' psychologist who doesn't actually understand archetypes. He says that femininity has always been associated with chaos in western culture, which is oversimplified. The example I can give is the Victorian image of the domestic goddess who creates solace to her husband. This also does not properly address archetypes as demonstrated by the stories of: Amatseratsu, who is functionally the virgin queen of the Shinto pantheon; White Buffalo Calf Woman who created civilization; and Lady Demeter who has the title of law bringer."

"Great take! Also holy shit at that end credit scene. Your work is really paying off if conservatives are watching you and understanding the viewpoints in an agreeable way."
"The problem with conflating the lobster claim by saying is justifies any hierarchy is false. When he talks about natural hierarchy he does so to talk about a system with absolute freedom of opportunity. In places where people are free to choose the path that best suites them you end up with a society that contains natural hierarchy based off certain groups interests (women and men usually). A monarchy cannot be a natural hierarchy because people do not start with the same opportunity. Peterson argues that a society should offer the same opportunity but that desiring an equal outcome is against nature, and that by constructing laws and systems to prevent disparity in outcome necessarily oppresses people and removes freedom of opportunity."
"Clock me Amadeus 😂"
"Saying 'there is no feature of SJW ideology that is meaningfully non-Western' seems deliberately obtuse- progressivism often frames *itself* as being in opposition to Western tradition (regardless of the fact it's part of that tradition), by constantly associating the racism, sexism, etc that it opposes with Western tradition (in fact Contra does that in this video). And also by being much more ready to overlook the racism, sexism, etc in non-Western cultures. And progressivism often does exactly what Contra accuses Peterson of, and completely ignores  the fact that intellectual opposition to racism, sexism, etc was very much a product of the Western tradition. Shit, 'Western society' is progressivism's stock boogeyman, just like 'Pomo neo-marxism' is for Peterson.  I agree that Peterson is a scaremonger, and borderline disengenuous, but that's all the more reason to not use disengenuous arguments against him. The man has no shortage of faults, but you can't blame him for believing what your own movement tells him."
"This is the most hilarious thing I've seen in ages, it also made me seriously consider the merits of post modernism, and since I'm kind of a marxist, and definitely a collectivist/intersectonalist sjw, though I prefer social justice battle mage to warrior, I am basically now a living embodiment of the self conflicting strawman Peterson has construed. Which pleases me to no end."
"Peterson reminds me of myself when I was 19 and a blowhard, outspoken conservative who prided myself on upsetting people with my ideas."

"The whole 'post-something' way of terming things is just ludicrous to begin with.  Oh, I have this new thing!  What shall I call it?  Is it a pineapple?  No?  Then I shall call it a not-pineapple!

"This is such a fascinating video. I have a head cold and am a little out of it, so please be patient with my response to this. I love your work, Contra, and I hope you keep making content this good. I've loved all of your recent work. As someone who is a big fan of Peterson's, I appreciate that you seem to be treating what he says with respect, and you don't seem to be speaking in bad faith. But I think you're wrong about some things. For example, you state regarding the Cathy Newman interview that he creates a trap where you either have to find yourself arguing against an obviously true statement, or you have to guess at what he's implying by making the statement. But why? Why not just, I don't know, open-endedly ask him to elaborate?  Why do you figure that you have to either argue with something you also believe is obvious, or spend your time speculating about what the person you're having a conversation with meant about something? I mean he was right there in front of her. She doesn't have to guess at what he meant. The better response to him mentioning that there are obvious biological differences between men and women in a conversation regarding the disproportionate ratio of men to women CEOs would be 'and what connection do you see between those biological differences and this outcome we've seen in society?' And he likely would've answered something along the lines of 'well, different kinds of people make different kinds of decisions and so they end up in different kinds of positions'. And, whether you agree with him or not, this is a reasonable answer consistent with other things he's said, and so it would be perfectly reasonable to then move onto the next question. And boom - neither of them come out looking stupid, Newman does her job having Peterson explain what it is he believes, and the viewer can walk away from that evaluating it for themselves. I don't see what would be so wrong with that. And your problem with Peterson's lobster thing comes off as strange to me. You're arguing that he's straw-manning by responding to an argument that 'no one makes', but isn't it possible that he's responding to an argument that SOME people make, and it just doesn't happen to be a response to something you would argue yourself? I mean the lobster comparison wasn't a comparison he was using in regards to any specific argument any specific person was making, it was simply in response to the view that some people hold which states that hierarchies are all socially constructed. If what he's saying doesn't contradict anything you think, or any argument you've heard, why assume it's a straw-man? It's not like he was attributing this argument to anyone in particular. He just said that it is factually an idea out there which people have said. Why not just accept that it's a response to something that's of no concern to you? Why insist that no one is making the argument that natural hierarchies don't exist? I've personally been in conversations with people who have out-right stated that they don't believe that hierarchies exist naturally, that they're all socially constructed. Are you going to tell those people that they don't actually believe that? Or me that I haven't actually heard someone say that? Or Peterson that because you haven't heard someone say that, he shouldn't be responding to the argument? Just some food for thought. If you respond to this, I'd appreciate it. But I understand if you don't. Wish you the best."
"contra undermines her argumentative skills so much like of course her channel is a lot of preaching to the left but when she describes the squabbles the left has between sjws and marxists it really makes me think about our intersections and our differences with even the most far right people. this is a great skill to have and tbh i feel like i have been able yo articulate my ideas and thoughts way better since viewing this channel :)"

"Another interesting element of Peterson's rhetoric which is not covered in this video (which focuses mostly on his often-incoherent politics and philosophy) is his relationship with the harder sciences. Sometimes the uncontroversial fact leading into a controversial opinion is actually only uncontroversial because few journalists are familiar with the random studies he likes to bring up, so they can't explain to him why he is incredibly wrong. I don't have the clip off the top of my head, but there's one where he talks about some hormonal similarity between lobsters (his favorite, I guess) and humans and uses it to justify something related to the hierarchy thing covered in this video, but an actual biologist swoops in to explain how terrible the comparison is.

"THE QUEEN IS DEAD: GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!  Genius. Love it. I'm glad that Derrida and Deleuze didn't even get a simulacrum of a mention. But for the sake of rhizome, whatever happened to Baudrillard and Barthes?"
"The way PoMo is used to justify socialism and identity politics is something like 'truth and justice are really just power games, so let's forget about them and just try to balance out the power'. I see this type of argument often in papers and articles, so the connection is real. I don't know if there is an organized conspiracy woven through history, but it does seem that Critical Theory is ironically driving many people to just give up on critical thought, and surrender to emotion and coercion."

"Great video as always but there seems to be a minor misconception about his intentions. He’s constantly talking harshly about the right wing extremists and constantly receiving letters from people who left the far right and found meaning in their life through his work. He’s done more to get people out of radicalization than anyone else I can think of. He’s clearly on the side of fixing inequality he’s just worried about the people who think they can fix that complicated problem with simple solutions.   He’s even stated before that he’s for universal basic income and he’s in favor of Canada’s health care system over America’s. People have this misconception that he’s against post modernism and Marxism but he’s also stated many times that both have produced insightful and true conclusions but the actions as a consequence of those conclusions is his main concern. He’s not against the philosophies, he’s against the people who think they can impose their philosophy on behalf of people for the “greater good”. He’s even criticized Christianity and religion in general for doing this. He’s a Christian as a philosophical position but not from some moral absolutist dogma.   I disagree with him on some of his problems with Post Modernism because I love Foucault and I identify with a lot of post modern philosophy, but overall I still think Peterson is a valuable voice that gets written off too quickly by certain types of people. I like Chomsky, Foucault, Derrida, Zizek, Nietzsche, and Peterson. I think all of their voices are valuable in their own ways. I’m more inline with the Chomsky syndicalist ballpark of political thought but I still find Peterson’s work worthwhile. Theres this condescending gut reaction from some to label him a charlatan “pseudo intellectual”. Just using that term is condescending and elitist. You don’t get to decide who gets to discuss ideas and whether other people should find those ideas valuable. Out of many public intellectuals he comes off more sincere than many I can think of, I really believe the left is doing a disservice by writing him off.  Once again, excellent video even if I disagree with some of your conclusions."

"HELLO, DAVE"
"Great video, but your face could have used a few more jewels.  In seriousness though, you're charming and hilarious and brilliant as always, but I'm at a disadvantage with parsing this sort of high-level philosophical analysis because I have a hard time caring about the writings of old dead racists, and I definitely don't watch/read anything Jordan Peterson puts out. But I guess he's popular with the male youthsths? Maybe I'm out of touch. Maybe I should be reaching across the aisle more? But I can't really, considering those social groups make me fear for my life. So anyway, it's not that I dislike philosophy in general, but I personally would have probably benefitted more from a 'who is Jordan Peterson and why should we care' style video, but maybe the one you made is the one the world needs.  That being said, I appreciate your hilarity and gorgeousness and the fact that you're clearly a genius. GENIUS I SAY.  **untwists your bathing suit strap** >,>;;"

"To be honest I was expecting hbomber guy  under the Peter mask 😁. What I don't get is that surely Peter Jordan should be smart enough to know better than to believe in such a thing as 'postmodern Marxism'. But I fear he's ether a sham or he's gotten high off his own supply."

"I am a Jordan Peterson fan, (I would even say he's help save my life (sort myself out)). When it comes to his ideas of politics, views of religion and non religion, I am merely a listener. I am a mere idiot who cannot choose who's right and who's wrong. Is Atheism or Christianity true? Communism or Capitalism? Pragmatism, materialism, post modernism.... I don't know the answers. Like I said... I'm a mere idiot. And every time I think I can see something sounds right, another thing comes along and says 'No, not correct' and then that sounds right, and then another thing debunks that. And the rabbit hole goes on forever. Of course there are things like Incels, White Nationalism, and Otherkin. That I look at and just can't take seriously.  But overall it's just all too fucking much to take in and find an answer. I find Dr. Peterson's views interesting and his ideas on sorting yourself out make sense to me. Especially for someone who wasn't taught those things at all and was more told that I am good as I am. I was told that a lot so I never had the idea in my head that I should still try to improve and wasn't encouraged to. He comes along and does which was something I needed.  I liked the video though and I'm glad it wasn't filled with vitriol and pissy vinegar that many of the other video responses of his ideas come out."

"ok so wait...being trans and a fan of Stalin I have to ask...How exactly will defending trans rights lead to Stalinism? Also, more over on to Stalinism; Would Stalinism really be bad if it were performed by a persons who isn't Stalin? What if the all-mighty watching over us leader was moral and kind? Would totalitarianism work if the leader were, say,...Oprah? Like diversified power hasn't done us very much good, if anything it's caused significant delays in urgently needed changes and, through an effort of unity, enabled conservatives to have a seat at the same discussion table as modern day progressives, leftists, and anarchists (assuming McCarthyism left any around)., thus degrading our society.   To add to my argument, the USSR was right on many issues we are faced with today: free national healthcare, free national education including college, free and guaranteed housing, a guaranteed job earning a livable wage, non-interventionism, a unified national identity that didn't involve killing foreigners, a strong but affordable military, a stable economy, significantly less corruption (comparatively), quality goods and services, a positive reputation in the international community, and most of all, workers rights.   All of that being said, along with the fact that 3 quarters of Russia want the USSR back according to a 2015ish study, why not go for Stalinism?"

He's from the communist utopia of Canada.  Also, I never read all of one of Derrida's books, but my favorite takeaway concept that he talked about is writing under erasure. Yeah, that wasn't his, but that's where I learned it."
"I cant help but love this sassy robot version of Peterson."
"Hume's racist! What did he say?"
"Firstly, I wanna say that I fairly enjoyed this video, you spelled out some of points about JP's philosophy, which are quite questionable, but it's hard to articulate, what is really questionable, because of his rhetorical strategies. The only bit of criticism I have is the thing about Peterson's 'cultural neo-Marxists' - I think he refers to those far radical left, on which you did video yourself (even though their number is probably far less, than he presents it to be)."
"I've seen a lot of JP and have even liked quite a bit of what he says (especially his psychology lectures), and I think your critique was quite fair and good when it comes to JP's politics and philosophy. My one nitpick of your video is to point out that Peterson is fully aware of the conflict between postmodern philosophy and Marxism. Quote from Peterson: '... It's not obvious by any stretch of the imagination why postmodernism and [Marxism] would be aligned, because postmodernism is an anti-grand-narrative philosophical movement, and Marxism is a grand narrative, and so the fact that those two things seem to exist in the same space definitely needs some explanation' (Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfH8IG7Awk0)   IIRC, he goes on later in that lecture to explain what he sees as the abuse of postmodern philosophy by today's Marxists in terms of Postmodernism's critique of grand narratives to dismantle traditional aspects of society for potentially subversive or unjust reasons. Now, I think you are right in that this is far less prevalent than what JP sees. I think I agree it's more that there are the Postmodern leftists, and there are the Marxist leftists, and JP sees them as both extreme and thus somehow aligned when in fact they are squabbling among themselves as much as they are yelling at everyone else."
"You are literally so good at makeup tho"
"A minute in and you're hitting me with Guerrilla Girls references? Sign me the frell up!"

"As always, your points are well thought out and the presentation is superb!  I am quite frustrated with your mischaracterization of hierarchy concerns on the far Left; it most certainly is commonplace to believe that all powerstructures should be dismantled that people may live in true, classless equality. It is, of course, not thought by the intellectual leaders on the far Left, but by the common degenerate. They do not see the bigger picture in a clear way and are all highly primed to create a 'classless egalitarian Utopia' through dismantling the patriarchy. This is what concerns Dr. Petersen; it is fertile ground for authoritarian regimes to sprout. Regimes led by those cognizant Leftist intellectuals spouting 'equality' rhetoric all the while knowing it is a myth. We've seen it before. It's a valid concern."

"I'd love to hang out with you on a warm summer day drinking mint juleps on the porch of a painted lady. You'd have to make the drinks though, your much better at muddling.   Boosh pow pow  zing ....walked that one all the way in.  I love your videos, I ready do. You're smart, very funny, striking in your beauty, and a master crafter of nigh videos and thought.  Compliments not withstanding,  the narratives you weave as beautiful, funny, and intellectual as they are seem devoid of realistic perspective at times. I unfortunately can't cite the video but you most definitely  do have a video in which you put forward   the concept that  the political centered in thi country are just kind of wishywashy bumkins being pulled to one aode or tye other by the master tacticians of the or the right. The run through was the nature of the middle is to be persuaded and the nature of the left or right is to persuade.   I think some your breaking down of lobster mans postmodern neo marxist labeling is accurate when dealing with its component parts it ignored the intention and expression of the whole. Sometimes words or phrases are used inside of new contexts that break from their traditional meaning.  That's basically it  Wanted to make a muddle joke and subconsciously suggest that me you and mint juleps should be a thing.   Goodbye now  Tah tah"
"This is one of the flimsiest arguments you’ve made. Which makes sense because you’re attempting to argue against someone who has made largely impenetrable arguments.   What’s really bizarre is that you dismiss a movement because...people in HR departments don’t believe in said movement? That’s...that’s the totality of it? It seems like the entire video was really just an attempt to compare Peterson to Nazis. Did you just ignore that reality while editing this video? lol   Also, you’ve pretty egregiously misdefined identity politics. Identity politics is a means of achieving a sexist, racist agenda. It doesn’t seek equality by any measure, it seeks for power to be taken away from one class of people and given to another in the pursuit of supposed *equity of outcome*. But the only way that equity can come about is if straight, white males are purposely and aggressively shut down and crippled in their pursuits. That is *literally* the only way you reach equity of outcome.   Even in your definition you say —rights? What rights? Equality? What equality? Visibility? Minorities and women are OVERREPRESENTED in every position of media influence. All people have equal rights based on sex and race and sexuality. Women are overrepresented in college degrees just like Asians make the most money in America.   Identity politics argues for the oppression of one group over another because identity politics argues for *equity of outcome*."

"the debate with Cathy Newman was on Channel 4 not BBC. Don't you know, what Neo-Marxism is? ;D You know, e.g. Horkheimer and Adorno, Critical Theorie, frankfurt school.

"The only thing that makes me more uncomfortable than Peterson himself is an unnervingly believable imitation of him in a bath with what I presume to be Wolf's milk being poured over his face.  Great video as always, a really solid breakdown of the failings of those that tried to debate or argue with him. It astounds me he became so popular when he uses so many words, justifications and anecdotes to say absolutely nothing."
"That isn't a BBC interview... It is Channel 4"
"ah good old contra. Making the normal... uncomfortably sexual... Well done lol"
"PCP?  All us cool kids that smoke it  call it sherm or yuk yuk Poser!"
"Contra, you are really smart and understand these issues much better than other leftists. There's a difference between 'protecting trans human rights' and forcing people to use certain pronouns. Forcing others to use certain words is not a human right. I'm not a huge Peterson fan but there's nothing wrong with what he says. It's basic conservative talking points. That's pretty much it.  There is a very clear anti white(especially white male) bias in the media, entertainment industry and academia. I'm sure you've seen all the 'resolutions for white men' 'white people stop ruining X' or 'dismantle whiteness'  articles. Do you not expect a reaction from us? Do you really think we are all just going to roll over and die when it wouldn't be acceptable to write articles like that about any other group? Then we are gas lit with responses like 'oh look at their 'white fragility.'' It's bullshit. No one will ever give credit for white men inventing countless physical things and concepts(like human rights!), but we all are expected to feel guilt and shame for things white people did a 100+ years ago. When every other race/culture did the same terrible things at one point in history."

"LOL the clip at the end...Its amazing that Rubin has not asked you on to his show yet...one day i think will."
"I agree with almost all of the criticism directed at Peterson. However, there are a couple of points I take issue with. Firstly, Peterson has actually addressed the contradiction between post-modernism and Marxism.  My interpretation of his ideas is that he considers the ideology of the left to be a clusterfuck of contradictions rather than a unified clear world view. And I would go even further and say that he accuses the left of embracing ideology without even knowing it.  Secondly, with regards to his 'rhetorical trick' of saying something obvious and implying something controversial, it seems to me you presented a false dichotomy of the available responses. Either you challenge the obviously true statement or you ascribe him an opinion he seems to have implied. You could just ask a more specific follow up such as: 'What biological differences between men and women are relevant for a discussion about the pay gap?'  Love your content!"

"Yes... yes, yes!"
"I like your old stuff, but you don’t like your old stuff.Can I close my eyes and listen to your old stuff?"
"I’m a big fan of the bucko. But I don’t think his ideas should be interpreted as being new and important, but constant and important. The bible says pretty self-evident stuff, but it’s foundational. He’s trying to re-establish that and I do agree with him about the whole ‘conspiracy’ aspect. Not so much the extreme way he articulates it, but I don’t think that’s reason to dismiss it altogether. His use of words is kind of brazen, but his points are still valid. And what with this ‘post-modernism’ being the flavour of the day and becoming institutional in some sense and these activists having as much understanding of the concepts as JBP, I think it worth taking a humble take on what he says. That being said, politics is usually a s**t show. I know it’s hard to properly understand what he means, but it’s all in the context of a very chaotic time. We’re all trying to make sense of things and that’s why he’s an attractive prospect, cos he’s doing it better than anyone else imo. At the very least he’s a good and worthy voice to listen to. Also, I do agree that Pomo is part of the tradition and should be treated as such."

"Contra. Mind my nitpick, it was the Channel 4 News, not the BBC, I know, I know. Great fan of your videos btw."
"Dr. Layman covered post-modernism pretty well when he made his videos smashing Armoured Skeptic to bits for his video on Postmodernism (that you referenced in the video). Wondering if you've seen that video? It's very well done."
"Truly the next Nelson Mandela"
"I relate to your feelings on Hume Is that identity politics or post-modernism? Regardless it's marxist."
"It always amazes me when I tell Peterson's fans that he's a Christian who loves his pseudo science. Like... you guys (and I mean men) do get that much of his stuff is built on Christianity? Which is why I'm truly shocked he's been so accepted by the centrist Atheist community. His higher power stuff is straight out of the Christian conversion handbook, his love for DNA being 'intelligent machines', and his love for Deepak Chopra Quantum Spiritualism. But hey, what do I know? I'm just another bearded white guy on the internet.   Also, fuck Hume, and fuck Derrida. You're absolutely right. Derrida's deconstructuralism did not need 3000 pages to explain! A goddamn year wasted on you Derrida.... a goddamn year..."
"Haven't watched yet but the notification just came up and having seen the title it's like a mini Christmas haha"
"I must be obsessed with you because I always get a notif about your new videos when I'm already watching one of your vids. Nice work as always, Contra!"
"'I knew that already. I learned it at the AA meetings I refused to go to.' Yep. Me too. They were good for something, lol."
"Trying to watch this at my University's library is mostly my fault."
"Comrades! Prepare the Gulags and get into the Albanian Bunkers.  The Salt-Right is coming...."
"I was hoping for this video. JBP needs a talking to."
"16:35 'HR deparments that care about diversity' yea, bacause 'caring about diversity' will defientely not lead into not being accepted into a job position because of their skin color or gender just to appese the diversity gods. And silly me thought that we should hire people based on their merin, not on their race. You know, the 'judge people by their character, not by the color of their skin' thing?"
"YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF MAKEUP NOW OH MY GOSH"
"Didn't hear the start of the video, too busy standing for the national anthem. Edit: additional standing at about 23:00 mins"
"I've been waiting my whole life for this"
"Why does everybody keep talking about this Jordan Peterson guy? He's not that smart and the ideas that he has proposed are less than 'impressive'. Whenever I criticized him his basement dwelling fedora wearing goons gang up on me. It's as if they can't think for themselves."
"Peterson is a fascist."
"You should definitely have a conversation with him. That would be very interesting to hear."
"I keep having dreams where my cat drops it's tail like a lizard.  WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!?!?"
"8:12- My life."
"It's a small nit pick, but the BBC is our state funded TV service, like our PBS. They make mistakes but it's important to me to protect them. That interview was a TV Channel called Channel 4, not the BBC."
"Sometime i feel like you and Hbomb are in some kind of weird contest about trying to make the weirdest imagery possible and i feel like ti might lead to the end of the world to be frank."
"Don't want to diss lady contrapoints but cathy newman is a journalist for channel four, not the bbc, anyway you look gorgeous in period costume, so glad to see you back (it feels like the last video come out a good while ago)"
"The thirst is outlandish jesus Christ."
"Oh my god, I have been rewatching all of your videos today, so this really got released at the perfect time!"
"marx and engels labeled as 'our boys' i'm gonna fucking shit"
"I want to watch your videos because you do have some good points but I can't stand watching 15 minutes of video padded with 15 minutes of fat."
"god ok I've been waiting for this since my boyfriend started talking about dragons of chaos but I gotta say GOD YOU LOOK SO HO T STEP ON ME"
"Lady Foppington <3_<3."
"I love you. This made my wine-filled evening so much better."
":')"
"I love the bougie cosplay"
"(GRABS POPCORN) I'm ready"
"You are so damn weird, but on point at the same time. I approve. Edit: thanks for the Margaret Mead shout out"
"How long til the lobster cult finds this video?"
"😭😭😭😭 It's not fair my whitness is not enough anymore. Jordan Peterson= A snake oil salesman by any other name is still a snake oil salesman."
"Jordan Peterson reminds me of Deepak Chopra. Did you see Matt Dillahunty clean his clock?"
"YAAAAAAASSSSS"
"This is art."
"Natalie, you look absolutely BREATHTAKING in this video. I love this video. I love the Peterson mannequin. I love you."
"THIS IS MY DREAM COME TRUE"
"I love this video, I don’t know how to express my adoration for this video."
"i think how you twist things to fit your purpose is priceless ..."
"'Just a trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda'.  Yes, the lifelong clinical psychologist who has spent most of his time trying to help people and students that will grow up to help other people, just wants to push a political agenda.  Why do people bother to listen past that?  Idiot."
"MICHEL FAUXCOUP"
"12 minutes after release, according to Youtube, this has so many comments, many from 12 hours ago. I'm so confused. ."
"OMG I soooo waited for this"
"7:00 lol, except JP don't try to put his rules into state-enforced law (if he did, I would oppose it). Do you see the difference?"
"d-did you rape peterson in this video?"
"i wanna be just like you except less pretentious and gay(?)"
"Idk of this is mean but your voice kinda sounds like Jordan Peterson’s lol"
"It’s lit"
"Jordan Peterson is right"
"6:30 How does JP target gender equality and cilil right? You don't have the right to be called your prefered pronoun."
"Holy shit Contra you in the Georgian dress and giant hair is just... S W E A T S"
"Im just so happy 😁 thank you contra 😘"
"J. Peterson video, eh?  Hoop, there it is.  Didn't have anything better to do for the next half hour."
"(REFERENCE TO LADY LIBERTY BEING A RIP OFF OF GOD SAVE THE QUEEN REMOVED)  peter and greg are too skinny and clean shaven to be daddies  And one final note, I am digging the inverse Elvira look you have going on from 9:50 onwards"
"Not sure if its for comedic purposes or not (in this case) but more often than not i see that the whole rise to fame incident of Jordan Peterson was more about free speech than anything else.  Misgendering someone is pretty shitty but making it a crime seems a bit excessive."
"Uh oh, I sense a backlash coming from giving Peterson some compliments."
"Yeah he’s a pretty smart guy 🐸👍"
"*FANGIRL SQUEEEEEEL*"
"This might be the best contra video yet"
"I love to think that you own several pieces of 18th century period wear."
"contra you're super smart but there's a lot of stuff you're jsut wrong about"
"4:10 Jordan Perterson is completely justified in characterizing progressive politics as 'totaliran and evil'. Take affirmitive action for example. BBC literally has job positions where they will openly discriminate between candidates based on race and sex, but it's somehow okay, because they discriminate agains white men.  State-sponsored (BBC is state funded) discrimmination is totaliran and evil."
"Oh yeah I've been waiting for this one"
"Glad to have you back. Keep up the great work ^_^"
"jordan peterson is THE boogie man"
"I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE"
"I can tell by the thumbnail that this is gonna be super weird and I'm so happy to see you doing the W E I R D shit that (hopefully) gets your passions INFLAMED! I'm so happy for you, Dark Momrade™"
"I've waited so long for this moment."
"Pordan Jeterson, imo"
"I’ve. Been. WAITING FOR THIS!!!!"
"Long to reign over us, God save the Queen!"
"Great video as always, your eyes look amazing! I always can’t wait for you and shaun to put out videos😀"
"Ouuuuh fuck yea"
"Ah that guy. I'd like to see him deep down in a well."
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH ❤️❤️💖💖💗💞💞💞💝💝💕💕💕💗💓💓❣️💘💖💕"
"Myself I shall adore!"
"Dont do this ;_; that fanbase is insane"
"So how much do you spend on costumes?"
"Was wondering which one of you would be the first to take on Peterson, couldn't be happier it's you"
"Praise be."
"sorry thought it was a Chanel Four Interview, not BBC"
"THANKS I LOVE IT ALREADY"
"NEW CONTRA"
"j peterson is a dipshit"
"How much of the patreon budget goes to wardrobe?  And if I include the comment 'For wardrobe' with a contribution, can that increase?"
"The V hand should be short on all fingers, tbh."
"IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO BLESS"
"YESSSSS"
"DAYYYUUUM HOMIE!! about time!!"
"I've SO needed this! ☺️  Edit- Minor correction:it was channel 4 not BBC."
"GOD IM SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR THIS"
"contra i love you"
"Oh heck yes finally"
"QUEEN"
"No wonder Jordan Peterson likes to talk about lobsters so much...he's a shellfish person.   I'll show myself out. Thanx. ❤️"
"I love that the bisexual manicure is catching on. Been keeping long nails on the left and short nails on the right for years.  I notice you've only kept a couple of nails short though. And that's fine. But you can't fist someone with just two short nails. For further degeneracy, I recommend going all short on your business hand."
"We are in lesbian with you!"
"I love the new revelation that you don't exist in some trans dimensional portal, but rather just have... really weird roommates."
"Troll: What do you think of Jordan Peterson and his gender pronoun free speech blablabla...? Elf: I agree with her."
"Anything that comes from Judaism or Christianity is inherently non western therefore Marxism and post modernism is non western."
"Some people at my uni in Sweden want to invite him, so I'm actually considering linking to this video on our fb page."
"I need to remember bisexual manicure if I ever grow my nails out."
"Omg, Sigmund Freud as 'Daddy'. So perfect."
"HOLY SHIT THE ENDING"
"𝒞𝓁𝑜𝒸𝓀 𝓂𝑒, 𝒜𝓂𝒶𝒹𝑒𝓊𝓈!"
"So I've been a bit out of the loop about this whole Jordan Peterson situation. So this was definitely useful for me.  I did enjoy the video, but if I might make a small criticism: While the degeneracy stuff is generally good fun and welcome in most videos, some of it feels a bit shoehorned-in for this one. Almost a bit checklist-y. That said, fun to see the current incarnation of Foppington! Same with the return of the milk bath."
"All hail The Lobster Queen!"
"'youthhss'"
"I'm four and a half minutes in and already absolutely loving this beyond words. God, Natalie, you're too good."
"Omg, I’m on the patron list! We appreciate your hard work, Nat and we support you. Also you look very pretty here and it’s making me feel super gay. :D"
"Tfw you join Patreon and just two days after a new video is here. I've been blessed~ Also, very good job deconstructing Peterson"
"Someone please show this to Jordan Peterson."
"28:17  Its happening!"
"Mopomoa when"
"Never thought I'd be jealous of a mannequin."
"The Undergrad Capitalism is evil gag! Yes!"
"The Superior Patreon Collective"
"'Nails? Is that all womanhood means to you?!'  '... Mhm.'  lmao, love you contra"
"Why do I find the 'beep-boop' noises that keep playing when the Jordan Peterson mannequin pops up so funny  WHYYYY  (Great video, by the way. :D)"
"Back with the milk baths I see!"
"Mommy <3"
"THE MARVEL POST-CREDITS SCENE WITH THE CLASSIC (ouija board?) STRINGS <3"
"'...mhm!'  oh no i've choked on my dinner"
"yeah i watched the video, it was good"
"This was maybe the best summary of modernism and post-modernism in philosophy I've ever heard, and I'm a grad student in the humanities and a card-carrying member of the Neo-Marxist Postmodernist Cabal! Awesome as always, will definitely be sharing :)   and of course:   🦐 🦐 🦐 GOD SAVE THE LOBSTER QUEEN 🦐 🦐 🦐"
"This one is such a beauty"
"26:13 Wait Divine was Marquis dessad this whole time?!?!?"
"@Contrapoints Thank you for this. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your work."
"the snipping acrylic lobster nails are inspired"
"God save our Lobster Queen!"
"come for the degeneracy, stay for the lobster queen single over the credits."
"'Hello, Dave' Geez I remember sending your videos to Dave on his Patreon months and months ago, since I think before the Free Speech pt 1 video. Could it happen ?"
"Pepe Silvia's been making the rounds!"
"'that goes way back to ancient times.....unf'   lmao"
"That Peterson face... It's... Too real..."
"I lost it at 'So much for the tolerant Jacobins!'"
"First! And holy sheez, Conta's about to hit 100k! Go go girl!"
