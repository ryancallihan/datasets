"Tag yourself. I’m the grape at 13:44"
"Why am I reminded of the One Direction video where it looks like you’re eating spaghetti with Zayn sksksksjd"
"This guy actually fears me ! His face has something terrfic !"
"Maybe before we answer the above question first we need to establish if the soul is real (and it's not. No serious. A thousand years from now people will still be debating theism but the jury is in on the idea of the soul. There's mountains of empirical evidence that sugest that we're simply our brains and nothing more. See: Matt Dillihunty and studies on split brain surgery). Unless she's simply using soul as a metaphor for mental health. In that case: I digress."
"I hopped back in time to see this, Natalie.  You may wince at your early videos, but this was damned good. I doubt Oscar Wilde came up with as many perversely quotable lines in one week as this little video has."
"Oooooh... the winter."
"Thankyou so much for existing contrapoints <3"
"I love how far she’s come in the past few years"
"Contra points: you can’t go past human consciousness   Joe Rogan: *kicks down door* HAVE YOU EVER TRIED DMT"
"Started watching as a suggestion from my ex-wife, and I'm pleased to see these well-spoken and quirky videos."
"'We as a society could make sex safer for women by ending rape culture and slut shaming and instituting all you can eat birth control'"
"Sometimes I think your channel is a clusterfuck of pretentious sjw nonsense and then you amaze me with your wit and intellect."
"'Muh sex bad uhhhhh how dare all these people live happy lives instead of waiting to die and then *probably* go to heaven uhhh I'm so mad but at least I am above these degenerates so I can feel better about myself '"
"i should try the classical music thing"
"Is being a delusuonist who believes in a higher being bad for your soul?"
"I feel like society conditions us to reject anything that's less than a romantic relationship on the grounds that being single is a personal failure. As a result, we appreciate casual sex and any romantic-adjacent connexion that isn't viable material for a traditional relationship a lot less than we should, because we dismiss those experiences as temporary distractions from the ultimate goal of finding a partner. Additionally, we tend to avoid having sex with friends under the assumption that repeated sex with someone we have a platonic attachment to might add pressure to turn the friendship into a romantic relationship. We conclude that sex ruins friendships, when in reality, the idea that if we have emotional and sexual chemistry with someone, material goals (kids, home ownership, etc.) are a necessary step in the relationship places tremendous pressure on friendships to not involve sex. As a result, we deny ourselves the opportunity to explore ourselves in various relational contexts, which makes us less likely to 'succeed' in the eventual romantic relationship that society tells us we should build by the time we turn 30.  The pervasive notion that marriage is the ultimate accomplishment in interpersonal relationships prevents us from envisioning relationships with nuance. It makes us worse friends, worse partners, and frames our expectations in a way that sets us up for disappointment and anxiety."
"Capitalism Trumps everything."
"girl, why didn't you rinse your canned beans?"
"'I weary of this beef.' =)"
"Okay I need contrapoints to sing Earth Angel at my future wedding"
"Somehow i have never seen this CP video before, and what is it? Natalie during her awkward male phase giving a sarcastic JOI set to classical music.  Welp, happy Thursday, everyone."
"Im having a really bad night and your videos help me a lot. Thank you for being yourself and creating beautiful things"
"Oh I love this one."
"Contrapoints, amazing video, love all your content, but...thats not how you say brothel..."
"Next time you cave- and yes, you will"
"I looove u bitch!!!!!!!! ♡"
"Natalie, I’m from the future. It’s no longer two weird men arguing about what sex we should have, it’s now a weird man and a weird woman, which is pretty neat."
"Well, this marks the first occasion I've seen a nun masturbating to furries accompanied by Vivaldi. Cheers?"
"The slowly walking nun was creepy for most of tge video. Then the masturbation to classical music and Furries came...."
"Why is casual sex so much more vilified because of the emotional damage it causes than lack of communication or emotional distance which are just as bad if not worse?"
"this is great and all but could you please explain why you pronounced 'brothel' in such a way"
"This I would definitely have to disagree because even though she does make good points on the some of the one way thinking of conservatives, there is a danger in claiming that all porn and all erotic interactions are liberating. Believe me, most people have viewed porn; and it’s understandable, we are sexual beings and it’s in our biology. However one time ,when I was in my teens and still viewing tons of porn, an add popped up right before the video and it was a man on top of a women, slapping her in the face over and over HARD. And there she was, smiling and screaming like a child with a new toy. After that I felt so sick to my stomach, I couldn’t go through with watching the video I had wanted to originally.  Whether you argue that the women was fully consenting(which I can’t imagine she was fully) this still is associating violence with pleasurable sex. And this was a pop up add. What do you think a 12 year old who is viewing porn for the first time is going to think about what sex is like? Also, while some good points were made, I felt she did not get into the darker side of casual sex. Consent is a vital aspect in any and all sexual encounters. Unfortunately though I’ve  heard a lot of stories where two people have just met and there having sex and everything is going fine until he asks if he can put it in her ass. She says no, but the bastard does it anyway. Now it’s rape. And that poor girl has to deal with that her whole life. This is why I don’t think the culture of consent and the romanticized hook up culture can ever fully coexist. After all, people try to imitate romantic scenes on TV were things are hot and sweaty then in a burst of heat both parties kiss and passionately remove one another’s clothes, but there is almost never a clear cut question that the man asks her and she says yes. Directors know that if they did this, it would be a turn off. That’s why these shows have given people a skewed vision of what good sex is, even though they are ignoring the essential question.  But going back to my other point on those scary situations. You don’t truly know the people you met after 2 weeks. The relationship is already really superficial, and it’s clear both parties are after sex, but what if one wants more than the other wants? This is the issue because some guys can be real pigs(that’s not a generalization because I said some) and you can’t fall back on always trusting someone u just met a week ago. This is why I think that the healthiest and best sex is intimate sex. You both have known each other for long time, you love one another, you want what is best for them. Not only is this great because it’s intimate, but you both sincerely trust one another in these situations and care about the other person and their well being. Natalie even mentioned this when she was arguing the idea that it is solely for procreation. What she didn’t understand was that the intimacy argument was something that the right uses a lot because the second most impersonal sex, is casual sex(the first being rape for obvious reasons).  Also, and I know I’m going to get some backlash for this, but there was a dark side to the Sexual Revolution that everyone forgets. This is best seen in the icon of Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy. Many I’ve met would say that Hefner is a feminist and that he improved the lives of women. But that is only what is on the surface of his personality. If you know about the psychology of sex and business you can see what Hefner was clearly trying to do. Hefner would be in all these pictures with the red robes, the dark sunglasses, the gold watch’s, the fancy cars, the Mansion, and about ten unrealistically thin blond, white women all topless. Hefner did this because he knew that every man in their 20’s wanted to be this. This high society “bachelor” ideology is most effective on young boys. He was seen as having a good social status from the “stuff” he surrounded himself with and that included women. This is the age old idea that having beautiful women around you as arm as eye candy is a sign of your wealth and social status. And what is so weird to me is how he is just so blatantly doing it, and no one is criticizing him for it.  So sometimes I have to wonder the full effect the sexual revolution brought to the table. Was it really as liberating for EVERYONE? Or was it just trading off one oppressive society(were women have to wear skirts down to their ankles and act all “prim and proper” in order for acceptance) for another much different but still very oppressed society(where women have become expected to put out on the first date and meet a level of beauty that is neither healthy nor realistic in order to satisfy men and their fantasies.)"
"I am a catholic and,,, I love your videos"
"contra: *sings* my vagina: open"
"DON'T try the wine. also, when I were a wee lad, were, I recall all the girls being obsessed with their BANGS. it was the 80's. it was a time when gamers had to go out to a communal gathering place and face each others shame and fear and anxiety in an empathetic arcade. All the risks of the human condition, 25 cents at a time.  there is a little something...something...I can totally put my finger on. the urges toward transcendance. fap across the waters of deep self toward the sweet peaks on the horizon of illusion."
"I am sorry but i haer you shouting the drugs and now only see the mad hater"
"10:36   'It's the peak of a fucking guitar solo'.  Truer words were never spoken"
"I just want someone who will hold my dumb hand"
"all you can eat birth control"
"So I only just watched this video, and I wish I had sooner. The Distributist? He's my cousin.  You think he's a riot to respond to online? Try debating him over Thanksgiving dinner."

"Came here after listening you sing The Sound of Silence ❤😗"
"Wow, Natalie, this was really high-brow stuff!!! It would be cool to see you get back into this hardcore philosophical lingo once in a while. You are absolutely eloquent here!!!"
"No talking over the piano and the singing!"
"End slut shamming?...  have you not used the app Skout as a male? Every woman acts like they're entitled to rich guys, paying for their time, starting useless live chats asking for money... not neccessary for sex, and some want sugar daddies. This is a disgusting privilege attractive women have, and they probably should be shamed for that shit."
"Why do I wanna try fapping to classical music now? Dammit this is not what I came here for!"
"1:12 In recent years Laci Green plunged head-first in the altright sphere :/"
"we've simultaneously hold sex as the highest possible good, and the lowest shameful act all at once :/"
"Gosh stop making me hungry. I'm trying to eat healthier."
"And don’t know if I’m allowed to say this, but I don’t care as long as it’s with you."
"That entire god damn opening in a scene from a Petter Greenaway movie coming to you soon starring Natalie Wynn. I love this production."
"the comment about lust is just peak trans woman"
"Ah... Back when Laci Green was still good. Dan sucks, though, and he's sucked for a long time for his biphobia."
"I mean beans are considered dessert in many parts of Asia... So I don't understand why it needed to be addressed"
"Does contra points sell costume sets? She should. She has so many goddamn costumes and costume ideas."
"Raw oystas...not only do they look like a lady's naughty bits, but...served raw are a known aphrodisiac!!!"
"Contra, please get together with The Golden One. I know he's a bad boy, but I think you can change him 😇"
"OH YES"
"I AM A PERSON ON THE THRESHOLD OF BEING UNABLE TO FUNCTION IN SOCIETY"
"I watched this video yesterday and laughed a good minute at the 'Now look Chesteron' joke. I now came back just to watch that again. That joke, and the delivery is probably the best thing I've seen in quite a while. I've been watching too many, too serious videos. This was awesome to see. Thanks for this."
"4:38 we need a full cover of Earth Angel by you Natalie"
"THE DRUGS!"
"the last five minutes made me shed a tear or two"
"Really I've had one or two issues trying to understand my partner's vision about love and casual sex. Your video have been a relief and a guide to try to lead a more healthy emotional relationship. Thank U."
"I did the homework. It was fantastic and I really recommend it."
"I'm surprised this video is still up lol"
"Why is that plato book upside down?"
"homework accepted"
"I love you fellow libra"
"'All transcendence is an allusion,' GO OFF !!"
"11:41 what the fuck is wrong with his chest?"
"Watching your videos helps me think more cogent thoughts."
"This is the most confusing and roundabout JOI video I've ever watched."
"when I grow up I want to be an Assistant SJW Coordinator"
"I love how she totally ignores Lena Dunham."
"5:00 WTF When I stop laughing I'll watch the rest of this."
"Not even gonna lie. I got ALL of my sex ed from Lacy Green. Its some good shit and honestly if i ever have children i will probably show them her videos. They're great."
"Why can't I be Anita and be loved by contra"
"I love your Earth Angel cover. Is there any sample of it?"
"The title is exactly how I've felt about casual sex, yet I've never been able to put words to it. This video should be interesting."
"SZKALUJĄ PAPIEŻA POLAKA W INTERNECIE"
"Its so true the comment about how consent is the absolute minimum necessary and not the prerequisites for good sex. Like holy shit dudes really be thinking that a girl agrees to have sex its automatically good. Holy shit I guess I've had decent luck with partners because I've been so naive that people like that exist"
"Watching these old videos now is really weird"
"I love you Con, please have my babies."
"I think the morrowind reference in the credits made me cum"
"As I watch your videos I would always appreciate there not be a poor victim of the slaughter house on your plate. In fact I find it quite disturbing."
"This video features Secular Talk!"
"Random comment: that steak looked delicious though a tad over cooked. Didn't see the center, but it looked medium well."
"i used to like to listen to religious music while engaging in forincatory sodomy... now i'm married."
"Been following your channel for a few months now and just came across this one.As someone who very much prefers a monogamous sexual relationship over casual encounters, great video!"
"Are you trying to suggest that milk is an emotional risk?  This is absurd, someone report her immediately!"
"You are a super star! And I love you."
"Your my new favourite youtuber now 😄"
"you're dumb for suggesting classical music"
"Oh boy.. the 'nun' sequence at 6:18 really freaked my cat out! Regardless, I love your VDO's ."
"Right that's a nice video but where's my fucking child support?"
"That Laci Green appeals to naive 16 Year old girls as a statement that they're just kids, doesn't mean that it's more acceptable. If anything they defend against being mislead more poorly, due to decreased experience.  Repeated and consistent experiences of meaninglessness can cause people to lose hope. How many want to be special? What is the point of making an attempt if it is meaningless? 'It's just sex.' So that's it? It's just sex? How many orgasms did that produce?  One of the hardest things about promiscuous sex is this idea that you have to settle down. When are you going to commit? When do you get to have a sexual experience that feels more than a means to an end? When can you be truly open with someone?  Maybe a lot of intimacy issues have less to do with casual sex and more to do with how we perceive our sexual partners and how we are perceived. When sleeping with someone else I detest value statements that declare absolutes. 'This partner was just 'better'.' Like that even makes sense. What about the last partner I slept with? I don't need to degrade their position to feel better about myself.  And the thing is by this point people should know better. They already know about a misattribution bias. And if sex is a competition, the results are meaningless. Because they're rigged."
"You are a fucking star sir, a star. Surely you should recite Ozymandias at least once in the one of your videos!?"
"Casual sex is as bad for my soul as masturbation. Not at all. My soul feels much better afterwards."
"I got emotionally damaged by the first Goth girl who sucked me off. STFU"
"'mmm yeah' - always my response to a mouth full of beef"
"Pick a fight with your nose, get those boogers out."
"I'm not alt right either  : D"
"Casual sex is bad for your soul (play darksouls.)"
"ContraPoints is a true Nazi just in case you guys didn't realize it.  Not because of HIS german parody vids. He's just Nazi Socialist Scum."
"God will will always take a huge shit  on your face you socialist nazi scum. Good job."
"I see furries! I love this channel even more now!"
"Your videos are shit btw. Just so you know."
"wow"
"a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party."
"Wanna argue with A real Nazi?"
"Lol Nazis to God? Cool"
"Yeah I know you are  a man."
"Fuck it, i'm a Trump supporter but i kindof think your hot."
"Cant* (raelly fucked up there tyler good job)"
"The initial video looked like some shit from Mandy,...but we all know you can make a MOVIE that good."
"Then again...i Play darksouls every night..."
"Yes! Casual Sex IS BAD FOR YOU! (Duh!)"
"Tabulate dem *BANGS* 😂"
"🥰"
"The problem with PUAs is that they see each woman as a target. They use their sex with these women to make themselves feel superior to said women, and then tell other men that all women are sluts and that men should go out and take advantage of them. Like, it's not a healthy way to view sex or view women. Sex is such a great experience, but it can easily become a fucking tragedy when you realize the person with you doesn't respect you or is just there to get themselves off. If you have some gross ''strategy'' to getting laid, then you're pathetic and creepy."
"Yes. When you’re about 47-50 you’ll realize it. Especially if ever contracted a disease."
"Watching your videos , I seriously think I fell in love with you...."
"I appreciate the weird. Bravo"
"As someone who has done it for a period of time I’d say it is. Truly not worth it and can leave you hurt; I wrote this before watching the video not realizing it’s targeted towards men whoopsie lol"
"Fuck to Debussy or Satie."
"Nice points, funny videos. I still love Jesus. But there's a lot of love to go around!"
"How are you not more popular? The backgrounds, lighting, singing cameos, drag, sarcasm and your absolute intelligence is phenomenal."
"Thot dots lol"
"Ankles! On a nun for God' sake! The profanity in this day and age!"
"I can tell she took a long time to edit this portion of the video 11:16"
"“We’re all gonna be emotionally damaged- I’m emotionally damaged right now!” 😂😂😂 this should have been my yearbook quote"
"Yeah, well... where is the full cover of earth angel????"
"Shit this channel is funny as hell. Keep it up!"
"I don't have a soul, so... Gonna have as much casual sex as I please."
"are these  new vids or you just changed all titles to deutsch?"
"'men' lmao"
"I came for the milk and bath but I stayed for all the other weird shit!"
"Finally somebody who’s opinion matters on this subject"
"“Shawn Don”"
"ContraPoints has a deeper voice than RooshV."
"I came from Nat's incel video but I wasn't aware of her older videos. It felt like watching another person. She's such a beautiful person whatever she chooses to be and will support her no matter what."
"ContraPoints and I both share a deep and unabashed sexual attraction to Anita Sarkeesian :)"
"1:50 wow the nun movie looks great"
"Unfortunately, life keeps on intruding on my fevered pursuit of hedonism. I want to go on a drug-fueled orgiastic bender, but then my mum calls and asks me to come mow the lawn. I try to do it as sexy as I can and scandalize the suburbia, but it just ain't the same. Bit wobbly on those heels, darling. That's what comes of trying to walk slowly, heels need determined striding. Listen to me talking like I know how to wear heels, I fall over in sandals."
"Wow.. this is the best youtube video I've seen in a while.. also, Im watching all your stuff in Chronological Order, and it's fun to see you evolve into the style that is your current editing style. Anyway, this was educational and inspirational, food for thought:) thanks for putting in the effort and well done!"
"Everyone wishes they could have casual sex..."
"I personally want to wait until I am in a serious relationship or even until marriage BC the idea of having casual sex myself makes me feel uncomfortable. If other people would prefer to do that than that’s their right."
"I used casual sex as a really unhealthy coping mechanism to deal with my lack of self worth and  sexual trauma and it high key made it worse so if u have issues  it is lmaoooo"
"'So eat your fuckin' beans' aahhahaha"
"You had to direct 'the nun'"
"Fuckin SING IT  Earth Angel, yeah"
"You videos are art and you always make really good points, but I cannot show them to people, because not everyone has the same tolerance for weirdness. Keep up the good work!"
"Wtf did I just watch? Eh, it was entertaining."
"I'm always most offended by the idea of designed humans. Maybe a sadist. Or an idiot."
"Thank you. 😁"
"i'd partner you"
"I just discovered you today, and may I say, you are magnificent in every way! Bravo, magical being!"
"Side note: you have exquisite taste in classical music!"
"You've introduced and got that song in my head and now I cannot get it out."
"I loooove how you sing"
"Oh Mami! Thank you for reminding me how to fap correctly lol"
"“...So eat your fucking beans!” HAHA!!!"
"like another commenter said, i love that despite the oft complicated and deeper topics you touch on, you still tend to bring things back in some way to the human condition, and thats so pure and genuine to me and seriously i love your content. thank you for being you and sharing it with us."
"4:30 read Lucretius De Rerum Natura book 4 at some point, the end of book 4 weirdly aligns with this view, even if it is sexist as only a first century Roman can be"
"✌❤🐺🥛"
"there is no term that will accurately describe the progressive performance art rational debate kind of content you do. but that's i think a good thing, as you mentioned in relation to the unspecifiable details of transcending the banal"
"She just inadvertedly created a music fetish. What oh what will the conservatives do now?"
"god damn, that opening is so good!!!"
"I think i'm properly in love with you"
"I think people need to tread carefully with casual sex. Especially when they’re younger. My sister has had over 60 sexual partners and she’s not even 28 years old. I’m 33 and one casual sex encounter destroyed my self esteem and “scared” me straight. Never did it again. Personal choice. My sisters been screwed up in a different way from all the casual sex. She thought it was all fun and games til she realized no one wants to marry/pursue a relationship with her. I don’t judge people for it, but I do think you need to consider how sexual promiscuity can/may affect you personally."
"5:29 Oh fuck Anita and her lumberjack look, gets me every time!"
"The answer is: No."
"There is no rape culture! Omg other then people who have a rape fetish if thays what u mean."
"Love you."
"Just to remind everyone here that 'Bacchanale' from Samson et Dalilah by Camile Saint Saens is the best musical piece to self abuse yourself to."
"you did the nun before it was a thing"
"Can we be best friends?"
"I like this"
"oh no, her voice"
"That's some dedication to cook a steak just to take a single bite out of it for a video."
"If someone edits out the 'bangs' into an isolated video clip and sends me a link I will love you forever!"
"All I can focus on is how much I want to eat your meat. The steak obviously. How was it?"
"It’s funny but I’ve only have had sex with with my husband and am an atheist. I’ve never been interested in casual sex, drugs, or getting drunk but that is just me. I would like to see a shift that says whatever your choice is a party hard porn star or married with kids that has consequences and you should take into account your personality and mental health to what best suits you. Your not boring for being monogamous and your not damaged if you enjoy a new lover every night you are you."
"You're amazing, I love you."
"You should cover 'Return to Sender.'"
"10-12 hours?!?!"
"Grapes are a desert thing."
"Natalie: am I really supposed to believe that you have a staff of twenty people, that you filmed in L.A. and in Iceland?  I know I'm old but not blind, nor dumb. I think you do it all by your lonesome, that you are quite gifted albeit a 'little' odd and dare I say loveable?"
"In tonight's performance Thomas Aquinas will be portrayed by ambassador to the federation: Sarek"
"As much as I agree with your points I keep seeing meat all the time in your videos and it really makes me uncomfortable."
"I dont understand how you manage to have such high video quality every single time."
"This is probably Contras best video :)"
"uninsightful video"
"No. No it isn't.  Next question?"
"cant stop crying, you are awesome"
"I just want to listen to you talk forever. please don't ever stop"
"You're at such a high level. Someday the mainstream will embrace you. You're like the early Louis C.K."
"Ooooh..... Kierkegaard....."
"'Laci Green's videos are for naive sixteen-year-old girls, not jaded 28-year-old perverts.'  I feel personally attacked."
"Great video but I really need your help: I have to know the source of the video in your atheist mosaic where the man in the suit is standing in front of the green screen made to appear as the desert. Please connect me to this man."
"There is so much in this video, thank you!"
"Paused it at 1:43, I am digging the prosecco out as we speak, kind Sir (now Madam).."
"Society can function just fine without promiscuity, it cannot do the same without heterosexual families. So no, not every sexuality is equally useful. Same goes for yogurts."

"Dan Savage is really homophobic, Lena Dumb ham is a child predator and Laci Green is meh. So why are you in that line up your not a terrible or a meh type of person."
"The song is 👌 to the opening."
"As a culture, we are in a desperate quest to mitigate sexuality whereas in my opinion it requires none. Sublimation and assumptions about Platonic overquests are well-meaning and not necessarily a mark of stupidity, But stupid is what they look like, in the final analysis."

"You cannot separate the unitive act of sexual activity from the procreative act. If you do so, society will suffer severe consequences. America is a heavily medicated open air mental health institution. That includes ContraPoints own psychosis issues."
"I think if you have causal sex you should take the responsibility that follows. Aka the condom is a good idea."
"I didn't expect 'the Nun' to be quite so philosophical"
"Ohhh boy"
"I love it when you sing."
"Well what is meant by hedonism? I think if it means you seek to maximize your pleasure (positive emotions) and minimize negative emotions like pain, teen angst, boredom, and that internal screeching, then what's wrong with hedonism and aren't most people hedonists? If you mean unhealthily seeking emotional highs, then yeah, that's negative because those highs can't last and when they go away you're left in a really dark place. But if you want to see hedonism as a desire to build the happiest possible life for yourself long-term where you experience more pleasure and less pain, then why wouldn't you want that?"

"Awful lot of laci green hate in this comment section for saying there are toxic people that are our contemporaries, which is true and only being reinforced by people calling her a terf who dates an alt right nazi just because of said statement."

"The TALENT and artistry that goes into these are almost mind blowing. I asked you on Twitter what you film&edit with, it'd be great to get a reply but I know you're a busy bee. Earth Angel in the middle of this one made me laugh but it was actually a great rendition of the song. You seem to be at least a figureative genius, if not an actual one. On top of being witty + hot + thoughtful. And a hell of a video editor/content person. Thank you for these."

"This is some really great stuff.  I'm skeptical, though, about your assertion that actual human transcendence by way of aesthetics or sex or eating a big mac is ersatz.  I think this form of self-annihilating transcendence  is a possible experience but that such experience is impossible to articulate. The view from nowhere is a perspective that always and immediately collapses the moment  my consciousness intervenes by realizing that it is happening."

"The fact that feminists can critique and even make fun of one another without betraying feminism is a sign that the rhetoric of the movement is well-rounded and established. Whereas Red Pillers, Anti-Feminists, Mens Rights, or whatever the fuck they call themselves, I just call them incels because that's what they are, can't criticize each other in the slightest because their, 'movement' is purely emotional. They twist reality to justify the angst they feel from being rejected. Racists do the same thing because they feel marginalized for different reasons."

"Hey contra, I disagree with you on something! You should look into the research on nofap (if you haven't already by now, I know this vid is almost a year and a half old). I dunno about TGO and his 'preserving sexual energy' or whatever, but more and more hard science is coming out about the addictive dangers of internet pornography. Tbh, I have experienced this first hand as I jerked off multiple times a day for 14 years or so starting at the age of 12. It's all about novelty, you see. When you have sex with the same partner, there is a diminishing returns effect on how often and how powerfully you feel a desire to have sex with that person. Conversely, throwing a new partner into the mix can hit an instant reset button on someone's horniness, basically. So, here we are with internet porn and we are able to see more humans erotically displaying themselves in 20 minutes than our ancestors would have seen other humans in general during their lifetimes.  What this (along with other factors) adds up to is a novelty machine that allows someone to come back over and over for that fix. Now, I'm not gonna suggest that everyone should stop pleasuring themselves forever or anything, but I will say that for people like me and many others, this is a BIG problem. It leads to low energy, low focus, low motivation, even impotence, and all these things lead to depression and anxiety. Nofap is something we HAVE to do, because like an alcoholic or drug addict that cannot help themselves, going back just once can send you spiraling down that path again.   There's no moral guilt here. It's not saying 'oh jerking off is bad and evil'. For most of the nofap community, it's 'I have a serious problem with this and I need to fix it.' I have a lot more to say but that's all ill say about that right now"
"Not soul but for psyche it might be you morron"
"“It’s watching dabs of paint resolve into interplay of light and shadow. It’s the peak of a sweet fucking guitar solo. It’s the ability to regard the sadness and desperation of human life with simultaneous horror and humor.”   You forgot the hallucinogenic drugs! The drugs Contra! You’ve failed to consider the drugs!"
"So psychosexual and relatable. as a cathrolic, tho. no chiieck mates,,"
"Hmm I feel like I wanted you to say more on the title. You describe different sexual lifestyles as fine because they all have emotional risks, but are the risks equal? Is the consequential harm of heartbreak equal to that of loneliness? These emotions are just part of the story, obviously, and it may be impossible to ever measure in any reliable way, but I think the idea that casual sex is bad persists because it's good to take sex seriously. You acknowledge how serious pregnancy is and rape and I would throw in STDs, and for me that's enough to not want to numb myself to sexual relations, but the 'soul' or 'spirituality' involved in sex could be equally serious, as serious as a Jimi Hendrix solo at least. Would you want to consider a Jimi Hendrix solo as just any other casual experience? What else would you be numb to after that? I guess I'm saying that numbness worries me the most about casual sex, and not just for me. If there is an inherent seriousness to sex, then wouldn't it be I'll advised to repeatedly engage in something serious until it's casual?"
"I surely don't agree with a lot of yer positions Contra but I have read the theology of the body too and think your observations here are spot on.  One major bone I have to pick with you in your video about western culture is a smear you threw in halfway through that vid throwing a bit of shade at Michael Shermer.Drunken frolics is A-okay in the Contra-Universe but if Mr. Shermer wants to shake his dick and have a good time its obnoxious sexual assault and pseudo-intellectual whitey is covering up for his misdemeanours, is that about right??

"5:56 YOU'VE FAILED TO CONSIDER THE SMELL, DEE. THE SMELL.  I'd love to watch you do a video on the meta-modernism even though i know it had nothing to do with this episode <3"
"This video was very interesting to watch, while you’re making a video responding to a catholic YouTuber about casual sex, you do not completely oppose him.  It seems a lot of your sentiment is the same and it appears as if your ears may not be completely deaf to god, as your values seem to line up with Christian values pretty well (ps I am a Christian, NOT a catholic so i dont agree with the guy you’re devating with fully).  I would recommend giving some Christian reading a try since you seem willing to consider new ideas as shown through your shift from a shitlord to a feminist and your willingness to read what this guy said.  It could help with the general despair and meaninglessness you feel and could show you a way to transcend past human consciousness.  I know it helped me a lot with my despair and nihilistic worldview and really strengthened by liberal values i held before I became Christian (I was an atheist/agnostic until I was 15).  Idk if you’ll read this but i relate a lot with you and love your videos and if you’d just give it a try I think you might find something in it."
"I'm rather religious and find the points you make about risk natural and legitimate, and this guy you were discussing with had a frightening, not very wholesome of dealing with sex in the first place. he put assault and promiscuity so close together so blatantly, which is appalling to put it lightly. Sex is a worldly issue with worldly problems and benefits."

"Contra, isn't their point about casual sex being bad focused on those who would like a long-term relationship in the future, but are having casual sex until they want to start a family. Aren't they saying that casual sex will mess up your psychology and make it hard for you to be in a long-term relationship? Also, they often point to the statistic that the more partners a women has before getting married, the less happy she will be when she does get married (though this statistic does not imply causation)."

(There were some really weird typo corrections while I made this post, like changing the word 'One' to 'whole.' wtf?) -#2: We as a species need to figure out how to mandate reproduction. Teens making fucking retarded decisions (My GF hates that word, but I like it.) and I repeat RETARDED DECISIONS that lead to the creation of another human, that really needs intervention. I don't know how this needs to be implemented, but it does NEED to be implemented.  I'm sterile. My girlfriend is also sterile. We made these decisions because we're responsible 'adults.' ('adults' = 'kids who dunno what they're really up to but are trying to make less mistakes then everyone else around them... who are still in their 30s...')  Casual sex is awesome! Well, I think so anyway. Slut shaming is real, though, and I think that's literally atrocious. I love 'sluts,' for lack of a better term. I'd love to see 'slut promoting,' along with all the youth populace forced to apply for the right to breed. That's like... that's Facey Neck paradise, right there.

I've been thinking about this lately but don't have enough cis straight men in my life to be able to get their opinions: It seems to me that when I, as a person who is not-a-man, lust for a woman, I think about how attracted I am to her and how much I would like to give her pleasure. I see the narrative with cis straight men often seem to be, they think about how attracted they are to the woman, and how much they would like her to give them pleasure, in other words they desire to take or receive something from her, or in your words 'posses'. Do you think it's important to distinguish between these two different types of lust, 'I would like to give' and 'I would like to take' ? And I don't mean necessarily divide these ideas between genders, that was just my initial reference point which I thought of when you used the word 'possess.'"
"OK, OK, I think I have a crush on you at this point. I've been watching your videos this past week and you're actually a person on the internet who is genuine and cognitively aware that other people exist and you're funny and bright and I wish I was nimble enough to scissor my widescreen as I watch you with krazy glue sticking my knees to the walls. I will settle for cum-encrusted throw pillows."
"Hey, ya know what, I've held my tongue until now, but I must correct something that I feel got overlooked here. Eating just a plain can of dark red kidney beans is normal and delicious and should not be scoffed at as a dessert. I happen to do it all of the time. Put some taco sauce on it and you got yourself some amazing Ghetto Chilli. You can always rob Taco Bell of the sauce packets. Back in my homeless days, I did it all of the time. Plus, look at all of that fiber!"

"Everything aside, NoFap is good for several concrete reasons."
"I think your my favorite person on youtube, the cultural references, eloquence and your overall eccentric aesthetic and personality are intriguing . Anyway I would argue that our propensity towards lustful objectification of other people is simply an instinctive animalistic impulse to mate. I believe we must recognize our base nature and impulses if we wish to fulfill our innate curiosity as much as develop holistically as human beings, as long as the attraction is reciprocal and the sex is consensual, this sort of indulgence can be interesting its as much a part of exploring our human condition as is seeking a fulfilling long term relationship. Maybe its just my epicurean propensities, its arguably unnatural to repress ones sexuality in the name of a gilt based, ethereal and historically inconsistent belief system. What do you think?"
"This touches on something interesting. Religious people are still OBSESSED with sex as something 'dirty' instead of something transcendent--the fixation on procreation speaks to a desire to justify the base urges that most people are subject to (including themselves). It's easier to scream about babies than to understand it as transcendent, which would require more active sexual engagement (something many, say, priests and religious folk are not permitted/taught is wrong)."
"i love earth angel thank u for being"
"Contrapoints, I don't think that people long for transcendence when they lust.  I also don't think lust is bad, unless someone is referring to an extreme version of it.  We're animals and we're, at least on one level, gene survival machines.  We're genetically programmed to seek sex.  There's nothing wrong with that.  As long as people are responsible, honest, considerate, not obsessive (in a way that hinders their own functioning or that of others)and they're respectful of each other, I don't see anything wrong with casual sex.  If you personally take issue with lust, that's fine, but I think that's a subjective opinion that doesn't reflect something universal about lust (again, depending on the use of the word).  Sexually longing for someone doesn't mean that one has bad intentions.  It depends on what one wants to do.  Fantasizing in a way that isn't obsessive is normal and healthy.  Also, we can enjoy sex with people without 'objectifying' them.  Sex doesn't have to be sacred or dirty.  I think the philosopher Martha Nussbaum had some useful things to say about objectification in this article: http://policeprostitutionandpolitics.net/pdfs_all/Academic_pro_decrim_articles_pdfs/1998%20Whether%20From%20Reason%20or%20Prejudice.pdf"

"Your comment on ethically questionable sex, and subsequent comments on the emotional issues that come with casual sex, leads me to wonder something. To what degree or extent do you think we're responsible for other people's emotional outcomes? When does it go from their responsibility to yours to ensure a relationship (sexual or otherwise) isn't damaging to another? I'd love to hear your thoughts."

"*contra*versial video ayyy"
"Did you compare the sensation of listening to fucking good music with having sex? I get the metaphor for transcendence, but I think they're not quite the same. Given that the video was about this very idea, you should have been more specific (or maybe i didn't understand it well?)"
"Holy dogshit! You made a video about a Catholic where pederasty was brought up, and didn't make a pedophile priest joke. That may be a first for an atheist on Youtube. I know I wouldn't have had the willpower to resist."

"Emotional damage is exactly why you should have casual sex, it's how you discover those emotions and learn to deal with them. Those damage-like pains may not be so much damage as they are growing pains because if an experience of unrequited love can make you jump off a bridge then your problems started long before you ever had casual sex.  P.S. - Nice try on 'Earth Angel' but I think you need more vibrato (or tremolo? or both?) on certain parts of words (like the 'ime' in 'time' and the 'ew' in 'you').  P.S.S. - Masturbate to classical? No thanks, I'll take Crucified Barbara's 'Rock Me Like The Devil' or Leaves Eyes 'Into your light' (it has violins in it)."

All in all, I could never understand how this 'Chesterton' boor could see sexuality in a very black-and-white worldview, he also might have a Madonna-Whore Complex. And I say this as a happy Autochorrisexual (explained better here http://asexuals.wikia.com/wiki/Autochorissexual)."
"I'm surprised he lumped you in with those three, I think those three are total douchebags."
"Also there's a line I really love which fits with one thing said here, from Devdas(2002):  'In the soil of the whore's doorstep is moulded the image of the goddess.'  I reflect on that a lot."
"I'm a dirty (hipster) Muslim who was raised in a Catholic country so I'm coming from a different perspective but actually have most of the same conclusions, which I find very interesting.  Most contemporary Muslim clerics, as well as most conservative Christians would tend to view the idea of sex outside of marriage, or even sex not for procreation(which is to be fair more of a yt Christian thing than a Muslim thing) and obviously having a more socially & religiously liberal perspective I wouldn't subscribe to this. I'm more focused on Islam and the concept of Zina and Nikkah so I'll focus on that right now.  The concept of Zina is generally taken to refer to adultery, and extra marital affairs. It's often used to defend segregation as you are not meant to even 'Come close' to Zina(whatever that means). Zina, in of itself, is a word of not-entirely clear etymology and it may not even be certain it has something to do with sexual relations, but may refer to some other form of dishonesty that happens to include cheating. Contrary to this, you have the idea of the Nikkah, a marriage contract. What's important to note is that ideally marriages can be made and broken off more easily than the modern western or 'Christian' concept of marriage. Divorce isn't a big deal. Islam traditionally afforded a lot of rights to women, this being one of them, before The Mens decided to ruin things as usual.   So, it's not actually completely terrible that traditional Muslims don't 'date' because marriage is easier to initiate and cease. But it's important too to ask why these things exist. Many of the rulings in the Quran with regards the status of men & women assumed an already unequal society where men were the primary breadwinners(despite Islam itself having many examples of strong and successful women, like Khadijah, Umm Ammarah). Personally I do see religious texts as more guidance than the basis of law(There's no compulsion in religion) anyway, so I'd be more inclined to relegate such an interpretation as a historical thing we can understand and learn something from, but particularly in this case there's a context for it.  And this is where my views sort of strongly align with what's being said here. Around the time of the Prophet(and frankly throughout much of history up until now) there was an awful lot of issue with men pursuing women in less than responsible ways, disrespecting them, sleeping around in perhaps the bad way. For one, it made it very hard to ascertain lineage, which is one of the reasons early Muslims figured out some basic rules. But there's another factor her, obviously, and it's the idea of a healthy relationship, and sexual encounters which are not only consensual but wholesome for both parties. So the idea of some sort of contract, was integral to early Muslim society, and continues to be to this day.  The thing about the idea of this contract is that initially it wasn't necessarily a formal marriage document, but a sort of verbal agreement - more resembling a *social contract* than the modern concept of a marriage. So - according to more liberal and likely more accurate interpretations of Islam - if you are engaging in relations with someone, you cannot do so irresponsibly. Even if you are 'sleeping around', there must be some form of mutual understanding. Every time you engage in relations with someone, and you communicate, and are aware of consent - a contract exists.   In my view, Islam emphasises the importance of this contract, and 'Zina' in fact refers not to 'extra-marital relationships' but exactly the sort of unhealthy dynamics you describe which particularly back then were creating real difficulties for society, especially women. The 'ruling' that clerics use to justify mandatory Hijab is similar(and there's a really good Ted talk about this online), it was referring to a particular case were men would hide in bushes and prey on lower class & slave women, who would not traditionally wear a veil or conceal their bosom. In doing so, they made their status more ambiguous, and thus men would be less likely to touch them, fearing the consequences. All the historical evidence seems to be point to the idea that these parts of the Quran(though I can't qualify as much for the Bible) were in response to leery and exploitative/irresponsible behaviour, rather than mere pleasure seeking.  Similarly, men and women(but especially men) are told to 'lower their gaze', to avoid that sort of leeriness discussed. I do find the idea of positive and negative hedonist pretty fascinating, and again believe this to be a dynamic which does appear throughout Islamic history -  Ali ibn Nasr al-Katib's 'Encyclopedia of Pleasure' for example, which among other things tells of a romantic relationship between a Muslim woman and a Christian Princess. While we're on this subject too - there's a tale within the 1001 Nights which contains an erotic depiction of two women having relations! Containing erotic descriptions of both heterosexual and homosexual love would be unheard of in modern Islam. Yet in a story derived from Middle Eastern Folklore, taken from Muslim societies at the time, we find “The story of King Shahriman and his son, Qamar a-Zaman”.  I think that a lot of people especially in the Muslim world take issue with the idea of empty, hedonistic relationships and I think on certain levels I do too, but on principle. More liberal Muslims interpret Alcohol the same way - technically it's not absolutely forbidden, but it's said that it coincides with unruliness more often than not, and can be a 'temptation of the Devil' - which if you think about how alcohol affects a lot of people, is hard to deny. I think that the interpretation of Abrahamic religions(especially Christianity and especially moreso Islam) as no-fun-allowed and disalllowing of the pursuit of pleasure contradicts much of the rest of what their texts contain(like in Quran, it being stated that Allah has sent down everything on earth for us to consume) isn't really in keeping with their original intent, or these religions as best practised.   I think instead they're trying to teach people to be responsible and be mindful of the effect their decisions have on themselves and others. Which is a conclusion I came to even before I got into Islam."
"ooo your singing is good and you make good points. hehehe BANG."
"You´re so right about the issue of Catholics now looking like social Darwinists. I don´t think that´s just a coincidence, that´s their way of turning their religious arguments into something that could be meaningful to other people and in the end regulate our relationships (divorce, abortion, marriage equality for LGBT)..."
"Finally a totally non-homoerotic explanation for the errection I get when I listen to the beginning of 'Whole Lotta Love', the Chorus of 'Foxy Lady' or the beginning lick of the solo in 'Back in Black'. It is about transcendence! Also it is strong ... muscular, manly and OH MY GAWD!?"

"People... please don't try to moralize sex. That just ruins the fun of it."
"It sounds like you're using the term 'rape culture' in a generic, short-shrift way that I've heard you denounce others for doing in a great livestream you did with Mr. Silhouette.  That was a bit irksome.  Otherwise I enjoyed the video as usual.  Also, to touch on something else from that stream,I enjoy your videos; and not because you're also a white male, as though that's the only sort of person I can identify with.  I mean, for fuck sake, you should have already known that-- Your videos aren't like anything I'm used to seeing on these subjects, they're damn freaky.  So suck my balls.  Thumbs up!"
"you're alright...for a 'SJW' hahaha na but really you bring up some interesting points."
"Sweet lighting!"
"I must not be talking to Traditionalists because the Catholics I'm talking to think theology of the body is crap."
"I think this is the first video Contrapoints made where I disagree. Yeah, it's still a really good video (Contrapoints is awesome) and there are parts I agree with. But I split with him on spirituality and hedonism. If there's no afterlife, no God, nothing beyond this world (Sorry folks. There is no God), then seeking pleasure and avoiding pain is a pretty good motto if this is all we got."
"Wait a minute...  Wait a goddamned minute  J U S T H O L D O N H E R E  You use your left hand?  Heathen..."
"Its been quite a while since I read the Symposium, but isn't it most of the speeches prior to the speech of Agathon the one that mainly talks about boy love? I remember Agathon giving the allegorical speech about the eight-limbed, two-headed people who compose of male-male, male-female, and female-female. I remember Socrates talking about love not being a god but a 'spirit' that travels from men to the gods and vice-versa.   Maybe I didn't read it properly and its been a while, but I remember a few years ago thinking that the interpretation of Plato as this NAMBLA sympathizer as particularly disingenuous, especially considering these are characters that are saying these things which is entrenched in the Greek culture and not necessarily what 'Plato thought.'"

"I personally think Lacy is great. Sure she's a little pushy sometimes, but she's right most of the times. Plus it's thanks to her that I know so much about sex and sexuality. Anywho, onto the video. I love this video. Also great to see the ever amazing Nostalgia Chick in the comments. Also ContraPoints, you look fabulous!  Edit: I regret ever making this comment. Laci has turned into something I wanna forget about entirly."
"You have kind of a Burl Ives singing voice"
"For a small youtuber, your videos are really well produced."

"hahaha amazing. You wernt lying when you said that was your best video yet"
"Insightful video. I want to add my voice to the conversation as a politically progressive Christian (Yes we exist ). Personally, I'm not a fan of casual sex but I'm still sex positive in a sense. Its pretty clear sex is a gift from God for humans to enjoy. Hell, there's an entire book in the Old Testament all about how awesome sex is. However, this doesn't mean all sex is good. Divine gifts can be abused and to be honest, that is the source of most sin. I'm actually more lenient than some Christians regarding this issue. I don't think pre-marital sex is always bad but I think sex should be confined to couples in serious relationships. A theologically accurate view of sex involves acknowledging it as a powerful act of communion and reducing to pure hedonism cheapens it.  At the same time, I think its silly to try to make Non-Christians act like Christians. Trying to coerce people into being Christians will only breed resentment which is one of the reasons I reject social conservatism. Therefore, I don't really care if secular people are into casual sex and I have very little tolerance for slut shaming. I only have two demands from people who like casual sex.  1. Make your intentions perfectly clear with your partner. Manipulating people for your own pleasure isn't cool. 2. Don't look down on people who willing choose a more conservative form of sexual expression. Being monogamous, abstinent, or celibate doesn't mean someone's anti-sex or trying to make everyone like them. People are different and trying to make everyone promiscuous will bring sexual liberation full circle."

He basically said that everyone would act like Roosh if not for religious morality holding them back, which doesn't make sense unless you view sex on the same terms Roosh does."

"I fucking lost my shit when Anita fucking came up in the love song"
"The rendition of Earth Angel actually sounded great."
"I love the style and content of your videos. Keep it up!"
"Wow this was a fucking ride. A wonderful ride though, really awesome video."
"Your editing humor is starting to eclipse hbomb's."
"this video just kept getting better and better..  it's sweet that you can do this full time now, you'll go from strength to strength no doubt.. it's only a matter of time till you're on the curriculum.. XD"
"6:15 fkin LOVE this music your doing here. do some mo, full video! is DOPE"
"You have extremely sensual fingers, can't take my eyes off them 10/10  Also, nice video :)"
"one of your best ones. it made me warm and fuzzy inside"
"I whispered 'oh my god' at a rate of (at LEAST) once per minute.  For real though, I think this was your best video yet. The outfits, the editing, the script, the lighting (my GOD the lighting) - your 'new stuff' fucking shows, dogg. This was EXCELLENT."
"Wait, I thought Anita was your mother. Retcon or incest?"
"If you ever release merch, please please please have a t shirt saying 'TRY THE _WINE!_'"
"I like how 'try the wine' has become a thing."
"Conservative beliefs will contribute to 'degenerate' behavior, red and  southern states watch the most gay and tranny porn."
"The Fin.  Oh and that Chesterton Guy is totally in love with you and your body. Even if he'll prefer to kill himself (or more probably you, because YOU are the source of the impure thoughts he had) before admit it.   Stay true, sis."
"Discovered you yesterday and watched nearly all of your stuff. You are really good. Keep up the good work."
"How dare my friend introduce me to such a beautiful channel the aesthetic here i cant i'm gonna lose hours binge watching. Subbed. x'D  It's certainly not for everyone. You'll have to work out the feels you'll get. I know I can't do casual sex myself. I don't trust other people with my body, I don't want to find out they an asshole after I fuck them and no test is fast or accurate enough to ease my mind over having sex with a random person. :I Not having sex till I know everything I need..."
"Was the musical interlude intentionally Lynchian? (red drapes, lol)"
"Wow, you need a lot more practice on those heels gurl!"
"I don't like definition of rape as lack of consent, because it's a red herring, diverting from what people really don't like about it."
"If ladies don't want to listen to two men discussing what sex they should have, they can always join the conversation themselves."
"Contra is clothed. so far so good. let's hope this holds up"
"Transcendence with any transcendent. See my Sources."
"Recently discovered your videos, they're phenomenal."
"A brief moment of ecstasy and then the crashing despair of loss,but I love your makeup."
"Daily (well.. more like frequent) Reminder!  #ContraPoints has only 12K subscribers. Need to spread the word guys."
"This is your best video. Your an amazing singer btw"
"http://www.artble.com/imgs/d/a/5/431705/the_ecstasy_of_saint_theresa.jpg"
"I want that shirt and you, dinner?"
"New ContraPoints video? *Gets the wine and lights a candle*"
"I'm saddened by the lack of guns and pearls."
"I also think it kind of comes down to this weird belief that a penis/intercourse can somehow devalue a person. Or like, physically change the structure of a vagina somehow. The silly notion that you are hurting your future 'soulmate' by having sex with people prior to them...that it won't be 'as special'....It's so deeply rooted in shame and this strange notion of what cleanliness and purity is....It's bizarre but pervasive, even within myself even know I know it's logically ludicrous. Alas..."
"There seems to be this presumption that, in a vacuum, we would all feel guilt and shame for hedonistically fucking all the time. But it seems to me that the reason people feel ashamed after one-night stands or masturbating is because, according to centuries of social and moral norms, that's how we're SUPPOSED to feel. If worldviews that approached sex in this way didn't exist, I doubt we'd feel much different than most other animals do after they fuck.  Or maybe that's just me rationalizing my one-night stand-loving, perverse lifestyle. My sex drive clouds my judgment all the time."
"Ah I miss Theoretical Bull Shit! He was one of the few 'New atheist' that wasn't a complete Ass!"
"You're good, and your arguments seem solid. I don't know if that could be of interest, but you contributed at least shifting my opinion on the presence of systemic racism in the US, with your Baltimore video. I am Italian, though, so it probably does not matter much :-D  I would really be interested in seeing you debate some 'anti-SJW' (Sargon?) on a single topic. I think it would be both informing and entertaining."
"I loved your video! Funny as usual <3  Really random but, if you take requests, it would be awesome if you make a video about Generation Z and how conservative outlets are trying to manipulate us. I've recently become addicted to studying about my generation because some of us are starting to come of age. I hope you see this and have a great day!"
"The 'DUMB FUCKING WOMAN!' part made me laugh so hard, holy shit. This video is probably one of your best just like you thought. Even though it's on a subject I don't really care about, you still managed to make it pretty relevant. Great job!"
"The crazy antics and editing on screen keeps getting better and better lol"
"Fantastic lighting, editing and music in this. Did you see Moonlight perchance? :D"
"Truly excellent.  Taking the idea of a response video to a new level.  Love the description of transcendence."
"Nah, but really, great video as always. Hope you blow up soon."
"The Anita song but was amazing and hilarious. Good job."
"...end rape culture and slut shaming, hence feminist... I personally don't believe that the west is a rape culture, because all the males I know think of rape as a crime (and a horrible one to), but OK I at least understand why some women think there is a rape culture. But slut shaming? You know men are not the only ones who are doing it, I would even argue that women are much worse at this offence than men and much more cruel. How does this factor in feminism? Or are all good women feminists and all the bad ones aren't?"
"Plato doesn't say anything in the Symposium, but more seriously I swear Socrates argues that the center of love is a longing to recreate the object of beauty through reproduction. The other characters are more pederastic, obviously—that one younger guy defends the honor and masculinity of being loved by older men, the older lover defends older lovers as non-exploitative, and Aristophanes for sure is all like 'love of boys is purer and more classy,' but Socrates treats them all with the same contempt and sarcasm that he treats everyone with in all the dialogues. Alcibiades even shows up to bitch about how Socrates is sexless because he never went for anything after tutoring sessions and it made him feel ugly. Same in the Phaedrus, right? Phaedrus pretends to give some long speech he heard about how you shouldn't have sex with people who love you because love is obsessive and possessive, which in effect is Phaedrus saying 'hey, you keep not desiring me or fucking me, is it because you think I'm into you? Or you're not in love with me? I'd still be cool with a FWB thing.' And Socrates mocks him mercilessly. Plato seems at times to think Socrates is a little too silly, like in the end of symposium, but since Socrates is almost Philosophy Jesus for plasto, it's hard to read these works as pro-pederasty. The pederasts are another crowd for Socrates to troll."
"Wait, there are people who fap without listening to classical music?"
"D A D D Y"
"You have become one of my Favorites..."
"I wonder what it would be like if someone tried to get off listening to Le Sacre du Printemps....  Also, regarding the Symposium, I think Aristophanes was right, except I'm not sure how his answer factors in bi/pan folks.  Finally, I rather dislike the hardcore social conservatism of some sectors of the church. A friend of mine, who was raised some brand of Protestant, told me that the first time he ever kissed a guy, his immediate thought was of hell; that seems to me a sort of spiritual terrorism, like the fire 'n brimstone speech of the priest in Part 3 of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. It fucks with people's heads.   Great video, as always!"
"Why would the supposed lovers men and manliness be against the fap? Masturbating is the safest, most satisfying sex with someone you love. It's particularly important for men, as well, as there is a growing body of research that frequent ejaculation dramatically decreases incidence of prostate cancer, a top killer of men.

"someone is a fan of David Lynch"
"Be vegan please"
"Good stuff. Next do Roger Scruton's phenomenological justification for homophobia! Nice Grados :D"
"RT.  Classical music is so hot"
"you're the shit"
"Reppin' the Grados!   Good taste all around."
"I was skeptical of one of your recent tweets but you were right, this is your best video to date :)"
"That nun outfit tho... Great video as always"
"I found the comment that 'sex being ethical is about more than consent' intriguing, though I'm not sure if you [Contra] chose the best examples of other ethical questions to pose - I mean, information is a prerequisite to consent (which is why the only viable form of it is considered 'informed' consent), so anything which impedes information or the way in which it is processed is still bound to the issue of consent, not something external to it. But it may be more true to say that consent is the only basis for sexual 'politics' as something distinct to 'ethics'. I make a distinction between the two [correctly or otherwise] as politics being the action of moderating other individuals and ethics purely in the action of moderating the self.  As far as sexual ethics are concerned, that means literally any sexual act you do not consent to is one you find ethically questionable [rephrased: morally questionable for YOU personally]. I don't think that's particularly unhealthy. I'm okay with all the weird people out in the world who think heterosexuality is gross and incest is evil - what I'm not okay with is the attempt to politically influence or control another person's decisions based on one's own personal ethics. And that's what conservatives are guilty of, whether they are the 20th Century conservatives hanging around The Right or 21st Century conservatives who haven't yet departed from The Left.  The thing with religion coming in is that it defers ethics in favor of politics. The ONLY rationale brought in and perhaps necessary to religion is that someone else knows more and better and should be making those choices, and the attempt to understand those choices through scripture is pretty much irrelevant until you've pulled a Lucifer and claim equality to God. So yeah, for a lot of people casual sex is bad for the soul. But for an even higher proportion of mystics, complete submission to the great dominatrix they call God is the only ethos they ascribe to."
"You are the only feminist I like."
"Two men on the Internet arguing about what kind of sex I should have. Awesome."
"You are so beautiful, i'm melting"
"Excellent video. I love your channel and it just keeps getting better. I really like the people that watch and comment. Also the violin thing was lewd. Has Anita seen any of your vids yet? How will she react if/when she does?"
"Good work. Really enjoyed the vid"
"Can you do a vid on Bill Maher or Milo?"
"I hated 'SJWs' since atheism plus, i have started hating the shitlords relatively recently, so i am currently lacking a tribe. Time to find a reason to identify with the blonde pervert transvestite and then find a good reason to hate him later. 10/10 nice vid."
"Was that your rendition of dies irae too? Also, are you familiar with the philosophy of Epicurus? It's like hedonism lite. Great video! :D"
"He legitimately sounds like Aurini putting on a voice."
"This is better shot than some cheap cable TV. That's a huge improvement."
"'This video is going to be two weird men on the internet arguing about what kind of srx you should have. I'm so sorry.'  This is possibly the best line anyone has ever said."
"Laci Greens videos are for naive 16 year old girls despite not saying anything much different from you regarding social justice but actually better informing people (of all ages who are ignorant) regarding sex education, sexual exploration, and sexual orientation? No offense, and you've made some good videos, but she has a bit more cred than you because she doesn't spend so much of her time debunking shit posters and shit vloggers while making jokes and anecdotes but instead actually interviewing people of disparaged and misunderstood sexual lifestyles, spreading awareness, and educating others. For goodness sake, the most you said about using protection in this video is 'use a condom' while making a bunch of jokes. How much more informed am I for watching this?  I don't care if I get flak for this comment, but I've been a fan of yours and hers since even back when you were making less comedic videos, and in comparison, I just don't see how you get off on being so superior. I say this not just in response to this video but in response to other comments you've made about your disparaging take on 'pop feminism' in other videos you've made as well as hangout videos you've done with others."
"Godammit Contra, I need classical pieces to jack off to now!"
"Amazing video as usual, and holy fuck you're an amazing musician. Also, red is my favourite colour and I love how red this video was. Did you get my CD and other cool things in the mail yet? I hope you love them."
"You're a bit scary as a nun sir, but you have a surprisingly good singing voice. Man of many talents evidently. Many of Catholics I've met seemed to fetishize marriage with all its trappings and rituals. I kind of get it, but it isn't for all of us."
"Great stuff, CP!"
"Aerith Gainsborough  paid for this video."
"You keep getting weirder and weirder with each video. AND I LOVE IT. PLEASE DON'T STOP. Especially when you wear those rhinestones, damn son. 👌🏻Also, for the love of god can someone PLEASE write Contra/Golden One fanfic?"
"Even most of my friends, who are all pretty liberal, still don't understand why I don't indulge in hedonism"
"'And I have to wonder how much of social conservatives horror and disdain for degeneracy stems from their own feelings of shame and self loathing'...truer words were never said!"
"Not gonna lie, I like the effort and attention to detail you put in your videos."
"Dammit, how did you mic the piano without having it sound like crap?"
"So when's the single coming out on Spotify, Contra?"
"'Don Juan, Triumphant'  Of course he's a phantom fan. Nerd."
"By the way why is your Wh!te N@tionali$m video unavailabel in Germany?"
"all-you-can-eat birth control omfg... love it"
"I don't even think that 'sexual promiscuity' is inherently emotionally damaging to partners if communication is really on point. In pretty much every case where people get emotionally fucked up about casual sex, communication is usually poor. Just what I've noticed. Ps your eye gemstones are fucking glorious"
"The motion graphics are looking great!  As Production Accountant, you have my assurance that the budget did not go to waste."
"All right, I have a few thoughts.  1) Nice new intro 2) 'Only one person has had the balls to respond' is inaccurate.  Off the top of my head, you've gotten at least two before.  Justicar responded to your first video, and Armoured Skeptic responded to your second one.  I don't care about this too much but It makes the line lose some of its rhetorical punch. 3) Overall I really enjoy this style of dialogue on YouTube.  It's clear that you don't hate 'The Distributist' or go for cheap shots of showing his whole video in 10 second clips and doing angry rebuttal rants.  You try to summarize his argument as fairly as you can and then offer points of agreement and disagreement.  Sort of like the goal here is to actually move opinions forward instead of just argue controversial topics for the sake of YouTube money! 4) I'm now on a rabbit hole checking out The Distributist and I'd love to spend the afternoon watching and forming a bunch of thoughts on the arguments themselves but I have a busy day ahead of me so I'd better not do that, I'll come back to comment more fully at some other time."
"Yes, no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.   It's also a good idea to take emotional responsibility. Whatever sort of pain is associated with one's lifestyle of choice does need to be dealt with, and not blamed on others or even on the lifestyle itself. In a free society, we make our choices and then must accept the outcome of those choices. If the outcome brings more pain than nourishment, we can change the lifestyle choice, or we can attempt to become better at living that lifestyle. Those are the only two responsible reactions, the only responses that can improve the quality of our lives."
"also you barely adressed the cultural dimension of sexuality, which is the big one. even you, while saying that hedonism is 'a good philosophy for 4 hours', say this with an air of superiority for 'having done it', as if reaching a certain level of pleasure or a way of ahcieving pleasure is something to almost brag about.  i liked the video otherwise and i agree with the examination of the theology of body."
"I love your videos but they give me existential dread"
"How long does it take you to make such an episode? The 'cinematography' is amazing!"
"7:47 ANTI-NATALISM INTENSIFIES, THANKU CONTRA. (I KNOW YOU USED TO WATCH INMENDHAM. I C U FAM.)"
"So what's the difference between hedonism and all other lifestyles and philosophies? Doesn't everything we do go back to wanting pleasure? Don't Catholics get married because they see it as something that will make them happy? Don't masochists live their lifestyles because they get pleasure from pain?"
"Chesterton REKT and his man-panties all TORN ASUNDER.........naw just kidding. Really good video, and it came across to me as heartfelt in many places which I loved.  One thing that was occurring to me as I watched is that we consider so many things in sex as all-or-nothing. We give no quarter to the idea that people change, and sex is part of that. My sexual identity isn't exactly the same as it was 10 years ago, nor should it be. We keep trying to find THE answer for everyone for all time- and with the trial and error being so much damn fun, too! What a waste."
"What's the song at 3:52?"
"I have this theory about furries... we are only weirded out because we are not used to people being so happy."
"Yay! I'm so happy that you are able to create content Full TIme that you like because of Patreon <3."
"Also contrapoints, I'd love to hear your thoughts on Milo on Bill Maher, do you post your opinions anywhere else on the internet?"
"Yet another great and thought provoking video.   Milk is most definitely the peak of the human experience"
"It must be hilarious for the IRS to read these props as write-offs. I love it."
"This kind of thing is something everyone needs to study on their own and not just watch Youtube videos about it."
"I'm a straight female and you're distracting me in these videos. ALL THIS LUST GOD DAMN IT CONTRA"
"that steak is waaay too well done"
"I have impure feelings about you in that habit"
"Need a full version of Earth Angel on iTunes right now. Like, RIGHT now. Also, just a side note, isn't it funny how some people believe Adam and Eve is literally true? Like if Adam was made first, THEN the Eve, then why the hell would Adam have nipples? Y'all know that shit exists because nipples are formed before fully determined sex in the womb, but NO. Maybe God just really REALLY liked the idea of sensitive chest lumps... I mean I'm not saying anything, I'm just saying..."
"You move your rabbit mask like davis moves his skulls"
"Is there such thing as rhinestone fetish? I now have one"
">'some people don't want to have any sexual or romantic relationships' >doesn't say 'thats fine'  Shade thrown?"
"In before the..... well most people really."
"your videos keep getting better"
"LIES"
"Trying a lot of new stuff here, let me know what you think!  I've discussed the possibility of doing a live stream with the Distributist to talk about these issues, so I'll tweet/FB about it if that happens.  One thing that bothers me slightly about this video is that it kind of comes across like I have this disdain for procreation, which I do not, in fact, have, though I think it would be pretty irresponsible for me, personally, to procreate. At this point.  Also, I'm so sorry I've been procrastinating on the captions. I will literally do this video and as many others as I can today."
"Nun band Contra is the shit"
"So this is what it would look like if Stanley Kubrick/Nicolas Winding Refn made a made a YouTube video!"
"Liked before even watching..."
"I love your theatrics, nobody comes close. Great points too"
