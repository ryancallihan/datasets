"It reminds me of that movie with Ned Beatty and Halle Berry, Bullworth or something like it?  Anyway he is a politician and he is basically losing his mind and trying to commit suicide by hiring a hit and and a bunch of other stuff, so he starts running around with Halle Berry who plays a girl from the ghetto who is taking him to all these dangerous places trying to get him 'accidentally killed' and gets high and goes on TV and they ask him something about the divide between white people and black people and what's the answer to fix it, and he says, 'Get rid of em' and the interviewer is like, 'GET RID OF BLACK PEOPLE?!?!' and he says, 'No, GET RID OF WHITE PEOPLE' ..... 'White people, black people, whatever people, we all just need to keep fucking til we all look the same and no one can tell who's white or black or anything.'  This reminded me of that.

Why is the natural male/female birth rate virtually 50/50 everywhere despite 'race'? I think it's all environment/nurture-based, not some predetermined bloodline programming."

"In the US black people are not treated properly for pain and are more often denied painkillers on request than white people. Until VERY recently medical text books included the idea that black people don't experience pain like white people. This 'reasoning' was invented to justify cruelties such as slavery. The same logic is used today to justify cruelty to livestock. I'm an animist, I believe the world consists of diverse persons (only some of which are human) and that failing to see someones person-hood leads to lack of responsibility in our treatment of them. I believe nature shows us that diversity is necessary for a community to be resistant and resilient to change (e.g. biodiversity), it makes us strong. I heard you once make a dig at spirituality as wholesale nonsense, but some spiritual worldviews really help people to treat their fellow people better."

"It gets a little tiring how you try to talk from both sides of your mouth.  Yes, race is an ambiguous concept which has very fuzzy markings genetically.  It really has no utility in the modern world given that it cannot be accurately defined and policies cannot be crafted around it.  You find this true when it confers advantages to white people, but you immediately backtrack when it suggests we shouldn't give advantages to black people.  In the latter case, we must recognize race otherwise it would go against the modern narrative that black people need special treatment.    I know you justify it by claiming black people have been treated unfairly based on perception, but that is a cop out and you know it.  If race is truly a social construct and ambiguous, then we should do away with any policy which treats it in a serious manner.  You are fine with that when the discussion of race might recognize ostensibly white people as superior based on their historical achievements, but you shy away from it when it fails to advantage black people because of historical oppression.    Your entire argument comes across as disingenuous post hoc reasoning. This is why people cannot take these arguments seriously.  It is glaringly obvious some people want to utilize race to their advantage, but only certain groups are socially allowed to do so.  We need to do away with the whole concept, even if it means it will anger liberal people who have put race front and center again."

"I personally do think that colour blindness is the answer to solve the issue of race due to there being more effective ways to distinguish who should be given help and relief from oppression than perceived race. I feel like enacting policies and laws that refer to race is very negative because by keeping races in modern writing and especially modern discourse and politics we keep it as something that people are distinguished by and something that will cause discrimination intentionally or not."
"What a pile of shit."
"'Nay! NAaAaAaAyYyYyY!'"
"You say that we base race on a few genetic factors which control easy to see phenotypes, such as, skin colour and hair type. But then fail to see how important these are. Race is define along these lines due to basic human tribalism. People are most likely to get along with people who look like them and act like them. Why do you think fashion trends occur? It's from people trying to achieve social similarly because that breed cooperation which is therefore a favourable evolutionary trait. Therefore these minor genetic differences which divide race phenotypes are hugely important as similar races should be grouped together to make a higher functioning society."
"Instead of relating the concept of 'race' to dogs, which have a longer history of human interference through breeding, I think it makes more sense to relate it to common house and feral cats (i.e. not human-influenced breeds, just regular cats). There are black cats and white cats, calico cats and tabby cats, tuxedo cats and mixtures of all of them. They have long hair, short hair, tails or no tails, black noses, pink noses, long faces, short faces, green, blue or amber eyes, and so on and so forth.  Common cats have about as many physical differences and as much variety as humans. But all of them are still cats, and nobody would suggest that a tabby cat is any less of a 'cat' than a tuxedo cat, or that a cat with green eyes is superior in all ways to cats with amber eyes.  A human is a human, in the same way that a cat is a cat."

"The divisions that we make into racial categories is about as arbitrary as dividing black and white. Yes they are social constructs, but the category they reside in has real effects outside of the social systems we have created and this video does not argue against this but instead creates a strawman racist to dissect. The issue of racism is really the long standing debate of nature vs nurture, which really does go both ways a lot of the time."
"This is... a flawed understanding of race. Yes, the difference between two groups of races going just by differences in base nucleotide pairs can be considered small, but the differences themselves appear consistently; and consistently denote difference when they do appear. The 'what is aliens' is complete nonsense. We study based on samples of DNA, not on social groups, and the DNA does not lie. The overlap that occurs when testing only occurs between indigenous European phenotype and Asian phenotype.  What is something that people get wrong about race however is the 'purity' part of it, since there is always overlap, even if it is small (5-10%), but with the limited differences between groups sharing the same landmass these differences essentially mean that no race on the same landmass is pure. But Race itself 100% exists."

"Race is nothing but a concept. There is no such thing as a white person or a black person, Asian person etc. 'Human' is also a concept as are countries and 'homelands'.  When we are born we simply 'are'. We draw no distinctions as to what the objects in front of us are. We draw no distinctions as to what we are or our parents and siblings. Then we are told what things are. Suddenly the object in our hand becomes a rattle. The thing we are put in when we eat becomes a chair. This continues on until all things are named and have a place in our mind. You go to school and you are told you live in a country called America and that it shares borders with the country of Mexico and the country of Canada. You are told that the girl that is a different color than you is a different race and that, that makes her 'different.' You may or may not be told that America is the best country in the world. You're friend who does not like America may tell you that France is better. At the end of the day though these are all concepts. Countries, borders, race etc. but it doesn't end there. The thing you sit in while watching TV isn't a  chair. The TV you watch isn't a TV. Nothing is anything. Everything you have learned since the day you were born is a concept. We encounter something and we attempt to explain it in a way we can understand and we apply certain values to it based on what we have been taught by others. Someone who has no concept of money would not say that a hundred dollar bill has any value because in their reality money is not used to purchase goods and services. The world you live in does not exist outside of your own mind and chances are that world is vastly different than the world  your friends, family and people you disagree with live in as they all hold different views than you do. When you were first born and you drew no distinctions between you and the world around you, you were closer to reality than you are today."
"The easiest way for me to think about racial pride among racists is that they are proud of being inbred.  Suddenly, their fixation to keep 'their' women away from other races to prevent dominant genes from overwriting their regressive ones makes them even more pathetic."
"saddened by the lack of blackface"
"Biology student here: The term 'race' is the way of talking about a specifically maintained and established (mainly through human selection) of individuals which share a common fenotipe (and genotipe), usually associated with recessive genes. There are no such things as races in mankind if we are rigourous, but the term was taken in order to talk about the differences between the distant populations of people. Which is a big mistake, if I'm asked, as it's the perfect 'excuse' to start pontificating, generally used by people with no fucking idea of basic genetics and the evolutionary development of populations. In fact, the animals from a specific race can be and often are problematic when compared to non-race animals in good health, as the way of having and maintaining a race is through incest, and issues can emerge."
"I know I am a little late here...  but, thank you very much for this video.... I have been arguing about this word 'race' vs ethnicity since someone once asked me '..do you date outside your race?'

"So general race is often categorised by colour, with black, white and yellow (Asian), except for the fact that Asians can be any colour between white and black, and the different racial categories for Indians (Asian, Black, Brown).   So maybe it‚Äôs about national origin, except for the fact that Russia is mostly in Asia and they‚Äôre white, and the fact that many far away islands are also called Asian.   If it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre genetically close, then how close do they have to be to be categorised in a certain way? It differentiates depending on the category. Seems pretty socially constructed."

"The first part of the video assumes that ¬´race¬ª is based on genetics. It's not. It never was. It wasn't when the typology was religious. Genetics didn't exist when eugenics were around (they would have invoked it). It still isn't today. The isolation of genes pool with a specie (which allows for the process of speciation) is what defines a race. By the evolutionary definition of race their is about 40 human races... and you only ever met people with in one of them (the others are isolated Stone Age people who would die within weeks of you sneezing on them).  Some one once asked me what was the racial background of my family... That was hard to answer. See... I look white. I'm part native. My cousins look the native part. My 6/8 of my siblings are adopted from Haiti. My sister's long time boyfriend is asian. So black/White/Native/Asian? You can imagine the ¬´but that's not your family talk¬ª."

"I have had a lot of experiences that read as not white.  basically, although I look fairly white IMO, and whenever I talk about this someone will point it out thanks not really relevant. But I have more of an olive complexion dark straight hair.   however, I've had one, all through elementary school people trying to label me as native, despite my insistence I wasn't (I have since softened that stance, but at the time, I didn't really understand it, and I considered my heritage solely that of my mum's side, whose parents both immigrated to Canada in the '50s from England.) I was in the small group of first nations students who did things like watch pow-wow footage do smudges and stuff, and I was the only person who didn't identify as first nations. My mum (who also denied first nations heritage, since it wasn't on her side, and to her, it didn't really matter my dad's side since she thought of him as white) was often asked by other parents about my heritage, usually like 'Does Victoria have any first nations heritage' 'No' 'Are you sure?' like I was never allowed to in school just be white, and what strikes me, is there were other white kids in my school not treated that way, so I'm still a bit confused by it. I think it was a combination of my dad looking pretty dark, and him being a drug addict, and the area I grew up in (Vancouver Canada). I think there was some sense that my dad couldn't be white, not because of his actual look, because now as a recovered teacher, he reads as plenty white, but because of his circumstances, he was a tan man with straight black hair addicted to drugs and alcohol. Even though he looked a lot closer to the white spectrum, there's a pretty clear stereotype he was fitting into, and I fell into that. Staff and parents at my school knew who my dad was, and so they identified me as first nations, despite me never self-identifying nor my family ever identifying me that way.  These experiences though confusing, and very difficult to deal with when appropriation is brought up (I can't smudge cause I'm white, but I learned how to from first nations elders in my community and was invited to participate and given tools to maintain the tradition.) They weren't negative. I think there were more subtle negative effects though, they are harder to parse, because I'm also disabled, and I can't identify the specific reasons things happened in my school. But the staff had a distinct lack of concern for my boundaries and lack of faith in my ability to progress in society.  I feel that there are more things I'd consider racism I've experienced, but like whenever I have talked about it, I'm always told I'm wrong, which to be honest sucks, and since 99% of it is not overtly racist (I.E. I've only been called something directly racially derogatory genuinely twice, I've also been called racial slurs in a 'since you think you are treated that way' way which is really weird), but like also among my friends the common experience of racism isn't being straight up called a slur, it's subtle but yeah this is getting too complicated and personal. Just here are some feels with regards to that point.  In terms of my typical answer to ethnicity, i say that I'm half English, and half Ambiguos French Canadian.  I don't know a lot about my dad's side, but it is French Canadian with Acadian on my nana's side and goes back in Canada to the 1600's in parts. The Acadian does mean french ancestry, but the French Canadian, doesn't necessarily, it means my family was francophone and catholic, not that they originated in France, many French Canadians were not French in landing."

"I think it's interesting how closely tied language still is to racism in the US but only in the specific cases of the Arabic and Spanish languages.  Obviously language plays a part in racism in other cases but it seems like with regard to those two languages specifically the language on its own is enough to trigger the racist impulse in Americans. My grandmother was an immigrant from Spain and faced discrimination from people who thought she was Mexican purely because of her native language, when my mom, her daughter, started dating my dad, his parents explicitly told him they didn't want her in the house because of her 'race.'  I heard similar stories from the Spanish side of my family all the time growing up but I never actually faced any of it because my mom never taught me Spanish and I don't have any Spanish accent so I was always just perceived as a white American.  I've heard similar stories from Arab-American acquaintances and even seen a few articles with titles like '9/11 Robbed Me of My Whiteness' about Arab-Americans who were simply accepted as white until the September 11th attacks turned the attention of the racist mob onto them.  In a way it kind of reminds me of the old idea of the Barbarian-Greek divide being predicated on language/culture."

Because one of a couple of things would happeb; you'd be killed, imprisoned (and forcefully cast out) or wouldn't be accepted 100% in that culture. It's easy to attack someone who isn't fighting back (whites)."

"If Alien scientists saw the chart presented at 3:13 they would definitely notice clustering of certain haplotypes in certain places. Now it can be argued whether or not haplogroups are a biased categorization, but there is definitely some clustering.

"Is this a good place to say that I really hate the term 'people of color'? I mean it really grinds my gears. It just means non-white.

Grouping together all 'non-white' people, and excluding from that group any 'white' people who also suffer racial discrimination does not seem to me to be in any way helpful to the discussion about how to lessen racial discrimination in our societies."

"The biggest thing that tends to bug the shit out of me is when people argue that because forensics can identify certain gene mutations as being more common in certain ethnic groups, race and everything they want to attach to it exists. Which I mean yeah kinda but also no? The mutations in the genes forensics tend to almost exclusively focus on tend to be non-coding. Which means they aren't responsible for major protein products or the up and down-regulation of that protein in the human body. That means mutation rates are relatively high as natural selection isn't acting upon them and makes for a bit of an easier time when trying to prove someone matches a sample 'beyond all reasonable doubt' to a court of law. So assigning something as general as 'intelligence' or 'endurance running' to a specific race is total fucking bullshit considering the symphony of protein interaction needed to even begin to affect such a broad concept of human performance... when said genes are found to rarely if ever affect protein production to that degree."

"99% of chimps DNA is in us too, it's the little (biological) bits that distinguish us. Humans used to be just about as diverse as dogs are today.  People in the old days were much more comparable to dogs due to the lack of transportational technology, forcing HIGHER AMOUNTS of isolated groups to occur as opposed to our current time of widespread use of horses and cars. Some groups of humans even 'voluntarily' inbred themselves in the past/to this day with the sole intent of staying within their group. Some examples of intended/theoretical 'breeding' is that of; - European Nobles - Jews - Any hardcore patriots/nationalist groups that spans long amounts of time.  - Isolated islands/valleys where no other options are available but to stay within the group.  If you understand the rules of biology, race should be pretty straight forward. Breeding Isolation, - willingly or not will cause a group to grow differently from the rest - assuming they don't have the exact same natural and social 'preferred traits' guiding their breeding.  'But how does a group choose what to breed, stupid Fredrik S?' Simple, distressed little YouTubber; The individuals that best fills the traits deemed as 'good' within the group will be elected leaders. And leaders gets the best recources, and thus has a higher chance of leaving behind MORE OFFSPRING, most likely sharing some of the 'good' traits from the 'elected' parents. Over time, the family groups, - specifically the individuals within mentioned groups - with MORE leader-ancestor genes will have a greater reproductional rate.  *THE SOCIAL VALUES OF A GROUP BREEDS THE GROUP* *IF THE GROUP LACKS SOCIAL VALUES, THEN ENVIRONMENTAL SELECTION IS MORE GREATLY BREEDING THE GROUP*"

"I found this video interesting because it highlights how subjective race can be and how difficult to define it is and what problems can arise from that.  Being a white-skinned Brazilain living in England, I've always not quite understood where I fit in in terms of race. To elaborate- in Brazil, I am white, in England, I am white but in the US it gets more ambigious because of the different social politics there regarding latine people, and genetically it also gets more ambiguous because of my mixed white and native ancestry. However, I dont experience racial discrimination as I pass for white, but I still see members of my family go through this because of the perception of race where they live and their darker skin or non-european features.  The one common theme among the Brazil, the US and the UK (and a whole lot more of the world)  is how your proximity to whiteness affects your opportunities and how you are treated, and how far these ideals of eurocentricity reach - especially in countries that were colonised. For example, the  Brazilian government attempted to 'whiten' it's population multiple times by curbing coloured immigration and encouraging white immigration. This resulted in an even more racially tense nation, even though literally 52% of the population self-identifies as POC. This is also interesting because I've seen so many people in Brazil who self-identify as white because they are white *in relation to* that country, and so they still benefit from that benefit within Brazil. However, in England I know that they would be seen as brown, and would only benefit from privelege based on their proximity to whiteness."

"The most pathetic part of anti-race realists' line of argumentation is the dependence on Lewontin's fallacy. By extension, the blind assumption that genetic variability percentages under some seemingly low value like 1% or 3% somehow invalidates the plausibility of the statistical strength of clusters of racially differentiated gene polymorphisms upon incredibly broad-based phenotypes such as intelligence is completely ludicrous. Do anti-race realists have any idea what percentages of valid ANOVAs can be rightfully attributed to genetic factors of intelligence as opposed to all racially differentiated genetic variation? Hint: it's lower than you think. When just small handfuls of loci have been demonstrated time and time again to have significant impacts on certain traits, why would anti-race realists conclude that considering measurements of ALL genetic variation among the races as being seemingly low (as compared to what exactly?) is at all warranted?"

"Racism stems from a mentality of 'Us vs them' deeply rooted in human nature. You're merely redefining who 'Us' is and who 'Them' is. 'Our group is better, we're not bigoted racists.' Turn on, tune in, drop out, you feeble minded shitlord. This shit will keep existing in one form or the other until you let your egos die."
"Still sort of 50/50 with my ability to agree with you. Race is definitely not some hard and fast 'this is this' sort of thing, but there are physiological and inheritable traits. On the other hand psychological traits don't seem to have any ties to race/ethnicity, so if that's in someone's definition of race they've got something wrong. Previously mentioned traits form ethnicity, and cultures tied to that ethnicity and/or the regions where that ethnicity historically came from contributes to racial identity. But I'm not so sure we need to define race in some definitive way, as you mentioned the difference is negligible, with only about 10% being at all different genetically. But we also share around 60-70% of our DNA with bananas, so I think that the singular concept of 'Human Race' is more important when we refer to species, while ethnicity is more accurate in trying to define physiological trends like how the more hard-core biologically obsessed people tend to focus on. I think race itself has become rightfully so an ambiguous term with little need to clarify it, those who are happy trying to connect to the culture of their predecessors should be free to do so, some people will somewhat share physical traits, and culture's really complex but also doesn't define race.    To the point of biological race leading to Nazis, well you're technically right, but it falls more under the general trend of taking almost anything too far leading to bad ends. Those with modern biological understanding know definitively that there isn't any racial superiority, meaning that trying to find supremacy when it isn't real isn't the natural conclusion of understanding the biological trends but a combination of ignorance and trying to justify hate."

That's poisoning. I always felt very close to other Latino. Their ethnicity (white, indian or black) was anecdotal, we had share much cultural stuff.   I agree with Natalie, as we get more mixed, it will be less relevant the race, and more the person. It will be a win for everybody."

And if the only answer coming from the left is 'Race is a social construct.' that looks like an argument we're losing because anyone can look at people and say, 'That's BS!  I can see the differences!  You're gaslighting me!'  I think we need to study the issue of race with scientific rigor if for no better reason than to have an answer to white, black, and yellow.  Of course that's a childish over-simplification!  Scientific study is not going to bear that idea out.  There's no reason to be scared of the truth.  No society has ever had a problem with too many people telling the truth.  The problem is always too many people telling lies."

"the funny thing is that dog breeds are still the same species! Unlike how some of these white supremacists feel.  Race is pretty socially constructed. Even if we are to divide it to groups, it would have to to be much more than 3 of course. Then we would have to determine how? Physical superficial traits like skins, hair, and 'bone structure' of the face? Genetic diseases, 'intelligence' by IQ(even though the latter is pretty stupid since it's a more modern invention while humans have predated they society that created it). All three? the thing is, if you used anyone or all of those categories,  and you tried to stuff them into groups. especially 3, you'd have some pretty diverse looking groups. Most people in the past cared about ethic groups and cultural divides rather than race.  Physical beauty is obviously based on what you have grown up around and were told was beautiful lol. More over, we can't even put a line between what is a 'black' feature and a 'caucasian' or even white feature without running into so serious road blocks. Is kinky hair, flat Nasal bridge, big lips, dark eyes, and dark skin black or is just 1 or two of those things enough to call you black. There are a few West Africans with all of those traits, 3 of those traits, Some East Africans with one, 3, or none of those traits.We can apply with to Central and North Africans too.   Caucasians can with 2 of those traits(minus dark skin abviously unless we include about Indians). There Asians with 3 of those traits.  There are whites with light eyes, round eyes, blond hair, arched nose, staight hair and there are Asians with atleast 3 of those things (including  the light eyes). Where is the divide? Everyone who doesn't fit is now considered mixed? Who are the real blacks, whites, Asians? Whor aren't? One section of Africa, Europe, or Asia? I can't see how at this point one can even say this matters anymore."

"Looking through the comments I am shocked at the fact that no one brings up the concept of species.  While it is true that the idea of race originates from biology, introduced by the forefathers of taxonomy (e.g. Linnaeus), the concepts discussed in this video are all but abandoned in modern biology. Exceptions are, as stated in the video, are anthropological studies and the like although their classifications nowadays have very little to do with what is politically perceived as a race.  Biologist know that the concept of race is silly, which is why any modern classification of animals stops at the species level. Now you may ask how this is defined and you may expect this to be some arbitrary bullshit, but surprise it's not. If a member of any given species can have sex with another member of the same species and produce fertile offspring then these individuals are part of the same species. Now guess what? We Humans are all part of the same species! And personally I don‚Äôt think that more needs to be said about that.  Now it is true that, in dogs or pigeons, breeders distinguish between different races. These are, as alluded to in the video, the result of targeted and painstaking human selection. But this just further highlights the sheer stupidity of the concept of race. I can take almost any couple of dogs of any race and through selective breeding turn them back to their original form i.e. a wolf. That means for those that haven't caught on yet, Yes, I can turn a pitbull into a chihuahua using only pitbulls!"

"I would like to say at the outset that I enjoy your videos. But 15 percent genetic difference between races is the equivalent difference between coyotes and wolves. Futhermore, even difference in a single gene such as the gene responsible for dwarfism produces profound consequences. If one gene can have consequences that profound and we acknowledge that racial genetic differences extend well beyond a single gene there is room for arguments about genetically founded differences between races. And I would go on to say, that just because people are distinct from you doesn't necessarily justify treating them differently as individuals. I'm sorry but predicating moral arguments about how we should treat other races upon the facticity of scientifically distinct races leaves the door wide open for scientific investigation justifying racist policy. The argument is not that race does or does not exist, it is that regardless of that we have moral responsibility towards beings with desires,values, expectations and capacity for suffering. Insofar as we value the individual being of other beings we are not allowed to violate that because of classification and ethinic grouping. (This extends to animals to you fuckers.)"
"I have no objections considering Gowin's law, but I do object that everyone now days puts homosexuals on the first place, when listing target groups which nazis have harmed. Homosexuals, actually, should be listed last, because they suffered the least. Jews should be on the first place. Roma would be second, Serbs on the third, most probably (and they were the only ones, AFAIK, who's children were targeted in specialized concentration camp for Serbian children named Stara Gradiska), communists most probably on the fourth . All these were murdered in numbers more than few hundred thousands, mostly in concentration camps. There were only five to fifteen thousand homosexuals in concentration camps,  and 'only' 60% of those were murdered. I said 'only' because that is far less than a number of murdered people of other targeted groups, though, every murder of an innocent person is horrible (specially in a concentration camp), but it is just wrong to list them first. And when you are listing, and you chose not to list some groups, than chose not to list those groups that were least harmed. I'm not whining, I'm just suggesting that you do some more serious research."

"I grew up in the UK and now live in New Zealand. While I'm certainly not colour blind I do find that race is often a secondary categorisation for me and I'm prone to categorisation 'errors'.  In New Zealand we usually refer to ethnicity and ethnic groups rather than race, and that links a lot to culture. So I'd be categorized by others, and categorize myself, as 'European', 'New Zealand European', or 'Pakeha' (a Maori word which a few people consider offensive) rather than 'white' or 'caucasian', and while those terms would lead people to conculsions about my skin colour and probably social status/privilege it would be part of a bigger picture. Likewise, Maori (the indigenous people, about 20% of the population) are generally brown-skinned, but 'being Maori' means so much more than that, and that's implicit in the word. And within traditional Maori society your tribal affiliation, traced by ancestry, is hugely significant.  In the UK, class has long been, and arguably still is, the most significant category: everything from how you speak and the clothes you wear to your probable career, income, and marriage options will be influenced by the class into which you are born.  The thing is, arguing for a biological basis for ethnicity/culture and class seems self-evidently silly to most people, whereas race is accepted as a biological  (rather than sociological) fact by so many people."

There is no scientific definition of a labrador retriever; only a set of agreed upon and arbitrary aesthetic criteria only met by a certain number of dogs, with innumerable 'mix' dogs not conforming to the category.  In short, dog breeds are no more scientific than ideas about human race and they are all just Canis lupus familiaris with different phenotypes.  It is all just social construct."
"‚ô• thank you for all your work!"
"Oh my god, you are everything, finally, I've gone through this thought experiment many times where I think, where does one race end and another begin, and can you divide conventional races that you would see described, in, say, America into smaller groups, and can you put some groups together. And the answer is yes. In Rwanda, for example, what many people in the United States would consider black/African simply doesn't cut it in Rwanda, and neighboring areas, such as the nation of Burundi people are divided into two major groups, Hutu and Tutsi, this division would seem completely arbitrary to those outside, and while Hutu and Tutsi peopl are different tribes, racial differences during the Rwandan genocide were completely manufactured and unfounded, yet for some they existed as clearly as the difference between white and black people (which is to say poorly, but they felt like there had to be one, so, into existence it came) this ethnic tension infamously led to the Rwandan Genocide in the 90s. Now conversely, you can combine two 'races' for example, the same Americans that cannot tell the difference between Hutu and Tutsi have a hard time telling the difference between, say, Indians and Middle Eastern people, because the lines are blurred, they are ofcourse, but even people of no super-close relation can be confused, mixed race people are famously hard to tell apart, such was the case in America when that one guy tried to get on a whites-only train care and was initially allowed because the guy who let him on thought he was white, other passengers, though, thought otherwise, he sued and lost the SCOTUS case of Plessy v. Ferguson, that upheld the segregation of train cars, even in the face of someone who flew in the face of their racist views."

"Sometimes race is too socially constructed by people. All these brown people having strong feelings about being 'white' to them, though white is the subject of a very different and not-positive debate. If they believe in privilege, it's as though they want to be shot down by other people for this 'privilege'. Otherwise, they just come off as kind of insane. And I hate being called white because I'm less brown, or due to a belligerent perception of physics and reality. This particularly, sometimes, bothers me as a half black person. Would someone try to force being white down my throat if I were blacker?"

"I believe that the human race is one single race with variants based on worldly location and development of different cultures (which is usually attributed to the environment a sub-race devolved in genetically). Wolves and dogs and foxes are all the same race, just with genetic variants each developed in order to survive. So i guess what im trying to say is I agree that race is in a way a social construct but only in the sense that humans broke down variants  and turned sub-races into their own individual races as a way to feel more unique and superior to other sub-races."

"The entire angle that this video takes is based on the low-hanging fruit arguments of people who have no business discussing the subject. Subspecies (as race doesn't really work when talking about the actual application of the term) of humanity exist in their variance due to early-humanity having different environments that they had to adhere to.   Natural selection first and foremost had to do with those who couldn't meet environmental demands, and effectively, you can identify negative (absent) aspects of human genetics more easily than the positive (identifiable) traits. The distinction between 'racial' (subspecies, again, works better. Doesn't quite roll off the tongue though) demographics can be cemented in the simple observation that, if everything was epigenetics, then any human would have the capacity to survive in any environment, and the basis of attraction towards men and women wouldn't orient towards specialization of traits.   Very blatantly, Europeans are 'white' because those with less melanin in their skin had a better chance of surviving in Europe, where they were able to absorb more Vitamin D (at least that's what I've gathered so far, correct me if I'm wrong), especially in an environment that had a thicker atmosphere, and foliage varying from habitable African environments for humans, with the underlying theme here being malnutrition leading to a lower chance of survival. From there, the migrant European population had to adapt to seasonal weather, conceptualize complex structure creation, and drastically alter resource gathering/hunting methods in order to meet environmental demands and survive. Obviously, those who couldn't keep up died, leaving only the stronger and smarter individuals of the demographic to survive in an extremely harsh and relatively new climate.   Africa (for the sake of example) has a much less dynamic climate, required different resource-gathering/hunting methods, etc. with a different standard of selection and specialization, suited for a different environment, there is going to be a distinct difference in applicable traits as well as seemingly superficial ones.   This doesn't innately lead to any conclusion of races being superior or inferior, though it establishes the fundamental and driving forces that cement the genuine variance of the human subspecies. From there, you can further move on to observe what sort of environments various subspecies prosper or suffer decline within and make your own observation(s).  It's not just a social construct, and the genetic variance isn't something to be dismissed."

"Oh boy! I see a demand there, a demand to bring science back to society, and not for it to function as a secluded bubble of academia! Let us not forget that we change and debate the definitions of categories of levels biological organisation constantly, e.g. we don't even agree to a universal idea of what a species is, let alone a race or breed (terms not used much anyways in a world of phylogenetics). Linnean approaches to taxonomy are often debated today, and many scientists try to find different approaches that are less obviously 'hierarchical' (that could be understood in a different way, hierarchy is still necessary, but not in a 2>1 meaning). Popular society uses terms in ultimate definitions, drawing from science, but not considering that science doesn't deal in absolutes, and that's coming from an evolutionary biologist. Chapeu, that was great to watch my friend, nice work."

"Your lack of historic perspective is showing. A common ailment among modern people.   Aristotle wasn't intent on justifying slavery. Before Christianity took over, people's souls - especially those of ancient Greeks' - weren't ruled by the slaves' notion of morality. In those days, people believed in hierarchy, and power over others was sought openly; they didn't feel the need to come up with plebeian (Christian) excuses for why they are invading and enslaving neighboring peoples, unlike in the post-Greek and post-Roman world where rulers are obligated to find an excuse for their military and political ambitions, all in order to appease the sheep they rule over, or more precisely, to justify themselves before the ideal which rules their sheep's souls, namely Christianity."

First there is no race, then we're suddenly seperated into groups and 'breeding outside of our group', then suddenly there's no race again, then race is only relevant when 'white people' are responsible for the shortcomings of other races. I'm really confused. Race is a biological fact, especially amongst archeologists that needs to understand race, due to them working with ancient bones. If there is no race, then there are no racists. Science, biology, archeology and more can confirm the realism of race. There is no 'gene flow' happening. If you knew history of mankind, then you would know how seperated people lived back in the days without planes, cars, boats, etc. People lived close to or in their communities from they were born till they were dead, mixing with other groups was not a common thing until recent years. Read up on history and biology."
"I recently read something that said the variance among individual chimps is greater than it is among individual humans. It went as far to say that The two sub-species of chimps vary more genetically than humans do globally.

"Again, lots of false shit here. Invoking Lewontin's fallacy straight away. And then you utilize haplogroups as though these are foundations of genetic makeup, when all they show is old migratory patterns.  Now you have some point regarding the distinctions of race given that there has been gene exchange at the borders, but this of course doesn't negate biological groupings entirely. We can still see clusters form generally along continental lines.   Honestly I could argue your position a lot better than you have here. This is fairly weak from a biologist's perspective.

If sjw weren't so afraid of the validity of the concept of white supremacy, they wouldn't spend so much time trying to debunk it, they never spend time debunking Indian or black supremacist concepts, because they don't believe they are a real concept in the first place, so they give credentials and validation to white supremacist ideas, which is counter to their narrative."

"the larger biological difference within groups makes the smaller biological difference between different groups no less relevant.

As for your joke about measuring skullls, I know absolutely that what you're talking about is pseudoscience however you can definitely see significant differences in skulls... for example. https://jewamongyou.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/aboriginal-vs-slav.jpg Then you make a point about physical attributes not being a good indicator of genetics because of anecdotal evidence of black white people and white black people. Yes, its certainly possible to deviate from your most likely physical attributes based on parental genetics, but this is the exception not the rule.  Personally, I most certainly have prejudices when it comes to race and whilst these prejudices are usually the result of social construct not their genetics, they're still clearly definable as a group by physical manifestations of their genetics. I absolutely give every individual the benefit of the doubt when pitted against my prejudices and would never dream of treating anyone different solely based on my own prejudices, but confirmation bios or not if I have a prejudice then it was forged through my own experience and and reaffirmed far more often than not.  My thought is that you did your research and really pushed to fit it in with the values you and your subscribers hold.  Well.... if I agreed with EVERYTHING someone said it'd be scary... so I'm glad you're wrong about this.. hahahha"

"Ok, but why has only one white man ever run the 100m in under 10 seconds? That's not  social construct, we can measure the biological reasons for it objectively (white people on average probably have better access to equipment, nutrition and training, the social aspect can't beat the racial aspect). So different groups do have different characteristics on average, it therefor seems a bit silly to say that these differences end below the neck. This conversation is too abstract though, we'd have to be discussing what you want to do with race.   I don't agree we need a white ethnostate, I think immigration should be blind to race, but I'm not surprised when children of different races from the same neighbourhoods have different outcomes on average. But I suppose I'm just an ignorant nazi troll.   I really respect you for bringing this topic up Contra. You may not believe it, but even though I am right-wing I find the alt-right as troubling as you do. This unwillingness to talk about race means that 99% of the videos on race on youtube are from people presenting one side, and that's scary"

"I really want to enjoy this channel, but this is too fuckin weird."
"Let me start with firstly thanking you for exploring this topic in this amazing manner. In the past three weeks I came across your channel thanks to a Philosophy Tube shout out regarding your videos on White Supremacy and the internet Alt-Right. I have been enjoying going through so many of them and love your style of entertaining and hitting stuff head on. I also thank you for having the courage many like me lack to even attempt to seriously make a video for thousands to view, let alone with such artistic presentation. I wish I had come across your material much earlier.  Regarding this video, I think you made a massive jump from Ancient Greece to 17th century Iberian Colonialism and Slave Trade. In doing so you are only focusing on European 'scientific' racism ignoring its close encounters with other empires and adaptation of those ideas to be the roots, this is especially the case in the historical relationship between Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, of this racism.   Thus leaving out important examples like the 9th century Zanj Plantations in Southern Iraq and Khuzestan Province in which scientific racism was used to construct and maintain its existence under the Abbasid Empire.  As well as 14th century North African race classifications to justify the nations that are 'submissive to slavery,' most famously the ideas of Moroccan geographer Ibn Battuta and the Tunisian sociologists Ibn Khaldun. Which due to Geographical proximity and ten centuries of Arab/North African Barber rule of the Iberian Peninsula resulted in the exchange of those ideas and pseudo-knowledge.  To clarify in no way shape or form I'm excusing the European contribution to genocidal ideas, but want a more rounded factual assessment of historical material reality that is not simply Eurocentric. Furthermore, exploring the origins is an avenue which does not justify the consequential product. Also to satisfy the facts ignoring identity politics warriors of the interwebs, (which I must say was so brilliant addressing in one of my favourite videos of yours TERFs) I am of East African and South Arabian background and this topic of the post-Roman Arab empires origins of 'Scientific' Racism is of a particular interest to me, as it shaped my ancestral composition.

"Forgive the copy and paste..not too long -   Chomsky on IQ and Inequality  Noam Chomsky is a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a leading public intellectual, intervening on many of the most controversial issues of the time. He is credited as being the most cited living intellectual. Not only has Chomsky made a substantial contribution to theoretical linguistics; he has also engaged critically with other traditions and intellectual trends. One such critical engagement was with Richard Herrnstein in 1972. With Charles Murray, Herrnstein was later to publish a widely read and controversial book, The Bell Curve. Herrnstein and Murray argue that social inequality (including racial inequality) is the result of inherited variations in IQ. Here, Chomsky presents his critique of Herrnstein‚Äôs position:  Herrnstein‚Äôs argument is based first of all on the hypothesis that differences in mental abilities are inherited and that people close to one another in mental ability are more likely to marry and reproduce so that there will be a tendency toward long-term stratification by mental ability (which Herrnstein takes to be measured by I.Q). Secondly, Herrnstein argues that ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô requires mental ability and that social rewards ‚Äòdepend on success‚Äô. This step in the argument embodies two assumptions: that it is so in fact; and that it must be so for society to function effectively. The conclusion is that there is a tendency toward hereditary meritocracy, with ‚Äòsocial standing (which reflects earnings and prestige)‚Äô concentrated in groups with higher I.Q.s. This tendency will be accelerated as society becomes more egalitarian, that is, as artificial social barriers are eliminated, defects in prenatal (e.g., nutritional) environment are overcome, and so on, so that natural ability can play a more direct role in attainment of social reward. Therefore, as society becomes more egalitarian, social rewards will be concentrated in a hereditary meritocratic elite ‚Ä¶  For Herrnstein‚Äôs argument to have any force at all we must assume that people labor only for gain, and that the satisfaction found in interesting or socially beneficial work or in work well-done or in the respect shown to such activities, is not a sufficient ‚Äògain‚Äô to induce anyone to work. The assumption, in short, is that without material reward, people will vegetate. For this crucial assumption, no semblance of an argument is offered. Rather, Herrnstein merely asserts that if bakers and lumberjacks ‚Äògot the top salaries and the top social approval‚Äô, in place of those now at the top of the social ladder, then ‚Äòthe scale of I.Q.s would also invert‚Äô, and the most talented would strive to become bakers and lumberjacks. This, of course, is not an argument, but merely a reiteration of the claim that, necessarily, individuals work only for extrinsic reward. Furthermore, it is an extremely implausible claim. I doubt very much that Herrnstein would become a baker or lumberjack if he could earn more money that way ‚Ä¶ [His] assumption that people will work only gain in wealth and power is not only unargued, but quite probably false, except under extreme deprivation. But this degrading and brutal assumption, common to capitalist ideology and the behaviorist view of human beings, is fundamental to Herrnstein‚Äôs argument ‚Ä¶  Consider further Herrnstein‚Äôs assumption that in fact social rewards accrue to those who perform beneficial and needed services. He claims that the ‚Äògradient of occupations‚Äô is ‚Äòa natural measure of value and scarcity‚Äô, and that ‚Äòthe ties among I.Q., occupation, and social standing make practical sense‚Äô ‚Ä¶ To assume that society‚Äôs rewards go to those who have performed a social service is to succumb to essentially the same fallacy (among others) involved in the claim that a free market leads to the optimal satisfaction of wants. In fact, when wealth is badly distributed, a free market will tend to produce luxuries for the few who can pay, rather than necessities for the many who cannot. Similarly, given great inequalities of wealth, we will expect to find that the ‚Äògradient of occupations‚Äô by pay is a natural measure, not of service to society but of service to wealth and power, to those who can purchase and compel. The ties among I.Q., occupation, and social standing that Herrnstein notes make ‚Äòpractical sense‚Äô for those with wealth and power, but not necessarily for society or its members in general ‚Ä¶  [Moreover], the question of the relation, if any, between race and intelligence has very little scientific importance (as it has no social importance, except under the assumptions of a racist society) ‚Ä¶ As to social importance, a correlation between race and mean I.Q. (were this shown to exist) entails no social consequences except in a racist society in which each individual is assigned to a racial category and dealt with not as an individual in his own right, but as a representative of this category ‚Ä¶ In a non-racist society, the category of race would be of no greater significance [than height]. The mean I.Q. of individuals of a certain racial background is irrelevant to the situation of a particular individual, who is what he is. Recognizing this perfectly obvious fact, we are left with little, if any, plausible justification for an interest in the relation between mean I.Q. and race, apart from the ‚Äòjustification‚Äô provided by the existence of racial discrimination."

I could identify as mixed race if I wanted, I suppose, but I don't. I still think of myself as white, because I have no connection to South East Asian identity- I didn't grow up with any cultural connections, I don't 'look' South East Asian (or even mixed race really), I've never experienced the stereotypes and discrimination a lot of SE Asian people do. I don't really see a point in identifying as mixed race or SE Asian in the way that I see a point in identifying as Ashkenazi- where I've grown up with those cultural traditions, I grew up knowing I was Ashkenazi, I've experienced anti-Semitism etc."

"Yes the distinctions between races are socially constructed and arbitrary. But sjws claiming that therefore it doesn't exist or has no basis in biology are stupid.  Race like gender lies in the eye of the observer. If someone looks mexican people will assume stuff about his cultural heritage and ancestry even if it might be wrong to do so. The human mind wants to categorize to simplify the world whereby some nuance is neccesarily lost.  There are however some differences within populations, that may in part be biological although I doubt it. In contrast to gender I fall farther on the nurture side in regards to race. I believe the differences between ethnicities are largely cultural but therefore not unimportant. And yes discrimination has influence in this but discrimination is also not the solution. There have been laws in the US predominantly effecting africans americans negatively and we need programs to predominantley help them. Note not uniquely but by adressing their general issues (poverty, crime, fatherlessness, education, job opportunities). This can be done in a non discriminatory fashion and is in fact admirable. Harping on about the systematic or past discrimination that has led to your current situation is not helpful in fixing it. It might in fact be worsening it (eg. Poisoning the dialogue, polarizing the issue and overall distraction)"

"race is hullabaloo"
"There are a lot of obvious mistakes made in this video and a bunch of ones that forced me to do some research.  Yes, race was a a social construct but that doesn't make it any less real. All of social construct means is that it has been defined by man. So a man noticing reality and applying a definition to it is a social construct. Water is a socially constructed term but it doesn't mean that water doesn't exist except as a social construct. Even your own haploid graphic shows very clear groups of different races. The lines of what constitute a race could be drawn differently but there are clear differences. The most obvious lines would be black, white, Asian. People from the middle east represent a middle group who are still varied enough to possibly warrant being considered there own racial group. Also divisions could be made between American Indians, south and east Asian, and the Indigenous people of Australia.   The lines that were chosen however were based on the most obvious distinctions and at a time before modern genetics. However, this doesn't make them any less valid.   So race does exist but we should probably attempt to understand it better and consider the borders of the racial groups more carefully. However, denying that races exist is not a proper way of moving the real science forward."

However the biological foundations between primates including the tracing of common ancestors such as Neanderthals for Caucasians and Homo Denisovans for Eurasians (regardless of humanities lack of homogeneity) is substantive.  Therefore ancestral variants are rooted in biology which in part explains the behavioural, cognitive and phenotypical variations between races.

On the other end of the spectrum, in Europe there are whole groups of people who are considered 'white' in America (the Continent) but who are considered people of color; the Rromani, the Jewish, the Sammi, even the Mediterrenean are considered not-white in Europe. If race is such an undeniable biological fact, how come different people have such different interpretations of it?"

(And, by implication, Race Realism today will lead to those terrible things); therefore, race isn't a thing  5) Certain populations are being fucked over (by White men, of course), and their resulting poverty is causing physical differences, which are then being, mistakenly, read as genetic differences; therefore, race is a social construct."

"As always, your presentation of this subject is very entertaining... I just wish you'd try a little harder to not let you're obvious (PC) bias' shine through.  You present most of these findings as Fact.  Although, most is very well researched and contains a lot of facts, it's the deliberate 'untruths' and bias that I have a problem with.  First, the 'fact' that Greeks didn't have Slaves, is a total fabrication, or just bad research.  Throughout history, stronger groups of people enslaved peoples that they conquered, so they could sit around and contemplate life and the universe, without having to do mundane tasks, like wiping their own asses.  The Greeks were definitely, no exception, in their self-centered arrogance.  The reason that the US seems to be singled out for slavery, is because we were the last of the 'westernized' nations to outlaw slavery... although, slavery still existed in other parts of the world and underworld... even today.  And, about your bias' ... I see this in most of your videos.  You seem to have a subtle bias against white men... seemingly, due to some desire to impress the far-leftist, PC Culture (I say this, because you seem to be more intelligent than most of your opinions, which should make you more of a skeptic)... and, possibly the reason you no longer what to be thought of as a white man?  Seriously, I had more respect for you when you were a cross-dresser.  It's like, one day, you woke up and said 'I'm queer now', and that's that.  I know there is probably a lot more to this, but, from a viewers stand point, it looks like you're just pandering to PC Culture... the same reason most, but not all, Female to Male transgenders don't want to be associated with their 'maleness', so they make up 70+ gender labels.  I have more respect for the ones who legitimately feel like they're men, and are proud of it, and embrace their masculinity... toxic or not! :P"

Litterature? Well if you can¬¥t write a good story for anyone. Then don¬¥t. Instead work on your biceps, dress like a sexy office secretary(Job well done on that by the way) & make a living of off YT. There you go! Perfect plan"

It has actually been well established in the scientific community. The only people who are still using the Out of Africa Theory are people who have social political agenda to push.    You can look up the studies yourself if you want. You can look up Anatole A. Klyosov and Igor L. Rozhanski, two many of the geneticists who were actually trying to prove the theory and ended up disproving it.  Again this is common knowledge in the scientific community."
"i love you"
"Explain why gender is not analogous to race in the way that you have defined it here."
"ContraPoints, thank you for making this video. I recently found your channel and find your content both informative and funny. Race is a social construct and not biological. Even  the Irish, Italians (of which I am one), Jewish people etc at one point were seen as non-white, but race does have real world implications that leads to discrimination towards minorities like African Americans, Asians, Arabs and so on. Do you think that is a good way to define it?"
"0.0 .. ooo, I like Anime you."
"5:52 - 6:11 yessss I always say this when people talk about Italians and if they're 'white' or not. South Italians in Italy (such as people with roots in Sicily, Campania and Calabria) are often not considered 'white' there because most of them have mixed ancestry with North African and Middle Eastern countries (since they all border the Mediterranean Sea), but you hear 'Italian' here and nowadays people just count us as white since Italy is technically a European country. However, my ancestors were not considered white by Americans when they arrived here. I think that's why racial distinctions are really stupid and don't work because not everyone from everywhere in their respective continent of origin necessarily fits the bill of that racial label. The world has a history of invasions and interracial breeding so you can't just put someone in a box just from the way they look or by their parent's heritage or continent of origin."
"Lot of hard leftists commenting here. Hmmm, maybe they have an incentive to deny race to reconcile with their blank slate worldview? 70% of biologists surveyed accept that race exists. A hard-leftist race-denier did the surveys, look it up."

"6:25 Suddenly, ASMR."
"You begin with what's called Lewontin's fallacy, which was critiqued by Richard Dawkins in 'The Ancestor's Tale', he writes,   'However small the racial partition of the total variation may be, if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlate with other racial characteristics, they are by definition informative, and therefore of taxonomic significance.'  Further, according to the haplogroup map you used in the video, there is a clear correlation between a specific abundance of a particular haplogroup and a geographical location, no matter how much overlap there may be between regions. You then state that racial categorization is thus arbitrary when clearly, based on the map in the video, there is a distinct correlation between prevalence of a specific haplogroup and a geographical region. So perhaps by virtue of the inadequacy of generalizations, 'black, white, and asian' may not be _perfect_ in describing ethnicity, they are none the less valid in their description."
"Contrapoints. I want to make it clear, if SJWs spoke like you and didn't act like a bunch of ninnies, many of those Alt-Right dipshits would have a serious run for their money. Many of them can't come up with full sentences let alone coherent arguments. You really cut so deep into these issues it isn't funny.  I only wished you could cover it a bit longer, but I do know some other videos that do. Kudos dude."

"ok i have a problem i need to clarify (and you may not even answer this so hey, yo, guess i might never know)  You made the point that 'colorblindness is not the answer.' When you say that, what exactly do you mean? If you mean 'don't ignore the injustices some members of minorities face because of their skin color' then i get behind that, it should still be addressed. But typically I've viewed the term 'colorblind' in this sense as meaning 'not treating someone different because of their skin color' so which definition do you mean? if it is the latter, than I have some serious problems. But that might not be what you're saying so I wanted some clarification."

You were trying to avoid being controversial and also avoid being factually wrong, but by doing both, it comes off as too mild. The truth is that race realism and the facts ARE controversial, and you probably can't do justice to race realism without pissing a lot of people off."

"to those who want to learn more about this stuff, i highly recommend the writings of audrey smedley, particularly her book 'race in north america.' i read it earlier this year and learned a lot about how and when the rise of racial ideology occurred, how it affected the institution of slavery until it became inextricably entwined with it, and the role of 'race science' in reinforcing the worldview and the institutions that were seemingly justified by such ideology."
"Is that an actual skull you're handling or a model?"
"Why don't you race deniers just admit you position is based on politics? No one buys your BS. I have a GED and I know race is the result of a groups adapting their environment; hair, skin, eye color, bone density, and fertility rates are the product of *evolution* Remember evolution? The idea that the above characteristics would change but the brain would stay the same among the races is sexissocial construct level absurd.  You have no testable observable data to prove no race exist, IQ variants don't exists, or IQ test doesn't measure anything, Like with AGW, you have to rely on personal attacks, squid ink,outright lies, and a compliant scientific/media establishment.  The OP needs views, fine, but most people are scientific literate enough to see RD as the politically charged drivel that it is, and those who are not don't matter. I guess it's possible that most of you believe it...  From a comment below:  *Great video, yes race 'realism' is dangerous and has a bad history in  the United States. It was used to justify slavery, Indian Removal &  extermination, and exclusion of certain immigrant groups.*  At the end of the day this is what race denial is about for most of you. Just be honest about it."
"Race is a consequential construct of the limitations of our senses, not our social interactions.   With this logic any catagory is a social construct, but non social creatures also happen to be capeable of catagorising things by colour, etc.   'Race is a social construct' is usually coined to mean that race is abstract and therefore can be transcended, which it is not. Calling it a social construct is a misleading and a poor choice of words.   If you were to try to catagorise people by any arbitrary characterists, DNA is an outright terrible idea because it takes millions of years of seperation for significant differences to emerge and even then classifying people by DNA is highly inefficient. Use this to fight the 'race realists'.   This is just the interpretivists salvaging poor observations as best they can with semantics."
"I wanted to say something about the possible irony that Aristotle has to his idea of the 'natural slave', and the way that Rachael Donezal in fact fetishises  people who are black, as well as other points, but really what I want to say is that blue lipstick suits no-one, and is even worse on those whose base make-up is yellow-toned. Otherwise I have appreciated how you make-up skills have been progressing, because I am I silly person and this is what I care about."

"Dear Black People,  you're the reason racism still exists"
"Enjoyed the video - i'm not sure what, but something seemed to be missing. The Ham and Shem stuff might have deserved more than a passing reference, as it at least acknowledged a common ancestry in the period's attempts at anthropology. I think you were also a bit too quick to dismiss being 'colour blind'. It seemed like you wanted to cut off that idea before it was raised, but I didn't really understand the logic.  I get that race is not irrelevant to people's lived experiences, but if the idea of races only exists because we imagine them to, and humanity is better without an inherently political concept like race, and if race is going to get more and more ambiguous, why wouldn't you want to consider race irrelevant?"
"c0nc0rdance's videos on the subject have been my go to for arguments with race realists for years, as soon as I saw you shoutout to him, I knew this would be good."
"Okay I'm curious as to how you'd rationalize this.  In your video on gender you emphasized the fact that not all people fit into the binary, and thus the current binary categories are insufficient for representing the experience of sexual difference. Your solution here seems to be to construct new categories for those who exist 'in between', so to speak. Yet here (@ 3:20) you made similar observations about racial categories yet your solution is to de-emphasize the focus on categories.  This is why I agree with you (mostly) in this video, but not in your video on gender. In my view the attempts to construct concrete categories for every single variation in the human experience is part of the problem of identity, which is what you did regarding gender, but notably (and commendably) not regarding race. In reality no category will ever perfectly encapsulate the human experience, and that is just a natural limitation of language. The reason I am opposed to identity politics in general is the overemphasis on categories and groups, rather than the individual experience, which eliminates the real experiences of individuals in factor of idealized, abstract, and broadly imaginary concepts of 'groups'.  TL;DR: You rightly avoid obsessive group categorization in this video, yet it was the basis for your video on gender. In my view the problem is categorization itself. How do you square this circle?"

"In my opinion, Paris Jackson is a more interesting case of racial ambiguity than Rachel Dolezal. MJ raised his daughter to be proud of her black heritage. She believes his claim that he was her biological father, but most of the public is highly skeptical. Either way, she was raised by a black family and socialized as a black (or biracial) girl. One can't simply dismiss her lived experience, even though she clearly benefits from being conventionally beautiful by European standards.  Not to go down the Rachel Dolezal rabbit hole, but racial identity is not cut-and-dried. It's a combo of what you know (or believe) about you heritage and what other people assume about it. In other words, it exists somewhere between self-identification and others' perception. Take my childhood best friend for example. She's Italian, but, all her life, people have assumed she was Latina or even black. This misperception doesn't change her ancestry, of course, but it has an undeniable impact upon her life and the way people treat her."

Because it's funny: you obviously did your research and know when race theory was first concocted and what it is, but you seem to be unable to connect the dots between that and the contemporary feminist theory of 'intersectionality'."
"Bravo!"
"Oh god, some of those comments!  I don't know what's sadder. The prevalence of 'race is obvious' (so is the 'fact' that the sun spins around the earth. Just look at it rising), that 'social construct = not real' (because money, the police and 1600 years of nobility through divine right were all not real) or that these people really think that they represent some 'edgy true science' instead of holding to overhauled and dumb ideas.  Anyways, keep up the good work Contra. Love the lipstick."

"All systems of categorizations to do with living things, like race, are inherently error prone. But this doesn't make them useless as ContraPoints points out. This, and it seems a pending video on the same subject, are attempts to throw a scientific model out of the window because it has been used to bad ends. If we were to apply that rule consistently in every domain of science then we would have very little of anything left. Denial is not the answer."
"Great video but it would have been nice to see you talk about the connections between racism and capitalism. Well more like capitalism giving birth to racism as European settlers had to justify genocides, slavery, colonialism and imperialism for profit somehow and they did so using racism. Also I do not think that Rachael Dolezal is a good case to use to show the ambiguity around race; a more suiting candidate would have been a PoC who happens to be white-passing ( personally I do still consider white-passing black people 'black' but with privilege. There is a longgg history of light skin black people 'passing' as white in order to gain a better life). And that's something that black people talk about all the time,  what makes someone black ( having two fully white parents and living half of life as a white woman before taking an Africana class and then out of white guilt/ curiosity decide to 'adopt' what you think 'blackness' is and walk around in blackface for 10+ years  certainly doesn't)."
"Interesting how we can identify ancestry (race) through brain shape. But I am sure innate equality is real and that race is a meaningless variable. I am sure that will remain tenable"
"Just on an extra note on the Greeks Aristotle did say that the climate which people grew in shaped there nature and culture in a strange sort of environmental determinism. The people from the warmer south were studious but lacked the faculties for freedom and lived in slave societies i.e Egypt while those from the colder North were free but lacked the discipline for civilization i.e the 'Celts'. While surprise surprise the Greeks and by extension later the Romans being in between were both naturally civilized and free. http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.7.seven.html look up part 7"

"i've heard a lot of people claim that there are certain diseases that are more common in one race. is that true or not? is that based on the persons origin or some physical characteristics. like i can imagine a white person would be more likely to suffer from skin cancer because they have lighter skin, but then i saw people who would be considered white in italy that have darker skin than some light skin black people so idk.. another thing. i don't think that somebody who appears completely white like that twin girl you showed in the video could be considered black just because she has black parents, because she would pretty much have the same experience as a white person adopted by black parents. that's not to say that race is just about appearance, but your appearance does effect how others perceive you and how you perceive yourself. like let's work form the assumption that it's wrong for white people to say the n word since it will never be used against them to belittle them. that would also apply to the white looking twin in the video. if she was cast as rue from hunger games there wouldn't be a racist backlash against her and i also don't thing she would be seen as representation for black people.  but then you have dolezal who was perceived as black, but i still would not consider her black. i think what makes it so offensive about dolezal is that she altered her appearance, because she felt like she is black, which basically says to me that she thinks about black people in stereotypes. when people questioned her identity she lied and used plack people as props in her lies. and tbh it seems to me she kinda wanted to be part of the oppressed class, because that's seen almost as a good think in certain sjw groups. like i've seen a lot of white sjws gush over how brave and perfect and strong black women are just for existing which it kinda seems fetishizing oppression to me. i don't know if you watched shaun's video about frog men where he mentions that being oppressed seems romantic to these people. i think that also applies to a lot of white sjws in particular.  but if dolezal really would experience anti-black racism it would be misdirected and it wouldn't make her black since she could easily just go back to looking her white self. sorry for this long ramble, i hope any of it made sense. great video btw <3 still waiting for your asmr channel"
"If anyone wants to compare humans to another animal in regards to race, better to compare us to house cats than dogs. Think about the average house cat. Their coats come in all kinds of colours, even if the parents have the same kind of fur, the pattern can be different. But, despite the differences, they're still the same species. They're still house cats. Variations in human beings follows the same kind of style: we have different coats, but we're all human."
"Good video. In the future, I'm going to identify as black so I can take advantage of being a minority too. Why not? Since race is 'just a social construct' I am free to do so after all. It's just like changing your clothes. New day, new race/gender/etc."

Reminds me of that saying when ever somebody denies reality they say black is white, but it seems in this case you have it reversed.  I can see why you cannot admit saying you are black does not make you black given the cognitive dissidence it would cause, but it sort of puts everything else out of your mouth on really shaky footing.  Global warming is real, and that's not a basket ball its a chicken. I mean if you go back far enough a chicken was most likely involved in the process that made that ball, it really is a hard line to draw......"

"no matter what you wanna Call it. anchestry or race. forensic science  tells me you are wrong Anthropologists also attempt to identify¬†ancestry¬†as part of a biological profile. In our society, the term 'race' is often used to refer to population differences. However, races do not exist in the biological sense and anthropologists prefer the term ancestry. To assess ancestry, anthropologists look for skeletal features that tend to be more common in some populations than others. They cannot determine skin or eye colour, but they may be able to place an individual into one of three broad geographic categories: European, African, or Asian. Importantly, while people with similar ancestry tend to share certain characteristics, humans vary more within populations than between them and there is a high degree of overlap. It is also important to remember that in forensic investigations, recognition and identification are the ultimate goals and ancestry often has more to do with a person's physical appearance than their biological heritage. Ancestry is estimated by measuring, observing and analyzing the bones of an individual's face and skull"

"so you admit that people use it in the medical field because it does have biological backing (skin color and certain diseases) but want it to not be a factor in it in the future?  or do you want the politics only out of biology (iq purity, ethno nationalism, discrimination etc.)?  also, your view on the dolezal situation can be used against what you want (or what i guess what you want). she wants to be viewed as black because that is what she feels like. if you say that race is so wishy washy, people like her will take advantage of this.   and usually they only use stereotypes of what that race is (and it isn't just white people that do this, but it definitively is a form of white guilt when it is.) and that shows that race IS a real thing (like you said with the dog breed analogy.). it then becomes a 'not what you do/experience but what you actually are' situation. certain social standings are reflective of what our biology is, which can be negative (racism) or positive (sharing cultures from different regions).   but other than that, i actually like your video. i can understand when people say 'they may be a little SJWish, but they make good content.' careful, i may sub to ya. ;D"

"Mostly a good video but then towards the end you really screwed up. My two issues:  1) It would've been good if you had included information on how races are a social construct by specifically showing how the race concept that started it all (the so called 'white race') is a lie by the simple fact that those who were classified as nonwhite at one time are considered white later on. That not only proves that race is a social construct because it is based on the whims of where the air is blowing in that era of society but also how white nationalists are completely full of shit when they claim that America was created as some kind of outpost of Europe meant only for Europeans when most Europeans weren't even considered to be white at the time of the 'founding' of the United States of America.  2) Using Rachel Dolezal  as any kind of a positive example in this context is heavily misguided and quite off-putting. This is especially the case when you immediately follow your Dolezal segment by attacking the idea of blackface. The irony of that is off the charts. Dolezal is essentially running around in blackface while gaining parks (e.g. black scholarships) and positions of authority (e.g. president of a NAACP chapter) in black communities. Considering all of the resources and opportunities that have been denied to African Americans for so long, it's really insulting to place anything from her scandal. Dolezal is at best is quite confused on how to be an ally to African Americans or at worst a crazy person. Either way, it screwed up an otherwise fine video.   What you should've done to end your video was in place of Dolezal talk about those twins you put up where one came out looking like someone that would be classified as black and one that came out looking someone that would be classified as white despite them being twins. That is such a powerful reality right there that in and of itself proves that human beings indeed are only one race. There was even a recent case where a fully African couple from Nigeria gave birth to a light skinned, blond haired and blue eyed baby. These cases would've been far better to hang your last point on and would've brought it home. What a shame you decided to gloss over them in favor of Dolezal."

"Damn, you're almost look as orange as Lord Trumpkin in this video.  Also, what you said about the vagueness about how many races there are as well as acknowledging no matter how many there actually are, we'd still see essentially no pure races, reminds me of a presentation Aronra made a while back on defending Darwin's legacy as not being the founder of biological racism fundamentalist Christians try to make him out to be, where he essentially said the same thing. It's actually a really good point to bring up and I haven't really seen it be disputed."
"Tbh, I liked you better before you came out as genderqueer. NOT because of the gender thing... that was obvious before you said it. :)  ..No, my problem is that now you seem to be less funny and much more preachy.  Being genderqueer in no way obligates you to become a pedantic ass. Just sayin...."
"Absolutely best makeup so far :) As a 'white male', It's hard for me to say anything about a race without being accused as racist... no matter what I say. We all know that 'all whites are racists'. I don't know about y'all, but for me, the most beautiful women are mixed-race. Like Jessica Alba is a mixture of six different ethnicities, and she is absolutely stunning! In my opinion mixing all the races would be good not only for the reduction of prejudices but definitely, very good for the beauty of mankind. Sorry feminists... I should say human kind ;)"

"You parrot that old meaningless canard about there being more variation within races than between them. Well, no shit, if that wasn't true then we would be different species not different races. You could make the same non-point about the sexes. Some men are 4 ft tall, some men are 6 ft tall, but the average difference between men and women is only a few inches. And some people are intersex. Wow, There must be literally no scientific basis for differentiating the sexes! How woke.  Isn't it interesting that genomics companies like 23andMe break things into the same main categories that have been recognized since the age of discovery - IE European, African, Asian, Amerindian. When you showed the racial categories from Brazil, they were the same. The old race models from the 1800s were the same they just used different terms. It's just not true that concepts of race are arbitrarily different between times and cultures. Given the remarkable stability of racial categories, pre-modern scientists should be commended for identifying these categories basically correctly without the benefit of genomics.  Of course there are fuzzy boundaries like everywhere in nature, that doesn't mean the concept of race isn't basically an accurate model of the reality of human population differences. Sometimes mules are fertile, that doesn't mean we should throw out the concept of species, much less that we should see horses and donkeys as the same species."
"The podcast Radiolab did a really good podcast highlighting the arbitrariness of a lot of our race distinctions. It is about a rural family that is 1/8 back, looks white, considers themselves black, is considered black by the community, and experiences real racism as a result. The ex-husband of one of the daughters even ends up joining the KKK. It is quite  a good listen.  http://www.radiolab.org/story/304341-allys-choice/"
"Thank you for your wonderful videos."
"You got one thing wrong. Race doesn't cause Racism, capitalism does.   The amount of racism that race clasifications causes is meaningless, the amount of racism Capitalism causes is genocidal.  We can still live in peace and equality with all the divisions of race as long Capitalism doesn't exist.  If all the concepts of race are magically erased from every single human mind overnight nothing will change as long Capitalism exist.  But it was not a bad video, you just need to learn more, and stop being a liberal."

"I love you Contra, even if you culturally appropriated skull makeup."
"Great video as always and as a biology major, I was very impressed with your ability to succinctly summarize the topic into the core issues.   However, I do have one slight correction, specifically about dog breeds. Dog breeds are actually not recognized among biologists as being legitimate taxonomic groupings. You are correct that dog breeds are ironically a great comparison for races, however, for different reasons than what was implied. Dog breeds are actually entirely categorized by kennel clubs. This doesn't necessarily affect your point too much, but I feel that it's an important distinction that sheds light on how extreme phenotypic differences alone do not fulfill the scientific standards of taxonomic classification."

"Even though this is a bit unrelated to the main topic of the video, I still thought it was interesting to share: I am a dark-skinned Mexican Mestizo (Half-Indigenous/Half-White), but I have two younger sisters who have much lighter skin than me, and this is relevant because one of my light-skinned sisters is 10 years old, and because of her aforementioned light skin, she thought she was White. I tried to explain to her that she was half-White and half-Indigenous, but then she yelled out 'I am White because my skin is White!', so I then told her that if she was White, then why did she have a dark-skinned mother, brother, etc.? And she just said 'You're also White!' And I just decided to give up because I just thought that was funny and because I don't think that a 10 year old would understand the complexity of race."

"Interesting point about the Greeks' lack of racial classification. I think they still tended to form in-groups & out-groups based on province, though, ascribing stereotypes by a similar kind of regional nationalism as we tend to use today. I mean their plebs were debatably more concerned with the racial tensions presented by centaurs and satyrs and things, a mythological 'other' that united men in a kind of patriotism against a world without definable edges, and while the philosophers of the time were educated enough to recognise these as a good allegory it's unlikely the uneducated masses had that same privilege. Perhaps a spiritual nationalism ingrained in mythos was the reason racialism developed so late. It was only when expanding civilizations lost their old monsters that they started crafting new ones. Just as now we are faced with the slow death of 'racial' villainy as the old idea of race falls apart under scrutiny. Regional nationalism is the safe fallback for humanity for a while, until we start creating 'monsters' again. Robots and quad-genders and GMOs who certainly won't deserve what they're in for."

"I've had a lot of arguments with 'race realists' before and I've come across at least one interesting point which I might as well share. One 'race realist' claimed that race can be proven through bones, using the usage of things like forensic facial reconstruction using metrics to tell the race of a person from their skull, legs, etc. and so I looked into it and found that, during facial reconstructions, there are actually only three races which can be determined from the bones. Caucasian, African, and Asian are the categories which reconstructivists fit a skull into and even they will freely admit that even these very, very broad categories are often very wrong because there is so much variation in bone growth from person to person.  Also, it's very interesting that you use ground racist bones, I should try that. Mostly, I've been relying on troll tears and, while that's good for a temporary spring in my step, it's not necessarily keeping me young and beautiful."
"I thought the answer to the alien question was no simply because when I see labrodors of different color I just see them as Labs. with some variety. I would never use that to say race is JUST biological. Anyway dont most people believe race is a social construct? I never met anyone who didnt."

"EDIT: The following is all just speculation and the sharing of ideas. I am not making any definitive statements for or against the issue at hand. Also, while I'm already editing, I might as well point out that English isn't my native language so if there are any grammatical mistakes, that's why (+ it's the middle of the night, which doesn't help).  From my understanding there is a bit of genuine controversy over the 'realness of race' in science. Professor Richard Dawkins, if I'm not mistaken, says that since there is a slight genetic similarity within 'races' (that was a terrible phrasing, I hope people get what I mean) that would mean that race is technically 'real', however the differences are extremely small and superficial and therefore not grounds for rationalizing racial discrimination.  'However small the racial partition of total variation may be, if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlated with other racial characteristics, they are by definition informative, and therefore of taxonomic significance.' - Richard Dawkins, 'The Ancestor's Tale'  Essentially, according to this view, you can biologically divide humans into 'races' but it certainly doesn't encompass what people used to believe, it says nothing at all about people's personalities, intelligence, behavior etc. (historic assumptions about those things are probably a mix of cultural differences and xenophobia). Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but I vaguely remember hearing a couple of years ago that race can be of medical relevance because some races can be more vulnerable to certain diseases or something? I don't know, but I imagine that could make sense from an evolutionary perspective if for instance disease X is prevalent near the equator so those people have developed a resistance, whereas people further from the equator have not and are therefore more likely to catch it if they move nearer the equator."

Really explores the social construct angle well, and why people choose to keep that construct alive.  Also recommend Falguni Sheth's 'Toward A Political Philosophy of Race,' which is also about why people maintain the construct, but it's a philosophy book rather than a play."
