"PLEASE READ BEFORE ASSUMING MY VIEWS:  First off I should say that I am trans femme myself‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt announced this on YT, but I‚Äôve recently switched to ‚Äúshe/they‚Äù and am beginning medical transition. I mention it now because I‚Äôm guessing it affects how you watch this video. That said, I am NOT Tiffany Tumbles, and many things she says about herself are not true of me. I have not had most of the experiences of oppression that many women have. Many trans women do have these experiences, however, but I am very early in transition and haven‚Äôt had much time to be treated like a woman (plus I don‚Äôt pass well, which often leads to shitty experiences, but different shitty experiences).  It‚Äôs very difficult to talk about the similarities and differences in experiences of cis and trans women. Many trans women genuinely do have privileges as a result of their male upbringing‚Äîno matter how many distinctive ‚Äúwoman experiences‚Äù I have later in life, there is still that foundational 28 years of male privilege. However it‚Äôs nearly impossible to discuss this because the conversation has been so poisoned by TERFs that you can‚Äôt explore these nuances without worrying about being misconstrued.  A note on TERFs for normies: ‚ÄúTERF‚Äù is an acronym for ‚Äútrans-exclusionary radical feminist.‚Äù Basically their position is nothing more than an effort to reconcile radical feminism with transphobia. TERFs consider ‚ÄúTERF‚Äù a slur, as you see in the video. They call themselves ‚Äúgender critical.‚Äù Some of them make an effort to appear respectful of trans people, but in my experience most do not and are openly hostile and often outright cruel. They use widespread public transphobia to their advantage, relying on pernicious misrepresentations of trans people to appeal to those outside their circle.  As with all my debate dialogue, Abigail Cockbane‚Äôs arguments are taken almost word-for-word from real people. She is neither a strawman nor a steelman."
"I never though I'd support a feminist  But here I am supporting TERFS They make valid points for once"
"Who else came, during the BBQ scene????"
"as a man with very small hands, still haven't found any adult man or woman with smaller hands.... :( . . . i feel triggered."
"'Every definition is perfect if you ignore everything that doesn't fit the definition.'"
"Why is their no wight history month?"
"Honestly I had a brief time of trying to give TERFs the benefit of the doubt before I really understood what made them bad. The 'trans women are parodizing 'real women' with makeup' (which they literally called 'womanface' as if wearing makeup of any kind is equivalent to blackface) pretty much immediately threw me right back out of considering their opinions."
"I know parts of this were framed as comedy, but I had some big feels anyway. Great essay"
"Well, is misogynist to call women terf's, we don't have to criticize women even on their ideals."
"men are not women women are not men kids can't be transgender. this is an ideology we must all stop"
"Wait, if Abigail is here, then who's free-bleeding all over the national mall? After all, the national mall isn't going to bleed all over itself."
"The Moonlight Sonata is my favorite piece. =)"
"This is way too mean..."
"Wonderful!"
"Everything the TERF said my own mother has said to me in argument of me coming out as trans. It hits hard when people be this way towards you, but at least you know you‚Äôre not alone"
"Yo Tiffany used to be woke af, how did she go from this to completely dismissing Baltimore Maryland, what happened to her? D:"
"*Do vaccines cause feminism?* Lmao"
"Wait, but the terf is also wrong. Some woman who have XY chromosomes can't bleed due to a birth defect where the uterus does not grow properly and eggs are not made. Leading to infertility. So technically she would be neglecting another part of the circle that is women. Along with over weight woman and incredibly under weight women, there are many woman who do not bleed without even counting trans woman. But of course as a transgender myself, I count them as women too. Because that is what they are."
"Hard to watch. I've held some of those  TERF views. Not that should men transform into women. But pre bottom surgical women should not be in women's places . There was some cultural studies nonsense chucked in there.   I appreciate your vlogs.  They give me some thing to chew on."
"'i do not menstruate out of my dick if that's what your asking'"
"1:29 not joking, when the music started i almost flung my pizza across the room, it made me jump. scary."
"7:11 That basically defines classical liberals in a nutshell. Just values without substance or solutions."
"i am a man and my hands are tiny... :3"
"*where has this channel been all my life*"
"I really like that Natalie basically did a remake of this in the 'Gender Critical' video. Her revisit of this topic shows how far she's come artistically and philosophically since then."
"The imagery in this video is near perfection! I love your humor!"
"Gulag all TERFs, feminist civil war now."
"artistic, saturated with pathos, comedic and to the point.. some people think I actually love the shit they throw in my face..."
"Man remember when Tiffany wasn't a racist truscum jsdfkljsk"
"hahahahah, this is fucking great"
"*C A N   B L A C K   P E O P L E   D O   S C I E N C E?*"
"Why does being a man make you a bad feminist?  Even if trans women ARE men (which I don't believe, but IF) so what?  Some of the best feminists I know are men.  And there are other genetic abnormalities that cause women with XY chromosomes like androgen insensitivity disorder, so they don't have female reproductive organs, or menstruate, but they do have vaginas.  They tend to be taller genetically just as men tend to be taller, but that's about it.  I know of a woman who didn't learn of this until she was 19 and had obviously gone through puberty but hadn't started her period, so she finally went to a doctor to make sure she was ok and her diagnosis was XY.  I've only recently learned the term TERF, but now I've even heard of those type of women trying to exclude other women from bringing male babies to rallies.  Like are you kidding me, I have to get a baby sitter because this sweet boy happens to have a penis?  Like he might oppress you now?  I just don't understand that.  I am a wife and a mother and I refuse to trust anyone who believes that my amazing husband and my wonderful little boy are undeserving to do or be anything, just as I wouldn't trust anyone who said that I or my wonderful daughter are undeserving to do or be anything."
"'k womanface.  Still a dude tho."
"Man, Tiffany Tumbles came a long way!"
"'Lesbian genocide and the rape of feminism' XD"
"'Lesbian genocide and the rape of feminism' XD"
"But what about the moon you never cleared up what's really inside it"
"Holy shit I just lost it with the rib-eating drop. D R O P! Awesome."
"Dude the 'good free speech' was so fucking brutal. I'm sorry you've had to hear that"
"The issue I have with rad fems, terfs, etc. is that if your idea of womanhood revolves around being oppressed, then in a sexism free world, women cease to exist. The oppression that they fight so hard to eliminate is their only identity."
"Stop videoing my rib-eating sessions."
"You are a man"
"god the evolution of tiffany tumbles is fascinating"
"–ù–µ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω–∞ , –∞ —á—É–¥–æ !!!üíñ"
"7:34 Winona Ryder"
"I'm pretty sure your shoulders are more feminine than mine (a woman with a growbag - er, womb), love u mom."
"damn Tiffany's such a different character now"
"It's weird to watch in 2019 and see Tiffany Tumbles saying sensible things."
"Omg she named it terfs"
"I'm not even two minutes into this bloody thing and I suddenly have no clue what the fuck is going on! WTF?! lol"
"It‚Äôs actually medically unnecessary for women to have periods and there are birth controls that can stop menstrual cycles. Does that mean women who are on those types of birth control become men and then women when they‚Äôre off of it? Lol"
"Abigail‚Äôs an asshole"
"Man, finally i get Bat v Superman."
"I lost it when the TERF said 'DOST THOU BLEED'"
"So I'm sitting there.. Barbecue sauce on my tiddies.."
"you are a drag Queen."
"'And you'll tower over females like a monster' made me do a spit take."
"This reminds me of an anti-evolution video, comment section and all.  Lot's of willful ignorance, every elephant in the room completely ignored, strawmen defeated.  Any 'real people' this was based on were probably just gabbing on a comment board, not serious critics."
"You opened my mind."
"terfs need to get off the internet"
"Abigail Cockbane is Jordan Peterson, isn't she?"
"The rib scene made me come to a conclusion that I'm in love"
"10:55 ‚ÄúRay, when someone asks you if you bleed, you say 'YES!‚Äù"
"I watch the first two minutes of this video every morning to start the day off right."
"I love the freedom report."
"‚ÄúDoes vaccines cause feminism?‚Äù  I‚Äôm sorry I need to stop dying from laughter so I can watch this video."
"With respect it seems to me you made a false dichotomy, it‚Äôs possible to acknowledge the harm that has been done by some transgender woman (or people claiming to be transgender woman) without pretending every or most (or even a high percentage) of transitions are motivated by a desire for sexual assault, the argument would be that a climate where the thought of questioning someone‚Äôs motivations (or the seemingly sacred doctrine that people can decide how others should treat them based on their internal thoughts and feelings) is taboo leads to unintended negative consequences. For example male sex offenders being transferred to female only prisons after claiming a transition and raping or sexually assaulting female inmates (this has already happened multiple times in my understanding)  or confused young women undergoing irreversible surgery after voicing their concerns to doctors (spoiler alert, many turn out simply to have been gay and regret their operations). The argument is even a small chance of something terrible needs to be guarded against and the current ‚Äúterf‚Äù climate disproportionately prevents people from speaking out and leads to women suffering unnecessary suffering."
"Fucking perfect"
"Your sexuality is based on your bias, developed in early childhood experiences.  This will become blatantly obvious when you age and sexual desire and satisfaction become weak, tertiary drives.   As a internal bias, it is moldable by further experiences that successfully satisfy your personal sense of happiness.  Seeing sexuality for what it is means it is under your control and choice.  Difficult to abruptly change by self discipline but changeable by self examination of why you feel this or that way."
"Watch this in isalashin 7:17"
"3:52 it sounds like the debate is turning her on"
"Aww the Tiffany character is so cute and I felt bad for her the whole time."
"Even though I'm a huge supporter of transgender women, I've actually been accused of being a TERF because I don't agree with protecting transgender men's rights within feminism. I believe in protecting women in general, no one else."
"Can ee just have science history month"
"This guy is delusional and talking to himself"
"Amazing debate. Fucking brilliant."
"a question to trans women, how do you know you're a woman? what does it feel to be a women? is it wearing makeup, having long hair, using 'girl' clothes? honestly, learn about radical feminism before calling people 'terfs', it's a misogynistic term and it's used to even discriminate women from their own movement."
"I... I like to wear mini-skirts and high heels..."
"And it's just freakin' funny that you guys just make the name 'terf' only to jeer and ‚úåcriticize ‚úå women and the male who detests transgender didn't have any titleüòÇüòÇüòÇ how misogynistic they are! They didn't even hide that! What a proude activity, 'guys'?"
"Tiffany has come along way in her approach to trans subjects and commentary."
"Would honestly subscribe to a channel that's just you covering yourself in food to EDM"
"1:28 you made me jump out of my skin and spill my tea down myself hahaha"
"Ewww God the TERF rats finally came to this video"
"Men:  Entire comment section: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"Jajajaja es el mejor video que he visto en meses y el primero que veo tuyo, ya te amo."
"1:30 fuckin got me bitch"
"To be fair, who *doesn't* get turned right on when a woman goes in and just *inhales all of the fucking barbequed ribs*"
"ok im in at about 0:22 and black ppl doing science really NIGA ? we know thay can't  allo Fe them have gaming disorder's"
"someone confirm for me that this is a direct reference to 'so i was lying there, bbq sauce on my titties...' this would have been about the same time right?"
"That first tiffany tumbles clip was super intense lmaooooo"
"wow that Terf is relentless and cruel, you are so good at this, its scary, I almost cried at ... well you know the moment. and I¬¥m not trans, still I totally emphasize with you"
"One of my mother's friends said of my transition that I should have to bleed. I was tempted after SRS to send her a photo of the packing coming out with the caption 'Is that enough blood?', but I thought better of it."
"When I see someone being called terf, I legit can't tell if they shank trans women as a hobby or if they are just a lesbian."
"people do belittle kim k for her sex-tape and her hyper-fem, sexualized persona.... that is her #1 hate speech, that she is conforming to unnatural standards of beauty through surgery and making women feel bad for not looking like her (although not on purpose)... older feminists dont agree with hyper-fem females being hyper-fem, ofc theyre going to like it less when trans people use it to make standards of 'passing', what is a biological woman doesn't pass, what happens then? will someone misgender her.   i dont shave, me for allowing my body to grow naturally get shamed for that. trans people get shamed for going against their biological bodies, do not compare that.  all the issues mentioned, disownment, evection, abuse, and rape can happen to ANYONE because of MANY THINGS...there are something that can ONLY happen to women...thats the point  i feel like i am more aware of now what it looks like to be a woman now than when i was growing up... gender now is so emphasized so much more now  also aren't you arguing against non-binary, nonconforming trans/queer people who do not 'believe that gender is important?'   also its become increasingly popular to become trans in the younger communities and i've seen many of these teens transition because they feel pressured to because they look more like the opposite gender. and then de-transitioning when they become young adults and regret having the ability to access hormones so easily: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxVmSGTgNxI  i want to see trans people be as happy as possible and feel good about themselves...please do not equate hate for acknowledging that sometimes they will be left out of th  conversation"
"1:50 ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm sitting there, barbecue sauce on my titties‚Ä¶‚Äù"
"Gender should be linked to sex, and what we usually refer to gender should be renamed, and only referred to socialized behaviors. You can‚Äôt use the word gender in situations like this as gender is linked to sex, and so this is breakdown that occurs. You need a new term to express only behavior dislinked to sex that is derived from socialized behaviors."
"7:00 broke my heart wtf"
"My queen"
"sis wish u were on Netflix so I'm not wasting my subscription there"
"10:55 Transwoman , transman , sawyer , Medical people,  control the cult of blood üëÄüîº"
"IS THAT THE TIFFANY TUMBLES. THE LIBERAL DESTROYER TIFFANY TUMBLES!"
"A friend of mine had recently made love to a beautiful, charming terf and was spouting basically all the same talking points as this video.  We watched together and I think it changed his mind.  The mix of comedy, earnestness, wit, and excellent rhetorical skills in your videos make for incredibly persuasive pieces that never feel manipulative.   Thanks for doing what you do!"
"Wao üòÆ"
"You are just so funny you should also do just straight comedy üòÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è  I‚Äôm a blue-collar straight white male and I‚Äôm about to go to community college is this the type of people you find a college? I have never found anybody even remotely like this pink haired radical that you that you have here... if they get that upset about stuff this nuanced what the fuck are they going to do when they see me?!??!?  I‚Äôm very nice and really tolerant and I just wanna be friends with people but if they get this mad at trans people who are definitely on the left and then what the fuck are they going to think of a white welder?!??!"
"Wow. I feel dumber for watching this.... and here i was thinking i was going to watch something insightful"
"Oh my god. That was the sexiest putting a way of a rack of ribs I've seen in the last week, nice."
"This is hands down on of the best youtube channels there is üëèüèæ"
"Feeling black and calling yourself transracial is the same as feeling female (whatever that means) and calling yourself transgender."
"I think this video gave me a 'girl eating ribs' fetish"
":) Thanks for the video!"
"6:24 - 6:51 DAMN üòï"
"Your wonderful"
"I am just crying omg"
"I took way too long to watch this"
"https://youtu.be/AQPWI7cEJGs?t=399 Oof I'm not even a transwoman myself and that made me feel self-conscious about my hands and height .w."
"Ugh can you imagine finding out in a contra video that you enjoy women eating ribs in that manner..."
"**TERFS have left the chat**"
"Lo triste es que hay muchas feministas que piensan as√≠, me cagan"
"I definitely understand were you are coming from with the radicalization against trans people that some feminists take, however however just to play devil‚Äôs advocate here, are some of their concerns justified on some issues?  -https://youtu.be/UZgtMK0UxlY -https://youtu.be/JcAPU6paCxo Try to watch the whole thing for both."
"0_0 *Long, Weird-ass Pause* >.>; .... oWo 'DOST THOU BLEED???'  Annnnnd, I'm on the floor! üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Yo, FUCK Terfs, okay?! I don't know *any* woman who's honored to bleed, GTFOH with that shit! Trans women are women!"
"lmao what a bunch of retards you are"
"When you can't actually argue with radfems so you make a video strawmanning them ü§¶üòÇ"
"This no joke made me a terf."
"natalie pls can you come play piano to me next time i am bleeding"
"April is white history month"
"I think the reason you do will is you understand your target demographic vary will.your also not an apsalotest and admet the left haves there own porblems."
"1. Abigail looks like a pink haired Winona Ryder in the thumbnail 2. That song and that outfit in the barbecue food orgy scene are üî• 3. I kept thinking that was a Carefree Panty Shields package on the piano and felt some satisfaction when that's basically what it turned out to be (well, Always, but close enough.)"
"Do vaccines cause feminism?"
"terfs are so toxic and trashy ugh, @ all the trans women, don't listen to what they say, you're all women and my sisters"
"I've watched so many of your videos, and why is your hallway so narrow??"
"@1:44 so there I was, Barbecue sauce on my titties"
"Lol the bathtub scene... I‚Äôm pagan and do value my menstrual blood for ritual work, but that‚Äôs not what defines gender."
"This is the problem people that pretend to have a vernier 'respect' for transgender women but will reject their existence because 'they not reals woms'. And tell them that their models have outliers and they calmly reject them as 'abnormal', while holding a position with clear contradictions. It's called being 'disingenuous'. They don't care for their objections because they have concluded to reject transgender women already."
"Who else wanted to relive this after Natalie's Gender Critical video"
"Now i know Natalie has never read Infinite Jest. If she did she would not have time to make these videos. that fucker is dense, and really kinda terrible"
"Patron names are funny because you have regular ass names and then you have FULLY AUTOMATED LUXURY SPACE POST-SCARCITY COMMUNISM"
"'Trans women as a group are the most devoted hair removers I've ever met' Heard over the sound of an epilator as it runs over the backs of my hands and knuckles."
"abigsil cockbane is a remarkably accurate depiction of a TERF."
"The steady, creeping intoxication made me fall over."
"I still can't believe terfs are real."
"you did the terf role so perfectly i wanted to punch you in the face"
"So I‚Äôm sitting there, barbecue sauce on my tiddies,"
"As a cisgender male who sometimes bleeds from his genitals (thanks, kidney stones!), the whole 'if it bleeds, it's a woman' notion always gives me a laugh."
"as a anti feminist i love to lean back and watch how the feminist revolution is eating itself.:) trans vs. feminists. jewish women vs. radical leftists....gonna love that.:)"
"you gotta love a patriarchy so powerful that a trans woman (who grew up and had all the privileges of a man) defining - to actual women what being a woman actually is  'well ackshulllyyy....'  SMDH"
"another man talking about feminism as if it were his burden to bear."
"Terfs are awful but i can only hate a person who‚Äôs last name is fucking ‚ÄúCockbane‚Äù so much"
"As a viewer from the future, I think maybe this interview and the repercussions of it is what changed Tiffany. Instead of defending trans women like herself, she became complicit in their abuse and took a full 180 ultimately at the expense of her own wellbeing. I hope we can get a redemption arc for her, I want her to be okay. I want her to be comfortable with who she is and learn to be strong enough to defend and stand up for other trans women like herself. She's a really interesting character, I have a big soft spot for morally grey characters."
"...I have to be honest. I personally had some gender critical views-- not terfism, bc holy shit, but gender critical-- esp after my assaulter came out as trans. This really gave me some perspective. It's all hunky-dory for me, a cis girl, to debate the merits and pitfalls of gender, but I don't deal with resultant transphobic fallout. Ideas have costs.    We still need to engage critically with gender and the idea of 'womanhood'-- but never to discriminate against our trans sisters. Only ever to recognize our differences so we can better target misogyny in all its forms through solidarity. Thanks, Natalie x"
"I want ‚Äúcreepy vagina cult‚Äù on a t shirt"
"Cockbane,  BRILLIANT üëèname for a shit feminist!"
"This reminds me of Maddox‚Äôs podcast, after Dick Masterson left and he decided to debate himself. But he always presented one side pretty poorly, so we always knew which side he was really on. This was very well done, demonizing neither side, just presenting their respective arguments. Also, what was that book Cockbane authored...The Trans Menace: Lesbian Genocide and the Rape of Feminism. Ha ha, why did that title crack me up lol..."
"‚ÄúI was sitting there, barbecue sauce on my titties.‚Äù"
"Nice strawman."
"Oh my god I didn't know you were this hilarious."
"This was my response to another comment here but it sums up my feelings on terfs arguments pretty well: Say if restrooms were separated by sex, any man could walk into the women's bathroom claiming to be a trans man. If trans women were forced to use mens bathrooms and go to mens prosions, I probably don't need to explain how dangerous that would be considering trans women are one of the most widely fetishized groups in the world.  Yes cis men are typically naturally stronger than cis women, but people come in all shapes and sizes. Plenty of cis women and taller and stronger than cis men. That whole argument is way too reductive unless you're going to start measuring people's muscle mass and using it to be a prerequisite to being a certain gender. I'm not denying that there have been men pretending to be trans women for malicious reasons (although I literally haven't seen one instance of that actually happening) which is something the trans community finds equally as alarming but that's men you should be going after, not actual trans women."
"Put those pickles back in the fridge yo."
"There are an equal amount of men on the right that hate women, as there are women on the left that hate men. It's hilarious."
"Who else never heard of TERFs before this video? I used to be an anti-SJW person thinking modern day feminism is a reactionary echo chamber. And I actually might still be subscribed to some of the 'classical liberals' spewing those ideas without even knowing it. Thank you, Contra, I feel like every video is teaching me a new angle to the conversations being had on these sensitive topics."
"There is penis there is vagene - Nathalie wynne"
"OMG I laughed so damn hard at the moment when she tore into the ribs... just... wow"
"I really want this discussion of gender to be held between trans men and trans women. I think people who have lived and been perceived as both men and women may have the greatest understanding of what it is to be each gender."
"Wow a biological man talking about female issues . How typical."
"That was the most gratuitous display of rib abuse I have ever seen on YouTube!"
"Ah yes the blood ritual."
"Im no trans person, but that was hard to watch, wonderful video üò≠üòä"
"Coming back and watching this video after Natalie has transitioned, I have to say it‚Äôs pretty brave for her to speak out loud what must have been her deepest insecurities when acting as the TERF. That‚Äôs very admirable."
"I don't like the name 'TERF'. I personally prefer Feminism-Appropriating Reactionary Transphobe. Or FART for short."
"There‚Äôs also a terf on tumblr who hates trans men more than women. She thinks than trans men are ‚Äúself hating women‚Äù that wilfully mutilate themselves. She also doesn‚Äôt even think trans is real and called me ‚Äúscum‚Äù for it. I hate that bitch with a passion"
"Love the moonlight sonata pun"

"Ha! 'Cocksbane'!"
"Terfs are funny to me because I have a female body and am not a woman. Squabble about that for a couple of hours you trilobites."
"Jeez, you don't get that much blood in the bath water if you give birth in it!  Also, a REAL woman doesn't get her period because she gets pregnant every time she ovulates and is in a perpetual state of pregnancy or breastfeeding."
"i like your bookshelf."
"What if I don't have a tub?"
"Can't stress how much I love your artistry and dramatization of your points"
"you deliberately make TERFs hysterical and stupid, presenting this nonsense as their arguments. did you know that radical feminism is by definition against queer theory? the term 'TERF' is useless. or this is my favourite liberal entertainment: pretend that I have a gender, and not gender has me lol? fuck u very very much"
"I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I just watched but my spirit feels enriched.  Thx :)"
"'Wouldn't a sexual assailant's genitals be hard instead of flailing?'  Asking those hard hitting questions there."
"For a second my dumb male ass thought the 'Dost thou bleed' bit was referencing shylock's speech in the  Merchant of Venice, and although it probably wasn't implied, the parrallel adds a whole other dimension of irony."
"I used to be kinda disgusted by Trans people, because reason... However what git me hooked waa one of Isaac Arthurs Videos in which he talks about a travellor who had spend centurys travelling through the milky way just to come home to earth finding out, that it has become possible to tranaplant the human mind into any mamal and the first guy he meets is a dolphin.  Yeah, to be really progressive atthis point I think that science and technology will steamroll this issue like some many other reactionary bullshit before."
"Honestly bleeding out of your vagillicuddy ain‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be lol TERFS are so fucking weird."
"Your really a good actress.  Being transgender is both wonderful and also a horrid state of being at the same time. It is wonderful because the person has come to a deep understanding of who they are as human beings. Horrid because they now become the lighting rod for every social commentary no matter how unrelated the subject is. We are who we are and that alone gives us hope."
"Ribs...hawt"
"men is dresses think there is a 'right' 2b a woman. no."
"Notice which one is being kind and calm. Now notice which one is raising their voice.."
"I‚Äôm non-binary and am AFAB. I have some of the worst fucking painful periods. Like in bed moaning and crying bad. But the fixation of periods from cis women is so weird to me sometimes. Like yeah my periods are bad, and I hate them. But I‚Äôd still rather have painful periods than deal with the constant street harassment that all women - trans or cis will face. periods suck but it‚Äôs only a small slice of the complexity of what makes up a cis woman - there‚Äôs a lot of other garbage to womanhood to experience!"
"I'm so glad I watched this to the end. You are a genius on many levels."
"I don't know where you got this footage of me eating ribs."
"We should all take a vote of our parts and let the majority rule."
"a man cant experience misogyny"
"I feel like this isn't strawman, because you clearly researched this alot."
"Am I the only one who thinks a key reason terfs hate and disregard the legitimacy of trans people‚Äôs identities is because they can‚Äôt stand the thought for one second there might be people out there who are more oppressed and marginalised than they are"
"It's easy. If you have a pipi you boy, if you have a vjayjay you girl. And it can't be fake."
"I can't imagine how horrible it must be to feel you are trapped in the wrong body. And I don't see what the prob is with calling a trans woman...a woman. Your transition doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever.  Menstruation doesn't define a woman. It's a biological process that is only present for a few decades in a woman's life. There are so many facets to what 'it means to be a woman' that this argument by Terfs, is just another prejudice.  I say be who you want to be!"
"Putting Ayn Rand that close to Salman Rushdie on the bookshelf behind her makes me super uncomfortable"
"Apologies if you have already addressed this, but would you be open to commenting on Meghan Murphy's Twitter ban?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2L4w837agg"
"You aren't playing it soft enough. I mean even I can put more feeling into this and I always get called a black smith for my excessive use of force."
"I've been doing period rituals wrong for all these years !?..."
"Why anyone would take you seriously is questionable to me. Yuck."
"Nya. I always thought of things by sex, not gender. So XX equals female, XY equals male.  But that only matters when it comes to actual reproduction. However else people want to behave or change their bodies should be up to them.  If someone wants to be treated a certain way, and they have to (or at least think they have to) look and behave a certain way to be treated that way, then go for it, and good luck to them."
"This was outstanding."
"you had me until nearly the very end. trans women's perceptions of periods are nearly universally irrational; likewise their perceptions of radfem's perspective on periods are insulting. menstruation isn't creepy. it isn't exclusionary. and it isn't the baseline for being female. i genuinely enjoyed every minute of this video until you ended it like that."
"'Is it that time already?' That's exactly how I feel when I wake up in a pool of my own blood"

"Hey uhh actually does anyone want to have a civilised conversation with me about this. Recently I've been seeing female erasure due to the trans movement. I used to be a huge tra but a couple days ago I discovered radfem(I don't fully support them or their arguments on different topics)  and I really hate to admit it but some of their points sound logical. I'd be happy to get another view on these points because I might not be thinking as critically about this as I should. Remember all opinions are subject to change.  1. Trans people are erasing female empowerment. There have been multiple posts of trans women claiming art depicting women with female anatomy is transphobic because it hurts tw who do not have xx anatomy. But doing so very much hurts women who have always felt ashamed of their xx anatomy and presenting pictures that normalises women with xy anatomy show that xy is the default even for women. Shouldn't xx anatomy be the default for women? Is it really that invalidating to trans people to see a women with xx anatomy? Is this just a small portion of the community that thinks xx anatomy is triggering?  2. Non-transitioned tim's shouldn't identify as women. While I do know some trans women that put as much effort into being a women as most xx women do. But what about the tims that put on lipstick and a dress and claim to be a women? In my opinion that dissolves all women's identities including tw as it gives the notion that all it means to be a women is cosmetics and clothes and erases the effort that real women (which includes trans women in my definition) have to put into being a women and any oppression that they've faced. Being a women is complex and the idea that a man who threw on some makeup and clothes because they think they look hot as a woman is fetishising women and cannot genuinely identify as female.  If you disagree or agree with what I'm saying I'd realllllyyyyy appreciate you're reasoning on why I'm incorrect or correct, not to argue, I just really need another POV to make sure these opinions are valid."

I 'feel' like a woman. I 'perform' like a woman. These aren't stereotypes?

This is most of what I have heard from women labeled as TERF. I've not engaged in conversations where anything was close to what Tumbles says that are also truly feminist. However, non-feminist, conservative women have said those things ALL the time, even loudly in a workplace (people will call them TERFs falsely, because they shit on all women)."

"Unsure if this has been raised before at all -- the reason why TERF style reasoning got into my head was through unfortunate experiences with men who WERE actually trying to infiltrate female spaces with sexual intent.

But those experiences fucked with me for a while. Thank you. Love"
"This video gives me peace of mind"
"People here don't seem to understand that exceptions don't disprove a rule. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species. Males have testes, a prostate, penis, and will be able to create sperm from puberty on, until (sometimes) old age. Females have a uterus, ovaries, vagina, breasts, and from puberty on menstruate. They will generally be able to have a shot at pregnancy once per cycle, and this fertility decreases (severely) after 30/35 and is virtually gone for most women past 40, especially past 45. These are the rules of nature for healthy, fully functional, human beings. Yes, there are intersex people. That is NOT normal but a developmental abnormality. The existence of intersex people doesn't make the existence of males and females less true. Yes, there are females and males who are sterile with all kinds of reasons for this. That makes them a female or male with fertility issues, not a third sex or whatever. Cutting your dick off and taking female sex hormones can make a make look more like a female but he will never be one. He lacks all the body parts, hormones, and chromosomal makeup seen in females. Just because you can artificially approach a hormone balance more like that of a female doesn't make a male a female. The changes trans women undergo ate mainly cosmetic, so they have a better chance at being perceived ad the opposite sex in public and to cure their dysphoria. However, you aren't a female because your body isn't like that of a female. Just because there are females born without uterus, which is a birth defect, doesn't mean a male who also doesn't have a uterus can claim to be female. It's a sad exercise when you list all the attributes of a female body and find there are either intersex people or females that lack that attribute to weasel yourself as a male into that definition. Females that lack any of the body parts or functionality that come with a healthy female are an aberration, they aren't like a male who doesn't have any of the female attributes."

"Radfem arguments seem reasonable Most women can give birth -> all women are forced to be mothers and wives from early childhood (when you can't tell who's gonna be infertile) -> belief that women are only good for these purposes -> ideological system in which female purpose is to serve men (not only do childbirth, but also housekeeping, emotional support, sexual and aesthetic pleasing), so men can fully commit to the Important Business Women are discriminated at the workplace because society expect them to prioritize kids and family over job, and it doesn't matter whether they want / can have kids / family -- Our reproductive differences are the root for oppression of 50% of the human population and it's really ignorant and disrespectful to dismiss it like you did"

"Everyone interested in gender identity should watch this outstanding, humane and funny video. After watching it, the complexity of gender issues has deepened, but I am more relaxed about it than ever. I regard gender as binary, but include in the  binariness both biological and transitioning- transgender people. Trans people who chose not to transition are non-binary transsexuals who should  inhabit neither male nor female status in law or society, but have their own gender group. Ditto for Gender Fluid and Gender neutral groups etc. Ditto for intersex. So there should be 6 genders recognised by law and culture: binary male and female including transitioned trans; non-binary transexual male and female who chose not to transition; non-binary self-designated genders; non-binary  biological intersex gender. There should be no need in this rich classification to be fighting over who inhabits what gender. Let's just chill out and be respectful everyone. Well done Contrapoints."

I mean, using such terms is like asking to become more biased, so maybe they should be discarded, but they may also have some purpose in organizing thought, so I ain't sure."

"That song during the rib massacre was dope"
"But if TERF define women as physically inferior to men biologically, and that biology is what should build the strucure of our society, why even trying to fight for feminism and female empowerment? Hasn't bilogy settled this down already through human'ds existence, that men being physically stronger means that it will always be easier for them to dominate women rather than the opposite? We always talk about the everlasting influence of patriarchy, but how has the patriarchy even been established? It seems to me that men at some point have been able able to seize to power and maintain it through their physical and biological advantage (it takes only a few seconds for a man to create an offspring, the woman will be vulnerable for at least 9 months) before even creating strong social structures. So, with that upper hand, they built those structures so that they have control."

"D O S T T H O U  B L E E D"
"Just started watching  your videos last year and I've been a fan of most of them. This one makes me take a step back. You're as biased on this topic as Ben Shapiro is when talking about Israel. You didn't even attempt to use the best arguments from the opposition, and that's a practice I'll never respect.   This idea that feminist that don't believe biological men can become biological women aren't feminist at all is just nonsense. Feminism has always been about ridding the world of gender roles that aren't based on actual biological differences, and moving to a system where the sexual label is secondary to the individual's abilities. Instead you're pretending that it's all about the ability to give birth, and that because you can be raped that makes your struggle the same as their own. It doesn't...  That's like a white person getting a tan, and then being racially discriminated against, and saying well there's no difference I'm officially black now. Knaw, the better course is just to stop using race as a distinction all together. But what you can't do is conflate a bunch of terms that don't mean the same thing because you want to get in on a descriptor that you chose.while everyone else didn't.  Imagine if I cut my legs off and then claimed to be a dwarf. You think real dwarves are going to be ok with that? Even if a dude who has the hots for short people rapes me? Does that mean I got raped as a dwarf, or I got raped as a short person? Clearly the latter. You're someone who looks like a woman. And you can get raped as someone who looks like a woman and not be trans at all. That's an entire different category of hardship. Doesn't make you a biological woman though."
"DAMN THE TEA IS HOT"
"Thanks. I'd heard the term TERF before but didn't know what it was about until watching this video. It was really educational, but also, you're so damn funny and skilled.

"The problem with TERFS including transwomen is problematic because TERFS have no legal framework to go off of. There is no 'trans-enough' rule in the trans community, yes transwomen are more comfortable dressing and acting and presenting as women and yes I do believe this does make them experience womanhood where as a man that puts on a wig (not a trans person legit a man in a wig) doesn't live like that every day nor do they necessarily want to. Legally, like in court rooms and on trials how to what define what a transperson is? There are people out there who are crazy, men and women alike. Some transpeople turn out crazy, anyone can be crazy. I am a TERF who lived three years as a transmale trying to fit in and the ONLY reason I am a TERF is because I don't understand how legally we can change the definition or a woman or man or that matter. For  someone wanted to commit a crime and get away with it they can plead insanity and if a man, a normal non-trans man, wants to dress up as a woman and kill people or do whatever they want and then say 'its okay world I'm trans just put me with the rest of the girls' then women get raped. All of these are real stories I have read about. It's not the transwomen us TERFS are scared of, its the law being used to hurt us by people, men, pretending to be trans and the world, not fully grasping what it means to be trans, says its okay just because the person at fault says they are trans, even if they aren't. Hell we have guys that change their identity to female just to get away from their old criminal records. These are the things I wish you would discuss in a video because I, a TERF, wants to include transwomen like you, who live like women to be legally defined better than you are now so that bad people can't pretend to live the way you live when people find out that they're bad.

(Then again, things might get rude or flooded with people that have an agenda). Maybe people could submit questions in advance? Either way, I love your work, your clarity of thought and the way you engage with all the difficult questions and provide new insights (that are at least new to me). Loved your video on aesthetics and appearance though it left me quite confused about my own life üôà"
"Yeah..pretty much. As much as you want to be a female, you will never be a female."
"Contra, are you on steam? can I add you to steam? Not joking or being an asshole. Would love to have you as a friend."
"I disagree with you buti subscribed and hit the bell LOL"
"Hey, i disagree with everything you say, but do you have discord? I'd love to talk to you in person."
"Holy shit I feel like this video just saved me A LOT of time."
"I feel like I am still waiting for a conclusion"
"‚ÄúWhat? No, I just wanna pee. I don‚Äôt want to be part of your creepy vagina cult.‚Äù  Lmao üòÇüëçüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
"Men will never be women. Women are adult human females.  Misogyny is sex based oppression. It's why FGM and child brides happen. It's based in sex discrimination, not the abstract idea of womanhood. Gender is just stereotypes and by assigning them to others or yourself, you just dressing yourself up in another person's oppressive stereotypes and roles. You aren't a woman."
"L I G H T I N G"
"Lol I love the moderator"
"Holy fuck Abigail Cockbane is the most perfect name I've ever seen for that role"
"The only Innacurate thing I see here is that Abigail should have those horrid cut across too short bangs all the terfs seem to have nowadays. Kick ass Nat!"
"Your point here on being transgender and womanhood is much more coherent than in your last two videos (asethetics and gender nouns). You the best."
"Fossils, are they real"
"This is brilliance."
"Go ahead, nearly give me a Damn seizure from eating those ribs. TRIGGERED"
"You are brilliant."
"2:40 This is exactly what I expected opening a video at 3 am"
"Well I'm gonna have nightmares of TERFs on a whole new level now..."
"Nat looks so much like Winona in that pink wig. <3"
"You scared the shit out of me with that dubstep-ribs surprise."
"'What is REALLY inside the moon?'"
"Do vaccines cause feminism? No.  Where do gay people come from? Vaginas.  What's *really* inside the moon? Rock and magma.  Fossils, are they real? Yes.  Why is there no white history month? Because the privileged whites get enough attention.   What if dreams are the real reality? You're talking BS."
"why does this have higher production value than the suicide squad"
"I love how he is portraying the 'TERF' as this hysterical, crazy woman and the trans as the composed, rational individual when, in reality, is quite the oposite."
"I'm not transgender but I got so upset at the terf..."
"I've watched this video twice and I'm still hung up on a simple thing: how do you define a woman? According to this video, it's not genitals. It has nothing to do with appearance. It's not your genes because sometimes a rare medical condition comes up in the human population. What are we left with to define 'woman'? And if the answer is that there's no definition, or that man and women don't exist (or something along those lines), then how do we explain gender dysphoria? These are legitimate questions."
"I like how the phrenology chart is behind Abigail and the books are behind Tiffany lol"
"TERFs: 'Emotional labor needs to be acknowledged & validated!' Also TERFs: 'You can't just 'feel' like a woman feelings aren't real'"
"I love you!!"
"At what point does technicality differ from 'construct' it's hard to explain. This is the 'What IS being a woman' discussion. Is a woman defined by what she does or presents as or her genitals? Is it possible for someone to still be a woman when she has everything that could be defined as male? Is it because you know 'her'?  That's a deeply personal thing though. It's not even dependent on if I like her or not. She could be an absolute bitch, but the person themselves and their desire to be that woman is completely separate from the negative aspects of her personality. But also interesting is the idea that this person could be 'male'.  How would your or my perception of them change if the only thing that we defined about them was that they were 'male'? Still the same person, no real meaning. Does gender matter? Is it ultimately important to me, even as a transwoman? I do have some desire, or attachment, to that world. Where those differences are inconsequential. Where expectations of a person do not come into existence when you invoke the idea that they are supposed to be male, or female.  I think that is ultimately restricting. You narrow down the possibilities of what constitutes male or female and provoke gender dysphoria when these narrow definitions are broken. Until the point where these things are no longer serviceable, and you essentially have to disregard how people are defining you, in order to have the complexities of a person who is unrestrained by any stereotypes.  And a lot of people will not understand. Is this my problem?"
"This is an episode about gas lighting."
"I don't think you actually got to the root of the issue. Check out the video on my channel, and let me know your thoughts on it. I explore it a little closer."
"imagine if all debates were like this: no one screaming and interrupting each other every 5 seconds..."
"I can't believe I'm actually starting to enjoy your content. Even though I don't agree with you on a few things."
"1:28 my ears"
"Abigale Cockbane looks a bit like Wynona  Ryder."
"HI."
"I swear to god, if you don't have a bath-time in your next video I am going to leave uneventful comments on it!!!"
"Should have ate the ribs in a milk bath!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"ur eyes r rly pretty"
"Make Atlantis GAY AGAIN!"
"About the rib scene...I'm not sure if I get the joke, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. XD"
"THAT BARBECUE BIT ACTUALLY SHOCKED ME"
"Dude, when she said 'you can reject conventional social roles and still be a woman' üò©üëåüëåüëå"
"I actually do that on my period. XD"
"10:56 holy shit literally made me chuckle"
"Abigail is the embodiment of literally every transphobe ever."
"I may have jumped out of my skin when that rib montage started lol"
"7:00 I felt so bad omg"
"Useless comment #50000: you and I own the same Beowulf edition (Seamus Heaney)! 8D"
"Now that's how you eat ribs!"
"0_o ...Jesus... around that 7 min mark was harsh... lay off, please."
"The fun part about this is that the TERF is also insinuating that men are evil, besides transwomen. It's almost as if they hate anyone who's not part of their cult!"
"Ok, I'll be the first to admit that often, I can't tell the difference between a 'real' woman or man in a wig.  Gotten me into a bit of trouble, in the past... by trouble I mean conversations about anal sex.  Which was actually kinda fun.  Which troubles me.  No homo."
"No, wait it's just retardation."
"Is this toxic masculinity?"
"*THE SKULLS*  *THINK OF THE SKULLS*"
"4:57 I STARTED FICKING DYDING"
"Is it weird that even though all three of them are you I still get the urge to yell 'Hey, fuck you, leave her alone!' when some of the harsher physical criticisms and digs come out?  Your channel is extremely eye opening. I've never been anything close to transphobic, but I don't think I really thought about the struggles that take place when it comes to what you and others go through, both in the case of how society treats you and how you percieve yourself.  Keep up the great work."
"Thank you for the good video!"
"The bleed argument is so trash. Are little girls who haven't experienced puberty men now? Are older women who have gone thru menopause, men now? Logic sweetie..."
"But... some biological females are incapable of menstruating....."
"well, although i like and respect this content creator to call a trans woman a 100% genuine woman is factually incorrect. Calling them trans-woman is more accurate."
"Low-key looks like winona ryder"
"I always imagine that Abigail Cockbane hangs out with Lena Dunham as Valerie Solanas¬†(AHS: CULt) at the SCUM clubhouse once this debate finishes."
"I wish you talked more about 'socialization'. I'm a trans woman, but some people on my facebook have accused me of being transphobic somehow for stating that I was, and most transgender women were, treated like a boy until I started to pass as female, and until that point enjoyed most of the privileges of a male childhood."
"How much sauce did you have to eat to make that rib clip"
"I suddenly want ribs."
"Holy shit.. It was REALLY jarring to actually hear someone say  'Swyer Syndrome.' I often hear people talk about Intersex conditions.. but no one has ever (AFAIR) said the exact name of the condition I was Diagnosed with. (This is not a negative)"
"I also wonder after eading some comments then how people would handle the concept of chimerism induced dysphoria such as by having xx neurology and the rest of the body being largely xy as any dysphoria that comes from that would not be societal.  Would that then be neurological or biological dysphoriaor some strange hybrid?"
"Love the fact that Jackie Jackson, while completely sloshed, can still play moonlight sonata"
"I have regularly forgotten what people's gender race etc are when not looking at them for most of my life of course this was because i forgot what they look like and i forget what i look like unless i am looking in a mirror everbldy just needs to have issues like me and not remember peopel well or develop a theory of mind until after speech upon consider their first school bully had to have their own thoughts because how else could they be so mean.  If everybody started life viewing other people as movign furniture and only after three years of black history month discover that skin color passes from parent to child we would have a kinder if more oblivious world."
"Goddamn that host character is feckin hilarious. Also the title of the terf's book."
"Most trans people hate Catiliyn Jenner, she's a reactionary fuck"
"4:55 me trying to contribute to any conversation"
"'You are a Terf.' 'What did you just call me?' Cluelessly: 'Yeah.What does that mean?' LMAO"
"I love that you really understand both sides of this argument. I really would like to have a martini with you and have this debate in private because you have an awesome mind and i am extremely interested in this topic and interested in both sides of the argument."
"I am all for androgyny, but if you being what you want harms none I say go for it. I belive gender roles keep humans from reaching thair full potential and freedom, but than again all roles to that. shape means boundaries. so all is cool."
"I feel like the only oddity here is if you still have male or female reproductive organs, you shouldn't just yet be going into the bathroom of the gender you feel. Mainly because girls going into male bathrooms may sexually harassed because it is a male bathroom after all and males going into female bathrooms don't have the organs to properly use the bathroom the way the female toilet is designed to function. Basically you can use your gender's bathroom once you have the proper organs, but bathrooms are designed a certain way for a reason. Neither of the genders can use the other gender bathroom due to the way it is designed. It's not rude if it's common sense, some transtrenders need to calm down and realize the problem with them using the bathroom they want. We have family bathrooms for a reason."
"Brams Stokers: The Terf"
"12:51 what am I watching anymore???"
"How pathetic it is to define yourself through oppression by huwite miieeen."
"10:00 I feel like this is the lynch pin of the issue. What gender is exactly is still very much up for debate, anybody sorted it out perfectly yet?"
"If you can sit there and tell people they're disgusting freaks with a straight face when that person has done nothing to provoke you other than being themselves, and then horror music starts playing in the background and everyone around you in the 1950's diner you're saying this stuff in goes silent and stares at you... kay, like... you're evil. If you can do that and you don't get that that's not okay and you need to stop? That's just evil. Don't be the evil sheriff in a cheesey 70's horror movie. Fucking... don't do that, that's evil. Don't be a fucking disney villain. I don't give a fuck what the hell kind of point you're trying to make, if you can sit there and make someone want to die just by undermining their self worth for no fucking reason, you're evil, and you need to shut the fuck up and die. Have something to say? Be human. Not hard, just fucking be human. I will never, ever understand or tolerate people being pure fucking evil regardless of what they're trying to argue. You could sit there and try and tell me pizza is good, but if you start telling me I'm a freak and don't deserve love and the horror music starts up and the diner goes silent, you're evil, and the time for discussion has passed, and my life is now in danger.  Idunno, seems pretty simple to me. Don't be evil. Just don't fucking be evil and we can all be human together and sort out our differences. I can't talk to you if there's stock horror music blaring in a creepy 1950's diner full of white people I just can't, sorry.  Long story short, TERFs need to learn to be human beings before I engage anything they say, the end."
"Yeah, I‚Äôm not fond of radicals"
"I've been binging your videos and.... I think I love you."
"I prefer to think of these people as Trans Exclusionary Radical Douchebags."
"I was excited to see what the super subtly placed pads were foreshadowing and oh boy was I not disappointed."
"JESUS FUCK the debate moderator is a fucking great character This is one of the funniest shows on YouTube, how am I seeing it just now?"
"I always hate that; 'that's an aberration' thing. Because really, anyone with blond hair, red hair and those like me. Someone left handed. Can count as genetic 'aberrations'. Considering that it's an accepted idea that blond and red hair is a recent genetic development.  That aside, things like intersex births are far more common than previously stated. Along with certain mental, physical and genetic disorders.  It's like, these people think they're those 'holy' people in the Chrysalids, hunting for any and all 'aberrations' (even slight ones, like extra toes) and killing them."
"Tefs -Clit , trans-women don't have a clitoris there for she isnt a woman"
"The assumption that Trans people are raped etc is an experience of misogyny is wrong, they're experiencing transphobia.  Also, Trans people aren't hated by us 'TERFS.' We just do not accept the sexist notion of 'lady brains' and 'man brains' most transfolk use to justify their transness, that not falling into female gender norms make you less of a female or vice versa which is why MOST trans people identify as trans. 99.9% of trans folk experience dysphoria because they fall outside the gender norms of their society, nothing else. They're victims but we're not gonna sugarcoat the underlying sexism of their trans identity. Granted, like said in the video, there are a minority of transfolk that experience dysphoria regardless of gender norms etc and don't use the 'male/female brain' as a justification of their transness, and we welcome these people. Also, people kneejerk react to people saying the stuff I say and call people like myself terfs when I'm not a Radical Feminist and find the whole vagina cult thing real and silly. And yes, while sex is concrete and biological wheras gender is sexist bullshit, that doesn't mean you cannot have a sex transition. Being male/female is not reducible to chromosomes or being capable of reproduction etc. Sex is also socially constructed, though it's grounded in biology as opposed to sexism. All we require is that the person goes through the process of transition from male to female so we cam call them as such. Identity isn't enough for us because sex is not an identity, gender is and gender is sexist bullshit. Once gender is abolished transness will be reduced to the people that refuse their sex purely out of reason aside from falling outside of gender norms, which is pretty much nobody."
"Contrapoint to 'women are people with uteruses/ who menstruate': What about trans-men? Would TERFs force them into womanhood? What if they're on testosterone? I don't think TERFs will welcome a Transguy on testo in their midst, even with his uterus. Genitals don't make a gender!"
"Wow, TERFs need to be silenced. Such cruel, hateful words."
"‚ù§Ô∏è EVERYTHING about this, Contrapoints. Just wow.. I have found all your videos enlightening, to say the least.  It has been an education sorely needed.  So.. I‚Äôve agreed with the points you make and the positions you take.  Coming from India, the trans community has been culturally visible (but abused) for centuries now and while we have national recognition for the ‚ÄúThird Gender‚Äù or eunuchs, gender identity itself was viewed a little differently from the West. I‚Äôve been familiar with the Western discourse, and thought I understood it.  That is, until Abigail showed up and demonstrated so many of the unconscious biases I‚Äôve held too. I now want to apologise for them. We can‚Äôt claim ‚Äúgender is a social construct‚Äù AND try to exclude transwomen from feminist issues :). Radicalism obviously wasn‚Äôt the way, but a lot of female identity revolves around childhood female struggle.  So, I think blurring ALL the lines around societal gender roles, sexuality, gender identity and body autonomy is a must. It‚Äôs something we will all stand to benefit from, in my view.  Blurring of official/legal mandates and general cultural norms do go hand in hand though. And you do some the most beautiful work in the world, towards that end, towards teaching people to understand and accept that for society to function we don‚Äôt have to really draw lines in the sand over who gets to raise children, or bring home the bacon, or even be the bottom :D.  Your junk isn‚Äôt, and shouldn‚Äôt be, an arena for discourse over societal ‚Äústability‚Äù.  That was my take home message anyway, and I really hope I haven‚Äôt misunderstood you, Contrapoints.  You are the goddess we‚Äôve all needed for quite some time now üèµ."
"I want my babyback babyback babyback ribs"
"I know this is a serious topic, but my favorite part of this video is Dave Rub... I mean Jackie Jackson."
"Those ribs DID look pretty fuckin good. Damn."
"At 14 I wanted my womb removed because I'm very sex repulsed and don't want children and periods are a massive pain, and though I now feel slightly on binary, I very much present as a women and am fine being seen as one, so I'd like to see terfs react to that idea lol"
"Wow this was literally the conversation I had with my dad the other day"
"how many lights do you own, woman???"
"Hey, I have a problem. I've been trying to feminize my rib-eating, but I can't get the strobe light and techno music to happen in synch. I'll start chowing down on that fat, meaty riblet and the lights will start going, sure enough, but no music! And then half an hour later, I'm walking out to the car, the shame of Applebees all, and the music comes in! I tried a couple more times, once at TGI Friday's and once at a Ruby Tues, but they just will not happen together. Any tips I and my boy can bounce on to make this experience all it should be?"
"I always love it when terfs bring up 'wide shoulders, tall, hairy' because then I can point to myself and other cis women with PCOS. Among other things, it causes us to have very high levels of testosterone. So yes, I have broad shoulders, a 'strong jaw',lots of body hair, and nobody's ever called my hands 'dainty'. No small number of us can (and some do) grow beards. All while having XX chromosomes. So yeah, my trans sisters can have those things and be every bit the woman I am. Secondary sexual characteristics = biological sex or gender has always been bs and will always be bs.  EDIT: Because someone will inevitably ask for evidence, just google novafuzzcheeks. She's a cis woman with PCOS who started growing a beard at 12 or so and only recently stopped shaving it off"
"New subscriber here. Just wanna say this almost made me cry. Not because i was transphobic but just to realize the amount of shit that you suffer. I thought it was bad but damn. And im a cis straight male if that's important."
"I am trying to figure out what it really means to be a woman. Until now i fell on the conclusion that being a woman had to be a person with female genitals because i couldn't agree with the definition of a woman being someone who fills the social role of a woman, because this social role is built by culture and inaccurate. I heard trans women explaining that when they were kids, they never liked sports, they loved dresses and make up etc and I was annoyed because loving make-up etc does not make you female. But with your explanation of psychology 'what matters is that you feel at ease with female embodiment and ill-at-ease with male embodiment' brings a new perspective to me. Thank you !"
"'' do vaccines cause feminism '' is a golden sentence thank you for it i never want to forget it"
"This would be an amazing format for a talk show. Two people arguing while the host gets steadily more drunk and spectates like its a bar fight. You could have done this in the seventies. Not everything was bad in the seventies."
"Many years ago I met a TERF. I'm a feminist, but I had no idea these types of women existed. It was all that 2nd wave feminist bullshit. 'We don't want men in our spaces.' I concluded that this person (and others liker her) have simply never met or spent time around trans women. My job involves providing services for trans folks and I interact with trans women in all stages of their transition. Even pre-hormone or pre-surgery or whatever, trans women just don't feel like men to me, and I wouldn't object to them being in 'women only spaces' because of it. My own experience aside, people with this sort of essentialist thinking can be almost impossible to get through to. The non complexity of their experiences reflects the simplicity of their dogmatic worldview."
"This was so great"
"i was staring at the package of panty liners in the background of abigail's shot's and i kept thinking 'are those Always? why're they there?' and then the payoff at 11:41 was Immense"
"Why does everybody focus on bitchy transphobic radfems instead of the transphobic cis males that go around murdering trans women like it‚Äôs a damn sport??? Just because murderous transphobic males aren‚Äôt as vocal as ‚Äúterfs‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they are any less dangerous. All of you need to get your priorities straight and focus on fighting against all transphobes instead of one small group."
"There's also cisgender women who are born without a vagina, or born without a uterus. It's an actual medical condition."
"This was a really weird video to be watching when a stranger came up behind me to ask where I bought my bagel chips üò∂"
"Trans women are women, but depending on when they transitioned should respect female spaces and conversations about sexism when they have lived the majority of their lives perceived as men, and reaped the benefits of male privilege or being able to choose to pass as cis straight male, which is an option women simply don't have to avoid discrimination. No different than how Cis women need to respect that only Trans women can truly speak to the trans woman's experience. I can totally understand how TERFs are problematic, but I have run into many drag queens and recent Trans women who seem to believe that they are as, if not more qualified to speak on the female experience, sexism, and misogyny, often in a way that is completely dismissive, minimizing, and derailing of female issues.    To bring the situation out of the bias of emotion, someone who's worked as an employee in a space is still an employee there, even if they've only worked there for a short while. However, they still need to respect that their input is going to be inherently less valuable based on sheer experience than someone who has been in that space for 20, 30. 60+ years. Someone who's a temp, or someone who's worked in that space for less than years full time is going to 110% get a hard side eye if they start arguing with life long members. Same logic, different situation. I unfortunately have found that many drag queens and recently transitioned women (which are different, I know, but tend to, in my experience bring the same bias to the table based on their male experience) bring a lot of misogynistic rhetoric to the table, and tend to undercut women's rights issues extensively in favor of the male experience they have lived with for the majority of their lives.    Not all of course, but in this space do we really have to #notall_____?"
"Today I learned about Swyer Syndrome. Thank you, @ContraPoints !"
"I've actually experienced someone who claimed Christianity use Diannic Wiccan language to attempt to explain to me why my identity is purely self delusionary nonsense. Thankfully, I didn't break down or flame like I really wanted to and although I didn't change their mind, I did at least get them to acknowledge the logical inconsistency of their argument. Apparently being wrong and admitting it are different."
"I get the point about Periods.  This is a rebuttal to the concept that a woman is a woman once she has her period.   Some Cis women don‚Äôt experience periods. I personally rarely have periods, does that make me have to identify as a Non-Binary person? No.   Gender isn‚Äôt black and white. Sure, there are some ‚Äúgenders‚Äù out there that just seem fictional.  I do admire the work that went into this though. I try my best to be an Ally to those who are Transgender and stuff like this helps me understand the stupidity and dangerous situations."
"If trans women were discriminated in the same and for the same reasons as way women are, you would expect the unemployment and sexual violence rates to be about the same between the groups. The fact that trans people suffer more than women clearly indicates society views them separately from women."
"I hope you never think these ugly things about yourself (what the terf is saying)"
"I still don't see how intersex is a good example of how gender isn't related to biology... intersex people are 1.7% of the population, that means 98% of the population is born one sex or the other. You can't let outliers make you throw out what we know is true for the vast majority. That argument is just ridiculous."
"mmh... ribs..."
"I first came across your 'Peterson doesn't understand post-modernism or post-structuralism' type vid that was right on the money and hysterical (obviously your field of expertise). Alot of the theses of many of your other vids aren't my cup of tea, but every video of yours I've seen has been extremely well made and funny. I would love to see an apolitical piece of yours."
"'demonizing menstruation and performing a caricature of the way i think women speak and behave is peak womanhood you guys omg!! just look at my ladylike thigh high socks!!'"
"Gender means nothing,especially in the English languge which doesn't have genders in its grammar like most European languages,and there is the fact how that term was popularized and in reality the researcher John Money did some horrifically unethical shit to prove it...and it failed. There is biological sex determined by the 2 sex chromosomes Yeah you have people with xxy,xyy etc. chromosomes but those ARE aberrations,saying that is not a valid measure of sex is like saying chromosome 21 isn't a measure of certain physical and mental attributes because people with Down Syndrome are a thing."
"I agree with this video! It gave me so much insight into the stuggles of trans women. I used to be a terf, heavily involved in the community and such. I still associate with radical feminism, and sex-based oppression, however I definitely think that trans women are women and their struggles and oppression as women need to be acknowledged ALONGSIDE cis women, not instead of (or vise versa). I hope for a day that feminism can be inclusive of everyone without talking over any woman. However that being said I do think it's important not to silence cis women talking about their oppression as cis women, and their vaginas (e.g., trying to rename a vagina to a 'front hole', banning those pussy hat things, getting mad at cis women personally defining their womanhood with/taking pride in THEIR genitals (without trying to silence trans women of course)). I can source those if you'd like by the way."
"How does one become a TERF?"
"Im not even trans and this video stings."
"Odin's Ravens that rib sequence xD"
"Abigail kinda looks like Winona Ryder!"
"Literally the first time I've ever watched your channel. I WILL be back to watch more. I really love that you actually represent the real arguments TERFs have and didnt just make her a cunty stereotype.   Dont get me wrong tho. TERFs ARE cunts.  Edit: You are very good at playing puano as well. Kudos"
"akdkss just listening to your fake terf character pissed me off so much i wanted to beat their ass."
"Gender is a state of mind. Gender is a subjective expression of self. It should not be projected in law or on to society. It's to ambiguous and ever evolving. It shouldn't even be called gender. Biological reality is sound."
"TERFs are repulsive, or in the best cases just laughable."
"10:40 tbh I was waiting for a dick joke"
"I swear the Vagina blood Cult is real. Like I'm not one of the cult despite the fact I do that"
"Um, that's not menstruating, that's hemorrhaging..."
"The scenario of the floppy genitals man is completely valid if we're talking ideologically. Who are you to tell me I don't feel like a woman, thus allowing me to prance about in women's locker rooms."
"All of you commie radfems are the same to me. You're all pushing your Jewish agenda and actively trying to destroy European culture."
"What an exact representation of menstruation"
"I'm personally on the fence on this issue and have a open mind to either side. I basically agree with most of the points made against TERFs in this video, but I feel as though some points were either missed or thrown to the extreme. So I'd like to see what people think about some of these points I've heard from more moderate radical feminists. 1) The vast majority of trans people are not out to get women and do truly believe they are women, but what is stopping people o from taking advantage of new laws and practices? Will there have to be a governmental body that evaluates each trans person to determine if they are really trans or potential sexual predators? And if so, what would be the determining factors that would disqualify someone from being trans? 2) While there still needs to be a lot more research done on this issue, with the current information provided, there is a large portion of the trans community that never transitions, stops their transition, or detransition. Many of these people then resort to therapy to treat their body dysphoria. Why is this approach seen as unsatisfactory compared to spending the vast amounts of money and time to transition? Also, other body dysphoria disorders, such as anorexia, would never be treated by using surgery and hormones to give that person their desired body, but instead with therapy. 3) Trans athletes. It is a biological fact that men are better at almost every sport than women. By allowing trans women to play in women's sports, they have a huge advantage, and are basically getting rid of the whole reason for sex divided sports. And there have been some resent examples of trans women beating women in women's sports, and personally, this issue is one I don't think I could budge on. 4) Children transitioning. This is another one I don't think I can budge on. Children are in no place to make this kind of decision, and parents should not be able to do anything to a child that will permanently affect them for the rest of their lives. I hear the puberty blockers argument a lot, but those make the user sterile for the rest of their lives, which is no a preferable option. I'd love to hear some feedback and opinions from people on both sides. I know this sentence will be ignored, but please keep all responses on-topic and civil. No need for people to get angry at 1s and 0s on the internet that will never agree with you."

"I got a couple of questions... I‚Äôm not a feminist and although there are some iterations of it I might agree with and respect, I strongly disagree with TERFs and non-TERFs in a billion things, especially this patriarchy and male privilege topic...   With that being said, why all the hate towards Terfs for not accepting the extremely unconvincing idea that identity is the sole constituent of sex? Do you do this too with the vast majority of inhabitants of earth who also don‚Äôt believe this? Why do TERFs get so much hate yet people from other cultures don‚Äôt?   Furthermore, what exactly is so horrific about this? How am I denying your humanity by not subscribing to this extremely unconvincing idea? How must it entail that I hate you or that I don‚Äôt want you to have rights?   The transgender condition generates agony, frustration and sadness in many people EVEN when they find social acceptance. It‚Äôs only until very recently, and only in some developed countries and to some individuals with the economic capacity to do so, that the condition has been able to be remedied in some way or another. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, transgender people need hormone therapy FOR LIFE to be who they want to be. What in the bloody hell is so horrific about acknowledging that it is a condition, and almost always a negative one?"
"Oh my god I love your videos. So informative and funny."
"Natalie why do you look like Winona ryder when you have the pink wig"
"Swyer syndrome - well done - but 1/80,000 does not a 'spectrum' make lol!! And it's questionable whether Swyers people are technically female, since it's one of the few conditions that results in genuinely ambiguous primary sex characteristics.  Women are adult human females, that's the ones who have grown ovaries, not testicles. If you are a man who hates the fact of his reproductive anatomy, that's sad, but it's literally nothing to do with being female."
"Hmm, this is the first time I really heard the arguments on both sides next to each other... it‚Äôs also the first time I heard the word ‚Äòterf‚Äô so that may show you how much I knew about this conversation.  I was going to go on a long explanation of my understanding of trans people and how it has changed over the years (though I do think I was always fairly accepting), but I think I‚Äôll just say thank you so much for this video. I really feel like I understand much more than I did 20 minutes ago.  Also, congrats on being a woman now. :)"
"What does it mean to be a woman? I read Tao de Ching when I was little so I think of feminine as yin energy, but that's a little bit sexist. :x  Some women have more yang energy. I think it does have something to do with having a womb, even if there are some women who get them removed, all biological women have them when they're born (except intersex). I sympathize with TERFs, even though I think trans women should be treated as women and allowed in women's spaces. Women have been fighting against societal pressure to look a certain way for so long, and it does seem like trans women are saying that appearance is what makes someone a woman, so the logical next step is that women who don't feel like or dress like women should not be women. Is this new paradigm of gender coercing non-gender-conforming women to identify as male or non-binary? What about women who do identify with their physicality but not with the gendered social role as women?  I could understand why TERFs wouldn't want to identify with the sex they grew up considering as the enemy."

"'that was some good free-speech right there...'"
"You got it all wrong, radfem definition of being female is not having a womb, not having XX chromosomes or small hands (where did you even get that?), but instead being assigned female at birth and raised as one, resulting in a female gender socialisation. So the main point of radfem is that someone who was raised as a man and has male gender socialisation will never understand what it's like to be raised as a female, have female gender socialisation and therefore be a female in a sense society gives us, in a deep psychological way. A boy and a girl face completely different realities after they're brought into this world, completely different pressures, expectations, set of stereotypes, etc. That's it, that's the reason why a woman can't be a man, a man can't be a woman and nonbinary genders are bullshit. Radfem statement about nonbinary and binary genders is simple: instead of creating more stereotypes and boxes to put people in, we should just get rid of the idea of putting people in those boxes whatsoever. So no genders at all basically. Idk, sounds good to me, but for the world we live in right now it's unrealistic.  Also most radfem aren't as angry and crazy as people love to portray them. Search tags 'terf/radfem' on tumblr and see that most of the posts are saying that terfs deserve to die, be raped and tortured, and actually radfem posts are pretty calm and chill and don't say that trans people deserve to die or whatever you may think they do. The ones who are agressive, however, had really bad experiences with men and some had really bad experiences with transwomen. After I went on the path of feminism and realised that I was abused by a transwoman as a teen, I was also very angry and agressive with my language and views. So like, I understand that you're hurt by radfem statements, but the real deal is - they're also hurt. So let's all hear and understand each other and shit."

"Just putting it out there, I know I don't speak for everyone but as a sexual assault survivor, seeing a trans woman's penis has triggered me and I'm fairly certain never will (and for context I was staring at people's crotches constantly to make sure no one around me was hard, for literally years). For me, at least, it's not about the body. It's about the intent behind the body, and I feel safe gauging that intent because I know there's like a 0.00000000001% chance, if any at all, that a trans femme would compromise her identity and a fellow trans person's safety like that."

"'would'nt sexual assailers' genitals be hard instead of floppy' I LOST MY MIND"
"Using 'biology' will never work as an argument because there will always be exceptions to any rule. Nature doesn't exist in pretty little boxes, it's not as simple as a highschool textbook will tell you--its messy and exists in a blurry state of 'well I guess that works.' There will always be petite cis men with high pitched voices and limited body hair, there will always be tall cis women with body hair and broad shoulders. Intersex people and people with chromosomal or hormonal disorders/imbalances will exist. People who have had medical procedures or malfunctions which require removal or alteration of genitals or secondary sexual characteristics exist. Sterile people exist. People with bodies that just don't fit what is considered the norm. Any definition trying to use biology as a kind of end-all-be-all will fail to protect individuals it wishes to speak for.   And different women will have different experiences with their identities and bodies. Cis women get breast reductions/removals, or go on testosterone, because, despite being women and being comfortable with being women, they are for whatever reason, uncomfortable with their own bodies, or being seen in a certain light by others. If you don't believe me, ask a butch lesbian why she's butch. Rejecting traditional femininity is not a mark on womanhood."
"This is hysterical"
"The definition of women is adult human female with female being the sex that produces eggs and can bear children. This does not fall a part on examination even if some women are infertile because this does not make them male. Trans women however are biologically male. Therefore, they can not be females. Transwomen can experience misogyny if they pass but are more likely to experience transphobia and homophobia. The vast majority of sexism is rooted in reproductive capabilities. Women should be able to openly discuss sex based oppression or even celebrate the female body without being called terfs of transphobic."

"As many others have commented, there is dialogue to be had regarding what the implications of transwomen and drag queens doing to 'appear feminine' and 'act feminine' are when it comes to what is expected and acceptable of biological women, but my main problem with TERFs is simply their insistence that all men are evil and women are all good, or anything bad a woman does is somehow the fault of a man. I don't think a man was the reason that a girl in middle school bullied me to the point of considering suicide, nor do I think it is a man's fault when a woman with a drug habit sells her kid to be raped by strangers for said drugs. Neither men nor women are inherently better or morally superior than the other, they are simply people who have different societal expectations and majorly different biological processes. Men and women are *complementary* at their most basic level -- reproduction -- but everything beyond that is what you personally make of it. That's it."
"I feel like this is an attack on how I eat ribs."
"Being a gay man is so much better than people think it is, and that is largely because I think it is and nothing else. Think you are and you are. Know you're not and you are not. Is it that simple?

"The rib scene was everything."
"Thank you for making this video!!! It answered so many questions for me!"
"There's just a huge logical leap between 'I feel uncomfortable embodied as a man, and more comfortable with being embodied as a woman' and 'I AM a woman'. The latter does not in any way follow from the former, that's just nonsense.  In order for the statement 'I am a woman' to be in any way meaningful, you have to define what 'woman' means. And TERFs have such a definition. Transwomen don't. Their position is essentially 'A woman is someone who identifies as a woman', which means that the statement 'I am a woman' is both tautological and totally meaningless in their framework."

A nice receptionist answered the phone and she told me TLC is a discussion forum with speakers of people who get together to discuss ideas. Like an AA meeting. Of course they have no actual power {wink}.  They merely discuss ideas, positions, and possible advice for government leaders and large capitalist industries. No big deal.

"While I side with trans women, I have to say that the argument 'I feel like a woman therefore I am a woman' is sort of weak. I mean, I agree with the sentiment, but it needs a stronger foundation (we cannot in general say 'I feel like X therefore I am X'). This is distinct from the argument that trans women face the same oppression as cis women, which is stronger."

The she posted something about tha fact that a unfaithful man is a mysoginist and a forgiveness woman has internelise mysoginy. I told her that as a psychologist i heard thousand of stories about unfithful couple and that male wasn't the most to be unfaithful, that it was more like 50/50, she told me i didn't understand. Then she told me that being in a love relationship with a man, as a woman, is a internelise mysoginy....So i told her i pretty like dicks (man dicks, thos one that come everywhere...never taste the mouthfeel of any other kind of dicks actually)...she told me i didn't understand and therefore she would'nt explain anything...then she ghosted me...  So fucking weird, i thought those kind of girls was scary tales masculinist told us to lead us far away from feminism...but it's not a myth! It's alive! ALIIIIIVE!"

"This is a complete joke. Whether or not you men like it, you are born men, just as we are genetically born female & people of various races/ethnicities may present physical features that are distinct to their group. Do you think us women always like all of the cards life dealt us? We don't necessarily get to change what we were born with. Take for example the fact that due to my whole, being a female thing causes me to suffer from multiple painful, chronic illnesses that there are no cure for (all of which can not effect males due to genetics). I don't get to just change the fact that I'm legitimately in the hospital every damn month (yes for my fucking period, which doctors refuse to help stop permanently). Try actually being a girl and telling your obgyn that you don't want to remove your uterus at the age of 25 (you'll be fucking laughed at). Not to mention the years of (what's considered to be) our most crucial development that you missed out on not growing up as an actual woman, as you mentioned in your transcript. This also branches out to pink tax and the fact that you aren't forced to pay for such things as birth control (which in my case is absolutely required to keep the symptoms of CVS, PCOS, among others at bay). Not to mention the fact that over the past few months, with our current political climate, companies producing birth control are starting to discontinue production, forcing us all onto either ridiculously expensive &/or unstable brands (went from paying $0-$100 a month for 28 fucking pills, 5 of which are sugar). Would you accept someone who was genetically born Caucasian if they painted their face and pretended to act as what they perceive someone of African decent to be? Would you then also try to argue with someone of African decent as to why they have no right to be offended by this, if that were the case? I understand that some people are born with both male and female reproductive organs, in which case, there is an exception. But you have no fucking right to tell someone who was actually born into this what they should and shouldn't be offended by when you do nothing but appropriate our gender, I'm sure as fuck you don't support cultural appropriation."
"But... but I'm technically female and I DO HAVE wide shoulders!  And I have excessive body hair! And big hands! (I think it's time for people to re-evaluate their beliefs about what makes you a 'genuine' female). Personally, I think trans women are lovely (and definitely female)."

"Watching this, while fully knowing this is a parody, was still hard. Especially Abigail's monologue about how trans women will never be women. It really just hit a sore spot for me that shows I have a lot of emotional and mental growth I need to go through before I think I'll be ready to put myself up on that proverbial pedestal of public transition. I still worry though that I'm just being complacent in the lack of conflict I face when I take the path of least resistance daily and put no effort into presenting as a woman.

"Great video. 'Femininity' and 'masculinity' are social constructs and changed throughout history, and they will always change. Gender on the other hand is still at debate - science has no definite answer. I personally believe that gender (which is sadly often confused with disgusting sexist gender stereotypes - especially by misogynists in right wings, conservatives and religions. They are so stupid that they confuse these two things - or want to confuse it) is real. Every school shooter is a male, men are (backed by science) more aggressive, mentally weaker, intellectually inferior but at the same time so confident - I tell you, testosterone is one hell of a drug.  We¬¥re all just human beings, let¬¥s accept each other. But I think the main reason some women don¬¥t accept trans women is because some trans women openly confuse these two - which harms ALL women and the bloody fight Feminists (both women and trans women) gave their lives for."
"I grew up listening to men joke saying: 'I don't trust women because they are creatures that bleed every month and doesn't die', amongst other period jokes enfasizing how gross vaginas are during our menses. So go on, keep on with your satires and cinisism about female genitalia and the female reproductive system, completely ignoring the fact the women were persecuted and deemed dirty and impure as long as recorded history exists. Go on, and ignore also the fact that still to these days, women do suffer oppression for having periods. For instance, in the country I live women can not drive ambulances 'because they may get to emotional when menstruating'. You probably thinking that I'm living in some middle eastern country under sharia law. No. I live in Brazil. A country that prides himself in the objeficition of women, known for sexual tourism and 'gorgeous women'. We still can not drive ambulances or busses. We can not join the firefighters. All due to our vaginas, that bleed and cause various chemical and biological reactions to our bodies. Your hormones may mimic what happens to us. But the discrimination you suffer, as trans, is not by being born female. It's merely by being trans and pushing a particular agenda. You know that you face discrimination because you are seen as an abomination by today's society. I regard you as an intelligent being so I imagine it will be not hard for you to figure it out why we, so called terfs, are fed up with your 'I'm a woman too and suffer oppression just like any othe cis women' narrative. You don't. The oppression you go through as transgender is different. For instance, you never had to fight the right to vote. You never had to prove that your brain is less developed than a male's. You do suffer violence, hardship and all that jazz. But your disrespect against a biological (or assigned as you most likely call it) gender is unreasonable and is no more then bigotry and denial. Keep making degrading jokes about periods, please. This way, you will naturally convince all of us that you, in fact, are a women. And, also, keep citing people with mutations and comparing them to otherwise healthy individuals, because, you know, that makes perfect sense and really feeds your narrative, obviously."

"I left a feminist community I used to be a part of because TERFs came in and very few feminists would stand up to them. So those of us who had any self respect declared the group a total loss and left. Without us, it rapidly fell apart and disbanded. Feminism isn't feminism if it isn't inclusive."

"That was uncomfortable.  My wife is a cis woman slightly taller than me with big, manly hands and Johnny Depp's jawline.  The idea that a TERF would exclude her based on morphology when she has the lived experience as a female her entire freaking life really irks me, maybe even more than the idea that her mother bought her COUSIN a Nintendo Entertainment System, but wouldn't buy her one, because it was a 'boy toy.'  That's rubbish."

"This is great - it's nuanced and entertaining. May I show this video in my classes on womyn's music?  I'm a cis white queer man and I often find myself teaching womyn's music and the debates around the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, a site where much of this 'gender critical' vs Transfeminist plaid/plays out. Because I'm a man, and a cis man at that, I've found it hard to take a position in these debates, instead I choose to teach both sides and allow my students to make up their minds; however I suspect I'm doing a disservice - if not violence - to trans women by not taking a position in their defense as an educator. Though I'm not sure you make your position known in this video (instead, I think, you point out the cruelty and absurdity of these debates), you have here an engaging, concise, and dialogic explanation of these debates that my students and I would benefit from having in my classroom.    P.s. You help me think more clearly about so many topics. Thank you for doing what you're doing."
"You are beyond beautiful inside and out."
"Tiffany missed a chance to point out that post-menopausal cis women also don't menstruate."

"Wow. As someone who struggles to understand the relationship between trans people and the gender binary, this is has been extremely informative."
"Thank you so much for this vid!  As a gal who's had hysterectomy years ago *and* has just gone through menopause (OH NO I'VE OUTED MYSELF AS AN OLD), I try to tell transphobic folks that if their silly biological crap is 'what a woman/man is', then I don't fit into their definitions either.  But you do it so much better. So. Much. Better.  Thank you. <3"
"They hate trans women because trans women were born with a penis and terfs hate men.  That's what it boils down to.   Trans women were biologically born a male so therefore they are evil.  Fuck terfs. Transphobic and misandristic scum.   I dont like transphobes or man haters.  Unfortunately that means I don't like you social justice warriors either because you lot also detest men."

"I think we need to have a conversation about how people thought she was really like that. She said the Jews were turning Atlantis gay when we ALL KNOW that the Jews moved Atlantis to the 8th dimension in an attempt to distribute bukkake porn."
"I love your videos. Another thing Terfs don't think about and something that proves gender is not genetic but assigned at birth, (and then later confirmed or denied), is Intersex people. They are born with both male and female anatomy but are assigned the gender they are 'closer' to. When they grow up they usually take hormones to make sure they mature as their assigned sex. But some of them go against their assigned sex when they get older. Some intersex people that are assigned male at birth grow up to find out they feel more like a woman, and vice versa. There are also some that feel like both and embrace being both sexes or neither."

"Also there needs to be a real discussion about how certain trans women can be misogynistic. I understand dysphoria and the genuine need to make changes for mental wellbeing . But women who go completely over the top with surgery and ultra 'feminine ' clothes .... I mean you can see why people think they have a shallow grasp of womenhood. They are creating themselves in soceitys strict ideal gender roles. I realize there are women who are misogynistic and really into beauty standards too but can't you see the power imbalance when a man makes this change.   Someone with no prior frist hand account of the oppression and sexual harassment women face everyday turns themselves into this parody of womanhood and then complains about their problems . And we are supposed to be completely supportive of trans people getting surgery after surgery to meet standards that we don't beleive should exist in the first place and that we are trying to get rid of.   It's more complicated than you are presenting it here .   I sort of wish being a feminine man would become more normal like being a tom boy has become normal.   I don't feel comfortable in dresses or with showing my body . I hate my breast and men's reaction to them. I try to get strong and like sports . But am I a man or gender queer ? No . I am just a woman . I see woman hood as being a broader catergory than that"
"Ok but for real I worked with a person who crossdressed (?) (still had male name ect). That's fine by me . However he happened to have a few screws lose too . He followed me home on multiple occasions and would make strange remarks .   He scared the shit out of me. In some cases woman will stil be more scared of trans women than women . If it was a biological women following me home I would not be as concerned . It's like the schrodingers rapist thing.   There is a valid concern about more and more labels for gender becoming constricting rather than empowering . Like why not just expand the labels we already have ... deconstruct the ideas of gender . Like how woman can ride bikes and wear pants and have tatoos and shit . The same revolution should happen for men."

"Damn. You did it again. üëèüëèüëè"
"That rib action though lmfao"
"Maybe the reason why trans women face worse gender discrimination than women is that people don't want to associate with trans women as inside everyone exists the same kind of pantomimic insanity as evidenced here. Why are you trying to argue that trans women are women when they're really not. You can be a third gender, then you wouldn't need to misappropriate women's issues for your own. Your arguments are faulty because your premises are incorrect."

"you know i dont think terf is a slur per say, but when im called that for saying im same-sex attracted and am not interested in trans women its hard to not take it as an insulting word, meant to dehumanize women and especially lesbians. also people are called terfs when they arent radical feminists or when they are trans themselves so it doesnt in fact seem to describe any specific group. idk what the exact definition of a slur is but 'terf' is sure used like one."
"the fuck is this implying that a man doesnt care about the genitals of the person he rapes?.... as if sexual desire doesnt play a role???? will a man stop raping me if i tell him im actually a trans man?"

"It truly baffles me that some Feminists think that trans women are 'invading women's spaces.' Yeah, because reworking your entire identity is just tons of fun, especially when society mocks them for it and treats them like shit. I mean, sure, cis women don't have the choice about whether to face sexism, but there're a ton of shit trans women have to deal with that we don't. Also, the patriarchy doesn't try to control the reproductive function of other men? What? Because society is just so accepting of gay men (sure, it's gotten better, but we've got a long way to go yet). It's interesting that in the case of homosexuality, it seems to be women who get off easier (so to speak)."
"Watched this drunk and cried lol. Love you."
"I think the the thing that people get hung up on is that just because someone's experience is not identical to a cis woman's (and the experience of being a trans woman is certainly not) that they must be defaulted back to 'man' rather than 'different sort of woman.' I think the latter is a perfectly fine way to understand transwomen -- no less a woman, but a different kind of woman than cis women, but to look at a transwoman and say 'You're a man' just seems preposterous."

"This is bloody brilliant! Rationalizing human instincts, while utterly important, will almost always end up diminishing the individual one way or the other? Although I'm not religious, doesn't mean Jesus didn't say brilliant things?  'Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.'"
"Why does she look like Winona Ryder in the pink wig. Hahahaha"
"There's something I don't understand. If having a vagina is not the defining factor that makes you a woman AND stereo-typically female social roles / stereo-typically female appearances ALSO does not make you a woman, than isn't being a woman just a meaningless arbitrary label? Like if a label carries no tangible criteria required to fit that label is it not just meaningless? And if this is the case why is it that trans people want to switch genders or feel uncomfortable in their gender and almost invariably trans people tend to take on the stereotypical style of dress and mannerisms of the gender they want to become. So I think it's disingenuous to say that being a woman has both nothing to do with biology and nothing to do with social roles. To non-trans people, woman is typically a biological term and to trans people it's typically a social concept but to say that it's neither just makes the distinction between men and women completely meaningless begging the question as to why a person would feel the need to transition."

"What about the feelings of TERF's?  Is there a hierarchy of feels?"
"I always thought it was gross the way radfems (who aren't even RAD like, wtf? It's time to reclaim being rad and femme) place so much emphasis on the reproductive system. Lots of people cry when they're told they cannot have children but I was honestly relieved because having a uterus makes me extremely uncomfortable and so does the entire concept of pregnancy and motherhood. Not because of internalized misogyny either. Anyway, hella cool video (again)."
"Damn. So I was a TERF all along. I thought about over the 'disabling gender roles will remove gender disphoria'. Thanks for the enlightment."
"Talk about TERFs aside, that first part with Tiffany Tumbles and the BBQ ribs was absolutely hilarious. I would totally shake your hand, however I'm almost certainly based thousands of miles away, which would make shaking your hand right now basically impossible unless I was Mr Fantastic"

"You have some serious piano skills, dude. Jelly."
"Every question ends up eternal.  Social derision and suppression by force are two different things. If people are terribly wrong, there is nothing 'icky' about blasting their points apart, and showing them why they are ridiculous.  We always end up automatically stigmatizing such views on the basis of our knowledge, that does not stop us from refuting them when they surface on their own terms."

"Nice video! I kinda see what it is the view from many people around and which is true, I can't deny that people mostly tend to discriminate toward people who just want to be in the other face of the coin.  Still I will say a few dumb things from my view, these may be true or not, but its mostly from my culture 'patriarchy' thing, I come from South America, a latin american country that has this 'Macho Culture' still around, so from my views here comes the experiences and disappointments as a cis-woman on a daily basis  For me, at least here in Latin Am√©rica, the culture itself benefits the man over the woman, down here there is still this mentality that men are better than women by just having a penis, which is wrong, any person whatever they are is just as equal as the other no matter what they got under their pants, and this includes trans and non-binary people.  As I've been experiencing, an example of whole 'patriarchy' on cis-women is literally the thing about 'having a vagina', anyone here may wonder why but as a cis-woman you can't be safe at night in the streets, which includes transwomen too (but I'm gonna explain this more deeply later), men when they see a woman or even a little girl alone they will catcall them not because of beauty but morbidity and dominance, to the point to even trying to grope you or disturbing you while you're walking (at daylight), this is something that is done mostly because of the feminine aspects that are shown to the world, the whole concept of 'Femininity' in Latin America is mostly seems just as 'cute, weak, for pleasure and beauty toward men', which is super toxic and I sincerely say this from my point of view from experiences and the things I've seen.  Why thinking that being a woman means that they will rape you down here? First off, men down here acknowledge the fact that the common women isn't strong enough to deal damage, which is true. Whenever a man rapes a girl or a woman, it is still the fault of her no matter what, which is a thing that feminism been trying to fight a lot down here, whenever they rape or kill a girl, there is this question that is always for the victim  Where you alone? Why weren't you with a man to defend you?  From childhood they always teach girls that they must take care of themselves and not be alone with men or being at high night hours, but they never say to men that they should never touch a woman, or never catcall them. I've seen how a 11 years old girl came to school crying because a pervert masturbated and finished on her school uniform, inside a public system with people, they didn't help her, she was 'ALONE' and was the mothers fault for not take her to the school at 7:30 AM. Being a woman in latin america means that you will suffer sexism and treats against yourself daily or as many times of your life, from childhood to your teens and even adulthood. This simple thought is always given, it is always the girl fault by 'not being with a male guardian', you can be with 3 or 4 girl friends around, but if there isn't any man around its told that 'they WERE ALONE' (literally, 4 people hanging around, if they're just women they are alone, this doesn't happen to men-only groups or a mix-group), men are always taught since childbirth that men are strong, that they shouldn't cry, that they must fight and show anger, that they are superior to women somehow, that if a woman cheats on a man she is a bitch, if she is pregnant and is young she is a 'madre luchona aka single furious and fighter mother', they make fun of women who are single, men discriminate about your beauty by showing certain aspects that to another women don't, being more pretty than the woman next to you means that you will get privileges, the more pretty literally means the more attention, but at the same time it means danger because if you are too pretty they will try to abuse you, if a 10 years old girl gets pregnant is usually forced to give birth because 'women at any age whenever they get pregnant are meant to be mothers and give birth'.  As a cis-gender I've been told that I'm a non-mature person by the simple fact that I wanted a sterilization, which came from a cis-gender female gynecologist, literally the fact that 'by being a woman' I should give birth which is the meaning of being a woman and another reason was 'you never know if your spouse or boyfriend will ever want a child, for love you must force yourself on things you don't like'. Literally no matter how much I said that it is my right to choose my way of birth control, i've been told no, that was against 'ethics and personal beliefs', funnily since the country that where i am supposed to live has a law 'against discrimination toward women decisions' that says that anyone over 18+ can have the choice of getting an sterilization, still every doctor down here will tell you no by just being a woman, no matter how much you want to pay, private or public, it is that way since years.  Women are always told that they are killers, assassins when it comes to abortion, because they say that women can't decide an abortion because they're literally putting an innocent life death sentence,  mostly men always say 'well just close your legs' giving this answer to every women, thinking that they are sluts by having a non-wished pregnancy, even that people like me are with the same person for years and simply don't want kids, i am cataloged as a slut, if any birth control fails (condom, pills, etc) well, forced to be a mother, by law abortion is still illegal in these cases.  A common thing here in Latin America too, is that women must do the house chores, I did all the house chores since I was young, even dinner and lunch because I am a woman, while my brother who is older than me by 7 years literally just had to study, I had to iron his clothes for university, I had to make him lunch, i had to make his bed and clean the bathrooms, because my mother screamed at me with her macho culture imposed on her that I MUST do the house chores by being a woman. Men always get freedom, as simply as being able to close your bedroom door, as a woman I never had that privilege and that is kind of common unless you are a bit wealthy, wealthy people is less exposed to these kind of things and is around the 4% of the population in my country, the rest of the people are people who live under 600 bucks monthly and still can't have savings.  I sincerely can't deny that patriarchy exists, and as I said before, women and transwomen suffer these things; Transwomen suffer the imposition that was put over women, because they didn't want to be 'normal men', trans people suffer a lot of violence and rape too because of this, because of being feminine, because of wanting to be a woman.  Beauty standards are imposed to both of us, trans women and women down here have to deal with the macho bullshit. Trans women are called sluts because somehow 'being trans means that you're prostituting yourself' which is totally wrong and is still a common belief.  Men down here encourages the violence toward us by just simply 'thinking that is being a macho', getting raped by just having a feminine feature from a vagina to just wanting to be seen as a woman in society, being imposed and told that because you are a woman you must serve men, being told to stay slim and never get fat because your partner (male for heterosexuality cases) will cheat on you for a 'BETTER' woman (literally saying that having beauty must be enforced and that men can have the right to look outside the relationship by these things.  Still men suffer from the patriarchy too, they get told not to cry, that they are strong and it is a shame to be weak, that being a virgin at your 20's is lame and that men should be hypersexual and have a lot of experiences, that men must always have superior education, to play football, if you like pink you're a faggot, if you are trans that means death because that means you're weak.  I love the idea of abolishing Patriarchy, I don't want beauty standards, I don't want people being harmed just by their birth sex, or gender, I don't like the idea of having stereotypes, I want men to be able to wear skirts without shame, I want transwomen to be accepted because they are people, non-binary are people too, women are people too, the simple concept of having someone in front of you, you must respect them because they are as human as you.  I want transwomen to feel safe at night as I want to feel safe at night, I want that feeling away, the feeling that if you are alone by just being a woman means that you will get raped and die, and if you survive the rape, they will tell you that it was your whole fault, because of your clothes, your face, you were alone, you were only with women, your body, your sex, yourself.  I always feel that transwomen or any trans person is awesome, I mean literally defying the norm and culture that was taught by force, is amazing, but still it worries me that by doing these things they get witch hunted whenever they are, no matter the continent. I just can't understand how hard it is to accept that people just want to be themselves, for them to be happy. You and all the other trans people, you decide to be what you want to be because of your happiness, what is wrong with that? What is wrong to be able to express yourself the way you really are?  But beside everything above, I sincerely don't believe in womanhood, or I try to not believe because by what I've been gone through had taught me that my womanhood was always being under the aspects and thoughts of men, patriarchy. The last thing that Patriarchy wants is that women get their voices up, including you and me, the men that suffer for not being able to be emotional, the women that don't want to be mothers, and the people who what they want to be.  I just want us to be equal :( no matter the gender I want to abolish the differences that hurt us."

"*its almost like trying to decide who 'isnt' a woman is counter-productive to feminism and does nothing to actually help women, and that freedom to express or reject womanhood should (and is!) a freedom good feminism aims for and that includes ALL goddamn women!!!* (btw, im absolutely hooked on your videos. i love your editing style, your acting, your costuming, and the extremely entertaining way you get important points across! trans pride forever <3)"
"Laughing and learning so much right now!!!!"
"I feel like there might be a few arguments against 'transexualism' though, and I don't know how to answer them. I hope this comment is not too offensive btw. I just want the perspective of a transperson on this.    ‚Ä¢If gender is just a social invention, made to categorize people and used to oppress females, what would make you trans? I mean, according to society we are the gender which or body looks most like and that is not effected by our mental state. I would be treated as a woman by our society, and there for seen as a woman, because I am perceived as a woman based on what I look like, how I talk and walk and so on. I don't feel like a woman tho. Not like a man either. I do wish that I could be freed from the expectations put on me for being born into the category 'woman'. I don't think that makes trans. I think most people are uncomfortable with their gender. Is that not the reason why so many kids say 'I'm not like other girls/boys'? No one is like all the other people of their gender. Therefor I think that gender should be understood as descriptive of how society treats you - not on how you 'feel inside'.  ‚Ä¢Can you even be a gender in the first place? If you can't - can you be assigned the wrong one? ‚Ä¢If women and men are actually biologically different (which I kind of think is implied by saying that you can be born as a gender), couldn't that mean that some inequalities between them are okay? Let's say that women are softer, more caring (or however you define your womanhood), why shouldn't we have women work with for example children if they are better at it?  What I basically mean is that if we say that transwomen are women (or that you can be born as another gender than what your sex implies), doesn't that mean that we are saying that men and women are different, in any other way than reproductive organs? I don't believe that we are. I believe that if we lived in a truly equal society there would only be people, no genders, and I don't know where to fit trans people into that theory.   With that said, I don't believe that trans people are lying, or that they should not be respected as if they where the gender they say they are. After all, I don't believe that cis women are really women, or that cis men are really men. That obviously doesn't mean that I'm gonna tell them that they are wrong about what gender they are. Same should go for trans people.   I will say that I don't relate to being a gender. I did, for a shorter period, define myself as gender queer/a gender because of this. I don't want to come of as a TERF, and I really hope I'm not being one. I just hope that my questions could maybe lead to a discussion on gender. I haven't dared asking any of my trans-friends since I don't want to come of as questioning their identity. I hope this was the right place to ask."

"Could you elaborate on ''feeling like a woman''? Do you mean that psychological thing where a male child identifies with his mother instead of father? Because this can actually be a deep and serious cause of being disphoric with one's sex. Although in order to realise that, one have to examine their past with a therapist. Either way, most women would laugh this statement off. You grow up as a person belonging to a particular group and you don't know what it feels like to be a person of another group. You only see them as ''the other''. Even if you somehow feel you identify with them then objectively you still can't know what it is to be them and what it ''feels'' like. You only see a societal depiction of them as ''the other'' from male point of view. You can't even know what any other human being feels on the inside and how it feels to be them. This is just so absurd. What makes us feel like we're women is our societal experience and physical one. Male human beings are percieved as male/men, no matter what their feelings are like and it's the same with females. So you have an experience of being a man in this world. Gender non-conforming man who identifies himself as a woman or  who identifies with a societal concept of womenhood but it's still not experience of an actual woman. You can grow your breasts  and body fat through hormonal therapy and this is what your physical experience is limited to. But you claim to ''feel like a woman'' before you take hormones so it's not about that."

Also one could at least discuss critically how Butch lesbians are today redefined as 'trans men'. And then there is also also the point of the 'terfs' that by erasing the concept of womanhood you're basically erasing the subject of feminism. Finally, reading all the comments hating not only on 'terfs' but also on 'swerfs' you probably should do a video discussing prostitution from a feminist position."

There are enough forces out there like populism, religious groups, misogyny, homo- and transphobia, we should not turn on each other. The problem with the different experiences could be solved by sharing the various experiences of discrimination as cis women and trans women.  And just like there are TERFs who are really annoying i have to add there are trans women or non-binary people who do not identify as feminists and promote a stereotypical way of life for women and then, yeah, i do have a problem with them just as much as i do with cis women who turn on their own gender and support (some) men in their harassing and discriminating against us - or to say it simply: support patriarchy. And then, if i attack their view, i do not mind if they are cis or trans - i mind their opinion."

I have to say though that a cult that worships menstruation and the moon, two connected cycles sounds pretty dope to me, that is if it weren't populated by TERFs (as in this video). I'm a wild heathen with a yoni painting on my wall but I definitely believe that trans women are women.  I'm currently working on an article about virgin goddesses and women who chose to not use their wombs to make babies. Do you think I should mention that trans women and women who get hysterectomies are women? I'm not trans so I want to be inclusive but I don't want to be sticking my voice where it doesn't belong.  Anyways I'd love it if you got back to me as I will have to read this article naked in front of people so I want it to be good. Thanks!  Love, Madeleine"

"'Dodst thou bleed?' ---- What? Are proffesional female gymnasts not women?"
"Definition of woman: adult human female. I'm sure you've listened to this one. Female: cromossomes XX, internal and external reproductive organs of females and female hormones that are naturally produced.   Intersex people are not female or male, so they're not women. But they are socialized into one gender, which is always bad for them. Because the problem is the gender.  Why the hell do you belive that changing yourself into a female body will stop the opression that trans people have at work an so? It will only reinforce it, because the opression is based on who looks like women.  Saying that someone is not a woman is not violence, when they are not. Even because, calling yourself a women wont stop your opression in any form. Actually, if you call yourself a man, even if you look like female, it can save you from opression.  The experience into growing up being teached to repress yourself due to the female genitals you had when you was born is what gives you the sense of femininity, not the clothes you choose. If you were not socialized this way, then you can't clame for yourself the feminity."
"Actually, men have tried to control the reproductive organs of trans people. There are still countries where you can only have your gender marker changed on your ID if you have been irrevocably sterilised.    I do encounter transwomen who have been affected by their male socialisation in terms of privilege, which affects how they interact with cis women, transmen and anyone else who is not a White Cis hetero man. Yes, it is a touchy subject. It is mostly an issue among transwomen who are newly out or have just started transitioning. Moreover, I do not feel transwomen should sacrifice what assertiveness they have in order to transition."

My best friend's roommate is a gender-critical feminist, so I've had the pleasure of being able to hear her side of the story, and this doesn't even come close. Most of what it seems to boil down to are the gender norms into which you were enculturated as a child, not your reproductive organs."

"I don't know what I was expecting from this comments section. Why did I read it? I don't know.  And I don't know why I'm writing this, either, aside from that I want to. So, cue me screaming into the void about gender.  Big, fat disclaimer here- this is all talking about my personal experiences and what's inside my head. I don't know what's in yours besides 'not me,' and that's okay; I'm sure y'all have different experiences than me.  Also, note to the, uh, everyone in the comments but especially the other trans girls: I love y'all, but you are not very good at debate. Shout out to those who actually sourced their claims! We need more of that.  One of the main things I've been seeing here is whether trans women are women, which, okay, that is the ostensible question posed in the video. But I'm here to pose a different question to you: does it matter?  Like, no, really, does it? Sure, if you're attracted to trans women and a cis guy, then the question of if you're straight is important to you, I understand that. Similarly for if you're a cis woman. But like... that's on you, not them. It's not someone else's job to define your sexuality for you, and some sexualities are really weird- speaking from experience here. Maybe you don't like men or women, you just really like penises; similarly, maybe you just really like vaginas. I don't know. But it's kind of reductionist to say that a vagina equals a woman or a penis equals a man, isn't it? What about intersex people, or people who have their genitals removed, like eunuchs? (Apologies, I can't find a word that doesn't reduce someone to their lack of genitalia but is appropriate here.)  And, furthermore, what does it matter what genitals someone does or doesn't have if you're not going to be sleeping with them? It seems like these people who insist that trans women are really men (and vice versa) have no intention of ever being intimate with trans women or trans men, so... why does it matter to them? (We're putting crime aside for the moment, and just assuming that everyone will act politely.) I personally wouldn't care if Donald Trump had a penis or not, I still wouldn't sleep with him because he's a prick, he's rude and disrespectful, that's not what I look for in a partner. So, why is it their business?  Okay, now we're going to talk about crime. Just for this paragraph, though. The primary reason for, say, bathroom bills I've noticed has been that cis men will go into women's bathrooms, pretending to be trans women, and then dangle their bits menacingly. (Okay, I'm being a bit dismissive here- seriously, it is kinda really horrid to have that happen to you.) My question here is, what's the difference between that and cis women doing it? If you, a cis woman, go into a women's bathroom and there's another cis woman there who lifts her skirt to flash you, then what's the difference between if she's cis or trans? And, furthermore, why do you think that adding more laws that say not to do something will stop people who are already literally committing a crime?  Whoops, we're talking about crime more in this paragraph. Sorry, y'all. But, that doesn't actually seem to be the viewpoint; the viewpoint seems to be that, if bathroom bills are not passed, then flashers cannot be kicked out of bathrooms. I hate to say it, but you're wrong. Flashing is a criminal offense if it's in public, and the bathrooms that this is going to happen in are public bathrooms, the kind with multiple stalls. They have 'public' written in the name. So, if a flashing happens there, the flasher can and should get into trouble, regardless of their gender.  I'd recommend using private bathrooms, if at all possible; single stall ones, where there's just the one toilet, are much better than ones with multiple stalls for the simple reason of 'there's no reason for other people who aren't in a caretaker relationship with you to be there while you are.' (Well, except for janitors.) It seems like constructing multiple sets of single stall bathrooms instead of a single multiple stall one should be good for reducing crime that happens in these bathrooms, but I haven't seen data that indicates either way. Please show me if you do!  Back to the point at hand, though- what I find is that being referred to as a woman is most comfortable for me. It's not hurting anyone. So what's wrong with it? And if you're going to argue that it's hurting me, then that's still my choice to make; you're not my mom, dude, you don't get to dress me or make my decisions for me. Tons of people endanger themselves every day; why focus on this one, which can only possibly hurt me mentally, versus decisions like drinking or smoking which have been shown to definitely hurt people physically? Why is this important to you, if you don't want to be my friend or in my bed?  And, if it's 'cool to be trans,' and hundreds of easily-influenced teens or children jump onto the bandwagon without actually being trans- then they'll jump back off later. Let them make that mistake. If they're true to themselves, and they're actually cis, then... hey, they'll realize that sooner or later and back off from being trans. And that's okay. It's okay to try out different identities to see what fits best, what's most comfortable. Not everyone needs to know what they are and what they want all the time; we can just take a more relaxed view, especially as progresses in technology make life easier and easier for humans and make our lives longer.  But if we're going to be chill-ass robots, then we're going to have to start by chilling out now. Peace, nerds. Thanks for reading. <3"

"I had gender dysphoria for many years, and it's a selfish problem. On top of gender dysphoria, I had abuse to deal with, my Dad died of Cancer when I was young,  blah blah sad story. Of all of my struggles, the Gender Dysphoria was ONLY about my self-image, it was a selfish problem compared to my other problems, and it actually became less of a problem when I put effort into fixing the other areas of life, like my damaged family and stuff.   If you have the freedom, like Contra, to make Gender Expression your main 'thing' in life, then you are the definition of privileged and out of touch with the rest of the world. 'How you see yourself and how people see you' pales in comparison to watching a loved one die in front of you, and beyond that, 'how other people see you', or even what they call you, is none of your god damned business. Your right end where other's begin, and if you have a small minority in a population trying to extend their rights beyond their own boundaries, eventually there will be a backlash and the majority will re-assert their rights, in an ugly way, and you Contra are pushing our culture closer to that ugly backlash every day by making YOUR issues into OUR issues.   If you identify as a woman, go ahead and do that, but that is a problem you are LUCKY TO HAVE compared to most of the rest of the world who suffers and starves and has to deal with real problems like work, family, and finding meaning in life. You, Contra, are the worst stereotype of a privileged white north american male. You have TINY problems which you invent for yourself, and act as if you're living through fucking Jim Crow when you're not. My upbringing was almost entirely around far lefties, liberals, circus folk, music festival kids, gay, trans etc, and You Contra, are a wolf in sheeps clothing. I know your type exactly. A trans activist male-lesbian, you just dont have a good relationship with masculinity and you failed at competing in that realm so you've femmed yourself up and have embedded yourself in a world where you can access Liberal pussy freely, under the false guise of your accessibility as a woke 'woman'. I've literally seen exactly this before and used to even lean in this direction at a point in my past which I am not proud of.   Your activism hurts your cause, so just fucking stop, cause youre only doing it for the attention and because youve finally found a realm in which you can (sorta, kindof) compete."

Some women are hyper-feminine because it's fun for them. Maybe they don't want to please the patriarchy. I don't think people should be forced to conform to gender stereotypes, but I also don't see the harm in women being feminine because they want to be. Be gender non-conforming if you'd like but also realise that women who are hyper-feminine aren't always internally misogynistic."

I want to have a better understanding of something that is seemingly so complicated and foreign to me, but it is still so taboo that such information in an easily digestible format can be hard to find.

"Wow. Nicely done, Contrapoints. I stumble on your channel from a recent video you did about Jordan Peterson. And I just have to compliment you on this and your other videos. I really admire someone who can play two sides of such a heated debate (like this one) really well. And you do! The fact taht you had to put a disclaimer ('please read before assuming my views') is, to me, a testament to how well you can 'step into' both sides of this discussion.   Really enjoying the videos."
"Thought Experiment: Say you have a genderqueer person who asserts the idea that they are intersex. An intersex person might very well object to this, saying that you can't do that. Being intersex has a morphological and medical definition, one cannot simply 'feel' intersex. Furthermore, you cannot simply put on intersex identity like a new jacket, it's a life-long lived experience that often comes with a lot of hardship.   Of course, if you haven't gotten the point by now, all the above points can be applied equally to men and women, but yet it is against modern gender dogma to say that one cannot 'feel' woman because being a woman is a lifelong lived experience and not a detachable or attachable identity. But when applied to intersex, would anyone argue with the above paragraph? You might say it's not an apt analogy, but then are you suggesting that being intersex is not a defined sex like man or woman? That special rules should to apply to it?"

"What do you think about this: in the UK, if a man 'legally' transitions to female, his marriage can be annulled (meaning no spousal or child support).  IS this simply government overreach or is this the logical end point of trans activism? See Germaine Greer speak on this."
"I don't want to appear transphobic but I certainly agree with a good 60% of Abigails points. Which is astonishing since I am allergic to third wave feminists.  Esp. in the exchange about definitions of woman. You can't take all the outlier circumstances (Swires syndrome etc.) and exclaim that that somehow confounds our commonly understood definition of female or woman.  Anyway Contra, I hope the whole thing is successful. No harm to you. You are very smart so doubtless you can deal with all life throws at you. Perhaps when you are fully transitioned and completely passable you will see the amount of courtesy and consideration the majority of blokes extend towards woman almost without thought and might be able to produce some content that dosent belabour the misogyny charge.  Yours, in partial opposition (but with no ill-intent)"

"You can paint the house, build a new porch, upgrade the plumbing, buy new furniture, and refurbish the basement, but it is the same house and postal code. You can make all the changes to your body  you want but you still have the same  XX or XY  chromosomes you were born with.  You can only pretend to be a different sex, but if that makes you happy go ahead. But don't expect the rest of the world to agree."
"The 'terf' has some valid points though. I do believe that we should have sex segregated public areas like lockerooms and prisons. If the trans activists aren't willing to make a distinction about what 'trans' is, why should we allow them to occupy any space they want. You yourself are 'genderqueer', you feel that you are not a man or a woman. Should women  just be expected to open up our spaces to accommodate... whatever genderqueer is?  Someone please tell me"
"Omg, I love the host"
"Omg the Rubin report reference üò©üò©üò©üëåüëåüëå"
"The point you, or the 'host' (idk Im new here) make about filling the societal role of a woman is what makes you a woman. If you actively fill the role of a woman, imo, youre a woman. You can argue about whether or not its stereotyping and bad, but thats all pretty secondary to the reality which, I feel, is that most people only care if you present yourself and act in a way that fits what they view a woman should do/say/act like/look like. This is my perspective as a trans woman. I think Im visibly trans/pass maybe 60% of the time, so maybe there's some play with that."
"Holy crap. the production of this video must have been hell. That's a lot of work. Tip of the Hat."
"these will make excellent refrence material for future generations to look back on when reflecting on social issues of this era. Some one needs to start that archive"
"For a long time I've been struggling with my gender identity. At certain times I'm extremely uncomfortable with my masculine features and other times I barely care. When the TERF started talking about how '...even if you do decide to mutilate your genitals, you'll still have big hands, and wide shoulders,  and you'll tower over females like a monster' it basically reminded me of all the shit I say to myself whenever I think I'm going to actually come out fully to my family and friends. I'm 6'6'. I have facial hair I have to deal with every day, and people who tell me I don't look good clean shaven. I have hairy arms and legs, and chest hair and I hate all of it.   I guess it just struck a chord in me, that line. It made me feel uniquely gross about myself, as only a TERF could. I don't know if I'll ever come out, or transition, or even if I *AM* trans, but I do know that if I woke up tomorrow as a woman I wouldn't complain, or feel weird, or anything.  Sorry for rambling."
"I could make him bleed."
"DOST THOU BLEED"
"'im sitting there, barbecue sauce on my titties... '"
"I realize this video is old so I don't know if my question will be answered, but I do have a serious question that I'm often afraid to ask: Why are trans women so concerned with being accepted as 'real women'? Full disclosure, I do believe there is a difference between a trans woman and a biological woman so it will be more convincing. I know everyone as individual human beings have different experiences, but trans women have experiences that biological women will never have and vice versa. So why not just keep the two categories separate and then mingle on shared topics that we're both concerned with?"
"This satire is brilliant."
"there are only 2 genders... people i want to hump and people i don't want to hump! anything else is pretty much irrelevant  should work for pretty much everybody"
"was that top okay after you poured barbecue sauce on it??? omggg"
"not fetishizing vaginas and menstruation =/= thinking they're gross (or at least not any grosser than any other human function) terfs are defined by their vagina fetishism and it really is creepy, just like straight men's obsession with their dicks."
"Wait... I was born female, but I have big hands, wide shoulders, and am taller than most women. Am...Am I not female? This whole time, I was a dude?  I don't like TERF arguments, they're pretty questionable in general. But, I can kind of understand where they're starting out from. I don't like admitting this about myself, but I do have a knee-jerk, instantaneous reaction to trans-women. That, 'Oh, that's a guy.' Or initially side-eyeing a trans-woman talking about feminism and women's experiences.  But, I recognize these things for what they are (biases) and don't let them dictate my attitude and behavior toward trans people or whether or not I listen to what they have to say. And, truthfully, I can point to at least one example of a trans-woman illuminating something about the female experience that I *didn't even realize* had been going on my entire life. Paula Stone Williams' TEDTalk actually upset me because it took a trans-woman to point out how I've changed my behavior over time to compensate for frequently being doubted on the simplest of things."
"why do you look like winona ryder in that wig"
"This is pure art"
"'wouldn't a sexual assailants genitals be hard instead of flopping?' LMAO"
"Abigail Cockbane would be my drag name, if I ever enter that field."
"TERFs are dumb. I'm not a trans woman and I have broad shoulders, big hands and feet, and what would be considered traditionally masculine traits. That doesn't make me any less of a woman though, and it doesn't trans women either.  That being said menstruation is definately 100% like this."
"I'm on Abigail's side! :)"
"damn you a prettier woman than me lol love you"
"you‚Äôre a sexist man. fuck off. women don‚Äôt claim you."
"Why is it so hard to understand, that biological there are men, women and some intersex people. There are male genitals, female genitals and some have both. Why cant we accept that biology defines the sex and that we still can live the way we want. If a man wants to live his live as a woman, go for it, then he is a transwoman and transwoman have their own problems with oppressions that are special to them. Live like you want, everybody should live the role he or she wants, but a transwomen is not a women, fact. Thats unscientifical ideology that doesnt help anyone."
"Really helpful on the TERF nightmare. A number of old feminist comrades seem to have lost the plot over this.  Here's my point. I noticed a similarity in their discourse with nationalism. (Maybe we should call it National Feminism!)  So.....words have meanings, right? And 'nation' derives from a Latin word meaning birth. 'Nation' means a shared ancestry. So can a Jew be a German? Can a Chinese person be British? See what I'm driving at? It would appear we have widened the meaning of 'nation' over the years. We can do that with gender too. Solidarity! Personally, I'm postgender.......like being postmodernist but a whole lot less fun...... xxx"
"You are absolute magic."
"Pretty awesome. By the way, there's nothing wrong with having a strong female spirit in a male body. It's perfectly natural to have both powerful feminine and masculine spiritual entities within yourself. I suppose that most people have the experience of only one truly conscious spirit within themselves, and might not be actually conscious of their other internal 'dreamers', let's call them. Psychonauts such as myself dive into ourselves and awaken all of our aspects as we find them, and I have to say, I found a perfect balance of the masculine and feminine, even though, to begin with, I was masculine dominant. Now I'm balanced.  The Indians have a concept of Shiva-Parvati (Ardhanarishvara), a soul that perfectly balances the masculine and feminine, something also found in Daoism's inner alchemy (the Yin/Yang symbol can be read this way), and also in Western alchemy (the stag and the unicorn / anima & animus).  The stories go that we begin as children being quite neutral, with both masculine and feminine aspects being dormant. Then as we get a bit older, one of those spirits awakens and becomes dominant, while the others sleep. As a general rule, it's a spirit that corresponds to our sex, but not always. Nor are the other sleepers silent, for they project themselves onto the world in various ways, make us act unconsciously, make us feel attracted to or resonate with people who embody them. Those projections are clues to psychonauts as to what to look for within themselves during trances/waking dreams.  It's said in all 3 pursuits of inner alchemy, the awakening of the sleepers (other colourful metaphors available), is a process by which all of the inner masculine and feminine aspects are brought into consciousness and carefully integrated. This means that regardless of whether you are a man or a woman, you end up with a perfectly balanced inner world. I find it particularly interesting that people are exploring gender a lot more these days, and perhaps not considering that the rules of the inner world are different from the outer world. Internally, we're both masculine and feminine. But externally, we're usually one or the other. The psyche is also very fluid, a 'many-faced god', while the body is highly fixed.  I'm sorry if this wall of text doesn't make any sense, since it's probably only of value to introverts into esoteric practices, but anyway, I just feel like people should explore their psyche a lot more before doing anything to their body. People are way more mentally complicated than they realise. I mean, you might *think* you know... but more than what you don't know, there's stuff you don't know you don't know..."

"We know that TIFF is not a woman because he does NOT look like a woman, does not have a vagina, does have a penis, does not have breasts, does not menstruate, does not have overies or a womb, does have testes, has not and will not ever be a woman."
"Unfortunately, there is a legitimate aspect to the 'right hook' TERF argument at 6:45. Most of the part before that is just thinly-veiled ad-hominem/bigotry, but the part about how 'no amount of surgery and makeup can make you woman' is true, and not particularly addressed other than by questioning the necessary definition of a woman.   I have experienced gender dysphoria, and wished I could be a female, since at least early elementary school. There was a period of time in late high school where I did desperately want to transition, but after much thought I realized that transitioning would not actually help my dysphoria: because, after all, transitioning *would not make me female* . Rather, it would make me a clever and convincing (if I'm lucky) *imitation* of a female.   So, instead I have sought to find a place somewhere in between. Though I have not made any attempts to 'formally' transition (so to speak), if I ever do it will be to some kind of non-binary status, as I do not feel I can ever have any legitimate claim to she/her pronouns or the female label. Of course this has numerous problems of its own, the foremost of which being that >95% of all people are mono-sexuals, by which I mean that they are attracted to 'only one' of the artificially constructed and (in my opinion) ridiculous gender roles. Or, as I like to say, they are picky.   I'm always going to be 'too male' or 'too female' for the vast majority of potential partners; I mean, I haven't even transitioned (I'm basically just a dude with dysphoria) and I ALREADY get the 'too male/too female' thing constantly from filthy heteros (and the occasional gay). But the way I see it, it's better than being male, and it's better than being an imperfect imitation."

It's strange to not get YOUR views on the matter (except in the comments) as it's hard to figure out who to 'root for' in the debates (Salzman in the last one, and Tiffany in this one seem pretty sympathetic to me and seem like 'the good guys'). But they're also flawed... I just find it harder to see the flaws in their arguments as I agree with everything they say!"

"The production on this, and all your videos, is incredible."
"Honestly, I know there's a lesson here but it hurt to watch you basically say that stuff to yourself I kind of just wanted to give you a hug."
"I will mention that at a point the 'TERF' character brings a legitimate concern about how to organize politically (for feminism), I'm guessing, out of a fear that they will not be taken seriously if they bring topics like 'gender spectrum' that sound so alien to every day laymen. I understand it, and redeem (?) that it comes from a place of fear for the movement, rather than plain (own) transphobia.  Then again, feminism is supposed to be an inclusive movement that works in intersectionality, so excluding one group does feel completely out of place. So, I think exclusion is a mistake here as it would be anywhere."
"You can't be the opposite sex just because you feel like it. End of story, really. I really couldn't care less about the feelings of such deluded individuals, much like I couldn't care less about the feelings of conspiracy theorists, anti-environmentalists, etc. etc. If you want to pretend that you're a man/woman, ok, but don't expect everybody else to follow along.

"'These pseudo-feminists consistently preach feminism with one hand while practicing traditional sexism with the other.' - Julia Serano. Far as I'm concerned that should be the mic-drop moment but terfs will deny it until they are blue in the face."
"this was fucking hilarious and just all around amazing i mean the cinematography, the set design, the acting, the writing, the music i mean the production value all around was just amazing. and all the points you made about reopening closed discussion, and just the break down you made about all the TERFs 'points' were just so eloquently put. i'm just blown away by the quality and everything, so glad I checked you out after you were on that podcast with Michael Brooks."
"Men who adopt feminity may believe that they are achieving femaleness, but femaleness is a tougher density than they can know or guess. Femaleness is demanding and painful whether at menarche, menstruation, childbed, or menopause, and born women have no choice but to deal with it. 'Painted faces, depilate bodies, hair extensions and pumped up tits are available to all human beings. Femininity is a de-sexed masquerade.  Men can be as good at it and better than women, but that does not make them women.' -greer  The mocking of women's periods in this vid is a good example for why trans women can only ever be trans women and never women. They have absolutely no idea what it's like to be a woman. It's like a white person pretending to be black. Their experiences will never be the same."

"It is pretty sick to repeat that right wing-trope that different oppressed groups were a threat to each other, because they were in some kind of competition of who is the most oppressed.  But, on top of that, if you could and should make such comparisons trans-women would be even more oppressed than cis-women, and the reason for that are wombes. Cis-women have something that patriarchy needs. Cis-women threaten patriarchy through what they might do, trans-women by their existance. Patriarchy wants to enslave cis-women and KILL trans-women.  (I am aware of how many cis-women are being killed by patriarchy, however that always has the ultimate purpose of intimitading other cis-women into submission. There is no sexist who wants a systematic extinction of ALL cis-women, while many transphobes want to do just that.)"

"Terfs are really crazy like"
"It seems like both the characters are engaged in an oppression competition. However, that is completely beside the point from the trans-exclusionary perspective. Transwomen do not become women because of oppression any more than an Irishman becomes black because of anti-Irish racism. Both characters seem to be looking for systematic oppression, and building categories around it.   That train of thought eventually leads to the conclusion that womanhood is oppressed by definition, and by nature. In other words, if the patriarchy did not oppress women, the category of 'woman' would cease to exist. Men, and 'the patriarchy' in particular create and sustain the category of women by that logic."
"Transgenderism is a contrary to the right of group self-identification of women. If a marginalized (or potentially marginalized) group does not have the prerogative to define itself and its extent, such a group is denied the ability to politically organize. For example, if the NAACP and other such movements were ran by false-flag 'trans-black' people, the civil rights movement would have been derailed, especially if 'trans-black' activists created a 'transblack-centric' civil rights movement.    No other group is defined by naked self-identification. To use the case of race, there is disagreement on the number of races and the boundaries between races. For example, are Egyptians black, white, or a separate middle-Eastern race? Also, social race has an ethnic component: a racially 'white' person from Latin America would often be classified as 'Hispanic.' However, no one takes transracialism seriously, despite race being a social construct only loosely based on objective biology."
"And on the other hand, I do have 2 x chromosomes, and I am 'one who bleeds.' However I am not a woman. I suppose as a white man you could say my life is privileged, however most of society treats me as a woman, (as I have not yet medically transitioned and at my most masculine I look like a 12 year old twink) and I have had to deal with the crippling anxieties of coming out to literally everyone I know to use the correct pronouns, and even more than that the dysphoria I experience has left me with extreme depression and an even more extreme anxiety disorder. So then, am I an oppressed female because of society's views on women and transgender people, or am I a privileged white male who is a part of the problem? I almost wish I could talk to a terf and see how they would respond to that."

It was much better. Remember just enjoying life? And talking about movies, and music, and video games and having real world face time. Actually having friends? Not having a website where people delete you in seconds because you violated some label that someone else gave you in their head, and then attack you as if it's world war. Remember a time when LGBT existed, kinky sex existed, homosexual relationships happened, people wore the opposite sex's clothing, yet nobody knew about it, so if others didn't know then they couldn't judge or attack you? Where you had gated communities that allowed people in, but had no political agenda of being formed just for the sake of attacking other gated communities? Those were the times. Now, we get this. Dehumanization of all of mankind (sorry, personkind-sorry insert label for whatever gender or sexuality or football team you are in the correct way that doesn't offended, doesn't ignore, doesn't dismiss, doesn't insert, aesthetically looks just right, and just enough not too hot or too cold-WHEW did I just survive that? shit almost though I lost you with the delete button). Minefields. Damn. I remember just walking. That was good. This I can't walk through without getting blown up. That's like Mike Tyson, Ninja Gaiden, Castlevania difficulty here. Too hard of a game. Better to just turn off the Nintendo and never talk to anyone and just do your own thing."
"I enjoyed watching your video about decrypting alt-right bullshit, but I gotta say, you guaranteed a subscription with that rib eating skit. As a trans gal I relate a lot, that's the ONLY way I can eat ribs."
"By erasing and commodifying the female sex and reinforcing gender boxes, fetishizing and mandating the reproduction of traditional stereotypes which feminism fought to escape:  Transactivism relativizes the category of sex and absolutizes the social construct of genders, that is, rather than liberate the sexes from gender (so that every person regardless of their sex could behave as they want without prejudice and expectations, freely mixing as they see fit the traits available for all humans), it rather 'liberated' gender from the reality of biological sex, removing it as an obstacle from even more efficiently performing the conforming to the patriarchal-hierarchical gender constructs game (including its stereotypes and oppressive limitations), once a set of stereotypes are chosen - courtesy of socialization - the traditionally alloted sex must follow... This enables certain males who sexualized femininity (gender) to role-play as females, creating a state of affairs where the only reality/meaning of 'to be a female' is to *perform* traditional femininity. From the point of view of actual biological females, this only means, that henceforth, their very reality is reduced to a role to be played, graciously provided by the ever-accommodating free market, where no commodification is left behind, not even the suffering of countless generations of females living under patriarchal domination, now its a free for all historical performance-buffet, ready for the taking for any adventurous male, bored with the equally exhausting act of masculinity, being role-played at the expense of their social liberation.  Basically trans-activism is a gender-essentialist, hyper-individualized (ladybrain, inborn gender) ideology, which when dictating social perception renders females (and even gender-nonconforming males) unable to confront the social structural barriers of their liberation, glamorizing conformity to traditional gender expectations, reifying and elevating these social constructs and personal identifications into realities to be respected and revered, while at the same time, erasing and making invisible the actual material reality and  social reproduction (socialization) of sex-based discrimination and oppression, taking thus away the very ability of females to conceptualize their plight and organize as females, their very ability to recognize the true socially imposed character of their miserable sex-roles (gender)...  In essence it declares the patriarchal values and norms encapsulated in the socially constructed oppressive ideology of gender as inviolable and unquestionable reality, just another item for the capitalist ego to consume and barter with, reveling drunken with individualist zeal in the erasure of the category of sex and the oppression which is built on it.  The only solution which is in line with feminism, is to promote gender-non-conformism, not at the expense of the actual reality of the sexes, but at the expense of the gender constructs, in favor of the liberation of said sexes.   Once society does not expect a certain body-shape, trait, behavior or preference having to conform to a certain sex, the 'dysphoria' itself evaporates, since there is no such thing as 'being as a female is supposed to be', thus there remains no conflict between society's expectations and your sex, so there would be no feeling of 'not-marching a gender', given there would be no genders to match. You would simply be you, a male or a female, wearing any clothes you like, displaying any trait, any behavior you like: thus both females and males could be their own sex, without any specific social expectation of performing a certain set of roles tied to that: aka true liberation.   If trans-ideology wins, then the traditional demand for a sex to fit to a gender will win and thus make feminism impossible, since its only difference to traditional patriarchy is that it graciously allows you to choose your sex to match a gender, while traditionalists does not allow you to change your sex, but expect the same. Both are subservient to the same patriarchal power-dynamics, the same essentialism, both are anti-feminism.   Traditionalism sees sex as determining gender, trans-ideology sees gender as determining sex, only radical feminism is liberatory: sex does not determine who you are as a person, it should not determine what you like, how you like, how you behave, etc."

"The thing is a lot of radfem's points on sex based oppression is valid (and this is coming from a aspiring FTM) but the way they fight against it is so fucking silly 'Imma harass this trans teen online to end FGM'"
"Whoa you're kinda nuts. But....you have points. Hence the name.   I can't believe people think this shit matters, actually. I just don't want to be forced to call you ze or 'demigirl' by law. You're still a girl.   There is still a possibility of men pretending to be trans just to go into the bathroom, but those people will stick out like a sore thumb, since they aren't actually trans...but then why are they there? Even if they don't assault, it could be creepy.   However, I'm gay and use the bathroom with straight men. I just would not be creepy, because I don't want to be creeped on. Not sure why people don't bring gays and lesbians up in this debate.  Anyway, I think that feminism is reductive compared to just fighting for equality and decency. But I won't tell you what to call yourself."
"I don't think you are actually informed about radical feminism and essential biologists (a label that I prefer to the word 'TERF'). Radical feminism believes that a woman is discriminated for her sex, not her gender (because gender is just a social construct imposed on them). No TERF justifies violence against trans people. They just think that a male could never be a woman, because a woman is an 'adult human female'. TERFs also think that there should be spaces only for cis women. Both radfems and TERFs wants the end of gender stereotypes imposed on women and men.  I consider myself as a radical feminist and I don't agree that trans women aren't women. However, I was called a TERF just because I do think it's totally fine for a lesbian to not sleep with a trans woman, or that there is no such thing as a female penis. I think that nowadays some trans people are too extreme and this pisses off some radfems (me included). I labelled myself before as an inclusionary radical feminist. I said that in interviews, in videos, on my blog. However, I'm so deeply disappointed by the transgender community that I don't want to put this label again on me. Finding myself in the middle of two views which I see as 'too extreme' I don't know which stance should I take. But as a radical feminist I met amazing people. Trans women, cis women, even men and it's just wonderful to see how many people are actually interested in radical feminism. And whenever I read a book about radical feminism, I just feel good, because it's for me like reading my own ideas. So, well, I don't care anymore if people label me as a TERF or whatever. I just know that women are my sisters and I wanna fight for their rights."

"I'm not trying to  be offensive but i still don't get it, genuinely can someone try and explain this to me because it is confusing.. So what are you considering when being trans. What is the important factor in making someone the Gender/Sex they identify with. Also if as said here it is simply having the body you wish, why then is it wrong for people to wish to identify as a different race or height or age etc. See i always viewed Sex/Gender simply by ones genitals as that would allow us to provide better sex education teaching and puberty. Otherwise the concept of using Sex/Gender seems counter productive as it has little constructive use. Also since testosterone  is needed for Mens Mental health and can be dangerous to have little of, why are we medically treating people who already are have a hard time and high suicide rates with methods we know cause mental health problems?"

All the best to you as you find you way on new and wonderful journey. Enjoy this time and don't forget what you had to do once the job is done.   As a Woman who transition over 10 years ago I would advise that you have firm idea of why you wish to transition and stay focused on that reason. It helped me, but it may or may not help you. I transition to be myself and not feel like a foreigner in my own body. I accomplished my goal. In the last 10 years, I lost my ex-wife and friend to cancer, I increased my business earnings and earned some certifications in my industry that helped me accomplish my business goals. We endured the recession, kept our house, got through my partners unemployment (2.5 fucking years, it sucked). I lost both of my cats, one was 18 the other 21. And we got new cats, we rescued two furrbabies. One of them is sitting right here with me. He's the one in our thumbnail image. We manged to get through all of this and she transitioned too, right beside me through all of this.  I was fortunate in my transition to meet another Trans-Woman and we fell in love. We've been together for 14 years. She just 'gets it' and she's so funny. I am lucky.   Now in 2018, in my 55th time around the Sun, I face new challenges. I need  a knee replaced. Kinda mundane compared with flying to the other side of the planet and getting my junk fixed. No problems there, it all works fine. But, surgery again is kind of scarey. Lots to do. I get started tomorrow after the hangover goes away. I just couldn't stop drinking that bottle of Meloz (Honey based distilled spirit, so fucking yummy.) my partner gave to me as a gift. We're Atheists, so booze helps us through the silly season. But, it's time to put the booze away and get into the New Year and all I have to do.  I wish you every success in life. Enjoy being yourself. Don't give up and keep making videos lady!"
"The idea that many transwomen have to present themselves in ways that are stereotypically very feminine in order to be recognized as women is certainly valid. But I admit I still feel some discomfort there because of the way the trans experience is part of the larger LGBT+ culture and specifically the drag queen community. I feel like you can't entirely get away from a lot of misogyny in the gay community and the camp performance of femininity of drag with the way some transwomen present themselves. I don't believe this is true for all transwomen but the ones who present their femininity in more exaggerated or stereotypical ways do seem to be reinforcing harmful ideas of what it means to be feminine. And I think it's worth having the discussion of what it means to be feminine and how to expand that definition while in the current moment still letting everyone present themselves as they see fit."
"I do think there's a valid conversation to be had about what it means to be a woman outside of reproductive function and reproductive rights and outside of specific types of oppression like sexual assault and harassment but there never seems to be a space where you can actually have that conversation without everyone getting mad and shutting down the conversation. If anyone knows of relevant reading that actually explores the nuances of the conversation, please reply."

"Serious question: why can't we have a third way? Both a third gender (for trans identities) and a third sex (for intersex)? Many societies have had a third gender - none before have ever had one where one sex could transition into the other (until now with this current wave of trans activism). It was always one sex joining the third gender - often feminine but never regarded as the same as born women. Which is not to say they would be considered in any way 'lesser' than men or women, just different. If 'woman' and 'man' are social constructs that don't really have a clear definition anymore anyways, why not have everyone who doesn't identify with their birth sex be part of a third option? (With intersex people having a legal third sex instead of in the past where their parents were often pressured to pick one and surgically intervene)"
"1:25 I was not expecting that at all."
"Contrapoints is a good philosopher."
"The sad thing is, this is balanced compared to the TERF/trans debate at large, but is pretty damn disingenuous at points, especially for someone as thoughtful as you are. In part for humorous effect, I'm sure.    - First of all, I totally agree that trans women can socialize themselves into womanhood and their lived experience is absolutely relevant here. In fact, ideally they have a unique and valuable perspective on that to share. I think the radical feminists who discount this experience are goddamn insane, because our beliefs DO emphasize the harms of socialization. I personally think the bathroom danger is way overstated and am not hugely concerned about issues related to people transitioning safely and being respected by others.   - But there are enormous glaring problems with contemporary trans discourse. Trans women are attempting to erase the fact that socialization happens TO us as a result of *our treatment by other people*. This is not something your video addresses, and it seems to me like you already understand how bullshit this is by the fact that you mention you haven't had female social experiences yet in your comment. But it is incredibly harmful, and sociologically bonkers, to think that trans women 'had girlhoods' (and tbh the use of the word 'girlhood' makes me cringe'). A lot of them bring up experiences of being bullied for being feminine-- well, girls are bullied INTO being feminine, and so these things are clearly not equivalent. What you experienced was something like homophobia, not misogyny. Sure, I wouldn't be surprised if trans women, like gay men, had different socialization from other people brought up male, but the real harm that comes for women when it comes to gendered socialization is *how you are treated*. Men don't know they interrupt and talk over women-- they just do. Women don't even know they are being interrupted and talked over-- they just are. Attempts to obfuscate these innumerable silent interactions are essentializing and bizarre.   Trans women frankly seem so desperate to distance themselves from every single scrap of maleness that they are willing distort and poison the discourse. I don't know what happened, because honestly, this only seems to be a recent development. Older trans women didn't talk this way at all and in general seemed much more pragmatic about things.   - The attempt to remove our ability to talk about uniquely female-sexed experiences by saying 'well women have very different experiences!' is just straight out of the libertarian playbook. Of course women don't have identical socialization. Intersectionality helps explain why. 'Black/gay/poor people have different experiences!' is a functionally identical argument. GENERALIZATIONS HAPPEN. NEWS AT 11. IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM WRONG. If you think intersectionality works at all, you cannot in any good faith use this argument and so many goddamn card-carrying leftists do.   In general, I think the trans movement understandably fetishizes and pedestalizes the idea of 'being a woman,' giving it more specific and weighted ontology than it actually has. I don't fucking care if you're a woman. It's not special to be treated like one; there are nice things about it, but a lot of it sucks. If it's important to you for personal reasons that you experience it, go for it. But I recognize most radfems don't agree with me. Honestly, so many radfems are lesbian and nonconforming that I think it *really* creeps them out to think of gender identity as anything more than personal history-- because to be honest, to the vast majority of us on this planet, I don't think it's any more than that at all. We don't 'feel like' anything, we just know what we've been through. This is why the word 'cis' is problematic: it's not about 'alignment with gender,' it's about making the best of what you've got.   This doesn't mean that people who feel differently shouldn't be accommodated and respected, but it does mean that, unfortunately, the people who are suffering the most from gender are coming at it from different angles. Anyway, for whatever little it may be worth after all that, I really do wish you best of luck with your transition, I have a high opinion of your discourse and hope you will do it thoughtfully, and I do consider you 'a woman'... whatever that means :)"
"'DOST THOU BLEED'"
"how does trans tips with tiffany perfectly encapsulate my experience with 'acting feminine' for men as a trans woman"
"Genuine question that is not at all intended to offend, and is asked with the utmost respect for your preferred gender pronouns: Why is a label like woman, trans femme, using certain pronouns and the likes so important? Does it matter what someone calls you? Isn't determining how you feel based on what someone else thinks a toxic principle to operate from? Again, I'm trying my best to ask questions without the sincerity in my voice to illustrate how I don't mean any of this in a derogatory way, but I do find these questions important. As a scientist, I require certain terms to do my work efficiently. If there's a blood sample of someone who has the chromosomes of a man, I'll say that test sample came from a man. If I put 'woman' down, my test sample would be incorrectly labeled, as there are different chromosomes. I have no idea what genitals nor level of fertility someone has by their DNA, but I still know whether they're a man or woman. Therefore, this means that your argument that an infertile woman should carry the same level of scrutiny over whether they're a 'real' woman as a trans-woman, however, the terms male and female come from a place of science. In the beginning of language, if there was a vagina, we called that a woman, and if there was a penis? A man. Men and women do act differently, as I'm sure you know. The reason for this is in their DNA. That's where the 'societal construct' comes from... from one's nature (DNA) presenting phenotypes (outward physical traits) that fall within a certain range of characteristics. If you claim that you are a woman, you're intrinsically saying that there's a difference between a male and female brain... which means that the two are not equal. Which would be contradictory of the feminist sentiment that 'women and men are exactly equal, and women can do anything that men can do.' Scientifically, that just isn't true. Men can't bare children and women can't fertilize a man's eggs... we aren't all equal. We have our different strengths, and we're both necessary for society. The way I see it, it shouldn't matter what someone calls you. If someone called me a man (i'm a woman), I'd say 'hey, I'm a woman,' they would then apologize and we'd both get on with our lives. If I said I was a man (I look like a woman) and that same interaction happened, and they instead said 'no, you're a woman,' I would think 'well they can fuck off' and we'd both get on with our lives. Please don't let words get you down. If you let them impact you, you give them power over you. Roll with the punches, and create something so great that people will like you enough to call you whatever makes you feel good. However, they won't call you a woman because they genuinely think you're a woman... they'll do so because they truly like you. Which is great! And what objectively makes the most sense for everyone, and what helps science progress without being bogged down by trivial semantics. I would like to close this ridiculously long comment by stating that I don't understand how hard it must be to feel like a woman but look down and not see a vagina. That must be very confusing and difficult. However, it is important to remember that we are a society. We all have our struggles, and we all just want to fit in and be loved. We do that by being honest, and deep down I think everyone understands the triviality of one single word... a pronoun. Fuck that pronoun. You are you, you aren't defined by it and it does not control how you feel. Kind regards and happy holidays from New York."

Her feeling was that the mission of the choir should be to promote the music of 'real' women, and that this composer likely had benefitted from male privilege...yada yada yada. I pointed out that chromosomes and genitalia do not define gender, that this composer's gender identity was assuredly quite real to herself, that transpeople suffer discrimination and marginalization beyond her imagining, and that my aquaintance in fact has insufficient knowledge of this person's life experiences to pass judgement on the extent to which male privilege has played a part in her success (the composer in question if African-American, btw). And this aquaintance is a person who identifies as progressive. Sigh."

"I love how the TERF's Socratic quest to find some ideal definition of womanhood leads to rejection and ignoring the subjective experience of the trans woman. Trained as a Classicist, I read a lot of Plato (though not as philosophy per se) and always viewed the Socratic method as getting to the heart of the matter by moving beyond subjective experience with a complex idea as a means of getting at 'the essence' of the thing. Now my sympathies very much lie with tearing down externalized constructs like ideal forms and insisting on the ultimate validity of subjective experiences, all of them. I had never before seen Plato's Socrates as dehumanizing, but I think he may have been. Ironic for a poster-child for the humanist movement."

"I feel like associating feminism with trans-exclusion is paradoxical. Feminism is a belief and advocacy in gender equality and fair treatment from cultural and socio-economic perspectives, so why do we label trans-exclusionist liberal women as TERFs? Feminism really has nothing to do with trans-exclusion. I also feel like labelling women as radical feminists is toxic as well. It's basically insinuating that feminism itself can be a bad thing. People who label themselves as feminists can indeed be bad people or have hidden misandristic beliefs, but then again, you can't be a misandrist and a feminist at the same time. We need to start calling people what they are. Instead of calling women radical feminists, we should be calling them misandrists. Instead of calling women TERFs, we should call them something like pseudo-feminists. I just really think it's important to teach people how to distinguish feminism and misandry/transphobia."

I have broad shoulders, body hair that I take care in removing, large hands, a tall stature-- and generally viewed as masculine. But, I am a cis woman.   I dealt with a lot of transphobia and homophobia as a young pretty gender ambivalent girl in my middle school and high school years. I've also had TERFs now as adult who's AGGRESSIVELY FEMININE still insist its compensating for my designation as male at birth, and invading gay women's spaces, despite the fact I meet all there requirements.   The issue isn't really about being trans or cis, it's about passing and agreeing with them. If you don't, you don't count.   I've had so many terfs agree I'm a cis woman until I adamantly disagree with them, which then declares me either dealing with 'internalized opression' or being suddenly trans."
"The other real insidious thing about TERFs is the extent to which they have invaded lesbian spaces as well, which claims that trans lesbians are going to try and sexually assault the poor, fragile cis lesbians and that they're just men trying to 'turn lezzies straight'. It's such bullshit, especially since TERFs are way more invasive of your sexual life than any trans woman. So many trans lesbians don't feel safe in their own fucking community, like I honestly hate TERFs so much."
"terfs have bad taste in hair styles and all their blogs all have Renaissance era paintings of white women."

"All terfs are cis lesbians. It's just, ugh. As a cis lesbian, I apologize for terfs"
"I really needed to watch this. I hope you continue to talk about this topic, because honestly, I'm still in over my head and confused about gender dysphoria. I like to think of myself as a compassionate person, but there are definitely things I have trouble reconciling in my brain when it comes to the abstract concept of womanhood and the experiences of trans people. I feel like there are perspectives of this conversation that I will never understand, limited by the fact that I can only know what I have experienced firsthand, and I worry that inability to understand will affect my capacity to empathize.    I support trans women in women-only spaces, and I know that women and trans women share a lot of the same experiences, but I also feel that there are enough differences between these groups that lumping them all together as one entity all of the time leads to generalizations that marginalize the varied circumstances of both groups.   I'm not sure what I'm trying to say. I'm feel like I'm disappointing everyone for not immediately 'getting it' like so many others seem to do."

"I consider myself a radical feminist, and this video was pretty funny üòÇ  You are correct on many things, but it seemed like you missed out some arguments we have. Im glad there are some people that at least tries to understand our point of view instead of just shutting down the conversation, it is very noticeble the research you made for this video. There are many different point of views even inside radfem. Most of us want a better world for women AND trans people, we arent the evil witches portraid by the web.   Now Im gonna watch your other videos üòÄüëç"

"why call people trans women  if they r women?"
"is u playpiano is good :v) <3"
"I never comment on Youtube videos but I have to say I absolutely love this! By far the best contribution to 'the debate' that I have ever seen. It represents almost word for word every argument I have ever had on the internet with TERFs but it does so with both humour and depth. In fact, from now on I will just post your videos instead of leaving long comments on Facebook threads: you have saved me many hours of my time and a ton of emotional anguish. Thank you.  I'm guessing Abigail Cockbane is also a SWERF, so it would be good to see a video about that too, if you're familiar with issues like the 'Nordic model' and calls for decriminalisation of sex work. I'm a genderqueer kinkster and a lot of my friends are sex workers. My own partner is a pro domme and we spend a lot of time defending sex workers from SWERFs online. Usually, these people are also the TERFs we spent our time arguing with about trans rights. They infantilise and patronise sex workers to the same extent as they deny the identity of trans and non-binary people. Their arguments are always traceable back to deeply puritan notions about sex which are positively patriarchal and yet they think sex workers are the bad feminists; 'fallen' women (they tellingly ignore male sex workers) who need rescuing."

"Has she discussed the different waves in any of her videos?"
"I like contra but I hate it when trans women compare themselves to infertile females. Not your table, not your argument to make."
"Thank you. Even though I know this was a parody, it really did help me deal a little bit more with my issues. I've realized that I have some TERF opinions and I feel really bad about that. I think my last struggle is to figure out how to reconcile the requests to stop using sexual reproductive terms. Women have always been taught from a young age that their vaginas are gross and even saying vagina or period grosses people out and you need to keep those things secret and hidden. At the same time, I understand that trans women have a similar, but different, experience when it comes to hating your own body. Continuing to be more accepting of my reproductive parts without using terms that exclude trans women is something I'm still figuring out."
"No but seriously. Why are there gay people? How did such a trait survive evolution?"

"When no one wants to have a discussion with you, put different wigs on."
"I have one question:  Can a trans woman become a lesbian?"
"This whole debate comes down to one potentially valid (IF accurate) point: Would male to female trans people being allowed into women¬¥s bathrooms increase the risk of women getting sexually assaulted there?  Because honestly, I don¬¥t know and about any statistics (I don¬¥t expect there to be any) on the propensity for (actual medically diagnosed transitioned) trans (m-f) to sexually assault women, I know there are some cases that were reported as such but I am not entirely sure which of those were actual trans people and how high the rate is. (There are cases of men crossdressing to get into bathrooms though and you could bet such people will try to call themselves 'trans' for cover)  All the other shit is just an excuse because they feel like they have to protect their female safe space. (which might exist for valid reasons) from male sexual predators (although they purposefully mix pervs who try to pass as women with actual trans people) which would be a valid concern, if true. Which I don¬¥t know.  Still, if they wanted to solve that 'naked hairy rapist with the -flappy- rock solid dick ' Issue, that would be possible:  We could simply go with trans people having to provide ID for the bathroom if someone suspects something fishy, which would not be much to ask to make sure no 'hairy male rapist in a dress' gets in because people are afraid to be called bigoted for questioning whether that ?woman? is supposed to be there. (I think it would be unreasonable to completely deny the possibility of people trying to abuse this so there would need to be some way to distinguish between a real transsexual and someone pretending to be one, because just going by looks does not sound like a good Idea to me. The smart move would IMO be to tie access to the women¬¥s bathroom to what it says on your ID and then trans folk can change that. That would not be an unreasonable measure to prevent sexual assault if you ask me.)  On the other hand, if m-f trans folk themselves would pose a problem (which I highly doubt) then we would have to weigh the issue carefully.   Them protecting their little 'oppression club' is just laughably petty.  But hey, that is where a cult of victimhood gets you. Not sure what you expected. And I am actually unsure whether these terf chicks are actually transphobic or just really dedicated man-haters..."
"This intro is fucking fabulous"
"THIS IS THE CONTENT I LIVE FOR WTF"
"damn, abigail was very rude here!"
"i watched this entire video from start to finish because i actually found it entertaining. however, your argument falls apart at a critical juncture right at the end before you engage in the period satire. it's at 10:09 when you mention XY humans with wombs. these are men with wombs. not women. this is one of the few places in rhetoric where exact language is necessary.  if you have a Y chromosome you are male. if you have no y chromosome, you are female. male and female are typified by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. organs are irrelevant. the genetic data is what counts--there are hundreds if not thousands of unique genes on the Y chromosome. it's just how it is. the genes on your Y chromosome are still being expressed. no matter how similar you think your experience is to a real woman, this gene expression completely bars you from ever experiencing exactly what it's like to be one.  you can't just gloss over these definitions to make your point. i actually like your style and the way you do your videos even if i possess completely antipodean political views. but you can't just not discuss the lynchpin because you don't like it."
"Wait  I thought Atlantis was already gay."

"The fuck is that diagram of a brain in the back? How old is it?"
"TERF's honestly have the right idea about certain things. If it's so easy to identify as a female and to switch genders which switches privilege. Did that so called privilege ever exist in the first place? Let's say someone tells me because I'm a man I'll never understand something and that I'm too privilege to understand. Next day I identify as a woman and magically I do understand and I won't be too privileged? It really throws a wrench into the feminist narrative."
"Ewwwww gross is that a man??"
"Also, the trans person, the trans woman, in your video, she is like, i wake up as a woman........   I was like, wtf is waking up as a woman ? Gigglin ? saying girly things ? Waving your hair ? Say something like ( i can't park my car ) while you step out of bed ?   What is that, can you explain that, without the theater of the video. I mean, the video is cool, its well made etc, but can you maybe at least explain to me, how woman wake up ?.......  .....  Our am i 'a fascist' now ? An evil TERF, not caring about feelings etc."
"A+ on Abigail costume and really funny video, thank you"
"But Contra-points.  First i wanna say, well made again, your a good actress, actor,( i dont how you want to be called)  But to me it was always like, when a trans person said : i AM a woman, i was like, ok fine with me, but wtf is 'a woman'. I have wondered my whole life about these so called, 'real woman', and 'real men'. Its a concept, its a rolepattern, a way society creates people, a way society want people to behave. Being born with a vagina, and the system wants you to be stupid, play with dolls, just wanna have fun, being social, binding, modest, beautifull, shy etc. When your born with a penis, society wants you to be serious, thug, well organised, not having emotions, built things, fight, be dominant etc, etc, etc....These roles are arbitrary, people comform to them, their isn't something as 'the man', our 'the female'. Im like, i have a penis, but im neither man our woman. I mean, im a man, for having a penis, but thats it, thats where it stops, when your talking about what that means. You can't say, he has a penis, so he wants to climb trees, and beat up his little brother, our anything...  I mean, i always rejected the whole idea of 'woman', and 'men'. Therefore i was like, why than should you remove your penis, our vagina ? I mean, your just you, fuck society, society doesn't exist, society is a spook. With our without a penis, you will never be 'a man'. With our without a vagina, you will never be 'a woman'.    So when a trans says like, im a woman, im like, of fine with me, but WTF is that ? I mean, biological its like Penis = man, vagina = woman, and thats it ( to me ). Pleace dont kill me for it, for speaking my mind. And the thing is,thats all, there are some rough bio differences, the rest is made up by society.  I mean, a woman can have a baby etc, but its bullshit when people say like, she is a woman, therefore she needs shoes, and therefore she likes to watch seks in the city. No, she can have a baby, but she could also like blow of your head, if she was armed etc.   Anyway, i dont know what this position is called, which i have. Is ii 'agender' ? I think something like that, i dont believe in gender, and i dont believe in society.  Am i a TERF than ? As a man, its a little bit silly to be a TERF, because they hate us hehehe.  Also, i don't know how these debates relate to the political schools in general. I have always been an anarchist, but i notice that radfem, bordeline mtfks like me, aren't appreciated within liberal 'anarchist' circles. Do not look 'radical', wear 'normal' clothes, and your not third wave enough, these days..."

"I don't know if you read the comments at all, I wouldn't blame you if you didn't, knowing how youtube comments are...   but I want to say, I had been on the fence and a bit skeptical about gender non-binary, but now it feels that I'm close to getting it. your delivery is much better and more in my wavelength than most trans activism we see on the internet, which is usually either saccharine appeals for unconditional acceptance or bitter and resentful censorship and shaming of dissidents, both of which never really address the issue as a philosophical problem, instead they just make moral judgements around it. I say this, but I also understand that it's unfair to expect people to explain their identities to me, as if they somehow needed my approval to be who they are, and I get why they can get upset by that. however, what you're doing here is giving the listener the benefit of the doubt that if you explain it to them well enough, they'll understand and not just be a bigot, and I think that's very constructive.   no matter what, I will accept a person's personal identity, because after all, even if it were the case that they just simply choose to be different for no reason, I still don't see why I'm in any less obligation to respect them. but strictly in theory, I don't understand: what is it that you call ''woman'' that you identify as? (you can switch ''woman'' for any gender) I've always thought you could define gender either as: 1) a social role defined by a conglomerate of characteristics typically associated with a certain biological sex, but that is ultimately determined by how one presents themselves to the world, i.e embodying those characteristics and being considered, effectively, a woman or a man depending on your behavior, i.e ''gender is performative'' or as 2) the same as biological sex (the traditionalist view). but it seems that for you, and the trans community, it isn't either of those things, it's how you ''feel''... but what is it that makes this feeling be a certain gender? often I hear: ''I've always felt like a woman/man...'' well, sure, but isn't that just you identifying with the characteristics typical of the opposite gender rather than your own? isn't ''feeling like a woman'' just relating to those characteristics associated with womanhood? whether you have a feminine personality, or identify with aesthetics and customs associated with femininity? let me be clear: I understand how you can be born in a male body, feel like a woman, and truly and genuinely be a woman by simply living your life as one. what I don't understand is how you can be a woman just on the inside, without embodying neither cultural nor biological characteristics of (what is traditionally called) women, simply because, well, what is left? what is it that you're even saying, when you say ''I am a woman/man''?   I think that, to a certain extent, for cis people like me, gender is a non-issue, something you just don't think about. I don't think about what makes me male, I was just born this way. truth be told, I often find my personality is more female-like, and in some ways I envy women and feel that I would thrive better if I was expected to fill the roles typically assigned to women, but I never once doubted that I *am* a man. it's not that I ''feel'' like a man, I just know I am one... is this how trans people feel, as in they ''just know''? and if so, the next question is: how do we say this phenomenon, as in, explain a phenomenological experience through language?"

"You transactivists still don't have any solid arguments other than 'woman' is something you know whenever you make up a 'feeling'. You as men have every right to live and dress and mutilate your body however you want, and not being discriminated by that. Go ahead trying to convince everyone that it is bodies and the categories we have to organize colectively the ones that need to be forced into gender stereotyping.

"Contra's argument in a nutshell: 'The definition of 'biological sex' isn't 100% perfect (because some people have rare birth defects), therefore it doesn't exist and I can completely disregard it.

The most powerful statistic I've come across regarding transgender issues is not that 40% transgender people attempt suicide but that today the average life-expectancy of a transgender person is 32 years old - this is the same as during the medieval period (13th century) in England. In the late 1990's the average life-expectancy of a transgender person was only 24 years old..  There is no comparison for that. I'm 38 years old."
"The whole trans/terf thing hurts my head.

"How do you know a white person isn't black? Or a 50 year old who claims to be 6 isn't in fact a kid? If material reality doesn't matter with regards to sex anymore, why should it matter with anything? We are whatever we say we are, no matter how absurd. Words don't mean anything anymore.  Gender non-conforming men aren't women, no matter what Orwellian twists you try to impose on the English language. We're on your side if you want to smash gender roles; everyone should be able to express themselves as they want. I even back you up if you're desperately unhappy enough with your body that you want to get surgery to have the appearance of the genitals and other sex characteristics of the opposite sex, so long as you know all the limitations, risks, and drawbacks. But none of this makes you the opposite sex. Just like I wouldn't support white people trying to erase the reality of black people, or adults trying to erase the reality of children, I won't support men trying to erase the reality of women."

"Are you trying to make a mockery out of feminism? It's working, but I don't think it's what you were trying to do.  But on a serious note: No! I don't think all feminists are TERFs, or all feminists are bad. TERFs are weird people who seem to idolize the fact that they are women to a strange degree. The only point where I can see them being right is when they say that trans women are not biological women. As in, they were not born women, they were born with a penis and are biologically still identifiable as men (chromosomally and in various other aspects, depending on how early they began hormonal treatments). Now I personally don't see a problem with identifying such an individual as a woman if they wish to be so identified and if they make an effort to be at least somewhat resembling of a woman on a superficial level. The same goes for trans men.  Where it gets a bit iffy for me is the non-binary identifying individuals. And it's not that I don't understand they want to be something other than male and female, it's that they expect others to know what that is and to know how they should act around them. Also the fact that some of them want to completely shatter the binary gender, and they want that right now! because they feel it should be so. Which is unrealistic, to put it kindly.  I would also argue there is such a thing as 'female privilege', in that parents and society tend to treat females better in some respects, at least where I'm from. For example, my mom always told me it's a woman's responsibility to clean the house, and that since my brother is a man, it's not my place to complain that she does his cleaning for him while I'm responsible for my own share. But she never told me to get a job as soon as I graduated high school, and supported me through many years of education without ever bringing it up, while my brother had to get a job as soon as his college entrance exams were over and work through his college years. And this is a wide spread way of treating one's children in society here. There's also the way most men are expected to pay for dates (although that is slowly being edged out), but I remember my mom always saying how she shouldn't give me money for dates because the man is supposed to pay. Obviously, these are only some situations that I ran into in my own life and are in no way meant to be exhaustive.   Whether or not the different ways men and women are privileged and disadvantaged in society can be accurately measured and compared is in the realm of social studies, and I do not have a major in that field, I went for STEM. But even as a layman in that field it appears that using only the feminist lens (that seems to attribute all the ills of society to men, and even complains about the ways women are treated better as a form of oppression) is not a good way to look at the situation. There should be some other ways to analyze the data that removes the bias of the feminist lens.  All of that aside, I hope it goes well for you, and you manage to be happy and healthy! You're already a better looking woman than me, though I bleed out of my genital area monthly :))"
"Glad to see the video is still up. The after credit 'good bye' spooked me out a bit to be honest. It reminded me of the ending of the episode 'The Outcast' from Star Trek: The Next Generation, in-which Will Riker has an affair with an alien humanoid (for limited production budget reasons obviously) called 'Soren' from a planet where there is no gender: Soren identifies as female. Gender is illegal on her home world & she is forceably 'cured' and tells Riker she was sick during her affair with him at the end."

"After the trans-woman character mentioned the XY females & the TERF responded by saying it's an aberration (which essentially means it's an anomaly ‚Äì an inconsequential percentage of the population) then the trans-woman could have responded with the fact that trans-women are also anomalies & are an inconsequential percentage of the population (0.1%). If gender is a construct, then 'woman' is a construct too, so why can't trans-women be women? You stuck with the uterus thing too long. It's not the only radfem argument out there. Another prominent one is about how trans-women experienced male-privilege. This could have been countered with the fact that: 1. Women are diverse, some have experienced more privilege than others, so why draw the line where you're drawing it? 2. Trans-women have not experienced a blemish-free life. Their effeminate behaviour in childhood might have made them the victim of homophobia, before graduating to transphobia when they start their transition & once they finally pass ‚Äì misogyny. The same way you wouldn't dismiss a gay man's oppression by only acknowledging his privilege, as that that would be homophobic, is the same way you shouldn't dismiss a trans-woman's oppression by only acknowledging her privilege, as that would be transphobic."

"I wish you bon voyage on your transition. RIP another identity falling from the mountain of gender-queer down into one of the binary valleys. Yet again it feels to me like every non-conformist is just learning to accept who they are, indirectly contributing to the 'bisexual/gender-queer is just a a label to help someone, (often yourself) accept your challenging gender preference.' I guess it takes more energy to resist than comply and we all get too old to continue fighting the inertia of sociological norms."

"ContraPoints Well, after i saw your 'genderqueer' vid, i did wonder.  I found that hard to process, and learned a lot while processing it. It helped me to identify myself as 'Genderqueer.'  Anyway, all the best for your transition. I hope you get what you want out of it.  And i think you are sexy, and expect that wherever you choose to go, you'll be just as sexy :P"
"ContraPoints, damn girl, you pull no punches. The whole time I was thinking 'sheez all this hullaballou over just being pissed at someone else's choices.' Aren't there more pressing issues to deal with that debating someone else's gender? This is what happen's when Humanities students can't get a job, are feeling devoid of a life purpose, and then decide to 'get purpose' by picking some safe moronic cause, with the potential to get some o that conservative money. I think some people need to be dropped into a slum or a war zone and get their priorities sorted out. Nothing chases away the bull shit and instills the spirit of kumbaya than trying to survive.  btw,  I love how you briefly break the 4th wall when talking about the Daily Mail. That...that made me giggle. :)  Keep up the good work - and let us know different ways we can support the trans people - cuz that terf sounds kinda deeply hurtful to a transperson. I'm trying to imagine having to prove to somebody I'm a man, and just thinking about it gets my bile up. Honestly, I am barely aware of the extra crap you have to put up with along with the regular crap....which is horrible enough. No one should go through that without someone having their back. Let us help."
"I like your formats."
"You know what. You really have me thinking on this one. Usually I watch your videos and I pretty much go in agreeing with your sentiments. I have to admit that I was TERFy myself and didn't even realize it. I would never not call a trans woman a woman if that's what a person wants to be called then I have no problems, but DEEP down, I wouldn't feel right believing it. I don't know exactly what it means to be a woman but I feel fine with being labeled a woman, and I know what it feels like to be treated as a woman. I use to think, hey dude, you wanna be a lady now cool..but you didn't spend the first 20 years of your life putting in the time of being treated like one...but shit...what the heck does that even mean?! After watching this it's come to my attention (I'm a slow learner I guess, lol!) that not every woman/man has the same experience growing up and who am I to hold that as a standard of 'womanhood'. Who am I to even try to say what qualifies as a woman or not since I myself don't really under stand it! (and I'm not talking about chromosomes people so please just don't!) basically you're being treated as 'not a man' and shit is scary out their for trans people. So thanks, I think this was just what I needed. I watch a lot of videos on gender and trans people because I always knew their was this nagging feeling in the back of my head on something that wasn't jiving (as well as gender just being a weird and interesting topic). Thanks for teaching me. I'll keep a much more open heart and mind now. Please don't stop doing what you're doing!"

I really enjoyed it!"
"I just want to say you are a goddess among mortals I can only really speak for myself but watching this was nerve wracking in a way that can only be conjured by some of the truest moments of vulnerability about deeply personal issues that resist any cathartic resolution by both the asinine individuals who refuse to show common decency towards those different from themselves, and the very transcendental/existential nature of the human condition. And I was only the person watching this, you not only had to preform it but also write and direct the whole thing. For the deed and the courage to bare it out, I thank you. :huggles:"

"in my opinion any intellectually honest and intelligent cis woman, especially if gay or gender non-conforming, will go through a 'terfy' phase in her life, when really learning about transexuality for the first time. like, even if they dont wanna be transphobic it's just things you end up thinking when you get to the root of thins. you end up asking yourself 'what makes women, women if not their biology?' 'what even is a woman?' etc. but then you educate yourself and you get over that phase. i dont really trust any feminist or woman in general who has always accepted transwomen as women without having asked herself any those questions before and without having made any mistakes. that's just how you learn. learning is key lol. if you've been a feminist for years and learnt about what transexuality is and you're still misgendering trans people on purpose then you're a shitty feminist."

"I enjoy this video but am sorry to see some of the responses in the comment section. I'd like to see people attempting to come closer together in understanding, rather than spewing at people they don't consider 'woke' enough. I'm old enough to remember how the 60s radical movements failed to unite and actually slowed down the social progress they sought with their open hostility and contempt for those who hadn't caught up yet, philosophically. And their strident demands for purity both provided quite a bit of fuel to the right-wing backlash, as well as made the prospect of defending progressive ideas unappealing to many might-have-been allies. We're still struggling to revive important discourses that seemed discredited at the time - these setbacks were so unnecessary, but I see some people are determined to repeat them."

"I'm really enjoying these debate videos"
"Unlike most youtube videos you do seem to try hard to make the case of the opposing view to your own which is good to see. It's so often the case that people mock the other side in some disingenuous manner. I have seen some prominent feminists criticise trans women in ugly and insensitive ways which I think is just mean and cruel. However I don't really understand this feeling of being a woman. To completely disown biology in favour of this feeling of womanhood doesn't make any sense to me. Even more so when nothing can come further from this explanation which doesn't sound like a stereotype. I don't see how gender is something innate as I've never heard a good explanation for it. As many people might know lots of things we associate with women used to be for men like the colour pink, high heels, skirts and dresses. So it seems more defined by culture and society than something innate. To me the reason I am a woman is because of my biology. To the extent that I may have more interests which are deemed 'feminine' (if that is the case) I think it could be because I've been treated as a woman since birth and so I haven't been given the opportunity or pressure to pursue male interests the same as I would have were I born a boy. If you look to outliers to define a group it can be difficult and you end up unable to have such a definition. That's not to say those outliers aren't part of that group but they do not experience everything that group does."
"You guys like to make fun of free thinkers, but you know it's okay to debate controversial topics. I think it's mean to keep people locked in echo chambers, not being allowed to listen to different view points. Ideas don't hurt people, people do. So yeah, make fun. I'm glad that I'm open-minded to some degree. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be on Contra's channel in the first place. I'd be in some anti-feminist circle jerk. It's good to get a variety of viewpoints to grow as a person, as long as you are a decent person and respect people's rights.  Oh yeah, and free speech?  It's *fucking* awesome."

"I wonder how Tiffany is going to eventually become corrupted..."
"I'm a little disappointed that Tiffany didn't actually offer any concrete (or even semi-concrete) definition of gender identity, because that's pretty much the sole aspect of the Transgender movement that bugs me, and I can't get behind.  Honestly, it makes more sense to me that there is no such thing as gender identity; there is only sex (which isn't *totally* binary) and gender performativity. Gender exists solely in our behaviours, not our brains, and is defined by restrictive society.  In this framework, 'man' and 'woman' are essentially shorthand for 'person with male body' and 'person with female body' respectively. But, because I'm not a dickhead, if a yet-to-transition trans woman wants to be called a woman, ill of course oblige.  In the end, we're all just people inhabiting differently shaped hunks of meat. You can want to be in a different hunk of meat, but you can't be born in the 'wrong' hunk of meat."
"So, I don't think one person can transition fully to another gender due to inherent differences between sexes (I know the difference between sex and gender). HOWEVER, we don't have a good way to deal with gender dysphoria, except to let people be whoever they want. And why wouldn't we let people be whoever they want, who is it really hurting? Plus, you just have to be kind of a dick to not call people what they want to be called."

"Yay!!! Great vid!!! EVERYONE hates TERFS!!!"
"I really enjoy your videos, ContraPoints. You genuinely engage in arguments."
"As a trans woman, the most fascinating thing about TERFS to me is the absolute *glee* they seem to take in being as callous as possible towards the trans women they interact with . . . it's like they're overjoyed to *finally* have a group of people they can shit on as hard as they have felt shat on by the patriarchal systems that oppress them.  Like, they spend lifetimes complaining about the ways society oppresses women, and then they turn around and replicate those behaviors *exactly*. . . . but on another set of women. I mean seriously, TERFS treat trans women just like misogynists treat  women: calling them delusional, picking apart their appearance as a means to discredit their ideas, treating their experiences of the world and their own subjectivity as fundamentally untrustworthy and suspect, presenting trans women's bodies as 'mutilated' or 'broken' (kind of like how historically women were seen as underdeveloped versions of men), and seeking to trigger feelings of shame and discomfort in trans women at their own embodiment never being 'good enough.'   They seem to think that if they can just make someone else feel as bad as *they've* felt, that'll somehow fix what has been broken inside them.  But I guess everyone needs a scapegoat.  As an aside, every time I interact with TERFS, I'm reminded of the ending of The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, talking about how the whole of society used Pecola Breedlove for their own ends:  'All of us--all who knew her--felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even her waking dreams we used--to silence our own nightmares. And she let us, and thereby deserved our contempt. We honed our egos on her, padded our characters with her frailty, and yawned in the fantasy of our strength.'  And I know Morrison's specifically talking about race here, but I see a lot of parallels between the positioning of black women and trans women (not that these are mutually exclusive identities, mind you) at the bottom ends of two spectrums of oppression, and the ways that all the people in various higher positions use members of the lowest in order to try to get themselves clean of the dirt that's been thrown at them throughout their lives.  Yeesh. I need to take a shower."
"I really love the voice you did for the trans woman it fits very well and i think it even actually sounds more you."

"Lmao that blood cult bit was hilarious. Very interesting points. Are women defined as those who have experienced a certain kind of oppression for a certain amount of time? Seems like a loose definition meant keep people out of the 'lady club' or whatever.  I realized I was non-binary when I started researching gender and asking trans people about it as a concept. My definition of gender changed from 'a deep almost spiritual connection to being a man or a woman' to 'a performance that could have nothing to do with where you are on the spectrum'. I realized that there wasn't something deep in my soul that made me a 'man'. (Do we even have souls? It just seemed like some weird religious/spiritual belief I had somehow inherited just by being a part of society (I don't have religious parents).)  So I stopped pretending and now I'm somewhere in the middle. When I'm confident I have fun with gender, but usually I'm some middle-of-the-spectrum non-passing anti-gender thing. This makes life difficult and I've thought about changing my performance to be more masculine just for my own sanity (even if I don't really feel a connection to 'male-ness').  Anyway, Thank you ContraPoints. Your videos are refreshingly informed and always interesting. They've been really helpful for me and I hope you make more :) Also, congrats on officially coming out as trans femme <3"

"I just want to let you know that these discussions you have with yourself are not only well thought out and educational, but often make me second guess my own opinions by revealing my biases and doubts, and make me see I have a lot of vague areas in my own belief system, which I may never figure out, but I have to keep trying, and listening to people experiencing the very real peoblems of the human condition is the surest path to understanding them. I spend a lot of time in my own head having conversations like this, and it's easy to feel like I have it figured out. Then you articulate all these things that I haven't confronted and it's often upsetting. I haven't figured out yet if I'm genderqueer but I know I'm not quite cis and it causes a lot of internal conflict. Thank you for taking the risks associated with revealing your  conflicts, in order to help others deal with their own."

"The problem with arguing against a TERF is that they have no trust in the lived experience of transfolk, so they fill that void with rigid intellectualism and theory. It's very difficult to dismiss those notions in the same way that it's difficult to argue against homophobes that argue homosexuality is caused by a 'feminized society' or something. They are wrong, but there rhetorical framework is completely self enforcing, and the arguments they use within that flawed framework are strictly speaking, logical.   In the same way we have to trust that gay people know there own sexuality on a more innate level, and that it's not the cause of some social phenomena, we have to trust transfolk to understand there own sex and gender better then an outside observer with some half baked theory will."

"I really hate it sometimes when I am right. Especially when I crystalize my argument really well: -  Is a trans woman a real woman? - when does it matter...?  - Marriage; a common sense approach would be the case of a future husband to be and a trans woman wife to be - in that case it matters to them personally about the trans woman being trans..   Maybe they could adopt? Maybe the husband is the carrier of a faulty gene for a severely disabling condition anyway?  - Health; should it matter to her doctor she is trans? - YES.  - Employment; should it matter to her boss she is trans? - NO. (in the same kind of logic as you can't ask a woman about if she is going to have children in a job interview).  - Peers; should it matter to other women she is trans? - there will inevitably be a lack of experience to share with regards reproductive organs.  - Politics; should it matter to the state and society she is trans? - that's a good question and comes down to entitlement and the basis for it....    For example feminists believe men and women are entitled to equal pay. A family with 2 point 4 kids seems to get more entitlement in politics than single mothers or just single people in general. This is why trans people are political - because they share identities across the political spectrum as part of gender identity...  You could argue (unfairly) a single trans person working in a none gender specific job without a sexual partner is not entitled to the same kind of gender identity as a mother in a family with a husband and two kids for example based on the kinds of entitlements we have in politics at the moment. And if the trans person is unemployed then the situation is even worse....   Stigmatize trans people so they can't get housing or employment or find a sexual partner or even use a public bathroom, and well that is going to make cis-hetero-normative people feel better about their shitty lives enough to vote for a currupt government that is passing on huge economic and environmental problems to future generations apparently. TRUTH."
"I can't believe I just read every single comment on a video that nearly made me cry. G-d, dysphoria is awful..."
"Cockbane's argument seems to be that women are people with wombs because wombs are the basis for women being oppressed, but that just means her definition of womanhood is oppression and victimization. So, if gendered oppression just stopped one day, would women just stop being women according to her?"
"Just because you can trick people into thinking you're a woman and treating you like a woman, that doesn't make you a woman. Much like being black. Did Rachel Dolezal experience black racism?  The reason Terfs continue to bring up 'Skirts and heels don't make you a woman' is because, other than that, there is very little that defines your 'womanhood.' If it's not that, what makes you a woman. If it's not biology and it's not stereotypes, there's nothing else. Your opinion that sex is 'too subjective' to measure is also misguided. Yes, there are intersex people, but intersex people do not prove the existence of trans people since most transpeople are not intersex. This misrepresentation of science is pretty blatant.  13:43 While I wouldn't use this scenario to argue, I think you missed the point. This isn't about transwomen. This is about cismen taking advantage of trans bathroom laws."

Also, do more threeways with more men instead of more women, as a feminist I want you to completely submit to a woman because I fucking hate men."
"What is it about a medical transition that you think will make you happy? I think it stands in contrast to the idea that gender identity is independent from biology.

I am asking this as a person who does not experience gender dysphoria, and I'm asking whether or not people who do experience gender dysphoria find this offensive? or is this an ultimate goal for a lot of intersectional feminists anyways?       when it comes to things like identity, there's a fine line in regards to embracing labels that i haven't figured out exactly,       anyone have any thoughts?"

Just now I got it again clicking on this one and decided to reset the video to see if it moves down the list, and FINALLY it put it further down the suggestions list so that I could FINALLY press the 'not interested' option on its hate-spewing ass.  Goddamnit, Youtube.  Why even isn't there a 'not interested' option on the first item in the suggestions list - who decided to exclude that?  You make... no sense.

And I said to them 'what if that child was transgender?'. And they were like 'But it's a girl!'. I kept saying 'But what if the child was transgender?'. And they were going on about the usual comebacks. I was just like 'isn't it a bit wrong to be talking about a kids genitals?...  I'm sure that wasn't a priority for the firefighter...   I'm just asking you what if the child was transgender?'. It kept going round in circles without end."
"Thank you for putting so much effort into making this. I can tell that Cockbane is not a caricature or strawman; I have seen and heard these exact arguments, almost word-for-word, from TERFs in-person and on social media. I also adore your opening segment, and I love the title of Cockbane's book."

"6:36 Contra. This moment literally made me have to stop and write this comment.

"Terfs are scum. You are fabulous babe."
"I sometimes wonder if the reason trans femmes are so much more visible in culture than trans mascs is because of the early childhood socialization of FABs against conflict or raising their voices or making a fuss.  ---  Unrelated thought: I think part of the underlying cause of TERFs is resentment at trans femmes for identifying certain features and behaviors as masc and trying to change them, despite them also being natural for cis women.   For example, I am a naturally hairy cis woman - I'm actually hairier than my cis boyfriend - and so encountering trans femmes being insecure about their body hair used to feel like an attack on me. It's like, you think women can't have hairy arms? You think my arms aren't feminine? They're a woman's arms, so they're feminine! Clearly all you know about women is what you've picked up from advertisers, blah blah blah.  Of course part of being a fucking ADULT is recognizing that other people's insecurities aren't about you.  Body hair is one of the things that's easiest for a trans femme to change about herself, to help her be recognized as a woman in society. A cleft chin or an Adam's apple or broad shoulders would all require major surgery to bring in line with feminine norms. Obsessing over how masculine their hair makes them look isn't really about body hair being a super important part of their understanding of what it means to be a woman - it's about it being one of the few physical things about themselves that they can control, in a body that's otherwise in rebellion against their mind.  tl;dr TERFS NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU."
"I am probably going to unintentionally phrase this wrong but here goes: Tiffany Tumbles probably passes the best out of these 3, if I encountered you in everyday life like that I won't deny I wouldn't notice something but at most I'd think you would be a bit of a masculine lady. I get that it is in a large part due to conforming to gender roles w.r.t. fashion and dresscode, but it doesn't look out of place on you. (Guys not being able to wear more cute clothes and getting away with it is shitty, but thats not the point here). If this is your starting stage for your process I think you will come out of your cocoon just fine; it's not going to be easy so stay strong."

"Hi SJWs, I could use your advice with something, if you'd take the time to read this comment and help me out  I'd be very grateful.  So at this time of writing I for all intents and purposes identify as a binary cis guy, I haven't always felt this way and for around two and a half years starting in about 2013 and ending in 2015 I had a very intense struggle with my my gender identity. I started out gender questioning, essentially playing with my assigned gender role as an exercise to see how how people would react to my non-conformism but as things developed I started to get less and less comfortable with the idea of being male and developed a crippling sense of dysphoria towards my body and social perception.   The thing I find the most confusing in hindsight is that after years of internal struggle my dysphoria and female identity seemed to rather quickly dissipate, I didn't do anything in particular to deliberately cultivate this and I wasn't on HRT or in therapy. The thing I find troubling is how supposedly abnormal my experience is as most trans people don't seem to suddenly.. go back (so to speak) to being cis. I'm really just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and to be clear that my story is one I tell with caution.. I really don't want to give weight to the narrative of so called 'transtrenders' or support the idea that being trans is just a phase.   Watching Contra's video brought back a few things and I'm kinda secretly terrified that my dysphoria might come back and that I'll have to re-live the most traumatic, confusing and depressing period in my life. I'm almost worried I'm repressing some inner sense of gender out of fear of the pain it might cause and writing this comment has been the first time I've gotten myself emotional about this stuff since 2015. I need your help .. please."

"From a biological science perspective, transgender people are 100% natural; all females temporarily become male once per month until menopause  (short-term, it's about hormones). So, the gender binary isn't just a social construction, it's also an anti-scientific one and is completely unnatural."

Which is fine, it's the trying to equate the discrimination to each other,  and jockeying for which is worse, is where to problems arise. Which I think you perfectly illustrated here. Women are always going to find reasons, why trans woman had, or have advantages over cis woman and trans women, are always going to find reasons why they have disadvantages cis women don't suffer from. All we can do is meet people where they are at, listen and empathize.   (The back and forth between characters is brilliant for not feeling 'talked at', its brilliant)"

"amazing video as always, and very real. also the opening and the 'DOST THOU BLEED' bit nearly made me piss myself with laughter"

"Eehh this is the sort of thing where you present the side you agree with as reasonable and empathetic, and the sides you disagree with as goofy caricatures. It's not particularly hard to win a fake debate where you get to script all participants. Production values are great though you should have more subs."
"Hey, good to see you're getting your alcoholism under control; only 1/3rd drunk in this video. ^_^"
"That thin veiled Laci Green shade"
"The single greatest contribution to the eternally valid and legitimate TERF-Trans debate is:  'Wouldn't a sexual assailants genitals be hard instead of flopping'  But also having recently hung out on some dank TERF forums recently one of the things I've noticed is they literally talk about trans-women 'impersonating' women the same way neo-Nazis talk about Jews impersonating white people."
"Not even a minute into a new ContraPoints video and it is already another feat of humankind."
"The framing and the introductory preamble sorta misfire in their attempted mockery. Dave Rubin's interest in free speech is mainly as a defense against moral reproach when he invites indecent flouncing trolls like Milo onto his show to talk unopposed for half an hour.  The Freedom Report, on the other hand, debates a topic that is not entirely frivolous. The two guests are sincere in their beliefs, the moderator asks illuminating questions, and the discussion that follows is somewhat productive. It actually flatters the thing the intro attempts to mock."
"This was good, but a little heavy handed for you.   I think that getting hung up on definitions of 'words' is a waste of time, so I refuse to care who calls themselves a woman. If you get something out of relating to the collected experiences of women, it is probably because you are affectedly negatively by the same or similar pressures and pitfalls in society that I deal with, and I would hope to consider you an ally.  Tiffany though, came off a little preachy.   Some trans women retain parts of the mindset that can make abuse so easy from their time as men. It is generally because being a man was pretty awful for them, but this happens, and not being able to acknowledge someone's past in a frank manner can mask this behavior. THis is something that needs to happen on a person to person basis, not a decree that the HIgh Councyl of Wombyn can pass down as 'sufficiently female.'   Men. Though. I really get your if you just can not stand to be called a man any more because have you seen Men recently? Goddess. I get that. But you know men. Is it THAT unthinkable to you that someone could use the recent great progress for Trans Rights for their own gain? People have been finding ways to fuck over the gender nonconforming people in society for most of society. Not everyone is Caitlynn Jenner, but not everyone is TIffany Tumbles either. Some people are Dana Rivers, or Ben Hopkins. I do not see all trans women I meet as a potential threat, but it is important for communities to be safe that people can call that out by name if it creeps up.   The ideal ideal would be to eradicate rape culture to the point where rape was considered on par with cannibalism, and women were taken seriously in reporting, so that these would become rare instances than are taken care of immediately. I think we agree on this point.   THough, please, pretty please. While I love seeing you in the bath, seeing the thing that has made me pass out after screaming portrayed as if it is sexy is kind of upsetting. I see what you were going for. You do not have to be a part of the weird vagina cult. I am not super duper into it, but you need to remember that my vagina and uterus and all of that functioning is something that I could have been killed at birth for in some parts of the world and leaves me vulnerable to pregnancy, and puts me in more restrictive social roles All My Life and gifts me with cramps and the cost of pads and the dirty bed sheets and the burning period shits.   My definition of womanhood is fine including you, so long as you are fine including me. If asked the question 'Would you rather have a male body then?' I would say yes. A lot of us would say yes. The physical constraints of being a female person are the only ties I have to being a Woman, and yet being a woman in a huge part of my life that affects everything, and continued to affect everything when I tried to escape it through medical transition.   This got kind of unorganized sorry. But I am reaching out to you as a radical feminist who is also tired of hateful radical feminists, but I have observations to share about how socialization can change and transcend transition based on my own Lived Experience, not being a bigot. There is a vast area of discussion in the middle here, and I would be glad to see you really address some more salient radical feminist points."
"i think the worst part about the terf ideology is that their definition of being a woman is not just gross its wrong, there is not a single womanhood experience: women come in all forms and shapes and our way of combating everyday sexism is always different (ex. white women gain roles in television as more rugged, brutal heroines, while black women want to have more representation as soft, emotional but not aggressive stereotypical people, etc). They also forget that some trans people figured this part of themselves out during childhood! There are so many documentaries now about trans children! Are you acusing a 6 year old trans girl of being a pervert trying to invade female spaces then?"
"ought to put a epilepsy warning and 'when to skip to' annotation."
"Can somebody give me a quick rundown on TERFs?"
"I agree that part of female oppression is being perceived as a women. However, having recognised the gender binary, shouldn't we be working towards deconstructing it? I understand people have gender dysphoria, but to claim that 'dressing as a woman' is a way of expressing your gender identity is quite problematic. It is essentially just validating cultural signifiers of femininity in order to be perceived as a woman by society. What seems better is to do away with any gender markers, and dress however you want without labelling it as an expression of 'femininity', or more accurately what society deems 'femininity' to be."
"god how i missed your videos AND your style, like seriously so unfair the terf in the video had the beautiful pink hair"
"I feel like I'm at a crossroads because I think I am radical-leaning ideologically, but I also reject the hostile and trans women-exclusionary stance of terfs. Is there such a thing as a TIRF?"
"Scintillating and poignant, informative and entertaining as always; and another tiny artistic masterpiece. Great work as always Contra! Good luck in all the future endeavors video un-and-related, and I - for one - cannot wait to see you take the nazis by the horns in the future :>"
"The marketplace of ideas Sells... but Who's Buying?"
"Tbh you went well too easy on TERFs they are completely insane search TERFISNOTASLUR for examples.  They paint transwoman as predators and transman a mental children that need protecting.  I blame feminism for TERFs when you paint males as the ultimate evil for years on end and pretend females can do no wrong and prefect victims its no surprise TERFs would exist."
"you continue to be a blessing in all of our lives, nat. i'm so glad you bother to break these arguments down and refute them like that. I actually shared this to facebook in the hopes any of my terf-leaning acquaintances watch it. wish me luck tbh  also am I wrong to believe that was an actual drink and not just a prop"
"Yet another gem of a video. <3"
"Yes, yes, good, good. They will eat their own."
"drop the F from TERF"
"I just love you so much"
"I really love these videos with you acting."
"Lowkey Contra's videos kind of remind me of Louie (the show with Louis CK) because there's a little bit of this nihilistic 'whatever, fuck you' attitude and a general absurdity that's very pertinent in setting the scene for her videos."
"great video! The only thing I wish had been addressed (maybe not in this video but maybe in a future one?) is the fact that trans people who choose not to transition, or present in a way that conforms with the gender roles of their assigned gender (a trans man who has long hair and wears makeup, for instance) are no less trans than trans folks who do take on the gender roles of their gender (a trans man who dresses and acts very masculine, for instance).   The way I see it, is being trans is having that discomfort with the gender one was assigned at birth, and a desire to have relationships that affirm ones gender (in the sense that as a nonbinary person, i wouldn't want to be in a romantic relationship in which my partner viewed us as straight, nor would i want, for instance, a group of all guys to see me as 'just one of the guys' or a group of girls to see me as 'just one of the girls' (i suppose i could have said that more succinctly as social dysphoria, but).   a trans person choosing to transition medically or otherwise, how they dress, whether they shave their body hair or grow it out, or anything else doesn't change their gender, and they are no less their gender because of it. a trans woman who is hairy, or masculine, or wears 'mens' clothes is no less a woman than any other woman, and deserves no less respect. this isn't to say i don't think you respect gender nonconforming trans people obviously, i just wanted to add my two cents because i'd love to see this addressed. all in all this was a really great video, good job as always! sorry for the text wall, if you do end up reading this!"

"trans ppl think its 'ciss privilege' for women to be raped and be forced to be pregnant from the rape. its ok if trans ppl say fucked up shit that wouldn't be tolerated from the right, their trans so their above reproach. its crazy that you are more charitable to the golden dawn guy whos a nazi sympathizer than to 2nd wave rad fems. all this was  adhominom bullshit. god im so glad i saw throgh the bullshit with sjw third wave tumblr feminism. as a rad fem i do not give a fuck if trans ppl believe they are women what i give a fuck about is the fact that they downplay women issues at every turn within the feminist movement. i have heard trans ppl say that women getting raped cat called is a privilgae, i have heard trans ppl say that they do not care about abortion/planned parenthood because they dont benifit from it and calll other cis sexist if they even talk about it. i have heard trans ppl downplay female genital mutilation. i have heard a trans person say to an ex muslim woman who was talking about reglion and the hijab that it was 'whit privlige'  to say that her religion oppressed women. i dont care that they dont have a period, i care that they come into feminist space and shut down all discussion that doesnt pertain perticually to them.  but of couse contrapoints wont bring any of this up."

"How bad was your shit after eating all that barbecue sauce?"
"TERF's are not decent human beings."
"Who knew that waching someone eat BBQ ribs could induce a seziure. It was sexy AF, but in all seriousness as someone who doesn't actually even suffer with epellepsy it made me feel funny and had to look away so maybe a¬†flashing lights¬†warning would be good?  Anyways great video as always, I like how Becky basically sat there doing nothing despite being a moderator getting drunk as hell.  Who am I kidding? like, literally me tho."
"We need more Abigail Cockbane."
"Thank God for Contrapoints"
"Epilepsy warning plz"
"TERFS are worse than MRAs because they are well read and educated on feminism and even then they claim to be for feminism and destroying female stereotypes and roles and at the dame time trying to strictly define womanhood."
"'The Transsexual Empire', which is essentially the Transphobia Manual for TERFs, was an accepted part of radical feminist academic thought for more than a decade.  You can certainly criticize them, but I don't see how you can completely disown them from feminism without also saying that feminism did not exist for that stretch of time.  In my opinion, the loathsome views of TERFs are an example of the tribalism which is inherent in Identity Politics.  They cannot help but to operate on stereotypes of groups outside their echo-chamber-- in this case, negative stereotypes of men as pathologically toxic sexual predators.  It is such a shame that you managed to completely avoid the obvious-- that Cockbane's views were born of established misandric paranoia.  Instead, you essentially tried to ingratiate yourself by validating her paranoia and claiming space on her team."
"i don't think i've ever seen any collection of visual media that combines beauty and intelligence in the way your channel does"
"shouldve given her TERF bangs :-("
"I consider you a woman good luck with your transitioning"
"you're so fucking talented man"
"The distinction between gender roles and socialized womanhood seems deeply at odds with the trans experience.   If gender is socialized from a young age with boys pressured to like STEM fields, trucks, blue, etc., and girls pressure to like art and caretaking, dolls, and pink, how can that account for the trans experience of having the opposite pressures and yet once transitioning (or even before) preferring their transitioned gender's stuff.   From the TERF point of view, it seems that not having that particular pressure and expectation all throughout childhood fundamentally changes the pressure of the 'role' that TERF feminism seeks to eradicate.   That is to say, on the one hand you have a feminism which states that what matters is removing the oppression of having to conform to the socialized gender 'role' that comes from being born and raised with particularly gendered pressures. On the other hand you have a feminism which wants to remove the oppression of the cultural 'second'-ness of women whatever the role they take on in society, in that they are cat-called, abused, make less money, etc. due to a racism-like prejudice."
"Now do SWERFS!"
"That bath has seen some weird shit in its time"

"The trans woman is not wearing a wig and the terf is. Brilliant."
"I think you did an amazing job of showing why trans women shouldn't have to defend their gender to TERF's (or anyone).  I am glad you do anyways though.  Like it or not people still want answers to those questions."
"Which one is Contra?"

"Abigail, no ..."
"contra i love your videos they capture what goes on in my head so well, and i love your artistic spin. keep up the great work!"
"I think there's a lot that could be said about gender essentialist pseudofeminism.  One claim I sometimes hear from tradcons, and in fact also from many mainstream religious conservatives, is that people who advocate for women to have the option of having careers or advanced education or of having the freedom to choose to not have children are 'the real sexists' because they're trying to deceive or manipulate women out of the 'normal female experience' and therefore are accused of hating femininity (with the subtext being that those female gender roles are inherent to being 'feminine', which is inherent in being biologically female).  This is something I think you came close to in your discussion with The Distributist earlier this year.  Also, maybe put a seizure warning in for that first bit with the ribs?"

"ok but I want Tiffany's outfit <3"
"Are the enigmas over with? I really like trying to solve them, and the puzzle didn't seem like it was fully complete yet."
"Contra, I'm sorry to impose on your undoubtedly busy schedule (given recent events and the fiery hellstorm I hope you're brewing up for our alt-right comrades).  Given the announcement of your medical transition, I had a question.   A little context first. I'm the cis-est white male you'll ever meet. I'm also fascinated by psychology and the workings of both my and others thought processes. I was immensely interested in your Gender Dysphoria Movie.   Not sure if you'll be willing to answer such a personal question, but here goes. And please bear in mind that my bluntness is in no way intended as disrespect.  Are you really going to let them peel your dick like a banana? I've seen pictures of the procedure on the internet (don't ask), and as a cis guy, I honestly couldn't imagine something more horrific. It's difficult to overestimate how much I treasure my dick.   Cis guys don't generally talk about their dicks (hate the word penis, just sounds wrong) as openly as I am, but the reverence they have for their member, both conscious and subconscious, is obvious in their speech, their actions, their jokes...  I guess what I'm trying to say Contra is, what's your relationship with your dick? How does it differ from mine? Could this be the topic of another video down the road?  Just reread what I wrote and I can't stop laughing. But I'm being honest here. I'm curious how your mind, which is so different from mine, works.   Feel free to ignore this if you're too busy. I'm never gonna unsubscribe, your videos are too good."
"YOU MATCHED THE CREDITS AT THE END TO THE RHYTHM OF MOONLIGHT SONATA! YESSS! (Also kickass video!)"
"Trans women believe that following gender stereotypes makes someone a woman. That's a fact. That's what it means to transtitioning from male to female. It not a 'way to comunicate a truth'. The truth is that they (most) have gender dysphoria, which is a mental illness. I don't have anything against trans people (They deserve all rights and even special protection for being targeted by violence), but their ideology is just wrong and unfeminist.   Being a woman is not an identity or a feeling. I'm a woman and i don't know what does it mean to identify as a woman. I identify as Daniela, with my tastes and interests. Trans people are telling boys who like dresses and barbies to change their gender because that means they are feeling like girls. How is that feminist?!"
"Fuck, Abigail Cockbane reenacting real 'arguments' I've had with TERFs is too real."
"I need to turn Atlantis gay."
"Atlantis was in ancient greece, don't think it really need help to be anymore gay"
"I'm really impressed with Contrapoints's production value. It's great to see how much effort she puts into her videos. Very informative and entertaining. Keep up the good work!"
"1:30 That sequence though."
"I have a question about a notion that's brought up in the video. In the sex/gender discussion, the fact that there is no female or male body often comes up, and the arguments are compelling. From this point of view, one could indeed argue that disphoria is about how society views a certain body: a trans man doesn't want top surgery to get a 'male body', as a ''male body' doesn't exist, but because breasts are seen as feminine. However, the video mentions being comfortable with 'female/male embodiment', and it's not a notion that's I've met before. Is 'female embodiment', for example, simply the way women are presented in our society?"
"#vaccinescausefeminism"
"Hate to admit it, because I am an anti-SJW: ContraPoints (aka Nykytyne) fucking rocks! These videos are very high production quality and take an enormous amount of preparation. Heck, I might even become a patreon donor. I enjoyed this video very much."

"Is that copy of infinite jest meant to be ironic?"
"Not the video I wanted considering recent events but I'll take it. At least you don't shit out mindless think pieces like some other guys."
"OK but seriously, can Trans Tips with Tiffany be its own series now?"
"Contra, are you a Dario Argento fan?"
"You could've bolstered 'Tiffany's' position further: Bleeding is irrelevant. Cis women don't always menstruate and trans women DO experience PMS complete with cramping if they finally have the right hormones in their bloodstreams."
"Jeez, don't you realize that TERFs do not identify as TERFs and that calling them that demeans them?  So much for the tolerant left.  ....wait a minute"

"'Countering' definitions, which draw gender distinctions statistically from objective biological and sexual characteristics, by appeal to 'lived experiences' (which is a synonym of 'anecdote' unless expressly shown otherwise) of the group, whose legitimacy is the very thing under question, is not especially convincing.
