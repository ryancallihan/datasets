"It's very scary when you say 'class and racial distinctions are excluded from the diagram altogether', because it may only mean race and class interfere in the formation or determination of sex, gender and orientation. Of course being, for example, a poor cis woman in NYC is different from being a middle-class cis woman in the Republic of Myanmar, in ways and levels that doesnt even fit to mention here, but still none of them is less cis or less a woman , at least in terms of rigths and validity of feelings and interests, or it should be. Since the diagram, simplistic as it may be, purpotedly applies for the entire species, class and race really must not be taken into consideration, exactly because they dont apply for the entire species. I daresay that anything that purpotedly apply for the entire species should never take into consideration cultural elements, lest it fall into the same framework of thinking as, for example, eugenics, physiognomy, maternal impression or phrenology."

Also, if you are having trouble with understanding how social sciences work because of how complex they are and you can‚Äôt handle the fact that the world is chaos and you want to fit it into neat little boxes, you‚Äôre not very good at the hard sciences either.

"I feel so bad for this guy, his parents and society have completely fucked him up. The fact he thinks he will be happier if he pretends to be woman is very sad. Having a dick and balls makes you a man having a vagina that when inseminated by a mans sperm you can create a child makes you a woman that's the one and only definition of sex. You can say all this other bullshit determines your sex but thats dishonest and complete bullshit. You can site the .00001 % of the time when these definitions don't fit but that changes nothing, in those extremely rare cases then you can use other things to determine the sex but that is only for those extremely rare cases. I feel sorry for you thinking you are validated by all these virtue signaling retard sheep that call you special and some kind of hero, a hero is someone who puts themselves in some kind of risk to help other, not a man pretending to be a woman and using pseudoscience to prove it."
"I'm sorry but anyone who buys this shit is either stupid, a virtue signaling d bag, or just stupid. The characteristics of a male are simple you have a dick and balls and a female has a vagina and the ability to grow an offspring inside her, this is the case for 99.99999% of every species that has ever existed on earth. I feel so bad for these people, they got fucked up by society, their parents, and who knows what else. No one gives a shit if you are a man and want to be a woman or vice versa, but trying to claim it's somehow normal and good thing is so wrong it's not funny. Im also sorry I have to say this, but I don't want these people anywhere near my daughter kids have enough bullshit to navigate through they don't need a freak like this putting insane thoughts in their head. Don't get it twisted you are a freak, just like people who think killing people is normal, just like child molesters who think fucking a child is ok society just doesn't understand, you are in the same category. You brain is completely fucked up, I have no idea why but it is and trying to push it as normal is disgusting and plain wrong."

"The conventional genders are for societal organization simplicity, from my understanding, but now that we have more time to philosophize as regular peoples: we bring those constructs into question and point our how flawed they are relative to truth; and all the injustices those simplicities have created from the older generations being lazy with legal semantics for political rulership.   The problem with the modern philosophy of all this is that it is impractical to implement the inevitable infinity-system, and too much to put into realistic legal semantics without causing the opposite desirable effect; at least with the way that the modern Left have been trying to do so anyway.  The older ways create injustices to the minorities, but the modern way is to create injustices against the majority.  The best solution would be get rid of all of the injustices, but _that_ is what many from both sides fear: a society that does not give a f* at all and destroys all diversity in the legal semantical context by enforcing universality in their legality; pansexuality & either 1 gender or genders not based on personal & biological constructs, but rather on something like 'Internal Citizen'/'External People', and effectively 1 gender otherwise by not giving a f*, and in doing so acquires equality across all legal spectrums.  But _that_ upsets too many people to accept. IMHO"

"If a person has a vagina, ovaries, xx chromosome etc. at birth, then it is a female, if they have a penis, xy chromosome etc. (again at birth) they are male. Any other combination of this is an abnormality. Using your own statistics we see that the most common disorder of the list would be 'Late onset adrenal hyperplasia'. Say we This occurs in 1 out of 1000 people, or .1%. Using .1% of the population and making a conclusion based on the .1% would be scientifically incorrect as there is not enough evidence to support that claim. The standard significance level of .05 or 5%, tells us that the probability of an event occurring must be at least .05 to be able to impose a conclusion of that upon the population. Any other of these disorders have even a lower probability so the same applies to them.    There are 2 genders, male and female. Gender is a biological term. Using gender as a cultural term is lack of creativity to define your own term. Defining a person's gender by the way they act, feel etc. is wrong by definition. Cultural aspects don't define your gender, your biology does. If a male acts very 'girly' or dresses like a 'girl' or whatever you people say, doesn't mean they are girl. First of, defining certain actions as masculine and others a feminine is not supported by science and it's entirely cultural. This is why imposing those sets of rules conflict with scientific ones. If you want to create a new term that explains these cultural values then go ahead, but it is inappropriate to force those beliefs upon science even though they are literally incorrect.  Now fuck off and stop making conclusion about entire species based on a handful of outliers."

"When you argue that a primary binary view does not want to adjust to reality, you're very comfortably ignoring reasonable explanations that are offered, which is unexpectedly dishonest of you. It does make sense that you want to ignore that, as on one side, one would be approaching vague and difficult definitions of 'natural' and 'normal', on the other hand there are many people that take offense to such perspectives and explanations. You could argue for example that 'normal' humans 'naturally' have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and that down-syndrome for example is a sickness and a 'deviation' from 'normality'. In the same way, swyer syndrome is generally viewed as a deviation from normality, something that is 'normally' not characteristic of human beings and does not define them. In this way, those 'other genders' or however you wanna define them, can be viewed as 'deviations from normality' or sicknesses, that would 'normally' not occur 'naturally'. Many people object to such perspectives, as this was for example used for explaining homosexuality and transsexuality. The occurence of homosexuality and transsexuality may be deviations from some kind of normally but do occur naturally and have for as long as we can tell. In particular transsexuals take offense to the view that their condition may be viewed as a sickness or disorder. I do however believe that that would be unproblematic, so long as people aren't fixated on it as something negative or bad. It's a kind of difference from some kind of normality with advantages and disadvantages. Proposing tons of different genders that are always changing does not some like something practical to me, in particular when this kind of understanding of gender overlaps so much with what people traditionally just mean with 'personality'"

"only 1 thing to say.....  MEN are Afraid that  Women might  Laugh at them. WOMEN are Afraid that  Men might KILL them.....  Interesting why there is not one single woman who  - started a war, committed a mass murder, was the perpetrator in a mass shooting & including school shootings, was behind murders (such as charles manson), committed bombings, and women are almost always the people who (and I don't like to say victim, survivor is acceptable) the targets of revenge porn, are the survivors of rape, sexual harassment, domestic relationship/intimate partner violence.  Now don't misunderstand me, there are certainly men who are the survivors of rape and domestic partner abuse/violence. It is the Vast Majority of women who are on the receiving end of these types of crimes.   And revenge porn is also seldom done by women.  It it sad & frustrating that most often women are hurt at the hands of men, then things like victim blaming happen on top of that.  There are both good & bad people that are both men & women. People should hold themselves to a higher standard, in the way they treat others, and we all can use a little more respect for one another."

"Okay, so, as a cis-man who is trying to be nice and 'woke', as someone who has trans friends and family and who cares about their well-being and about having a clear and healthy understanding of gender... 'How do I explain this to kids?' Now, I don't mean the above question the way most people do, like a sort of 'I don't know how to explain this to my kids, so _stop existing! (angry face)'_ I mean it like this: When I was a kid, gender was taught to me as: 'Boys have penises, and girls have vaginas.' and that's what I accepted. As I grew up and learned about the diversity of gender expressions, I learned: 'Men are those who identify as men, and women are those who identify as women.' and I am fine with that definition.  I accept it. But.... what if a four-year-old asked me: 'Hey, agiar2000, what's the difference between a boy and a girl?' and I said: 'A boy is a child that says they're a boy, and a girl is a child that says they're a girl.' and they say: 'Okay, but... which am I?' and I say: 'Whichever you feel like, or something in between or some entirely different gender, if that's what you feel.' and they say: 'But, how do I know what word I feel like, if I don't know what those words mean?' and I say: 'You're weirdly articulate for a four-year old.  But anyway, I don't know what to tell you.  They're social constructs.' and they say: 'Social constructs meaning what?' and I say: 'Damn it, I'm trying to be woke, here!  I'm sorry!  I don't know!  I don't know what it _really_ means to be male, female, boy or girl!'  Maybe someone can help articulate this better to me.  What would _you_ tell a child who wants to know what gender means?  What is an age-appropriate introduction to the concept for a toddler?  I promise I'm not looking for an argument.  I genuinely want to hear some other perspectives on this, such as from trans folk, non-binary folk, and others who are better versed than I."

I hope that that wasn't a Jew joke, and I really, really hope that wasn't a 'Jews being gassed' joke. Half of my heritage is Jewish, and as I would love to continue devouring your videos like newly minted McDonald fries, I was hoping you would address this. This isn't like a 'callout post' or anything. I just felt kind of uncomfortable and I wanted to figure it out."
"Hm. I think it's still useful to allow biology to draw a philosophical distinction between trans and cis women.  Talking about context is a good point -- in most social contexts, there isn't a big difference between trans and cis women.  But in other contexts (sexually, medically, physically if not on hormones) I don't think it should be considered wrong to acknowledge a difference. But what of the philosophical context? Is a trans woman 'really' a woman? Maybe reality isn't a binary, but a spectrum, too, with biology on the more real end of reality (because physical and objective) and sociology on the less real but still pretty real end?"

"The way I see is that any sexuality that falls in between males and females is a norm.others are oddities due to being rare.if these 'other sexes' become more common and if a set of features that don't fall under the typical male & female.then it can be stated that one has in fact observed a new sex.a gender is more like a fetish(which there is nothing wrong with) that is built upon one's sex(or against it as well)."

"1) The fact that  some natural phenomena can be defined as taking place on a spectrum (like an evolutionary chain) doesn't necessary imply that everything does. It is true that every change, movement, dynamic between a state A and B can be read as running along a spectrum, but it is short of being true that every existing state of affairs, or phenomenon or object happens to switch one another. I can imagine person A exchanging all his molecules to person B until they fully switch their respective identities; under this hypothesis A and B can be conceived to be on a spectrum, but to assert that two existing human beings are on a spectrum is just non sense. Similarly, asserting that female and male (or woman or man) can be ideally put on a spectrum, doesn't imply that they actually are, because it is still to be proved that a shift is possible between the former and the latter. Of course, through surgery or therapies a similar change can take place, but this leaves unanswered two questions: is that actually a change from being a female (or woman) to being a male (or man)? Should such change take place?  2) Answering the first question is strictly related to my second contention, because it is a matter of definitions. If I understood your words correctly, you assumed that words are signs used to refer to objects, subject to several requirements or conditions that mirror the features of the objects we usually label with such names (It is a complicated territory of linguistic philosophy, I would be glad if you corrected me should I have misconstrued your view). I may concede this is tenable (even if a little bit circular: the conditions for the application seem to be at the same time the outcome of the application). You also asserted that it is impossible to define once for all every condition of every definition. I can concede also this. The point is that from everything you stated doesn't certainly follow that the construction of a word for the intent of its application in a specific case can be arbitrary or unwarranted. Given a certain definition of woman that follows the aforementioned conditions, why are we supposed to use it with regard to individuals who fall more or less short of the definition? It is not a given that I should use the word 'woman' for referring to individuals that do not have neither ovaries or XX chromosomes, assuming that I previously included these conditions among those necessary for the word to apply. It seems to me that you are taking as a given that transexual woman are to be defined woman and, on the ground of this assumption, you argue that the chromosome based definition of woman is flawed because it doesn't encompass them. But, respectfully, I think you are committing a petitio principii here, that is to say you are taking as a premise for your conclusion something that you are actually supposed to prove, i.e.: that transexual women are actual women.   3) As to intersexual people or other sex related anomalies the issue it is definitely more complicated, and I acknowledge it is not my field. However, I can make two contentions that do not require any specific expertise on this fascinating topic.  Firstly, even assuming that there are individuals that for the aforementioned conditions can't be labelled neither as woman or men in accordance with the standard definition, and assuming that, even after a strict scientific scrutiny, it doesn't emerge that they might fit in one of them, this doesn't necessary provide any ground for gender theories. Indeed, acknowledging the existence of intersexual people compels us to redefine 'woman' and 'man' so as to encompass also this people or, in alternative, to create new definitions. What this fact doesn't allow us to do is setting forth definition fully detached from any biological ground. In fact intersexuality refers to a variety of conditions or anomalies that are deep rooted in biological and genetic features. In other terms: maybe we overrun a strictly binary definition of sex, but it would be a surpass well confined within biological reality, not leaving any room for a social definition of it.  Secondly, whether the existence of intersexual is an argument for transgenderism is really disputable. You used (at least in one case) the word condition yourself, underscoring that these are anomalies that amount to pathology or run on the borderline of it. They shouldn't be held to be the criterion against which measure the paradigm of the biological and conceptual relationship of genders.  4) I don't know whether gender is or not a social construct. To be frank, it seems to me that the most feasible hypothesis it that it is so, at least to a certain degree, but being also rooted in biological features. My point is different. If gender is a social construct, it would be only as a complicated set of patterns of behaviors, social models, preferences, attitudes. This may explain why some people prefer to adhere to some behavioural paradigms rather than others, but it can hardly explain those individuals who feel they are born with 'the wrong body parts'. It seems to me we are talking about issues that deeply differ in substance one another. Indeed, even accepting the suggested distinction between sex and gender, people who accept to pass through often painful therapies to change their physical features are not just adopting a different social model, they are affecting the most immediate and direct physiological factors being expressed by their chromosomes. If they are not changing sex, they are definitely doing something more than adopting a different gender intended as a social construct. This is to me biggest flaw of every gender theory.  5) All your arguments are fascinating, but appear to be more theoretical speculations rather than actual evidence based theories.   Personally, I remain skeptical as to those set of assumptions usually labelled as gender theory. And even if, under a legal and ethical perspective, I abhor every form of discrimination, I can't sincerely rule out that transgenderism is not a fully healthy system of belief (or whatever you want to define it). And that was the answer to the second question of my point N. 1)  p.s.: did I have to put a trigger warning somewhere? I am Italian, this is not a thing among us yet...luckily."
"People who believe in a gender (or sex) spectrum just don't ever get it. People born with abnormal chromosomes are usually deformed, suffering from mild to severe mental and physical disabilities. They are statistical outliers and therefore do not shape the common-use term we use when we say 'male' or 'female'.  Also the term 'gender' is a word invented by Dr. Money to describe /societal/ roles people play based on their sex. Females predominately display feminine traits and therefore shape their own societal norm, same with males displaying masculine traits. It's written into human's DNA.

"im gay. and gender to me (before the trans community hijecked the word) means 'do your produce eggs or sperm.' here is the thing. as a gay person there is nothing the opposite gender can do to them selves to make me love them sexually. im not into them. i dont care how many operations they have. i accept anyone of the same gender no matter if they wear dresses or a suit and tie. makeup, or no makeup. im not attracted what they look like, im not attracted to how masculine or feminine they are. im attracted to their body and what their body is. is their body physically the same as mine? then i like them. that means internally too. i happen to be a man so they need to have balls and they need to be able to make sperm. there is nothing a woman can do to make me attracted to her. no amount of hormones or surgery can make her into a he. she will always be a she. unless she removed her reproductive organs, then she will be an 'it' and not a he or she.  saying all that, i can love 'anyone' emotionally. but i have to be true to myself. i would rather live who i am, rather then who i am not. if i could, id probably change myself into a female. being male is nice and everything, but i like males so for me it would be easier to be female. but i cant do that. it just isnt possible. that would be me living a lie. i am a male and i like males. that is who i am.  also here is a simple way to answer the question of 'who you are' if you wanna know what gender you are. look in your pants. but if your asking who you are as a person. that is for you to fill in and anything at all can be places in that void. the only solid thing you cant easily change is what is in your pants. you can cut it off, you can reshape it but that doesnt change much. that just takes away from who you are  rather then adding to it.   i will personally accept trans when a complete and total transformation can be made. when you dont have to take pills. when you can go from a man to a woman and bear children by making eggs. even at that point i still think there is something to be lost when you change."

"4:56 To be fair, picky biologists, to my knowledge at least, don't characterize biological sex by sex chromosomes (maybe if we're talking about Drosophila). I thought most biologists and scientists in related fields viewed sex determination in humans as based on the presence/absence of the SRY gene (primary sex characterist genes). This is why people can be XX and be phenotypically male and XY and phenotypically female. To be fair, if you go by this logic, you will end up with 3 sexes instead of just 2 (to my knowledge aneuploidy and mosaicism of the Y chromosome or ovotesticular disorder cause other forms of intersex in humans). This is all the more reason for why humans need the concept of gender. Unless you're working in a lab that in some way deals reproductive biology, genetics, or something like that, I just don't see a practical every day use for biological sex. Good video, by the way!"

Eg do incel and vcels still count as part of their default bio sex categories? If a tree falls in the forest and noone hears it, does it still have a sex? Can't we just accept the social dynamic of genders and allow the gubments and their science communities to define us until we encounter another alpha human strong enough to break our will and tell us who/ what we are, and what our sexual rights and purposes are going forward?"

"I'm sorry in advance Contra but I have a question that might be triggering or ignorant. I just thought I'd ask and get some answer, no matter how harsh. So basically there's this one person I know from twitter who is very open about their being trans, and non-binary. What I'm confused about however is that they have the appearance and all the physical characteristics of a regular cis man. I understand they claim to be non-binary but isn't this just pretend in a way, since they're not making an effort to look less 'cis male' (whatever that might be, I understand its pretty stupid to say that)? I'm not trans myself but I had serious dysmorphia when I was younger and in general don't really define myself by my gender. Back then my ONLY wish was passing for the opposite gender. So I can't understand someone not doing that and being happy with people misgendering them because they're not giving any outer sign that they're of another gender. Maybe I'm wrong to think like this, IDK. I'm just wondering what your answer would be. Thanks for your help."

"Wait. So if gender and the like don't exist, then how can we expect anyone flipping and transitioning through these emipheral boundaries to gain rights? Then they're compaing about nothing? So consequencially they're also being attacked for no reason. But this lends barely anything to the cause. People shouldn't hurt people, and I think perhaps Trans people should be carful to screw around with the most complex systems on the palnet, because they have an identity crisis and are living in accordance and putting a lot of emotional emphasis on something you claim not to exist?   That's another issue. Masculinity and feminity clearly come from somewhere, they are expressed because there is archetypal significance to these themes. They exist psychologically and are brought more into reality by the biology. Its hard to say what exactly they are but clearly they exist. This is clear in any degree of analytical psychology. Should we let this control us? I don't believe so. Therefore both sides are at fault in a way. Not that people struggling with identity should be punished, but they are campaigning around something that doesn't really exist, gender, because of percieved roles created by general conciousness. And the people prosecuting the former are just assholes."

Females have breast that have milk producing glands along with the infrastructure to bring the milk from the glands to the nipples. Now your entire point has just been disprove by simply giving you accurate info."
"Love the way you talked about how language is insuficient to define just what things actually are. This happens 'cause words are not tied to things, but to the idea of the thing. Saussure said language was sound with meaning, but I'm inclined to think, like Chomsky, that language is actually meaning with sound. That is to say: what you mean precedes the way you say it because language actually began as only a way of reflecting on what you perceive and not of communicating it (and that is pretty obvious once you think about evolution theory, given that language and such traits can only be the product of mutation - which means there was a time in which only a selected few had the 'Language Faculty' and therefore a time in which there was no social conventions about the way sounds should be arranged to mean things) . Also, the way you say it is tied down by a certain number of rules that dictate meaning inside a certain context and by a limited but everchanging vocabulary. Words like 'transgender', for instance, did not exist for a long time, and that does not mean that transgender people did not exist, only that people didn't know the proper way to deal with this and therefore didn't include it in their language, probably causing great suffering on those who felt that their existence was null or who felt like they didn't belong anywhere. Luckily for us, language is also the way to preserve and evolve human shared knowledge and it won't be long before people actually learn to accept those changes in vocabulary that represent a change in the very way we think. It is inevitable. No amount of bigots can stop that. P.S.: just found your channel like yesterday and I'm loving it. You truly are a great communicator."

"Don't pretend that every human social construct has the same fluidity and uncertainess. Gender is a social construct with rather strong boundaries as it is tied to the observable mechanism in mammals which requires binary 'non-fluid' agents: one carrying the baby, the other fertilizing the egg. Sex variants can be considered as malfunctions of this mechanism. You can define Gender as you want, of cours,e there is no essential or correct definition. A new Gender definition which lumps together well-established distinct and related categories (biological sex, gender roles, gender identity) just seems to add some bluriness for the sake of turning gender from a descriptive into a semi-normative category."

"Gender is in the eye of the beholder?  I think sex is useful to use when talking about biological definitions of a person. And gender is best used to describe a person's appearance, habits, mannerisms, how they view themselves (which affects how they act).  Even then gender is kind of restrictive sometimes. If you ever felt sad about whether you ARE a man or ARE a woman you understand that, by placing expectations on people it excludes an identity from those who can't conform to it. Thereby putting them down to elevate ourselves at their expense (immoral) shrug?"
"As someone who studies biology and is absolutely turned on by the diversity of life on this earth; I get a bit peeved off when people use naturalistic arguments that make no sense (including those not related to gender). My understanding is that people don't seem to understand that the lines biologists draw to try and classify the world for our convenience are just that - for our convenience. They are not often ultimatums. You can find thousands of contradictions and exceptions in the classification of life. It's not even that clear cut what a /species/ is, let alone gender."

These cells have 2 genders, male and female, to distinguish who does the birthing and who has the larger gametes. There is only a need for these 2 genders, and it would not help the cell to think of itself as another gender. All other genders are unneeded and so by natural selection, the cell reproduces only via male female reproduction. You are a seedless fruit. You only serve to pleasure others and will never reproduce. You did this willingly to yourself which is why i think you are mentally defunct."
"So yes biology (the universe ) is a spectrum of change and language is inadequate tool for description, but brains are not binary as are the bodies they reside within. So should we abandon words for y* or Bayesian models (I might like that but I would hear fewer opinions;wait maybe that is the answer to depend on innumeracy just like we relied on illiteracy for power?) In time language will change in a predictable lag behind culture and maybe even biology so isn't this all an argument to be patient?"

Intersex people are err...incomplete so to speak.  Kind of like a kid with trisomy or a type of aneuploidy.  People really need to leave those people alone and stop using them as evidence of your 'sex does not objectively exist' ideology. I say that as a liberal scientist.  The combination of the genes expressed and hormones are not optimum to result in the complete and formation of naturally FUNCTIONAL gonads that requires the sex selective biochemical pathways. And yes I can mark them as incomplete if the product does not result in being fully functional same way can mark a person born with no functional kidney inconpletely (only in that case its acyually fatal). This precludes their orientation and how they decide to used their gonads. End of story."

"Since 'what is gender' is a philosophical question and has no final answer it really is an arbitrary thing. Claiming there are only two genders is as valid as any other claim. In reality you'll always have a finite amount of genders. There is no difference in quality of a statement: 'there are only 2 genders' and a statement: 'there are only 56 genders'. Changing one system for another, equally good makes no sense, since that new system presents new problems which are solved in the old one."

It's really very easy for a chair to be a horse, a tree, a house, a lamp, a dinner or a breakfast plate, a medicine for dizziness, a walking aid, a table for two, a very scary monster, an altar, a weapon, a bed. A chair is all those things and more, and it doesn't mind. Or it's happy about it! Hell, I think if it could speak for itself... Well, but it won't.

"Well I still think that the gender binary model makes the most sense, even philosophically.  For example if you want to take it to the extreme every person that has ever existed has a different gender. I think that gender has to do specifically with biological functions. What comes after that is sexuality (your attraction to others and to your self) wich in my opinion is what those dirty french philosophers call ' gender' . It is possible that this whole new idea of gender is just a missanderstandig caused by how poor human languages are. Maybe there isn't a word with wich to describe how you feel in your own body. And the roles that society puts on people make things even more confusing. But gender is for sure not the right word to describe that feeling.  Even I don't feel like a human sometimes (maybe I'm autistic I don't even know).  So to end all this: be who you think you are and try to be happy with your self . And to avoid confusion stop putting labels on your self. People will accept you for who you are but they won't accept you changing their vocabulary just for you."
"Sooooooooooo what's the gender identity again? I'm sorry but I still don't get it. What does it mean for someone to identify as women if they're biologically a man (so their sex is male) and dress/act as men (so their gender is male)? That seems illogical. And don't just tell me 'people are not always logical'. Yes, some people think they're being spied on by a duck, that doesn't mean we take them seriously. I'm not saying that men identifying as women while still acting as men are delusional, just that this video doesn't explain how they're not."

"You hold up Swyer Syndrome as a point to show the absurdity of a pure chromosome based categorization, and then use a completely different system to refute it.   A purely chromosome based system would define Swyer Syndrome as 'Men who can give birth'. The only real problem with that point is assigning ability to give birth to only women, which would not be a part of the chromosome based categorization in the first place. Also that is one of the points you previously used to argue against rigid categories. So, not getting the logic there.  The other parts are good arguments against non-binary, but that one is flawed."

Another definition is '' Gender is a performance, a series of imitative behaviours''.  BUT WHAT ARE THEY!??!?!?! WHAT ARE THE BEHAVIOURS?! Are they socially constructed ??? Then WHY do we even have gender if they are arbitrary definition to define individual? It doesn't help to have gender or transgender. It usurps behaviours from one gender to another. As if ''caring'' had to any else to do then being experienced through  ''caring people''. As if 'courageous' should be attributed to any one except  ''courageous people''.   Why. Gender."

"Hmmmm. Not convince.... you can't pick a few chromosomic aberrations or mutations and say that debunks the biological definition of gender. The label still useful when 99% of the population can fit into a binary category. Now if someone feels they belong to the dolphinhuman race and they want me to call them dolphins I will happily oblige."
"Bravo. I have a thought though. I preface by saying I really don't give a shit about who wins the competition of ideas so much as how the game is played. Where I see a potential disconnect regarding the definition of sex by the thoughtful scientific right and the thoughtful scientific left is the intended scope when talking about sex as binary or nonbinary. When the right says binary they're really describing something bimodal, and when the left (and you in this video in a well put way) describes the inherent lack of precise definition due to the variability of the pieces of the modes being mixed and matched, they're kind of skipping over the baseline that all the pieces that are mixed and matched are themselves binary - which gives rise to the continuum in the bimodality. I.e., having x or y chromosomes in and of themselves may not define sex, but they are binary choices inside of a complex bimodal system. So the right is always like hey, you're denying the modes, so all this nonbinary talk is nonsense (They don't say that, I'm paraphrasing my idea of the subtext of what they're actually saying), which is an obvious logical overreach. And the left is so busy showing how all the parts can mix and match to create an obviously nonbinary spectrum that they never talk about the binary qualities of the parts themselves. Unless I'm forgetting sex characteristics that are not divided into the male/female bimodality. Like is there a sex characteristic that is not male or female? I mean, it literally wouldn't be sexy.. uh.. paradox? I'm no pro. Anyway, you brain good. I'd love your thoughts but I know this is a late comment on an old video. Best of luck :-) P.S. I'd like to apologize for my use of 'left and 'right'. It's also a bimodal, not binary, system."

Even when there is a unifying theory, it's just not computationally (or even just financially) feasible to apply it to everything.  Also, I should mention that working with integers (i.e. eliminating spectra) is really useful, but it _does_ introduce the possibility of undecidable problems (this is one of the the things Turing researched!), which essentially means that fuzziness is required in order to get actual work done."

"Few things, and I am looking for different perspectives here I'm not just looking to rek people +Intersex conditions are at least twice as rare as people born with fewer or greater than 20 digits, and the vast majority lead to no significant phenotypic differences. Seems strange to define this as a spectrum rather than a mutation. Doesn't make intersex people less than human, but every system can fail and that's okay. I have asthma and epilepsy, these aren't just part of a lung and brain function spectrum +Characteristics which differ between the sexes always produce two overlapping bell-curves. Does that mean there are two or multiple genders? I say two, but ultimatle it's about labelling something we both have to admit (the people who think gender is entirely fluid and the people who have rigid ideas about what men and women should be) +Gender identity is a separate thing, I understand that, but having dealt with mental health issues before (including gender dysphoria) I know how malleable our experience of the world and view of ourself can be. A lot of people on your side are against transracialism, but they seem like the same principle to me. What am I missing? +Why are there so many more trans women than trans men?

"I don't get why the genderbread person model would be used, at least to how I understand it. It seems to try to cover multiple topics under one term, which to me seems to reinforce genderroles rather than dismissing them. It just seems easier to separate them as traits. For example:  sex: female expression: masculine sexuality: hetero  Sex can include intersex, sexuality can described whatever partner preference, etc. No need for a limited model in that regard.  Something like that. It just seems easier to me than making a gender for every combination of those traits. Sex can include intersex, sexuality can described whatever partner preference, etc."

And my current gender identity is completely impertinent to how I present or express my current gender.

"I accept your definition on the matter. My question is, does the rigid definition cause gender dysphoria. Is gender dysphoria just caused by society telling people they can't express how they feel, or is it a chronic depression of knowing that most straight men won't want you (which I guess you could say is a social aspect but its one that should be respected. There has to be middle ground here.) and that the gender you're trying to identify with, won't recognize you as one of their own (which again is social and I won't say that it should be respected as long as I can see evidence where trans people are being recognized as the gender they identify with among those normalized gendered groups) OR can we really just be chill with just saying 'Well its weird but it works so lets roll with it' Cuz that's what I'm doing."
"while it's important to be pro-reproductive rights and talk about how that's infused with misogyny, there's a way to do that without using the biological view of gender. for instance, there are transgender men who face huge hurdles upon not just abortion, but carrying a pregnancy to term, which yes, is a thing that happens. and sometimes, psychologists will use 'well you didn't hate your pregnancy' or 'well, you didn't have an abortion' as an actual, real, thing-that-happens justification for why a trans man doesn't deserve hormones. this is a real  thing that's happened to an actual acquaintance of mine. so by using the biological perspective, or employing the idea of 'political womanhood', you're not only siding with the system but actively insisting that these men have to ignore who they are and suck it up because there's clearly no other way to have a reproductive rights-debate. so... bad hot take on that, but i otherwise like you."

That said, why even presuppose 'gender'? In my opinion, for feeling however you feel there does not have be a universal entity you must instantiate in order to justify your feelings. Are your urges capable of hurting anyone but yourself? No? Well, then, do whatever you want to. I just don't want to be forced to acknowledge some abstract concept that effectively doesn't exist in my reality (discrimination is real, hatred towards societal outliers is real and both are dangerous; but when your whole argument is 'social categories are too narrow to subsume the entire spectrum of human biology and behaviour', then why does your solution seem to be to construct new categories? Why not do away with them entirely?)"

"2:58 The bush was a nice touch."
"I'd add that to be clear, gender does strongly correlate with biological sex and the left isn't trying to claim that it's some weird bigoted conspiracy that all of the world's cultures happen to have some notion of 'male' and 'female', each of which describe about half the population. That doesn't mean other mixtures of biological sex and gender aren't possible. I think shitlords get so caught up on 'only 2 genders' because these distinctions can initially seem overly abstract and subtle, so they think this is all a word game designed to show off lefty-cred and intentionally stifle the right by calling them transphobic if they don't find these concepts immediately intuitive."
"I think that in the part of biological sex, evolution must be taken into account. In sexual reproduction, two individuals with two different sex cells make an embryo. This, I think, explains why a binary concept of sex can be uphold. Intersex people can be only classified as conditions because (as far as I know, which is little) they are usually sterile.  Think about it this way: why did the concept of sex gained traction, not only in humans, but in animals? Because of sexual reproduction. Biology doesnt work without evolution.   This raises another interesting point: because of this, do males and females naturally have distinct behaviors? If we think about evolution, many scientists say that there are on average. This is because sperm is created more rapidly, are much smaller, and live much less than their egg counterpart. This is thought to urge males into a more competitive state, where the best reproductive strategy for them is to have sex much more frequently than women. This can have some basis to gender being related to sex, and therefore binary.  However, social and psychological effects on humans is an important part, and so I dont know how to separate them. Maybe the social influence is so strong that it ends being much more important than biology. And gender identity, expression, etc. Are just new concepts without a clear scientific consensus.  In conclusion, I think there is enough evidence to at least doubt the traditional gender roles."
"People that are born hermaphrodite's are apart of a very very small percentage. Their gender is chosen at birth, and they are surgically worked on to fit that role, this is based on what they lean more towards, male or female. Trans people are trying to either be male or female. In the end it's always male and female, why the fuck is that so hard to understand, it's even in the definition. You create such simple minded bs statements that trick people into thinking you are onto it, but you really covered nothing of value."

"I like the video, but I disagree that people should be categorized as women when it comes to reproductive rights like abortion. It's an oversimplification that hurts vulnerable people. Not only women need health care to safely give birth or have an abortion, but health services often only cater to women and deny other people the services they need. The other way around, there are women, some not trans, that need their prostate checked. Defining activism around health services around certain genders doesn't really help."

"In response to 5:15:  You are confused. Breasts have nothing to do with defining biological sex. They are sex characteristics, physiological features that are used to recognize sex, they are in no way part of the definition. Literally no scientist on Earth thinks a female person becomes less female following a mastectomy. What is this strawman you're trying to build here?  Chromosomes determine sex. To say XY individuals are female is tautological; 'female' literally means 'has XY chromosomes' and absolutely nothing else. That is the only definition of that word.  This 'preconceived scheme' is part of those hard sciences you alluded to before, and the existence of intersex individuals does absolutely nothing to ablate this foundation, any more than the existence of mutations demonstrates that there is no such thing as 'species'. Science is not prescriptive, it is descriptive. Calling basic biology 'bad science' is ridiculous.  And you don't even need any of this bullshit for your actual point, that's the really silly part. The existence of biological sex and its validity doesn't detract from your arguments on gender.     In response to the argument about the value of gold/money: This is a perfect illustration of the establishment 'progressive' attitude: a profoundly conservative position that serves to enforce and perpetuate the very structures of oppression you claim to oppose.   Gold is worthless. Money is worthless. The worth of these objects is a lie that is forced on people by a system that uses these values to manipulate their behavior.  Just like gender.   The solution is not to create a hundred intermediary categories between 'man' and 'woman'. The solution is to stop thinking in those terms entirely. Reinforcing the notion that gender is 'real' and that it is normal and expected for individuals to internalize gendered understandings of themselves is deeply harmful."

I've been telling myself we're all confused and that's okay (as long as we're moving toward equality, I can handle some confusion.) But I love the idea of gender definitions being contextual and fluid. It feels better to say 'gender is a fluid social construct that needs to be viewed relative to the situation' than to just be like 'idk, pls stop making me think about this.'"

I thought it would be Poetic Justice. I thought about making a channel that shitlords shitlord and videos. There is always a bigger fish. Muhahaha  Also, I have absolutely no interest in bifurcation logical fallacy and I certainly I'm not going to argue over theoretical fluctuating fields of probability...  Science is not a game for people to win at. I refuse to play people's games of high school debate team bullshit.  I will tell you the same thing that I told the pathetic shitlord. Both of you are wielding theories and you are far closer to achieving a level of complexity in regards to your understanding that has a better chance of arriving at the truth...  I'm not going to get specific here but likely you have nailed certain aspects of this... no porno. I got to be specific or one of the Holocaust of the hot dog and the watermelons.  I'm still studying many aspects of reality and I'm not prepared to publish my theories in regards to 'human sexuality' quite yet....  I have most of it ironed out to a point just passed some of where you've gone with this. Bit of a difference skew... There is stratification.  I'm actually thinking about making a documentary about it because I don't think my thoughts on this topic or going to fit neatly into a timely YouTube video. A series perhaps... Reality is fucking complicated.  Regardless of how long I wait to publish my theories on this topic, it will still likely be part fact and part theoretical fluctuating field of probability... obviously should be changing all the time and as soon as we think we have it figured out it up and changes on its again or it's at least a step in that direction... likely it's diverging and taking steps in multiple directions... especially if a form of biology knows it's being observed and is aware of the presumptions of the Observer... another one of the failures of modern psychology. The failure to adapt to our state of constant transmutation.  Anyway, you are clearly quite brilliant and creative. Keep up the good work and remember that the more primitive phenotype expressions of biology don't come up with anything that is complicated enough to be true. The majority's opinions have no value. Even their theories, in most cases are only partially reasonable due to their logical fallacy braided with cognitive bias... I would say that the majority are only capable of sophistry at best. I mean, unless they're studying something very easily quantifiable and totally fucking obvious."

"Yeah, you're right, philosophers don't do anything for society... for example: -Aristotle: shape how modern logic works (logic, the thing you are failing to use). -Sir Isaac Newton: philosopher how's also known as one of the greatest scientists ever.

With your level of intelligence, you might already realized that thinkers are the ones that push the boundaries of human knowledge in ALL DISCIPLINES.

"You're completely misusing the Dawkins thought experiment you're referring to, in the most retarded way possible. It's really ironic how you're using science as a theme here, while having no understanding of the science you're referring to. Biological sex, and sexual maturity (what you would call the difference between a child, and a man, or woman,) are not the same as evolution, which is what the Dawkins example was referencing. Biological sex is a binary, taxonomical classifications are a spectrum. No matter how fucked up your sex organs are, you produce eggs, sperm, or sometimes, you produce neither, but you never produce another vessel of passing on genetic information besides eggs, or sperm. Evolution takes millions of years, developing an intersex condition happens during a child's development in the womb, in a single generation, they're not close to being the same things.  Also the term 'man' has various connotations, like 'woman,' if you're talking about how society views a person, sometimes people reach adulthood, without people seeing them as a (mentally,) mature man or woman, ever. On the other hand, if you're talking about a man, or woman, just in terms of the physical stage in life, there's a very clear line, it goes, newborn, infant, toddler, child, predolescent (slightly prior to, and during puberty,) adolescent (after puberty,) and then adulthood. The new, hippy dippy, retarded snowflake generation seems to think it's a good idea to keep pushing adulthood farther, and farther into people's old age. They view college age adults as children, and treat them as such, so they start acting as such, throwing tantrums about pronouns, for example. I'll call you a 'her,' or a 'she,' if that's what you want, and you pay me mutual respect, but I don't owe you a fucking thing, least of all being expected to remember all this zee, zir, zerself horseshit, because you want to play pretend at the age of 25."

"while i like this video, there is a total lack of discussion about the scientific research and forming consensus on gender and specifically how trans people fit in.  In particular, neurophysiological studies - namely MRI scans and autopsies, show that there is a section of the brain that is gendered and that trans people tend to have brains more similar to their identified gender rather than what they were assigned at birth.  additionally, there wasn't even a discussion on fetal development and how sex and gender are developed.    i do not prescribe to gender being socially created, as there is sufficient evidence and research to support that gender physically resides in the brain.  This also lends itself neatly to the current theory that gender dysphoria is caused by a mismatch in the physical gender of the brain, what it expects and how the body developed.  furthermore, this explanation of the gender residing in the brain explains how come cross sex hormone therapy (HRT) is so effective in treating gender dysphoria.  if gender were a social construct, then HRT would be ineffective and actually quite harmful.  i do appreciate the video, its information, and artistry."
"It somewhat confuses me that the term used for everything seems to be ''gender'', even when mostly talking about sex as in the physical body. How can a surgery reassign your gender? - Is it some kind of horror movie brain surgery? As was pointed out gender is not strictly binary and the distinctions have been more and more blurred in the last few decades. Imagine your average day presenting as your biological sex, you get up, shower, eat, go to work or whatever, speak to other people etc. Now imagine the same day, but with the body of the opposite sex. Did any of those 2 versions act in a transgendered way or were both just showing perfectly acceptable social behavior? If you are a very manly man the second version might be seen tomboyish or if you a very girly woman the second version might be seen as a bit of a sissy, but it is not like you wouldn't come across people that are like that normally.  It seems to me that the crux of the transgender issue is just wanting to have the body of the opposite sex. If humans were a species that could perform sequential hermaphroditism that would not be a problem, but we are not and we can just change some of the sexual dimorphisms with our current technology. If it was impossible to tell a transgender woman apart from a cis woman I dont think there would be all this drama about it. You can easily see that trend if you compare the reactions of the general public to young transgender women that pass reasonably well to people that transition in their 40s or 50s and often cannot pass at all."

"Evil pinko non-binary queer person here. Judith Butler also observed that sex is actually gender all the way down. What she means is that prevailing ways of organizing body parts and behaviors into 'male,' 'female,' or 'intersex' are actually cultural customs; growth hormones, body parts, and chromosomes may contribute to one's behavior and gender identity but do not produce straightforward effects or meanings in themselves. While Natalie/Contra hints at this perspective, I wish she would give it more attention. J.B. Preciado discussed how growth hormones were gendered in the first half of the 20th century, and Anne-Fausto Sterling has basically revealed the shoddiness of supposed gender or sexual differences in brain imagery. Differences in people exist and have some biological component to varying degrees; our ways of classifying them and the assumptions we tie to those classifications are artificial. I just worry that straight cis people are using science to contain and limit their own possibility of being attracted to multiple genders or exploring other gender identities and presentations."

"It's difficult for those brought up in a strict binary culture that identify as an aspect of that binary culture to recognize that there are more aspects than the two they were presented with.

Think of it as adaptations to our scientific understanding rather than social revolution"

"First of all, hardly any scientifically literate person sees sex or gender as a rigid binary and most people don't see either as an evenly distributed spectrum. In other words, there is a huge middle ground to be explored.¬†Both sex and gender represent a polarity, rather than a strict binary,¬†where the majority of people are either male or female and where the majority identify as man (masculine) or woman (feminine). That's because there really¬†is a¬†strong biological basis for gender identity or expression, refined by cultural norms. The middle ground of intersex & transgender (or gender queer) is real, but it's sparsely populated because¬†natural selection favors those who have the equipment to reproduce offspring. Our primate cousins don't have culturally defined gender roles, and they don't wear fedoras or wedding gowns, but they do exhibit some level of gendered behavior.¬†This video makes no attempt at understanding the interplay between biology & culture. Comparing the male/female polarity, having a sparsely populated middle ground, with the continuous spectrum of evolutionary transitions, is a very bad analogy."
"I have an argument. As somebody who is studying linguistics, if there are only two genders, than why do languages often include pronouns for more than two genders or none at all? Why can't it be a spectrum? Sex and gender aren't the same thing. They're trying to equate sex and gender, which is wrong. You might say, 'Well, in English, there are only to genders' in response to this. Well, languages change all the time and, with it, the rules within them."

However, most people do not object to classifying humans as bi-pedal creatures with two arms and five fingers on each hand, two eyes in their single head etc. despite the fact that people are surely born without limbs, with extra limbs, or in any combination of body parts which goes against what is typically labelled 'human.'"
"TBH I think you hit the nail on the head with using different definitions for different scenarios. The big issue with it is that people are arguing about sociology without understanding how sociology tends to work; almost EVERYTHING sociology looks at tends to have multiple possible definitions and ways they look at certain parts of society. That's how  sociology works. But a lot of people arguing over which definition of gender is 'right' don't understand that. So some people end up trying to argue that gender is a social construct while simultaneously ignoring what it means for something to be a social construct in the first place"
"Why is female sexuality always equated to submissiveness? As a cis woman, I don't relate to that at all, nor do I feel less feminine by not being that way.  If anything, I feel most feminine when I am on top because I view sexuality as a way of showing physical affection. I want to pleasure a man whom I care for."
"I was born with gender variant body and mind. In other words during embryonic phase of development my male bits failed to fully develop. Thus you have wonderful me. Mostly male partly female and that includes my brain.  Now I wish these body parts would stop failing, stop becoming malignant and stop dying off. But the doctors cut away and cut away this thing or that thing till there is nothing.  We who are gender variant never asked to born this way it?  It effects very aspect of our lives. This isn‚Äôt a alternative lifestyle, it is who we are.  They have a name for it, intersex."
"6:28 into the video and I realised (tell me I'm wrong if I am) but are you using a remix of the jenova theme from FFVII."
"honestly i'd pour hot milk all over you any day !!!"
"Good video, but there was one slight thing I didn't understand. On the 'genderbread' diagram, gender identity is described as 'how you, in your own head, define your gender, based on how you align with what you understand to be the options of gender.'  Isn't this kind of a nonsensical and subjective statement? It could relate to how much you correlate with gender roles and expectations, but isn't this toxic as it implies the more you stick to male gender roles for example, the more of a man you are? I feel like this is my problem with the concept of a socially constructed gender as a whole - what makes you decide what your identity is?"
"Your videos arouse me on an artistic level"
"PEPSI?!  That's it!  As an Atlantan, that is an intolerable level of degenerate queerness!  Unfollow, block!"
"FYI, man-made = made by humans not males   What I don't get is why does it matter what the fuck gender you are or referred to as,  it is a function of your chromosomes not who you are or what things you like?"
"At the most fundamental level we are all individuals with different thoughts, ideas and feelings. I am glad you understood. That is why we all have individual rights."
"So... the sex binary doesn‚Äôt exist because 0.25% of humans‚Äô chromosomes are combinations other than XX or XY? Got it.  Ergo... humans don‚Äôt have two eyes because some babies aren‚Äôt born with both or either eyes.  Peak wokeness. I‚Äôm vindicated from the rigidity of white male thinking."
"God fucking damnit, my like on this video seems to have disappeared. What the fuck is youtube's problem?"
"Okay I am very tired and very wound up and I did not need that jump scare at 2:33."
"May I pour hot milk over your face and vice versa?"
"__________@8:34 'I wanna know who i am inside...whether i'm a man, woman or something else.  I just want to know WHO i am, Doc!'   Man/woman/he/she etc. etc. have VERY little to do with 'WHO' you are.  They describe 'WHAT' you are!  Not 'who'.   You clearly have a hard time separating those two things.  This is not normal.  To answer your question... You are a male.  As to 'WHO' you are, 'that path is for your thoughts alone.'"
"Lagomorphic? That could be rabbit-ish, but not quite."
"being butch has nothing to do with being masculinity. It has more to do with opting out of preforming femmininity. Im nonbinary and my gender is largely just my butch identity but i defs hate men and do not want to be like them. anyways gender is so god damn nuanced im pretty sure no human language will ever describe it, and instead men will go extinct and we'll become a neural net of lesbianism thats has left behind our biological chains. join gay cyberspace today, its the natural way a society converges. (or maybe i just really hope it is, sort of a gaydar or praydar situation)"

"You are born with a penis, and our a vagina, our something in between   That is it  Society creates gender, by projecting rolepatterns on people   Anarchism rejects society, so anarchism rejects gender.    ( and now, go on, attack me, abuse me, violate me, scream at me, be 'anti fascist' towards me )"
"Damn it, some of my favourite videos of yours now say that the content is age-restricted.  I really think YouTube should make intellegent and artistic videos like yours more accessable.  I guess not everyone gets your humour (I do though üòä)."
"Bless this wholeeee thing especially for addressing the topic in a way that acknowledges the futility of the endlessly cyclical debate and also for the mood lighting which i love so much. 'Philosophy gets you to a cul de sac' is such an extremely refreshing motto that I think will bring me much comfort in the future."
"So gender is... whatever it is most convenient for us to hold at any given time? This amounts to saying that gender isn't really a thing at all.  But then how can we talk about 'women's/trans rights?' Since it seems women and trans people don't really exist. There are just people, each person an individual unique to themselves."

"What is that song at the end??"
"Anyone who wants to give you a final answer on the question of what your gender is fundamentally about or what its meaning is might want to look in a mirror. Now, clearly, if they are an MRA, there is a good chance that they will see a neckbeard in a Nazi uniform. That's okay. They see correctly.. for once.  If they are NOT an MRA though, they are still setting up the same basic idealization and subjugation based on gender. A couple miss-steps and they are attacking the non-conforming members among their own or picking out other traits."
"'What am I inside, what do I make of this emptyness?' And this is why anyone who actually starts to put values into this empty slot, associated with otherwise-meaningless traits, is already sitting atop a mountain of bad ideas. Because for every individual who seeks to confirm that their identity defines who they are allowed to be, there is someone out there who will sell them it for the price of doing their political bidding. Regardless of your position right or left, fascistic ideals are much closer than you think."
"The problem with genderbread is that it is in fact institutionalizing gender roles."

"What I find funny is, That some people on the alt right, would probably think that. This Watermelon in the video is biologically female because it has a vagina. Because that's just how rigid and narrow-minded some of their logic is when it comes to biology."

"Very artistic, I loved the ending, lovely music. I think philosophers are doing an enormous amount for society, everything everyone thinks can be traced back to a philosopher, for the most part anyway. You studied philosophy, and that plays a big part in the educated way you express your ideas. Did you look much at the arguments for God's existence?"
"where are the dabs tho"
"I admit the stuff with the watermelon grossed me out. Part of it being I just wince when I see people screw with things I think of as food. But in any reason, I just wanted to say so. One reason I like this channel so much is that it is very approachable. But I admit some of your new stuff dips too much into weird avant garde art stuff. It's kinda fun but I feel it may be a bit alienating to some people in the audience. And when the objective of the videos are to educate as well as entertain there is more of a reason to try and be approachable."
"Although there are points I respectfully disagree with, I understand and acknowledge your point of view and I have to say your videos are quite enjoyable. You are very well spoken and you actually attempt to send your message, keep doing this kind of things it's actually kinda funny"
"You don't even know what gender is because the sex of your brain matches the sex of your body. You're cis.  You conflate gender with gender expression and gender roles. Gender is merely the sex of the brain, which is only determined by the presence or lack of dysphoria for ones sexed body characteristics and is independent of gender roles or expression."
"Well made video and love the rocky horror reference, shame that your argument about there being more than two sexes falls flat. You assume that there exist a sex called intersex but provide no evidence to why that is, those people account less than 2 percent of the world's population so you'd need some strong arguments on why it isn't a birth defect.  Also if you agree that there are two sexes but infinite number of genders that means that calling a trans woman a male or a trans man female is perfectly accurate since the terms 'female' and 'male' refer specifically to sex not gender."
"In response to the rigidity of gender and the Richard Dawkins reference:   You're right , MASCULINITY  ( traits we consider masculine ) , and FEMININITY ( traits we consider feminine) , exist on a spectrum, however biological sex doesn't, there is only one thing that determines whether you are a girl or a boy, chromosomes.   The Richard Dawkins reference does not prove your point because he is referring to evolution and species, not biological sex. Sex doesn't change or morph through evolution, the species as a whole does, there will still be a clearly definable male and female , as is needed to reproduce and keep the species alive, no where along this timeline will a boy suddenly change into a girl, or vice versa.   While yes, some guys are more ' girly ' or feminine, this does no change the biological truth that he is a boy, even if he despises this fact, he is still by definition a boy.   If we are to disregard the definition of sex and say that someone is a girl simply because they feel like it ( emotion does not portray reality ) , or because they try to look or act like it ( appearance does not reflect reality ). Then we are openly disregarding logic in favor of what makes us feel better, or in favor of how we feel reality should be."

"That hair is amazing."
"how can you talk about chromosome and completely neglect to mention that being male is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome period even if you're XY and don't have the SRN gene active (just for the record that means they develop like a biological female but biologically speaking they are male). next they are anomalies because either the cells didn't divide correctly aka an extra chromosome is present or one is missing like Turner syndrome like XO. next certain chromosomal anomalies don't do anything XO and XXX still developed like normal biologically females. in  rare situation the X chromosome will have a mutation and gain the SRN gene thus the biological women develops a fully functioning male reproduction system. XYY and XYYY develop like a typical male...and you're also ignoring how extremely rare these conditions are."
"What the Fuck did I just watch"
"While I agree with your conclusion, the reasoning you use to dismiss the chromosome argument is faulty. Yes, there are arrangements other than XX and XY but these are genetic disorders that have as much to do with gender expression as Down Syndrome.  The point you're arguing against is that chromosomes are entirely responsible for determining your body plan, including all primary and secondary sexual characteristics, and you're not addressing that by pointing out genetic disorders. I wish my gender was a choice - I've always wanted to be a woman. But it's not, and pretending otherwise is just hiding from reality."

"This is the first video about gender I've ever watched that didn't make me want to tip a vending machine onto myself."
"im confused as to what your point is. i mean are you trying to use evolution to prove that gender isn't the same as sex? if so you are failing. gender is not the same as gender identity. how you feel within your psyche is not gender. gender is biological not psychological. this channel has to be a joke."
"what examination? who/what is this....u r confusado!!!!"

"i love the wig"
"What a confused ugly bitch."
"I feel dumber for watching this. This is a fantastic example of why the soft sciences are not respected by hard ones. The application of the scientific method is not respected at all. And all arguments presented dont even account for statistical measure here, something highly respected in science, especially biology. In most biological measures, you can accept the majority of populations of events as the norm and anything outside of this as abnormal, or a variable. So yes biology is fluid, be it has statistic majority for classification (which most people in this thread and Contra would know if they remembered this simple stuff from early high school). This whole video neglects statistics, just saying there is variance. No one denies the variance, but gender in this case is measured on majority which from when i last checked, was over 90% of populations (for all anomalies, including sexual preference).   If we applied this same kind of logic to say medical science, another fluid biology, people would be dying. We apply what we know in the majority of cases and research those that are different so they are protected from the statistical majority treatments. These are abnormal. And trying to deconstruct English, or common language to suit, really fucks up society, because if we decide language is that fluid, no one will know what anyone means because everyone will start to make up their own shit. And to whoever mentioned the platypus, it has its own classification you muppet, it is called a monotreme. It is a sub category of mammal."
"As a somewhat rigid, far left trans woman, I find myself agreeing with you most of the time, with a few minor nitpicks once in a blue moon. You can bridge a gap that I think most of us can't swallow to do (or lack the ability to at the very least), and at some points I find myself unsure of whether to agree or disagree, but in the end a lot of it is choice in rhetoric. I think the videos you make are great things, and you are much better at bringing people over to a more left point of view than someone like myself could. I've gone on a bit about not a whole lot, but mostly I just wanted to say keep up the good work. Your videos are hilarious and it's good to see somebody out there talking about gender and other feminist issues in a way that accessible to everyone. Also, ya gorgeous."
"Every term is a simplification of reality - that's one of the major functions of language. Why making up new transgender pronouns/categories, if categories are abstractions of something not existing anyway? Seems like people want to replace one mistake with another. 'Black' and 'White' (people) are abstractions too, does it mean we need 10 new 'shades in between' to be really tolerant about everybody?"
"'a 10yo is a boy, a 30yo is a man' Challenge accepted, I'm going to grow to 30 and still be the fucking worst manchild ever, fucking watch me!"
"Just discovered this channel  Its absolutely amazing"
"I think the jury's still out on whether you can find a biological explanation for gender. Obviously you're not going to find something in the brain that says 'man' or 'woman', but I can't help but wonder if we couldn't find a way the brain functions that makes it so susceptible to gendering the world. Obviously this firm categorization thing is a contributor, but the idea that it's just to be left to the realm of the social seems to be a problem if you think about the sheer amount of gender across like every society. Obviously those with more than 2 have advanced to a deeper deconstructionist level on gender, but they still find something similar in carving up the performative sphere. I don't know, I have my biases as a syntactician (read: tendency towards neoplatonist ideas)"
"So... learning about this from the antifeminist crowd probably waa not a great idea after all. lol  Very informative. Mind changing; really."
"... I'm more confused that I was before. Can I just say I don't give a shit about gender and let people do whatever the fuck they want to do and call them whatever they want to be called? I mean, if you identify as an attack helicopter and wear a spinning hat and walk around with missile pods tucked under your arms it's really no inconvenience to me to call you Chopper."
"I wonder if suddenly discovering synth-wave music is why this showed up in my recommended.   btw You look damn good in that wig."
"Look bud, you probably just didn't get exposed to enough testosterone in utero. Not hard to explain. I think that we can VERY EASILY observe that the vast majority of the population is definitely male or female. It's really much the same as other animals in that regard. Not tough.  Go to a frigate bird colony on some forgotten rocky island and see how many mating pairs can't be identified as composed of strict genders. It's, you know, kinda required in order to continue the species."
"Informative AND horrifying. subbed."
"I wonder where they get their wigs."
"There are individuals with XXY, XYY, weird genitals etc., but does the existence of mules mean that no meaningful distinction between horses and donkeys can be made?  Behaviour can't be inspected in a test tube, but how on earth does it follow that social science is the only way to ascertain the causes of behavioural differences? The causal relationship between physiology (hormones, neurotransmittors etc.) and behaviour is remarkably well established. Furthermore, group differences in personality between males and females are consistent across all cultures and the species that most resemble us.  XOXO"
"Well, the first 6 minutes are entirely irrelevant. Nobody denies that there are exceptional circumstances like intersex people. That has nothing to do the 99.9% of women who possess all of the properties you list. Moreover, the part about evolution doesn't work. It's analogous to your point about the classification of children and adults; not with biological sex. Non-bunnies clearly lead to bunnies. A thirty-year-old is clearly an adult. People 'don't' slowly naturally transition into what's clearly a different sex."

"'Social Sciences' do not follow Scientific Method and thus are not Sciences. That's really all the criticism needed to shred this double-think nonsense."
"My question to trans people is why do they need to fit into a binary that doesn't fully define them? Why are they not fighting to be accepted in their uniqueness and craft a social space for themselves that is neither male nor female. Radical feminists have a right to female only spaces. Why do trans people want to be in those spaces and not ones that are  uniquely trans?"
"Sure there are intersex people, but this is caused by disease. I  think most people arguing against a spectrum are talking about people who say they are a different or fluid gender despite nothing physically wrong with them."
"Are you really this stupid or a troll?"
"some dumb idiot still can't figure biology out, figures for a femtard... they can't do anything right"
"These people are the definition of give an inch take a mile...We shouldve never started calling trans people by their preferred pronoun... I hate to say that but i mean cmon, i cant find one person in my area that WONT call you what you want to be called because they think its wrong or what ever... now i know those people exist that will just say fuck you your a boy get over it, but you keep just slamming home that we are all full of shit, and now you want to just absolutely ignore science and say fuck all. Its ridiculous, we gave you what you originally wanted and now you want more, more, MORE."

"If I may add to the conversation, I'd like to revisit the chair idea. Those philosophers you mention (and by 'philosophers,' I assume you mean Plato) have a theory about chairs, or more generally, the theory of forms. According to this theory, Plato says no chair is a true chair. Rather, all things we call 'chair,' all the things we recognize as chairs, are just imitations of the perfect chair, with varying degrees of 'chairness.' So a chair you sit at the dining table with might be 95% chair, thus earning the title 'chair.'  With that in mind, let's examine gender. In the form 'woman,' there are varying degrees of womanness. So, someone with xx chromosomes, but no other obviously womanly characteristics, they might be 20% female. Assuming their other characteristics are male sex organs and secondary sex characteristics, they'd be 80% male and therefore considered a man. Conversely, a trans woman with male sex organs, xy chromosomes, no functioning gonads, and female secondary sex characteristics may be considered 60% on the womanness scale, thus earning the title 'woman.'"
"Ffs, stop using intersex disorders as proof of a third sex. They have no bearing on the biological dichotomy of the sex binary. Furthermore, the majority of intersex expressions are best with severe physiological deficits.   One wouldn't justify some other sort of genetic birth disorder as part of the norm, so why do it here?"
"Why are you trying to use biology to push your gender politics agenda? Please stop. First Bill Nye and now this. I don't know how much more I can take of this before humanity declares itself screwed."
"What you seem to fail to understand is just because a binary isn't perfect, it doesn't make it a spectrum. It is just a binary in a world where things aren't perfect."

"Sorry but you're fundamentally wrong.  The determining genetic marker for male and female is the Y chromosome.  So even if you look at the rare cases of genetic anomalies, XXY is still male because it has the Y.  As for the evolution of species, once again there are genetic determiners that separate species.  Even one from it's ancestor.  One trait is that of reproduction.  The evolved species can no longer produce off spring when mating with the previous one.  To use your own example, the rabbit can not have offspring with the chicks because the two are too far genetically removed from each other.  The notion of gender being a social construct is absolutely absurd.  Such people have clearly never heard of the term 'subculture'.  Examples of which are Jock, Punk, Emo, Goth, etc.  These are not genders but when people talk about the 'social construct of gender' and describe what it means to be a particular gender, it's obvious that these people are conflating gender with subculture."
"only 2 gender exist. if you are anything else, you are a genetic abnormality, a freak, a mutant, a reject, that one chip in the bag that's fucked up beyond the point of eating. if you can find a 3rd gender ( that actually helps in ANY way with reproduction, then I'll applaud you ) otherwise, I'm just gonna assume you are a defective piece of chromosomal garbage. do the whole race a favor and drink some bleach before your defective shit fucks up the gene pool further."
"How more stupid can you be?"
"Funny video and you've said some interesting things. This is the first video I've ever watched of you and I actually kinda like it. But as for trans people, I wanna clarify something. Nobody's claiming ONLY chromosomes dictate gender (well, maybe some morons do but.. y'know. There are also people who think the earth is flat) all the things you listed, genitals, hormones etc. dictate it and we can all agree on that. The fact that trans people may choose to change some of those things and artificially change their genitals or take hormones doesn't change the fact that they were *born* with all the characteristics of a certain sex. And Intersex people, with all due respect, are a tiny anomaly and can not be considered a third sex, providing one exception to the rule doesn't disprove the rule.  Sorry for the ramble. I still liked the vid and took a lot form it :)"
"You're not using reality, you're just using irrelevant examples to push your everyone is special agenda. People are diverse, the fact that some people dont conform to something their sex usually does doesn't make them a new gender, a boy who likes barby isn't a new gender nor a girl who likes transformers action figures."
"I hate you."
"So you saying that if someone changes their body to look like the other sex they are the other sex? that is bs. Also about the intersex people they are people with severe genetical defects , are a minority and generally are infertile."
"Its called an abnormality and its rare. The majority of people involved in this fad dont actually have this abnormality.  Not anything you can base your argument on and say its a spectrum or whatever."
"gender comes from the greek genus which can mean race,stock,kind,order and inparticular (male and female) PIE root of genus (ie the protolanguage that dates back to 3500bce) is gene which means give birth, beget.lets look at that so give birth is obviously the female roll in reproduction, beget- '(especially for a male parent) to procreat or generate male offspring'. i dont know about you but the word gender in its very origin as far back as we can date it seems to reffer to defining or grouping people based on reproductive characteristics not on how feminin or masculin they feel, seems like the word gender is based on biological reproductive roles not social construct if you are a feminin male your gender isn't technically female nore is your sex, you are just that a feminine male because the intended purpose of your genitals is the reproductive roll of a male. dont get the two confused sure masculinity and femininity are on a spectrum because masculinity is just (in general male traits behaviour and atributes and is not at all an absolute) same goes for femininity and and the odd female being an acception to the atrbutes you can in general deffine as characteristics typically atributed to the female sex. but as for gender looking at its very origin it becomes clear, its root is cut and dry it relates to the 2 biological sexes required for procreation and the particular one an individual falls in to based on well the fact that they are equipt to for the male roll in reproduction or the female roll in reproduction. now does this mean if you are unable to have kids you aren't a gender? no because a deffective spade is a spade none the less. as for intersex people they are a defect and dont really fit into the equasion of reproduction (which is after all the very point of sex and gender in the first place and without it the concept is well none existant) but ok lets say i give leniency and say ok there is room for a third gender for hermaphrodites which again isn't a gender not to be cruel just tecnically isn't how exactly is that an argument for a male who expresses more feminine trates then masculine trates a female? it doesn't because again thats irralivent to the persons biological reproductive roll and as we just assest thats the only thing ralavent when discussing what is male and what is female because thats the point of male and female to beggin with. this isn't to shit on anyone by the way if you are a male that wants to live out the life of a female because thats who you are then the best of luck to you or if you are a female that wants to live out the life that resembals being a male because you are more masculine then thats fine there are outlyers and not everyone fits in the general rule and i wish you all the best i really do...but that said if you are going to try change what words mean or there intended purpose to suit your feelings over the fact then i am going to call you out on it, and even if the deffinition has changed the reality the word depicts in origin is still a reality even if you ignore it, and ignoring somthing that fundamental about who and what you are is more often then not counter productive to yourself and wellbeing."
"Okay, so let's start off with basics.  Biological sex all comes down to which gamete you produce.  Nothing more.  Now there is a slight argument about individuals who genetically can't produce either gamete, but even these are NOT a new sex as they don't produce a gamete.  A best they are a non-sex, but we don't do that in biology, you just get tossed into the nearest category because it is impractical to create a new one and unnecessary.  Which leads us to the next point, sex is sometimes used loosely on those secondary (emphasis on secondary) sex characteristics to define a category.  Think the Olympics.  But here the issue is entirely practical.  Now only are a good number of the intersex individual very closely aligned with one of the existing male/female categories to the point of it being useless to distinguish them (and often quite insulting to those individuals btw), but the few that aren't are predominantly suffering from serious health issues to the point they can't even compete practically, and we're already starting with a number generally sub 1% of the population area.  So with those extra issues in play, there is no practical purpose is defining a 3rd or 4th pseudo sex category as there is simply too few people to take advantage of it.  Now, the second situation could at least in theory want to us definite a new psuedo sex under certain circumstances, but I've yet to encounter ANY practical situation that exists for such.  The only real place that is matters, medically, the already will treat these individuals as... well individuals, not their sex."

"XX = Female XY = Male XXY / XXX / XYY / YYY = Extremely rare disability  That's it. Everything else is in your mind. It's a fetish, a preference, a fantasy. Not anything science has to account for. Same as for Religion, same as for imaginary friends, same as for Dungeons & Dragons bestiary."

"Jeez, Bearing fans are dumb."
"Here we have an example of when someone who has no clue about what they are talkiHow about this you stick with the chicks with dicks stuff, and you leave English to English majors. English (as well as every language) is fluid it adapts to the society, one word for something that isn't completely a rabbit is a Jackalope. If something that isn't quite a rabbit exists a word will be made for it like what happened with the Liger and platypus. I hate it when people try and talk about language when they don't understand it. I would need to write a book to deal with all the other misconceptions and completely unscientific claims being made, so I'll say this there are men, women, and the abnormalities that confirm to one or the other, your mental state has nothing to do with your sex."
"I disagree"
"No, dimwit... Any other combinations besides XX and XY is either detrimental or fatal. If a child is born and survives possess two of the, all the way through, the then-child turn adult have one functioning systems out of two. If and only if one individual can impregnate a woman and bear a child, we may have an intersex individual but as far as we know... we don't"
"Problem is with your chromosomes argument is that somebody with XYY is still male. They still grow up male, can produce sperm and father children. They often have no idea that they are different from XY. Why classify them as intersex? They are not a new sex, they are not a third sex. They are still quintessentially male. Thats why we still rely on the ever reliable presence of a Y chromosome. That will always hold true.  Except in the case of AIS, where the Y chromosome isn't activated or doesn't respond properly so they never get the hormones needed to become male. They develop as a female. These people are genetically male but pragmatically female. They produce ovaries and all female characteristics, they can give birth, and many don't know they have the condition. Technically they are male but not practically. Thing is though, this occurs in less than 1 in 20,000 births, so only a couple of thousand people in the entire world have this. But they live their lives as female without ever needing intersex labels or being transgender. So we rightfully call them an outlier, and not some new rule where chromosomes don't matter.   We can in that scenario actually identify what went wrong and how it went wrong. Its a birth defect or genetic defect. Thats not to say the individual is less of a person but something abnormal happened during their development in the womb. But the human body still adjusts trying to fit to the male/female dichotomy. Why do you think somebody born X still is fundamentally female? Sure, they can't reproduce and they have physical deformities, but their body and their mothers body still used what DNA it had to try and create a female. There is therefore no need to define them as a new sex.  When it comes to biological sex, its all to do with reproduction. You need two individuals to reproduce, and it so happens in most that each serves a different role, one brings eggs, the other brings sperm. Eggs cannot fertilize eggs, and sperm cannot with sperm either. So anybody who brings sperm, or attempts to bring sperm (whether or not that sperm is fertile or can be produced at all by the body is irrelevant) because they have the machinery built for it, they are all part of the same group. If they cannot breed with each other, why call them different sexes? Especially if they cannot breed at all. But if they can breed with somebody who has eggs, does it matter how different ones eggs might be from anothers?  Consider this thought experiment. I state we have two biological sexes, for simplicity - 1 and 2. 1 can't breed with 1, but 1 can breed with 2. You propose there are sexes 1 through 10. But sexes 1-4 cannot breed with another 1-4. Sexes 5-9 cannot breed with another 5-9. But any of sexes 1-4 can breed with any 5-9. And 10 (or lets say 10 and beyond) cannot breed with anybody. Why are we classifying them so differently when fundamentally 1-4 are just one group? Its like saying a Holden is a different type of vehicle from a Honda. Sure, they have cosmetic differences, and one might have a different engine than the other. But both are still cars, and not trucks. So when talking about vehicle-ness, they are still the same category, they may differ within that group but they are still part of the same group."
"I usually don't bother, but this is the dumbest shit I've ever heard.  You're not even using equivalent comparisons, I would make an extreme comparison to illustrate my point but I can't think of anything more ridiculous then your own examples."
"You slept through the part in biology class where they explained what a species is, didn't you? There is a very scientific definition of what is and is not biologically a member of a given species. It's actually rather simple. Fun fact, mental defectives like you fail that test for inclusion in the human species."
"You claim that some people (Read: One in several thousand AT BEST) are born with chromosomal and/or reproductive abnormalities, and that every one of them constitute their own sex instead of simply a birth defect. Even assuming that this is true (Which it's not), what does this have to do with transsexuals who aren't born with these defects, yet still 'identify' as transsexual anyways? I assume you weren't born with three X chromosomes or anything, so where's your justification? How does someone else's health abnormality dictate your 'identity'? Please let me know, this makes no sense to me."
"I just wanted to say that you might want to compare a spectrum with the word discrete rather than the word binary. Though something that is binary is discrete, something that is discrete is not necessarily binary. For instance, the way we use nouns is discrete (we say something is a rabbit or is a duck, but there is no continuum of nouns between these two values), but is not binary (there are more than two possible values for nouns)."
"ooh look, another Transtrender trash talking binery!"
"FUCKING IDIOT!!!"
"False equivalency - the distinction between 'boy' and 'man' is one of necessity and rights - you cannot evaluate each person individually, and say 'John is a man at age 16, but Tim is a man at age 14', so we establish legal definitions.  Sex is not the same.  First, we have to remove from our discussion those with birth defects.  Put simply, if you produce sperm, you are male, and if you produce eggs, you are female."
"How come theneedledrop didn't get a credit for being in this video?"
"No dude, gender is defined by chromosomes; XX | XY. Any other combination is actually an anomaly, which is why it is so rare to occurs. The secondary characteristics you describe at 4:18 happens naturally because of our chromosomes. The secondary characteristics described at 4:36 (transwoman) are artificial, they don't happen naturally because transwomen are actually men. The thing is, if we can't naturally change our gender in a spectrum, then it means that gender spectrum does not exist in humans."
"i respectfully disagree"
"So a model that has an accuracy rate of 94% in determining biological sex and sexual orientation, that accounts for variables (such as birth defects), 'isn't reflective of reality'?  Instead let's follow yours with no predictive model. I don't think you understand 'reality'.  If your theory is correct, than you should be capable of making quantifiable predictions.  Much like determining the geographic location of a particular undiscovered fossil by making a prediction, going to said location and finding said undiscovered fossil, that looks exactly how the predictive model showed it would look.  Can you predict biological birth defects with any accuracy? Can you determin the exact gender identity, sexual orientation, and gender signifiers of a particular zygote using only your proposed model?"
"Okay, so we need 19 different sexes so we don't miss out on labeling genetic abnormalities that happen in less that one in a thousand births (would equate to less than 0.1%) even when most of them turn out to be phaenotypical males when a Y chromosome is involved because it's genetic expression is dominant? That's what good science looks like? I can understand now why you are not a scientist.  And guess what, there are already names for it as you can simply call them Klinefelters, Turners, Swyers etc."
"Your point about evolution of species being gradual is all nice and good except that it has fuck all to do with biological sex. The fact that certain traits evolve that way doesn't mean every single trait we measure is on a spectrum. Nature has not created a spectrum of biological sex. Dichotomy does exist in nature.   And actually there is a distinct period where a boy transitions into a man. It's called puberty and is marked by a number of distinct measurable events."
"Nice colours, nice melon, still wrong."
"Going to the peep argument about rabbits and their development over time - the reason they would look/behave differently is because of Darwinism. It was crucial to their survival to adapt into the bunnies they are today. It is impossible to relate that to gender. Gender is a mentality that has awful suicide rates, over 40% last time I checked. If you want to relate gender to Darwinism, you have to state what it is they are adapting to in order to avoid dying, as well as stating why the people who are not adapting are dying out. Neither of which are plausible arguments in my opinion  I feel like that is a perfectly reasonable statement. But if I am misunderstanding anything, I am open to debate."
"Lol no, you are retarded. There are men women and then a very tiny amount of people with rare birth defects."

"you're all over the place with this, you keep conflating gender and biological sense and grossly misunderstand the Richard Dawkins Rabbit thing- its an example to show how evolution works, not gender.   Also lol 'masculine hard sciences and feminine soft social sciences' whats with this assertion of gendered qualities to absolutely everything.... the regular sciences are not 'masculine, hard', they are *strict*. social sciences are lenient, not 'feminine'. You need to stop applying your preconceived notions about sex and gender to absolutely fucking everything -_-"

"Ok so assuming there are more than two sex categories, what purpose do these other sex categories serve? I'm all for people to identify with whatever they choose, but that is only for the purpose of making people feel true to themselves/psychological wellbeing, not for any specific reproductive purpose."
"Cool sophistry, bro."
"ok you failed to mention the most important part of labelling a biological sex. does said human produce eggs, or sperm? and don't try the 'well what about people who can't' nonsense that's called a defect and it's tragic but all it means is they are SUPPOSED to produce sperm or an egg and their reproductive system isn't working. so now knowing this, please try and prove the 'binary' for sex not gender (two different things now btw don't know where you've been) is just some bullshit. lol I could rip into all your points but I'd rather hear why you neglected the biggest determining factor of biological sex."
"I completely disagree, but you present your argument in a thoughtful way and I like the production value on your video. Nice effort."
"Your boy/man analog is bullshit. The biological dividing line is when the balls drop and they can successfully reproduce."
"Fuck, but this is like watching a large box in sparkly wrapping paper being unfolded to contain nothing but hot air and a little bit of bullshit."
"The problem with using the Richard Dawkins thought experiment for this is that every creature in that line of his experiment is able to functionally reproduce. All nonfunctional aberrations are not able to pass on their genes. In a dimorphic system if you do not bring one side or the other to the table you are a genetic dead end and not part of that line of non-rabbits to rabbits you liked to reference. I will grant you that gender expression has infinite forms, however until one is successfully passing on their genes with either no partners or creates a functional organism that can successfully pass on the trait of reproducing with 3 chromosomes, that it remains a dimorphic system. I am open to discussion on the matter though, I don't want to come across as my way or the highway. I just don't see the logic when the factors that are required for breaking outside of the dimorphic system aren't there."
"It's not XX vs. XY. Rather, it's:  Has Y chromosome(s) - male. Has no Y chromosome(s) - female."
"Gender explained... with evolution... without hundreds of generations dividing them... There are hundreds of generations between man and woman? I think I need a better comparison..."
"I will say this, even though I disagree with most of the points you've made Contra, you do at least go about making them in a mostly logical fashion. For that alone, I respect you far more than those normally making these points. Bonus points for stilling bringing jokes to the subject too."
"Well this is both wrong and insane. Not a good combo."
"What (if any) difference is there between 'sex' and 'gender'? Depending on your answer I have a follow-up question..."
"I like how it all sounds reasonable, as we're led into: _Call Me Xir Or You Will End Up Fired, Fined, Possibly Homeless Or Even Locked Up_ Leftist Control Freaks lack the ability to play just _one_ move ahead. Everything is about how _they_ feel, right now."
"Hey fella this vid is hose-shit."
"The reason we observe irregular chromosomal matches, which you use to present to reinforce your claim for biological intersex, is not because there are other biological sex classifications, but because statistical variance. Whenever you have a system with large-quantity variables, you're going to have values which deviate from your cluster grouping, and the occurrence of that will be statistically significant. Or in short, mistakes happen."
"Wow more crazy deluded pseudo science! Listen up, if is wasn't for your female mother and your male father YOU would never have been born! It is that simple! Eons of evolution still would mean that it took a female And a male to create an offspring be it human, a snake, a rabbit, a bird, or whatever. The female egg must be fertilized by a male! Jesus Christ how fucjpked up are people to not know this! There is and never has been any other way to continue on reproduction! Even in a test tube you need a female egg and a male sperm!"
"There are only 2 sexes having mental disorder or birth defect isn't a new sex nor is it a new gender either and trying to use exeption to make a rule is fallacious."
"There are so many genders we cannot deny their multiplicity. A whole two of them :)"
"Gender/sex and species don't mean the same thing? What's there to compare?"
"Are we talking about gender or biological sex?"
"The way that biology actually works *is that* penis verses vagina *is* a binary in all reproductively viable animals including humans and *is* assigned at the point of conception based on which specific sperm fertilizes the egg - it is called biological sex.  Biological sex *is* a binary in all normal humans based on XX=vagina=biological female verses XY=penis=biological male.  You confusing that issue does not change biology or that binary. Now if you wanted just to talk about gender you should have left out all the _'penis verses vagina'_  stuff which contradicts what ever non-binary points you want to try and make."
"How is this still a ongoing debate? Gender (personal identity) is whatever you like, Sex (means of reproduction) is binary, Sexuality (preferences) is mostly hardwired (or conversion therapy would be legit) but we still have a choice to act on it, ignoring it, or exploring. This is just more insisting something is a problem when it's not."
"What is wrong with you people?  There are 2 genders, male and female.  Stop confusing that with your fucked up sexual fantasies."
"Bearing did a good job in my opinion debunking some of your arguments. You should reach him for a debate."
"Thats all good but the vast majority of people can be classified as male or female by numerous traits.  You failed to present a compelling argument against the binary.  Thats why you spend so much time on language and not biology."
"Atypical chromosomal types are just that, atypical.  They are rare and, in most cases, they are deformed and cannot reproduce.  Even if they can reproduce, they are still either male or female, but their sex organs and characteristics are out of line with the normal.  We are a binary species based around sperm and egg.  Mistakes of nature aren't 'alternatives'; they are mistakes.  -_-"
"Bro, you lost the moment you tried to deny 'naturalism' - it is, by definition, natural.  You can't exist outside of nature."
"Some people over think things"
"Gender is not biological at all, it's socially constructed that is imposed on individuals based on sex. From then on you are socialized to fit gender. No one can feel male or female in their mind because we have clean slate minds. We should just get rid of gender but in medicine and in law we should recognize sex. There's still sex based oppression. If a woman has a vagina in the Massai culture she will experience FGM because of misogyny. She can't protest it and say that she's really male because she has a vagina."
"Im very left on the social gender construct fluidity, however biological sex is defined the chromosomal mating potential to either receive genetic variation for offspring (female) or to give it (male). DNA mutations that cause infertility have nothing to do with the chromosomal potential. Any person that is intersex would still have the same potential as all intersex variation containing a Y chromosome would always have the potential to give genetic variation for offspring and lack the biology to receive it (not meaning ovaries but the actual egg needed for conception). All the intersex variations that lack a Y chromosome have the chromosomal potential to conceive."
"if knowing what 'gender' is, is a philosophical question that can never really be answered, then is it really very useful to use gender as part of your identity? because I think that's where a lot of misunderstandings come up - each person who says they identify with a gender means something different by that statement, so we're not even speaking the same language."
"I'd like to preface what I'm about to say with this: I'm not trying to speak solely to non binary or other individuals with  non traditional genders, nor am I speaking solely to trans individuals, or solely to cis individuals. I don't understand why gender is thing. Like at all. I appreciate the biological aspects, as well as the fact sex gender are separate, even if intertwined to a  extent. At the heart of it, my question boils down to 'What is a man?' besides a miserable little pile of secrets, of course. What does it mean to be a man, or a woman, or something else entirely? What purpose do those labels serve? I mean, I generally use masculine pronouns and identify as male, but that's only because I'm 6'2', broad shouldered and look good with a beard. But those are just antiquated traditional characteristics. I don't see what purpose they serve in our society and I really want to know what other people see in them."

"For someone who has become so obsessed with your channel that I did a 5 hour binge and watched it well into the early hours, falling  asleep with it on autoplay at 3am... I can honestly say that it made for interesting nightmares and i feel like ive been given a series of shocks, been on an acid trip...maybe partially due to the pschadelic music(?) or maybe a combination of both that and the intermittent LOUD SHRIEkING noises and beeps reminiscent of an emergency ward. I'm not sure whether the sound volumes are even. Could just be that. Hope my backhanded compliment was as interesting as learning finally in more depth about Gender from someone who is fair and open minded unlike the alt right trolls on youtube who have a monopoly on the subject. Now that ive been woken UP due to all the sound effects I was able to rewatch it properly, and can see the correlation to what I was listening to and being in some hospital room with pink and purple lights being chopped up by a nurse with a purple wig shrieking lol No seriously... I always thought gender was a social construct as opposed to biological sex...but had an 'aha' moment in particular when you placed that picture of a medieval dude who had a wig on not dissimilar to yours. Brainwashing will continue."

"How can gender be relevant when human life is devoid of meaning?"
"This video is very informative. However, could you revisit your first example in How to Think about Dawkins' rabbits. I understand you were trying to illustrate a spectrum‚Äã of rabbitness with the sexual and gender spectrum, but I find that this analogy fails to make that connection, especially with the up coming point you made about natural science and sex. Dawkins was illustrating to the layperson the problems with biological species definitions and speciation in general. I would rather recommend you say, 'similar to how biology has an issue with classifying biological species, biological sex is far more complex than the traditional XX-XY binary.' Otherwise, good job on this witty and well edited video!"
"Interesting video. I wondered if you agreed with the radical feminist stance on gender that 'feminity' is a patriarchal structure to hold women down in society?"
"there are only 2 gender period."
"i'm a little hesitant to use the idea that biology is why women are oppressed. i think biology is definetly used as a tactic, but its not the reason. it does make sense that people would automatically use that defintion for issues like abortion, but then that just shits of transgender feminists. the purpose of the anti abortion movement is misogyny, but that doesnt affect all women, even though its trying to."
"So binary sex is not real because abnormalities exist? So there is no longer such a thing as a statistical normal? What would be the point of making a spectrum when it's such a small percentage that don't fall into the binary and if they don't it's almost entirely a medical reason. That is the point of Sex vs Gender right? One is what your born with, so no medical confusion happens and Gender for what you identify with? So wouldn't making sex a spectrum sort of defeat the purpose, since medically if you don't fit the binary you almost certainly have to make a note on it on medical forms? Educate me if I'm missing something, this is confusing."
"XY or XX. Nothing more. Stop the bullshit"

"intersex people are born with special conditions, and swyer syndrome is just that! a syndrome, not a new gender."
"Well, whether we can create a working definition of 'biological sex' doesn't seem to discredit the idea that sexual reproduction in humans only has two functional roles. Which is what 'Biological Sex' it is describing. There are people who are inter-sexed or who have chromosomal disorders, but I don't know of any cases where a human has been a functional hermaphrodite or have had an alternative method of reproduction that isn't based on semen inseminate an egg. Just because those people exist doesn't mean they fill a sexually reproduction role, which is what biological sex is describing. Its like saying that humans are bipedal because some people are born without legs or a third malformed leg, a birth defect is a defect and doesn't invalidate the idea that humans are a bipedal species on any meaningful level. I'd be perfectly willing in a social situation to say that someone who is transgenders, or a person with chromosomes of the XXY or XYY or X or Y or XYZLMNOP variety is a male, female or whatever else they want to identity as. But that is because I try to be initially respectful to people (which to me includes how they identify their sex). And there isn't a contradiction in my actions because my social definition doesn't have to conform to the one a biologist operate under when studying reproduction in humans."

"Ignoring Sex here for the most part;  I don't get is why gender needs to be a thing? Other than the fit of clothes being different to sex.  We've come to a point where it's easy to share ideas and culture goes all over the place.  If I see something online I like I can buy it or try to make it. Everyone has access to made to wear clothing, short or long hair, make up and anything they feel like. Why base these things on sex linked genders anymore?    If not for the sex linked gender based things there would be no need for non-binary. Just  do you. And like you said. It changes. So the idea that a man is Non-binary NOW when it used to be a thing for rich guys to wear heels and wigs make it seem even sillier to try to make a distinction.   I'm just a woman that likes to shop in the men's section because I like their clothes better. Not because I feel like a man. Not because I'm trying to perform a male's role. Just because I'm comfy."

"The concept of race is man-made¬†but not a social construct because it never necessitates shared assumptions.

The number of Humans who DON'T have an easily recognizable penis or vagina is vanishingly small. THAT is why it's seen as a 'binary'."

"Ok, duck-rabbit analogy is a good one, but do you really need a word for every duckrabbit in between?  Also in you Genderqueer video you said about people indentifying as both ends of the spectrum and as neither(nothing at all on the spectrum, i pressume). Soo... how can you be both? You  a duck AND a rabbit? And i don't mean a middle of the spectrum, i mean BOTH ends of it. Aren't you one one creature and choose only one place in this spectrum? If not then analogy is actually misleading. Or how can you be not on the spectrum at all? That genders seems to me as trying to be original and outgender outqueer your friends to be more unique. Not even nesseseraly 'for attention', but maybe to feel more uniuque to yourself in your head, it's what teens do with their crisis of indentity."
"Why is it called 'gender reassignment surgery' if gender is a social construct? Do you do surgery on a social contruct? Isn't it biological-sex reassignment surgery? Why is it called transgender if gender is not about your body but a social construct? Isn't transgender is more about being want to be a different biological sex with what he/she was born with? therefore the surgery?"

"While I would have liked to see some inquiry into the practice of sexual reassignment of intersex babies which demonstrates the constructive nature of 'gender' & how that falls apart under the slightest scrutiny, your overview was surprisingly simple & straightforward while not being 'simply straight'.  Interesting facts - most cultures had more than 2 genders - Out of Abrahamic influenced cultures, Christian & Judaism cultures are strictly 2 genders while Islam embraces transgender, officially holding 3 gender societies. - Alpha/Beta Hunter/Gatherer male/female paradigm is a meme only & not an evolutionary constraint (see 'Stress - A Portrait of a Killer' doco or read the papers of Robert M. Sapolsky) - Acid to MRA's. - The Wiggles will instantly make babies STFU!"
"So I see this video & have to watch it (Thank You for making it & how did I miss it?). That means having it up on my PC while my son watches Swedish nursery rhymes, then finding it on my phone to watch outside in the freezing cold to then come back inside to comment (next to the heater) while placating a 6 month old who is already pissed off we took his tittie-time meals away while applying my attire for the day (which means hopping around trying to find my balance when putting on heels & feeding Walter in between dabs of foundation).

I was hesitant to even watch this video but I'm glad I did. There's so much that I never considered or even knew about (like atypical chromosomes or first and secondary sex characteristics failing to match up neatly with them.)  It's a surprisingly interesting topic and I feel a little ashamed for being so ignorant of it."

I feel so frustrated this has 2k likes. I feel so sad you're spreading this ignorance with such ease and pleasure and sense of contemplation.

"Intersex people are not what is being talked about when talking about sex in this argument 90% of the time though. What's being talked about is people who are phenotypically male or female who do not have Swyer Syndrome  (Swyer syndrome is specifically when a Y chromosome lacks the part that turns someone male because of a copying mishap that put it on the X chromosome instead). If the whole 'sex is a spectrum' thing was only referring to people with chromosomal abnormalities, then I don't think we would have any real debate on this (you might have some argument about a birth defect not being a sex or something I guess).  Maybe I am just misunderstanding what people say, but whenever it is brought up, I definitely get the impression that there is a claim for much more than just people with chromosomal abnormalities being something other than pure male or female sexed.  Later you talk about using different definitions for different contexts. Perhaps the problem is that when people say sex is binary (or almost entirely binary with a  few intersex people perhaps), they are referring to 'without surgery,' or 'what their body was before alterations'?  When I use the term 'biological sex' it is a term for prior to surgery or other alterations.  If biological sex is not the term you wish to use, then what is the term for 'at birth penis havers'¬†and 'at birth vagina havers'? I think male and female do fine in this context.  *The above has no bearing on my opinions on transgenderism or people who undergo surgery in any way, I am only arguing the point on the term sex*"
"lol dat pepsi"
"This video was great. The idea that we should view gender by different definitions based on context is simple, but my dumb brain didn't even consider that. Also, the variety of possible chromosome makeups was something I haven't seen before. Really interesting stuff.  And learning this all while seeing atrocities committed on a watermelon was... unexpected.  ...but I liked it."
"You might want to talk about the blow back Bill Nye got on his talk about gender.."
"was fun watching you get dismantled by blaire. you should really evolve your arguments past 'MUH FEELINGS BE NICE'.  your feelings have no place in a logical, rational, discourse."
"I don't know how anybody can be conscious of all the comments under their videos but here goes...   I was watching your post Blair White debate analysis interview on the youtube Destiny channel. Towards the end consciousness and free will came up. I am going to qualify what I say by admitting I am still learning about physics (for example I struggle to get my head around the bit 5 minutes and 30 seconds into PBS's 'The Higgs Mechanism Explained' - well done if you can understand it). My view on consciousness (if I am understanding physics correctly) wasn't even possible until the 20th century. I think modern understanding has made consciousness more special than it was using the old Newtonian physics (that you get taught as a teenager). For me the fact (again I don't fully understand physics) that Einstein's General Theory of relativity and Quantum Mechanics are incompatible at scales just larger than the atom - the scale at which infra red phenomena occurs (movement of atoms and molecules) - creates a great unknown regarding what consciousness actually consists of and whether consciousness is even possible at larger or smaller scales...     So when people take conversations about consciousness away from the physical scale at which consciousness exists (i.e. the scale of sound and language, at speeds and frequencies we associate with consciousness, and where the two modern pillars of Physics overlap and disagree) by the terms I have defined then I think that is doing disservice to the subject of consciousness, and moreover can no longer be defined as a conscious conversation. It is well known that we have levels of consciousness while we are awake ranging from trance to the conscious state of meditation - the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is of interest here as it is less active when in trance and dealing with material objects, but more active when in R.E.M. sleep and interacting with people or while in meditation. It all comes back to love essentially."

"9:46 'Gender is a performance, a series of imitative behaviours.'  First off, sorry for this wall. Second, a nitpick (or a pretty big correction, depending on how significant you think etymology is here). There is this wide (misrepresented) notion that Butler opines that gender is a 'performance', but she makes a distinction between 'performance' and 'performativity' that many people seem to miss (a very common misconception born from academia, much like how people think Marxism has anything to do with giving everyone equal stuff). Basically, as I understood it, she says that to say gender is a 'performance' would mean that you are 'acting', that it is an egoistical (rational/logical) decision to 'do your gender', and so, everyone would be able to change their gender as their mood comes and goes (dysphoria wouldn't be a thing under this definition). Butler, instead says that gender is 'performative', and by this, I understand she means that when a group sees among themselves a collection of behavior that it can, without the involvement of the ego, categorize under a single name, it will do so, and in this case it is named 'gender'. Under this definition, gender is not an egoistic construct, but it is created (through repetition) by the transgressive properties of our superego. All a bit weird sounding, sure, and heavy on psychoanalysis (also, in Gender Trouble, the two words seem to slide into each other, and it took me a while to understand her perspective, too), but basically, I think the distinction is that the former def has to with 'putting on a face for others that you can shed at any time', while the latter is 'being observed as someone who doesn't become 'someone' until that face is part of their identity', hence the concept of 'doing your gender wrong'. Performance presupposes a preexisting subject, while performativity contests the very notion of the subject. There is a Big Think video on YT where Butler explains the distinction. Also, I understand that this is just kind of a beginner video, but I just wanted to complicate the discussion because it is an important one. Hope you're well!"
"I came from Blaire, but I really enjoy your channel. Thank you for being a reasonable voice for feminism, I think a lot of people would benefit from hearing your perspective. So many people on the anti-social justice side see the 'radical side' of social justice movements and form their opinions. There is a spectrum of thought and attitudes as I see you demonstrating with the concept of gender. Great video, thanks for helping expand my mind."

"Already did an effort post before that got ignored so this feels like a damn waste, but whatever.  You say that the XX XY categories and generic penis=man vagina=woman don't work because there are less than 1% of people that do not fall correctly into these categories. Okay so that means that we have to redefine the definition because some few people who have something fucked up about them do not fit into them? Even if gross mass majority of normal people fall into their categories perfectly and even with their sexuality.  You make a point that gender is a social structure in a way like money because how people interact with money is very real ect, and gravity is different because its meaning to everything is not determined by humans. Which is kinda true, but you are ignoring the fact that gender as structure is a thing in animals, even if these structures are the opposite of the normal human ones. Some animal females are stronger so they take the dominant position, or there are animals that can even change their gender. But the fact that gender exists and gender created dominance hierarchies exist means, that gender is practically universal in animals. You can't say that gender is social construct done by humans when its done by millions other species as well.  Also its kinda funny you use picture King Louis XIV wearing what today we consider girly clothes while carrying a sword. Does it not contradict your point? You know we still consider weapons to be masculine to this day even if our fashion senses have changed."

"The Bill Nye assessment brought me here; it's detrimental of me to argue, for my stance is something else entirely, but I'll tell you something: Get better taste in Pepsi - Sakura or Cherry Vanilla. Also, Vaporwave's a dead horse; do yourself a favor and get something better deserving of yourself.  That important stuff out of the way, I suppose it's good to be a bit serious in some retrospect:  You've sometimes a nice mindset on different topics and their approaches and I'm glad that this fair attitude is something you possess in direct opposite to other individuals entirely. While we can't agree on this notion (as well as some more), I can at least say that your methods (outside of jumpcuts; little too jarring) and other concepts of ideas as well as dialogue to express them deserve some modicum of respect with the little of your videos that I've seen. This entire approach of discussion isn't to my favor - some of the ideas you talk about are something I consider taken too far, so you won't get a regular viewer in such case - but I wish you luck nonetheless. It's a hard road to walk for both sides, and it's one to bite you in the ass for a variety of mistakes that come to par, especially the more obscure ones."

"I caught your debate with Blair,¬† and I want to make a very simple point,¬† that I hope doesn't go over your head as you try to make everything so complicated.... But,¬† Blair is right,¬† A man cannot turn into a woman, and a woman cannot turn into a man.¬† The fact that there is a category called 'Trans'¬† proves it.¬†¬† There would be no need for Trans-rights, or Trans anything if a transition would actually be possible,¬† because then you would simply be man or woman.¬† The existence of 'Trans' as a classification proves that transition is impossible and your just acting as the opposite sex.¬† Again,¬† If you could actually transition,¬† you would simply be male or female.¬† Do you see how simple that is ?¬† Its self defeating.¬†¬†¬† Also, I'm really curious,¬† whatever happened to people just being themselves, and embracing and loving themselves,¬† and now people are obsessed with labels and fitting into boxes and conformity.¬† I'm rather baffled that I'm watching a debate on transgender conformity, and I don't know if that's what you even realize you are arguing for, stricter labeling, stereotyping, and conformity.¬† Also, here is another pointer on self defeating talking points,¬† I would stay away from mentioning science when your talking about gender, which is claimed to be a social construct.¬† social constructs are unscientific by their very nature.¬† If it was scientific,¬† it would not be a social construct.¬† You cannot have it both ways.....¬† wow, now I just got to the part where blair is having to explain to you what a vagina is, and what a wound is,¬† and your claiming because you can stick things in a wound that it's a vagina.¬† So, If someone fucks my ear, can that be a vagina too ?¬†¬† From the bottom of my heart kid,¬† Do what makes you happy,¬† and that's all the reasoning you need.¬† Because all this other nonsense coming out of your mouth is anti-science garbage and just makes your could be respectable choices a joke."

Just because some biologists will debate the demarcation point between two creatures like a Rabbit and a Hare in a fossil record does not mean that they are going to invent a 'spectrum of Lagomorphs' where every Rabbit and Hare can have it's own special species name. The Rabbit and the Hare are not on a spectrum they are separate species."

"I think I'm still unimpressed with the proposals to blur the lines of biological sex. This is a binary that transcends the human species & as far as I'm aware, applies to just about every animal (I think you have a few hermaphrodites, mostly plants, but that just ends up being the exception that proves the rule given that they are decidedly BOTH male and female and not a nebulous halfway inbetween).  You can expose a male fetus to a whole lotta hormones or chemicals & make him grow into all kinds of crazy shapes. It doesn't make him any less male (though it may cripple some masculine part of him, render him infertile, or make him appear more feminine). He's no closer to being female than cutting off your dick as a full grown adult would, or a cancerous growth that resembles tree bark makes you somewhere on the spectrum between plant and animal. He's just twisted into a similar shape. Stray mutations generally aren't considered when deciding what constitutes the characteristics of a group of organisms, even when they're fairly common.  And extra/missing chromosomes is generally the result of a misfire or cell damage in cell division. That's not exactly a variation on a sex as much as it is a birth defect. It's basically down's syndrome for your genitals. Sure, mutations could lead to a new gender (from the look of the Y chromosome, that's probably how we got males), but it appears to have happened ONCE since we split from a common ancestor with mushrooms (google fungus genders).  Personally I'd prefer to focus on stripping away the social & behavioral expectations of men & women. Let male and female be the rigid chromosome binary, but don't necessarily let that dictate how you live your life (beyond the obvious physical limitations). I worry that this philosophy of biological sex as a spectrum is deliberately erasing terminology that doesn't fit chromosomal diseases in what can be considered sex so that there's room to indulge a delusion with one's very own 'god of the gaps'. Not so much worried for society, more for the individual that doesn't seem capable of accepting their state of physical being."

"Upload your debate with blair white, or ill call you a boy.....dun dun duuuhhhhhhhhh"
"If their best argument for more than two genders is that this isn't a new thing and it's been around for thousands of years that's absolutely bullshit. God only knows how long people thought the earth was flat, and that bathing made you sick. There are only two genitals, a penis, and a vagina. Only two genders male and female respectively. You and everyone else on this planet have every right to dress and act however they want, but don't you dare tell me to go against what is scientifically and biologically concrete. If you're a male that wants to transform into a female, there is nothing wrong with you and you have every right to do so, but gender has absolutely nothing to do with sexual preference and people change their minds on that all the time. You can't bounce back and forth between male and female on a whim. If you have a penis you're a man, and a vagina you're a girl. If you undergo sex changing surgery and fully transform your body and put in the time effort then I understand wanting people to address you as your preferred gender. But being a whiney, attention seeking brat because you want to be different is an insult to all trans people who are really trying to make a change. You complain that it's so hard to be you, that you're oppressed and tormented by society, look at the real problems on this earth; murder, rape, starvation, natural disasters, kidnappings, war, genocide. You really think wanting to be a boy one second, a girl another, or neither is a real issue? The world doesn't revolve around your indecisiveness, and I am strongly opposed to anyone who throws science out the door and claims it's a social construct. Yes girls like dolls and boys like trucks is a social construct, but gender is not. You are not assigned your gender, and it is not an act of violence. There are people who truly suffer on this planet beyond what any of you can ever comprehend and your need to be sexually identified as a stapler is a fucking joke and I will not, WILL not cater to it."
"Your problem doesn't seem to be with anything other than language. You want to change the English language for some reason I don't understand, and you never explain that reason. We do have words to describe every type gender and sex that you described. It seems though, that for some reason you don't like those words. Describing a trans woman as a trans woman, does not make that person less, it is just an accurate description. If someone is intersex, then they are intersex. You use those words yourself, then want to shame others for using them. Every time you present a question that CONTRAdicts with what you want the answer be, you fade to a joke. How about you embrace words and language and stop putting your own internal biases on them."
"I wanted to thank you personally for having that conversation with Blaine White. I watched the entirety of your video you made a long time ago in regards to her and it was accurate. I disagreed with a majority of your points during the debate but I found them thought provoking and allowed for introspection in what I believe to be true. I know the majority of her fans gave you flack but I didn't think you behaved outlandish during it and I generally think you are a funny entertainer and I see now why Shoeonhead enjoys your content."
"I have to say this, I came here to scoff at your feminist videos, because clearly all feminists are crazy, right? However, I have genuinely enjoyed all your videos so far. You are the first 'feminist' or 'sjw' channel that has resonated with me and gotten me to listen. You are so rational, well thought out, and funny. Thank you for getting me to question some of my beliefs."

Basic male biology that is different to those of a female:    Men has more white-matter and less grey matter in their brains when compared to a woman's brain ... men has larger vascular system than a woman, men has more muscular mass, different chromosomes, men produces sperm, our skeletal structure is different, men do not have a womb.    It is not the doctor or society that assign our gender but rather Nature.  It is Gender-benders like yourself trying to redefine what nature has assigned."

"'And you would be foolish to try to determine the monetary value of actual gold by investigating it chemical properties.'  Are you seriously this blind. The first stage in determining a things monetary wealth is to make sure that thing has been correctly identified. Gold is identified based upon it's chemical properties. That's why we have the periodic table to categorize the basicx elements ordered based on the atomic weight of said element. Once the element has been initially identified based upon it's chemical properties it can then be compared with the other identified elements (again identified by chemical properties) against things such as abundance (mainly dictated by it's chemical properties), possible uses (again mainly dictated by its chemical properties), etc to place a value upon it."
"'We don't have a word for things that are slightly a rabbit, moderately a rabbit or mostly-but-not-all a rabbit.'  Well on the contrary Contra the word is Cunicular.  A hare for example is Cunicular yet it is not a rabbit. This is similar to the statement 'A trans woman is feminine yet is not a female."
"Heard your debate with Blaire and frankly you are just too much. Unlogical...my question for you is Do you have a womb? Can you produce a baby with male sperm? If the answer is no, then you are biologically male period."

"I'm a Blaire White fan and just saw your debate with her. Just want to say, even though I disagree with some of the things said, I think you did a good job. Also, this vid is pretty awesome and interesting. Later!"
"Who else is here from Blaire's channel after the debate? Contra was nice, and I wanted to check out the channel a bit. I haven't watched anything else yet but this is a good video."
"I disagree with almost everything you say but I have respect for you. You are very witty and your editing is good. Most of the people who try to make the arguments do a very poor job at effectively communicating their points but yours could be convincing. Thanks for speaking on Blaire's channel :)"
"if blaire's fans come storming your videos i'm ready to raise my cyber-sword Contra, keep it up <3"

"holy shit you mind fucked me this video is fucking awesome"
"Welp, I thought I'd take this opportunity to say thank you for doing what you do. I really enjoy your approach to contemporary topics, with your academic and well-supported information joined with your gloriously trippy visuals and editing. Overall, this is my rather boring way of telling you I really like your style and deeply appreciate your attempts to educate the masses that make up this terrible online world.  Btw fucking love your color-scheme here, as well as the lighting you've used the last few videos. Also like the deranged mad scientist angle here - that's always fun."

"I found your channel (and hence this video) after watching the discussion between you and Blaire White. As much love as I have for her, she didn't give you much room to speak and I wanted to get more of an idea about your thoughts by coming here. You have touched up on things I have been waiting to hear from the skeptic community and the right for a long time, and you made me laugh while doing it. Thanks for giving me another perspective, Contra. I look forward to watching more of your content. And uh, I've got some milk in the fridge if.."

"Contrapoint, do you support Donald Trump? Make a video advocating more people of the LGBT community to support Donald Trump please."
"Your point about evolution is incredibly ignorant. if you go back far enough and search out the common ancestors of humans through you'll arrive at some sort of worm-like creature which was the common ancestor of all vertebrate animals.  A researcher doesn't look at that as the human is on that grade of worm-like creatures, because the changes have evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Moreover, all of one animal doesn't turn into all of another. The lineage continued and simply branched off, but that base is still there. That's why you still have bacteria, flatworms, and other organisms on this planet.  You can't compare this to an ideology that is not even 50 years old, concocted by mentally ill pseudo-intellectuals and enabled by politically correct nimrods thay have no background in biology. Bored SJW's thought they were doing the right thing by propping up this mental illness."

"I want to ask a questions every SJW I've asked won't answer my question.   If gender roles are invalid and shouldn't exist, and gender is a social construct, then isn't being transgender pushing gender roles and only enforcing this 'social construct' you call gender. ESPECIALLY gender fluid people who say that they're a woman one day because they're wearing a dress, or they're a man for wearing jeans and a T shirt."
"I'm a fan of Blaire White and I'd like to say I understand your views. They come from a place of logic, though some of your arguements with Blaire seemed a bit semantic and emotionally fueled. Keep up the videos, they're pretty damn funny and interesting üòÑüëç"
"Great video... however... very disturbing to watch."
"Gender is a very unsatisfying concept. Like sexual preferences, too.  For  years I didn't call myself a heterosexual because, if you are a male  hetero, you have to have the virile type of dominating and protective  sexuality over women. I called myself a male lesbian, because I wanted equality and tender with my female partners. Now, I call myself a hetero, because nobody understands outside of binary gender based concepts. The  women I have sex with say that I'm the kindest and they feel free with  me. Because, yes, I'm not conform to the attitude I have to conform  with. But, I'm not a hetero virile, shit that's so frustrating."

"That speculum made me queasy"
"Hi Contra! You are amazing. I've found solace in Youtube channels at a time in my life when I've struggled with a lot of issues, and I greatly appreciate everything you do.   I've never met someone I have so much in common with,  being another mentally ill dipsomaniacal AMAB genderqueer grad school dropout, and I just want to thank you for being you. Although you don't seem like the type for sentimental sincerity, so deal with it."

"god I'm so happy you exist"
"I can certainly appreciate your points about the tricky nature of language; the argument about the way we categorize chairs reminds me of a lecture by Steven Pinker, and I've never quite managed to summarize his points as concisely as you have here. I can even agree that the way we classify biological sex is generally reductive, and that most of us tend to make that classification at first glance by assessing a combination of physical traits. We get really, really hung up on these categories, too. I've seen men who were really incisive about one topic wax on at length because they felt conflicted about their attraction to a trans-woman, convinced that because we can't change our sex, and because 'gay' is this rock-solid classification used to describe people attracted to the same sex, that any expression of gender is irrelevant, and they must be gay. It's certainly not that simple.  We just have to disagree at 5:24, though. I think biological sex is a meaningful classification despite our tendency to assess what are essentially phenotypical characteristics and classify based on some measure of inductive reasoning, because biological sex is a tool that we use to make distinctions between organisms with different reproductive functions. It seems pretty clear that people are overwhelmingly male or female, and have characteristics that are largely consistent with these classifications. That a very small fraction of the population resists easy classification isn't persuasive evidence to suggest that any kind of spectrum exists, because a spectrum entails equal representation at all points. We don't see that here. We see a few aberrations, many of whom are mostly male or mostly female with minor variations.  Meanwhile, many intersex people can be classified using a binary, and their gender identity reflects this. A woman with AIS may have internal testicles and XY sex chromosomes, but we classify her as a woman because her physical traits are largely consistent with other women. Given that most women with AIS would appear to identify as women, it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel and demand that we classify these people as some third or fourth or seventh sex, nor as something in between male and female. It would be one thing if they played a different role in sexual reproduction, but they don't, so why would we need to invent a new sex to describe them? Why shouldn't we accept that language is sometimes tricky and teach people how to be aware of this, instead of inventing a new word for every type of rabbit?"

"*a e s t h e t i c ! ! !* (somewhat lengthy message incoming):  Goodness, gracious, pink-wigged Jesus, you are awesome. Like, 'cool, cooler, coolest' awesome. I've determined that I would be remiss in not sharing the importance of your vids. For example, it took only two of them (this, and the one about being genderqueer) to completely upend my misconceptions about gender. And mind you, those videos are, as of yet, the _only_ ones I've watched.  See, I generally hover on the line between 'liberal dilettante' and 'hard science bro'. With regards to gender identity, this meant that while I accepted that people have different life experiences and identities and should obviously be allowed to make their own decisions regarding them, I was skeptical of the objective grounding for nonbinary. I agreed that gender is a social construct, but that understanding didn't extend to what I saw as the construction of novel and frivolous identities. This resulted in me being less-than-sympathetic about some of the issues facing those who so identified.  However, this and the genderqueer video have vastly expanded my views. They characterized and contextualized nonbinary gender identities in an entertaining and aesthetically-pleasing manner, and I now feel all sorts of enlightened and ready to do some research and introspection of my own. So thanks! If I were to praise your work by means of comparison, I would say that it's like that of 'Kurzegesagt ‚Äî In a Nutshell', 'cept with more synthwave and infinitely more dabs."

That is to say, they aren't a new sex, their extra chromosome still fits within the binary. Also, in relation to gender, I hardly imagine these are the people claiming to be 'otherkin' or 'transqueer' etc. J/s"
"Let's do a conceptual analysis. If you are observing gender, what are you observing? A group of all males doing activities only males do and a group of all females doing activities only females do. Males and females live completely seperate lives and share nothing in common. If it wasn't for sexual reproduction, males and females wouldn't even share the same space. So what is gender? Taking the entire human experience and dividing it into 2 parts, one masculine, one feminine, creating the ironclad no overlapping roles rule and only males can be masculine and females be feminine rule."

"'Gender' = sex roles and sex role stereotypes One of the biggest mistakes feminists made in the late 1970s was using the term 'gender' to replace the older terms. It opened the door for the word 'gender' to be deliberately conflated with sex. To use the older and more accurate terms makes it far easier to inform the public of the ludicrousness of transgenderism and exposes the vast majority of the trans as the fetishists and kinksters they truly are. Nobody can 'identify' as a sex role. It is a performance, an act, a group of behaviors assigned to each sex to make them 'complementary' to each other ('masculinity' and 'femininity'),  and it is not rooted in biology."

"Interesting video. We don't have a word for 'something that is slightly a rabbit' or 'something that is mostly a rabbit' for a simple reason - words describe things that people know about, and when people started speaking languages, they had no idea about evolution, all they could see were rabbits. There is no point in having common words for these, because they don't exist anymore and only scientists deal with them (and when they existed, rabbits didn't). The problem with defining 'chair' is that meaning changes with time. People make an object for sitting that has a certain shape and they call it 'chair'. Then someone else makes another object for sitting that has a slightly different shape and they call it 'chair', because it's used for sitting. After some time people will know a pattern of a shape of the chair (or multiple shapes) that they have seen and start calling similar objects a chair, too. As of the problem of gender, I think that the solution is quite simple. We can say there are two genders - male and female - and then there are rare exceptions. Most people have all or almost all characteristics of either male or female gender, including biological sex. I don't know whether gender could be called a social construct, because it's more or less based on biology. There are clearly psychological and physiological differences between men and women - men are generally stronger and women are more emphatic and they give birth to children => men are more suited for manual work and women for other things like taking care of children => they wear different clothes, woman used to (and to some extent still do) cook, do housework etc. more than men (because it is/used to be more efficent - men manually work => women do other things). Nowadays manual work becomes less important -> the difference between what men and women do is decreasing => a lot of things that I mentioned is becoming more or less irrelevant => the past becomes the sole reason for some (but not all) differences between the genders.  Gender is clearly not a psychological state - its meaning is derived from biological sex. Gender dysphoria is a rare disorder where the gender is for no logical reason the opposite."

"How do you talk with a straight face while dressed as a wacky wifu doctor?"
"Contrapoints appeal to Dawkins discussing the nature of evolution and the consequential difficulties as related to the classification of animals into species as an argument for a 'gender' spectrum is an absurd false equivalency in multiple ways. >_<  Whereas the fact that the evolutionary 'spectrum' exists in a single dimension progressing in a single direction across time going from proto or psuedo-rabbit to modern rabbit the 'gender' spectrum (assuming such a thing exists) while similarly one dimensional, progresses in two directions and is naturally divisible as a binary.  You have more feminine, less feminine, neutral (possibly androgeny), less masculine, more masculine.  or  Female/Feminine | Male/Masculine as the general categorization of anything applicable to 'gender' as a descriptive (adjective, not noun) concept.  Gender is binary in this nature because sex IS NECESSARILY binary, due to the fact that procreative potential, or to be more precise, assumed/presupposed procreative potential IS binary. Either you have a past/present/future procreative (cap)ability or you do not. This is a metaphysical attribute intrinsic to all animals. Human beings tie various cultural values, norms, and social conventions often represented by specific behavioral and visual aesthetics to procreation because humans recognize the existence of sexual reproduction as well as other numerous factors that compose the identifiable categories relevant to classifying the individual.  Thus 'transgender' is a naturally emergent category and class of people who appropriate the stereotypical presentation of the biological sex they are not and sometimes adopt the normative associated stereotypical behavioral mannerisms of their appropriated biological sex, relative to their culture, with the intent of being perceived by others as an individual who has (or does not have) intrinsic procreative potential.  All this queer theory and genderbread man shit is complete nonsense. Trannys are either fetishists, delusional, or mentally ill. Those are the people which transgenderism encompasses. Period. I don't know which one Contrapoints is, probably a fetishist based on his obnoxious anime-esque pink wig presentation or a delusive based on his defense of queer theory and slander of gender critical radical feminists as 'TERFS.'"
"Well , this was entertaining"

"If gender is a social construct, why did society construct it? We know why we have money, but why do we have gender? I don't think it's a construct myself, but interested in your theory as to why society would construct gender. Was it so the newly formed men could oppress the now labeled women?"
"Yo dude, break my outdated conceptions of gender but hands of Bertie Russ. He was too pure for this world."
"I thought I was already subbed to you until I noticed this video. That's now been amended. Your videos are great, very informative and funny, I like being educated and gender identities are a subject I'm very hazy on, so thanks for clearing up lots of stuff."
"If gender is purely a social construct (which I very much buy into), and transgender are people who was designated the wrong gender. Then why on earth do they feel the need to adjust things inherent to their sex? It just feels so backwards to tamper with your body, before trying to fight social constructs. It feels like a compromise, where you yourself are doing these irreversible changes to yourself to fit in, rather than to change others and especially your own concept of gender. It makes it sound like transgenders buy into a very stereotypical picture of what gender is."

"You're so pretty, I know this has nothing to do with the content of the video but purple hair looks awesome on you!   As for the stuff in the video, I feel like the rabbit metaphor was especially good and something I hadn't even considered but it's a great way to explain it and I'll probably use it the next time someone has a question. The cultural thing though, nonbinary genders are present in a lot of cultures! For example, Two-Spirit people have existed in most indigenous tribes and are celebrated though it might be a little like the Genderbreadman because it's a term which encompasses the whole LGBT identity, someone can be lesbian and two-spirit without being nonbinary, however it's most often used to describe the experience of being trans.   Anyway, I love your videos!"
"'Nature doesn't abide by the rues of the English language'  Goddammit, how do you so succinctly sum up what would take me days to try to explain?"
"This video was really confusing; and not just because of the weird shit with the watermelon and beakers (which was awesome BTW).  You appear to assert that there is no difference between biological sex and gender in the first half of your video; and then in the second half you act like there is a difference even though you never specified one.    The gender of a trans woman is female and the sex of a trans woman is male.  That is what makes them trans.  Otherwise, the word 'trans' is unnecessary and meaningless.  Sex is rigidly defined in the science of biology-- and it is done this way because it is analytically useful.  The existence of anomalous intersex individuals does not change the fact that sexually reproducing life is largely organized into a binary biological specialization.  Gender, on the other hand, is a complex psychological and sociological construct dealing with how an individual is internally driven to represent their biological sex-- one that is generally only applied to human beings and their behaviors.  No one asks what gender a cockroach or a spider is, at least not in that sense.  You asserted that gender is a social construct without addressing the elephant in the room... and I have to say, I'm really tired of this elephant being ignored because it's been left filling up the room of academic gender studies with dung for a long time now.  Meet elephant:  Most trans people are socialized their entire lives as the opposite gender from the one they eventually assume... and they reject it, often at great trauma and risk to themselves.  Similarly, boys who have had badly botched circumcisions have been raised as girls, and that has backfired with them returning to their biological sex without even knowing what their biological sex was.  That only makes sense if there is a hard biological basis-- that is, some aspect of their consciousness-- behind it; at least in part.  Obviously that doesn't mean that all of it is biologically driven, as is evident in the existence of widely different gender-based cultural norms such as crocodile-skin man, but it does imply that there is something extra.  The gendered cultural norms, however bizarre, are an expression of something.  Wouldn't you agree?"
"I appreciate the honesty and humor in this video, especially the jab at philosophers. This is not a scientific in the least however. There's too much to address with a single comment, so I'll be brief. First of all, sex is purely binary. Sex is a phenotype. It is based on 2 mating types being anisogamous. Chromosomes are irrelevant, they are merely a way to code the genotype to phenotype map (in some reptiles, sex is mainly determined by temperature!). Your particular anatomical features are irrelevant, they're just a way to produce the gametes that actually define your sex. Secondary sexual characteristics are irrelevant, not all anisogamous sexually reproducing species are sexually dimorphic (A. vittata, for example). Sex exists in plants, and in all of Animalia, and in Mycota as well. In some plants, the single organism can have both sexes as the same time! (We call them true hermaphrodites). Some organisms, such as the clown fish, can only express one sex, but can switch its sex within its lifetime! Human beings are sadly not one of these organisms. You use intersex people as your trump card. These individuals commonly suffer from aneuploidies (extra or missing chromosomes) in their 23rd slot of the karyotype. Same as Down's Syndrome patients have an extra chromosome 21. It is not normal. It is a medical disorder and these individuals deserve to receive are empathy and understanding. That being said, however, these individuals usually fall into one sex or the other, as they still produce sperm or eggs. Sometimes they may not be able to produce neither, in which case these people have no sex. If you find this idea confusing, simply ask yourself: 'what is the eye color of someone that has no eyes?'. The XY female is another phenomenon used to confuse. In these individuals, the SRY gene of their Y chromosome has suffered a LOF (loss of function) mutation, rendering it non functional. In humans, the 'default' of the development program is to create a female, male development must be 'turned on'. At the risk of oversimplifying this, it is the SRY gene that starts the male development program. No SRY, No male. You do the math.   As to what gender is, you never define it rigorously, only say it is a social construct. You add that it is about psychology. Gender started to be distinguished from sex in a non linguistic context by John Money, who believed the same social constructionist ideals as you do. His hypotheses (which he developed through gross scientific misconduct, may I add) have been falsified. Sexual dimorphism extends to behavior, through sexual dimorphism of the brain. Sex explains what we see, making 'gender' totally irrelevant. You conflate 'gender', which is fundamentally categorical, with gender (or really sex) roles, expectations and societal trends. I agree that many of these ARE social constructs. Nowhere in our genes does it say boys=blue, girls=pink. But these are expectations and associations, not the categories themselves. And yes, sex and biology predict who's the primary caretaker, it's called Bateman's principle, which in spite of the flaws of the original study, it's been shown to hold.  You don't address what mating types are, Fisher's Principle, or any population biology which is the field that uncovers the natural laws that govern living populations, including us. I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful with this, but the science is severely lacking."

Language is supposed to be a tool to help communicate ideas to others, not be this rigid definition on the world that surrounds you. We have labels that express general concepts, but they aren't the defining feature for any given object. I think this is quite important when you talk about labels and traits in a person's identity."

Transgenderism is like intersex with the secondary sex characteristic being the brain, instead of genitalia or hormones. This is plain and simple why nonbinary doesn't exist. You can call yourself whatever you want, but please don't appropriate a mental dysorder."

"Intersex people don't ruin the idea of bi-modal sex and that's not to do with forcing reality to fit your preconceived notions.   For example, we might say there are a two classes of animals. Bipeds, and non-bipeds. Humans are bipeds. The fact not all humans have two legs doesn't mean we're 'forcing reality to fit preconceived notions'. It works because humans almost always walk on two legs.   The same is true for sex. As a species we come in two different sexes. Some people don't but that no more ruins the bi-modal nature of sex than one legged people ruin the characterization of bipedal.     Here's my view on these concepts, tell me where I'm being inconsistent or failing to provide sensible frameworks for the social sciences to explain things;  1) Sex exists and is bi-modal.   2) Masculinity and femininity exist and refer to societal constructs. This is lipstick, child-raising and skin scarring. They DO change depending on society because duh, they're constructed by society. Who you are inside doesn't make sense in terms of man/woman any more than it makes sense in terms of bi-ped/mono-ped.(of however many legs you have).   3) Gender doesn't exist. If it does it refers to ones preference to be a given sex. It's a neat shorthand but that's about it   It might seem like all I'm doing is changing gender to masculine/feminine and that might be true, but doing this seems to fix all the confusion generated by the current cluster-fuck of definitions that attempt to explain gender at present. I don't see why people insist on the frankly contradictory definitions that seem to exist for no other reason but increase the special snowflakedness level ones 'identity'."
"Ouch."
"like my comment if contrapoints made you gay"
"No mention of the SRY-gene? Pft.  Gender identity is informed by biology. The fact that one can consider gender identity some kind of spectrum, doesn't mean that gender isn't in fact binary. It is informed by the role and purpose of gametes. The gender spectrum doesn't even make sense if there isn't a male and a female endpoint to the spectrum, seeing as we're not a Hermaphroditic species. There are roles of reproduction in our species.  The fact that we can now afford to shed those roles when it comes to daily life is neither here nor there.  But one of the biggest problems I see when it comes to the concept of gender, given that it's used as a term referring to social negotiation, is one of pragmatism. I have a hard enough time remembering peoples names, the reason that pronouns are used in languages is to be able to grab the attention to and negotiate with people you don't know in your surroundings. It's just not practical to ask people for their pronouns before you engage with them.   The problem creeps in here when people expect some sort of social or legal consequence for misgendering people. Even the most well-meaning and polite person will eventually slip up and accidentally misgender somebody, so I don't have any patience for treating it as deserving these consequences. But I also don't really see the social consequences when it comes to being deserving of somebody respecting your pronouns, even when you're being misgendered through intent. If you've resigned yourself and you're in agreement that gender is considered part of an active social negotiation, somebody has every right to negotiate with you on their own terms. You have no right to their respect.  Also, I do have a problem with the dichotomy that you seem to be resigning yourself to regarding gender identity and gender expression, you perfectly encapsulated it when asking *'Who Am I?'* and referencing your previous video.   From an outsider perspective, it feels to me like people who identify as something other than man/woman _(non-binary, genderqueer, agender, what-have-you)_, have simply resigned themselves to identify as that because they feel like they can't be bothered negotiating their gender expression and that this somehow helps to reorient and organize themselves in their society given this conundrum. This seems like a cop out that seeks to avoid rather than address the problem head on to me.  Why is it so shameful to simply identify as a man/woman that expresses their gender in a non-conforming way? And no, I don't consider trans people or intersex conditions to be a third (or higher) gender."

"Gender is a war between two tribes over who has to be disgusted by which behaviors, so that corporations can maximize their opportunities to sell us something to relieve our shame. If you have two genders, and every trait is only allowed in one or the either, yet traits are evenly distributed in the population, then fully 50% of traits will be shameful and monetizable. Any attempt to make gender less stringent will alleviate shame and therefore shrink GDP and is therefore VERY BAD THE WORST"

"Intersex people makeup more of a genetic outlier, an abnormality, an outlier in the data that should be used to define physical gender. This is brought up a lot in these types of arguments, but intersex is not the smoking gun, if anything it proves that in nature there are pretty clear lines, and that those lines are only blurred maybe 1.7% of the time (if we're being generous here). If the distinction of chromosomes and physical characteristics were ill-defined (i.e. intersex) in EVERY human (or the majority) I would agree that intersex is a valid point to disproving biological gender."

But physically the line is not as blurred as you try to argue here."

"I feel like what I commented in the other video still applies here. The entire concept of 'feeling like a woman' is empty and non definable unless you are referring to stereotypes (wearing a dress makes me feeling like a woman) or biological (menstrual cramps make me feel like a woman).  ALso, why did you call science masculine? If a woman is interested in science, does that make her masculine? Or is she just a woman who likes science? It's sexist to imply women are only interested in social sciences.  With the research I've done, every person who has been recorded as intersex with a combination of female and male organs, has had either a penis and a non functioning vagina, or had a vagina and a non functioning penis. As far as I'm aware there has been no recorded instance of anyone having both functioning organs.The pressense of one prevents the other from functioning. In many cases, neither the vagina or penis function. This is why I consider it a deformity. This is not an insult. People can be born without arms or legs. That's not a new type of human, that's just a deformed human. Again, not an insult. Amputees can still live great prosperus lives.  Yes, sex is a spectrum. But that statement is misleading as it includes deformites that cause infertility. And none of that justifies a transperson's gender."

"Erm, sorry, but 'rabbit' _does_ have a specific definition laid out by biologists, just as all well-documented species do. In that rather inane thought experiment you gave from Richard Dawkins (which I am sad to say, because I admire the man on many fronts), there would actually be a point where there are rabbits on one side of the line and non-rabbits on the other, because the ones on that side would not fulfill all the criteria contained in the current definition of the word 'rabbit'. The reason that thought experiment doesn't work here at all is because it takes a case where you string out the entire evolution of a species, which spans a _large amount of time_, but apply the _current_, i.e. single point in time, common usage of a single word to _everything_ on that string."

"Jesus, production has gone up, but so has the speciousness of your arguments. How can you show a list of human chromosome abnormalities and say that this proves gender isn't binary. Would you say being born armless is not a defect? You can be born with an abnormality and it does not imply we must redefine all mammals. Just because you are born does not make everything about you totally normal.  You also say that science cannot truly define what gender is because what humans mean by words might be very complex. Science is not dependent on what humans mean when they say a word. People use the term weight, when they mean mass, it does not mean that mass and weight are the same in the eyes of science. Water is defined by science despite people using it to describe all sorts of liquids.   Social sciences is not considered at the same level of biology because it lacks rigor, around 80% of social sciences studies cannot be reproduced.   Your ego is getting the best of you and you seem to lack the ability to check your emotions to understand other people's arguments. You are turning into any other youtuber, spouting how right you are without putting much effort into the reasons why. Your old work may be more janky, but it was far more thoughtful than this."

"Could this possibly be the best video yet?! So much love."
"Hi Contra, I appreciate the video but I have just a few questions:  1) Is it really useful to under sex as under a cluster-concept/family-resemblance model? Surely it's still easier to understand male and female as relating to chromosomes and regard intersex persons as just that I.e. neither male nor female)  2) Just with regards to what you said about their being as many masculinities and femininities as there are cultures. How can we understand what is a 'masculinity' without having some underlying/unifying feature within them. It seems to me that there must be some cross-cultural gender ideals for us to be able to identify them as such  3) Isn't applying different understandings of gender in different contexts intellectually dishonest? I'd imagine there must be something which drives the need to apply these different models and this higher-order value ought to be the focus of the decisions instead (if that is the case)  4) Not really a question but rather a criticism of your readiness to halt further investigation/your pessimism about the limits of philosophy. Is philosophy really just a dead end? :(  Anyway, hope I've made myself clear enough hear and I look forward to your response. Thanks x"

"I was hoping you would address the argument that being intersex doesn't count as an exception to the sex binary because intersex characteristics are 'abnormalities,' 'deformities,' or 'pathology diagnoses.' This argument seems to be a non sequitur to me. It boils down to 'they're rare, so they don't warrant a distinct sexual category.' Rarity, of course, doesn't necessarily determine the validity or utility of a category.  Folks who use this also seem to think that intersex people are examples of when something 'goes wrong' with nature. In other words, they're saying that examples that contradict the binary sexual description of nature don't mean that our description is wrong, rather these are examples of nature being wrong for failing to match our description of it."

"Just like species, we came to the concept of genders through observation of empirical clusters of things in the world.  And also just like species, there are cases where the concept don't apply very well, or angles you could look at the issue that make the concept seem like a bad fit in the first place.  I feel pretty comfortable in my understanding of what a species is, despite the shortcomings, and what's so different about gender?"
"I believe that if we are using different 'operational definitions' for gender dependent on context, what that really means is that we have different but related concepts of gender, and these concepts are relevant in different circumstances. In fact, the labels on the genderbread person can be seen as an attempt to separate and precisify those concepts. When we are discussing abortion rights, what matters is your genital anatomy, hence we talk of biological sex (ignoring the features which aren't relevant). When we talk about gender roles and stereotypes in a culture, what matters is the way you look and appear to others, so gender expression or performativity is relevant. When we are deciding what pronouns to use for someone, what matters is what gender they psychologically identify as (if we are nice), so gender identity is relevant. So gender really is a cluster of connected but separate and to some extent precise concepts, which, when separated, we can in fact make a good attempt at defining. The big problem, which has not been satisfactorily solved, is what exactly grounds gender identity. We can say that your gender identity is what gender you identify as psychologically, or internally. But there are many unanswered questions. Where does gender identity come from? Can it be right or wrong? What does it mean to say 'I identify as a man', other than 'I psychologically identify as a man'? More troublingly, it's not clear what sort of answer we need for these questions. Do we need a scientist to tell us where gender identity is located in the brain, and its chemical and social causes? Or do we need a philosopher to explain what it means to feel like you have a particular identity phenomenologically? Or perhaps a philosopher should reinterpret identification with a gender as some type of preference, for instance a preference about your body, or how you would like others to treat you. Or maybe it comes down to feelings about what societal norms 'apply' to you, but not necessarily which norms you think are right or wrong. In discussing the grounding of gender identity, it is important to not fall into positions which imply either that women ought to stay in the kitchen, or men ought or cannot wear dresses, whilst also allowing trans people's gender to have some meaningful basis. I have not seen any convincing argument for a particular position on gender identity."

"I do find it dangerous to define 'woman' as anything other than biological sex. It implies that 'woman' means you have specific personality traits or hobbies, and this reinforces gender roles. Like you said in the video, gender roles have constantly been changing throughout history. Therefore the only thing that has stayed constant about womanhood (and manhood) is biology. After watching this video however, I can see that biological sex is actually more of a spectrum, like the bunny analogy. hmm I'm confused about what to think now haha"

"As Dawkins calls it: 'the tyranny of the discontinuous mind.'"
"I don't think the way a person acts should have any bearing on their 'social construct' gender. The way a person acts characterizes the gender not the other way around. So, I really don't think expression or identity should count. Like he said, the characteristics of a gender change over time. That isn't the gender changing. The gender is constant and defined my other means. It's how that gender acts that changes. We are using yesterdays characteristics of gender on today's people. Acting masculine doesn't make you male, it just makes your gender more like yesterday's masculine."
"Babies I'm sarry!"

"Your best yet. Some next level shit.  Also, nice move on pulling Dawkins in. You didn't NEED to cite him in getting across the concept of a spectrum.

"My brother and I debated (not heated) about this yesterday and he basically was saying he was against it saying 'It's confusing and now we have no way of identifying with people,' to which I had to attempt to get him to understand that those who are genderqueer or who don't adhere to norms surrounding their gender aren't trying to take away male and female genders but add onto them. It's not supposed to be a personal attack but I guess some people can't understand that."
"I agree with most things in this video. However, I will say this. Given that gender is a social construct, does this not mean that it is completely relative what people define themselves as, and it shouldn't therefore not be a problem that people define themselves as binary, or traditionally feminine and masculine?  Or do you actually believe that here are 'better' genders, and are simply masking the supposed freedom and utility that comes from releasing the distinctions between the traditional categories because you don't like them?"
"I think you oversimplified what denotes someone's sex. In addition to gonads, genitalia, hormones and chromosomes, there's also things like skeletal structure and brain chemistry. And a trans person can't change their genitalia, they can only change the aesthetic of it through cosmetic surgery . And Intersex conditions are usually anomalous deformities of the gonads or chromosomal structure; They don't encompass the wide array of factors. There aren't more than two biological sexes because there's a biological imperative behind sexual dimorphism. I feel like your explanation is more an attempt to fit a palatable political ideology rather than explaining the actual science.  And this isn't me trying to insult trans people. The very fact that someone can be 'biologically male' and still be a woman (or vice versa) is a testament to how little sex even means today.  Love your videos, though. Keep doing your thing."
"I really want to see where you keep all of your wigs.  There's so many of them and they're absolutely gorgeous XD"
"I love your vidoes, but honestly the skits and stuff just bloat them IMO. I think you're interesting enough just with the points, and that the skits aren't really necessary. But that's just my take. I love the video :)"
"How is it that you manage to educate AND terrify at the same time?!  How do you do it?!"
"Maybe Gender is the friends we made along the way..."
"I think you might save the world"
"Good video, aesthetic and suit Pater/Mater Contra! Here is a tought that i catch long time ago: We don't know already, but i like to speculate that the psicological condition of being a non binary trans person is related with the 'non binary' chromosomes and the chemical composition of one's brain."
"OK, so I want to pose a difficulty I'm having with all of this gender stuff.  I have been convinced that gender is a social construct and that biological sex is a different thing.  I have also been convinced that there is definitely a spectrum of genders. Your spectrum point (vs binary) was very good, and I think that can be applied to every single debate we have.  BUT, here's my slight contention, would love to hear your thoughts on it.   IF people went to the doctor, came home, and said, 'I have xy chromosomes but I have breasts, therefore I am a _______' fill in the blank. I would be OK with this type of scenario. You have a medically testable diagnoses, and here's what 'you are'. When people bring up the fact that all these different chromosome combinations exist, that that is supposed to be the standard or something.  But, that's not what I see happening, there's a gap in logic. I feel like people are taking the fact that all of these different combinations exist (lets not forget that they're quite rare, as well), and then taking a logical leap and simply deciding what they're going to identify as. There is no standard, at all. Maybe one isn't possible, I'm not sure. We're mixing biology with psychology. All I hear from transgender people is, 'I have always felt like a girl, so I am one', which I don't really have a problem with, but it would be nice if it could be tied to something testable, instead of just what someone feels. Totally happy to be wrong about any of the above, but that's how it appears to me.  Hope that made sense."

"Everything I know is wrong (my reaction): sex is wrong, gender is wrong,¬†everyones wrong, we're all dying one second at a time, humanity has no meaning, what are humans? why are humans?... We stare into the harrowing¬†abyss every day expecting our gods to decend and tell us our prpose but all we get is the feeling of empty promises and the lonely inky blackness of space as we slowly wait for the universe to come to its inevitable end, Is god? ¬†Does Bruno mars is gay? Do 'I' mean anything? Are these drugs safe? Why do people hate porn? I love porn? Is that wrong of me? Why are we obsessed with giant mutant ostige eggs at easter time?¬†Why do you look good in lilac? Is that even lilac? Do colours lie? Was that one dress secretly made by magicians to trick us into thinking colours can change? Is 4chan right about the reptilian takeover? Does Trump like carrots? I actually really like pepsi and hate coke does that make me a bad person? Why do humans do things that are really destuctive to them despite knowing its destuctive to them are we simply blind to our own mortlity or are we all simply just willing to risk it for a chocolate biscuit? Rain is seriously under appreciated, We all live on¬†this eath at the most privelleged point in history and yet people still deny privillege including the under privilleged. Will anyone remember us? Who the fuck came up this 'American dream' and why the fuck did so many believe them when they did?  In just a few decades time my¬†life will fizzle away into nothing, I won't be remembered at all,¬†few of us will.¬†We all end up in the same place, nothing matteres truly, and yet, AND YET! I see a cople holding hands, a simple gesture and I smile because I know that even though we're all just stupid, greedy and untimately¬†insignificant beings there's something magical about our complexity ,our love, our passion, we're like a synthony each note represents the messyness of sex, the atrocities of war the building of society, each note teeming with life.  In the end I feel this video can be summed up for me with humans are dumb, barbaric, transient and beautiful, so fuck it if someone consideres themselves 'trigender' or whatever then it's no more meaniful or meaningless then life itself.  I should stop listening to Tchaikovsky while buzzed.  P.S. I still can't spell 'priv- privel- priville- oh fuck it."
"great video, cute girl"
"Even if all these constructs appear arbitrary when they're deconstructed, and are contingent on our validating them, does that necessarily mean that these consructs aren't useful in organizing  society?   Isn't the socially liberal stance of personal freedom over social responsibility, (communicated ironically and self-parodically here, but ultimately in earnest), inherently unsustainable in the long term?  If our definition of gender serves an operational purpose and differs depending on the context, aren't we, as selfish beings who no longer abide by static morality, going to adopt whichever suits our selfish purposes and not the purposes of society? How can we maintain a genuine moral position if this is the case?"
"That scene at the end is giving me life and I don't even like Pepsi.."
"A lot of people don‚Äôt seem to understand how messy biology can be.   Gender is like an inverse parabola with the majority of the population at the poles, male and female. But there are those who are not, they are in-between in some fashion, Usually they are close enough to count as one of the poles. However there will be an amount who don‚Äôt conform. Basic biological principles, any given population doesn‚Äôt have consistent gene or gene expression across it. There‚Äôs diversity within every group and you can naturally assume gender expression is part of that diversity. There‚Äôs nothing special about gender that makes it set it stone, your genes don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs a basic part of life and biology.   Gender is not a social construct, if it were gender dysphoria would not be a thing. That‚Äôs the one thing that really irks me about ‚Äúallies‚Äù when they speak of transgender issues. They implicitly dismiss the entirety of transsexual points of view. I think you mean gender presentation is a social construct. Gender identity, by necessity, must have some sort of biological trigger (genetic, environmental, neurological, etc). Gender presentation does not, it cannot. As you said, different cultures define gender roles and their expressions vastly different.   As an aside, XXY trans women exist, I am likely one(karyotyping is too fucking expensive). Come at me bro, I‚Äôm collecting all the special snowflake points.   Second aside: I love your videos by the way; you always bring an interesting point to things. Good luck figuring things out. If you ever need a sarcastic tranny‚Äôs brain to pick feel free to pm me."
"Why do you keep greenscreening yourself doing weird things!? Do you want to star in a Shooting Stars video?   Because that's how you star in a Shooting Stars video."
"Wow, this video actually does address a question I've been asking around for a while, about what meaning the terms 'Man' and 'Women' have in this gender-as-a-spectrum ideology. I appreciate that. One major problem for me is that what people SAY and what they DO are very different. You say 'Define them however is appropriate for the context or however is right for you.' But I can't do that, can I? Because someone will come along and say MY definition is sexist, transphobic or whatever. If I say that, to me, identifying as a woman includes being female, then I'm called a transphobe. So the sentiment that 'define it the way that's right for you' barely seems to be practiced even by the ones advocating it."
"Watching this makes me feel like I'm watching a non psychopathic version of  Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs."
"Awesome, as per!"
"Gender is a set of criteria. We happen to have words like male and female for some subsets of the gender set.  Now, I don't think that gender is as arbitrary as you make it out to be, especially since people undergo surgery to align their biology to their psychology. It's not like a chair where a chair is anything manmade that you're supposed to sit on, it's much more rigid. What I mean to say is that people have all kinds of different ideas about who they want to make love to and there's nothing you can do about it no matter how arbitrary and unscientific the societal definition of gender happens to be."

"Watched the full thing.  only quips thst i feel are incorrect, aside from complete separation of gender and sex, are:  1. The difference between a boy in a man are determined by the pituitary gland.  not a social stigma.  2. the thought experiment, while for millions of years, it is POSSIBLE, for one organism to resemble outside traits, however the organs within not so much so. which is how you could tell. by your logic 'sex' wise.  3. the chair. one thing you didnt mention is that someone would presume something is a chair... by the structure in which its made. not only by someone sitting in it and other characteristics listed...  4. Trans people and intersex. A trans person isnt born the sex, or gender, they believe they are meant. so the example given assume thst this fact is such. this is why you need hard evidence. not complete queries on possibility. children born with  3 chromosomes lead to a kid with DOWN SYNDROME again proving thst your example of intersex is a birth defect by your OWN reasons stated..  I appreciate the hard work ya put into the video and respect you for it. however, this does not disprove your counter audience. even if you claim that they are clinging into their perception of reality.  wouldnt be the first time you projected your own faults."

Hope this will help some people become a lil more open-minded. Thank you!"
"People believe that in order to be a certain gender you have to have some significant internal feeling of connectedness with a nebulous ethereal gendery idea. Cis people have had such a hard time understanding transpeople because whereas transpeople feel some kind of feeling that tells them their gender, cispeople have no such feeling. For cispeople everything is totally ok, nothing feels wrong or out of place so there is no thinking about gender identity unless prompted to do so.   The 'progressive' understanding of gender comes from transpeople, who have a very unique experience with gender, and as a result a lot of cispeople, myself included at one point, expect that they can't be cis because they don't have any feelings of connectedness."
"In my perspective, the divide of gender and sex did its part in the past, especially to highlight the social construction and power dynamics.   The problem I (and others like Stefan Hirschauer >> Undoing Gender <<) see, is that it still naturalizes sex as a pre-existent thing Biology and Medicine stumble across. The vid shows, that the concepts in those disciplines are flawed (or more precisely: often misused), but it still gives them the credit of an essentialist observation and thus making the naturalist scientist to modest witness, to speak in Harawayian terms.    I recognize that, as ContraPoints highlights in the comment section, that this is a 'giant topic' and thus 'shortcomings' (as I perceive it) are inevitable.   I'm looking forward to the video about the relation of Gender and Biology and what's your take on (realism vs. construcitivism?).   Your content give me something to think about. Often I agree on a general level, but see specific topics different. That sharpens my reflexivity and positioning, helping to formulate thoughts."
"this is really good! impressive editing"
"Saying 'a woman is somebody who identifies as a woman' is a tautological statement. It has no meaning as it's a circular definition. It's similar to saying 'a tove is somebody who identifies as a tove'. This statement leaves you none the wiser about what a 'tove' *really* is. You have thrown away the entire concept of gender in order to try to curry favor with 0.1% of the population. In reality, you and I and everyone else knows what a woman is. Whether you choose to claim that you have no idea what a woman is outside of people who speak the words 'I identify as a woman' is your prerogative."
"Half-woke here.  Do you think gender identity a social construct? Is it the same as gender expression?  Half-woke true-scum think that these labels like man, woman, genderqueer etc. only make sense when applied to identity because of how arbitrary and contingent on culture gender expression is.  '... it presents the poles of these spectrums as if they were eternal and stable.' No it doesn't. It's in no way dependent on that idea. Although 'full-woke' people often say identity and expression are different, so often they infer from their expression that they can't have certain identities, and ultimately end up reinforcing old fashioned definitions of gender expression."
"I'm wet."
"Sex is discrete characteristic not a spectrum, your argument for sex fails with even the most basic understanding of biology. All of those sexual characteristics (breasts, hormones, vagina, ovaries) all of these are DIRECT consequences of your sex chromosomes, X/Y, which even you admit is binary. It is not enough to say that there are people with genetic problems e.g. XXX or XYY chromosomes, these are not naturally occurring and result from errors during meiosis and are not transferable through generations. Furthermore, in most of these cases the body 'self-corrects' and deactivates the expression of genes through those chromosomes through methylation. Despite all of this, the argument still fails as logical falacy called 'exception that proves the rule', where you are trying to use a 1/85,000 event to discount the overwhelming predictive power of sex to determine sexual characteristics. Science is not perfect and on some occassions makes  exceptions to laws (when there is good reason), but your argument attempts to use an exception to reject a law which is non-sense. That being said, since we live in a liberal society you can delude yourself to be whatever gender you want that's fine."

"Of all the SJW you have the best production value and you deserve your views and subs.  I have a question tho. I'm a human, a conscious being and lets say I decide that I'm an animal, does the fact that this was my conscious decision make me an animal? Or Am I a human that just things he is an animal. My point is (probably) who Am I to decide what I am? If gender is a spectrum why should I be trusted that I know where I am on that spectrum?  And by animal I mean something cool like a wolf or a bear and don't come at me with that humans are animals too. You know how I mean it."

"Feminist theory isn¬¥t the only social theory that explains 'Gender'. Behaviorist have their own complicated explanation for your own and similar sexualities that differ from Feminist hipotesis. But personaly I find psychoanalytic theory explanations much more refined and precise. Even Freud¬¥s 100 year old explanation on sexuality is way better. Check out the Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (German: Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie), sometimes titled Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex, is a 1905 work by Sigmund Freud which advanced his theory of sexuality, in particular its relation to childhood.  Psychoanalytic theory postulates that a particular sexual drive, the principal component for 'gender' has definite characteristics: the source, the intensity, the object, and the goal. Feminist theory ignores every other aspect of gender as defined by Freud, ultimately half-hearthedly recognising 'the source', which are biological components such as postulated on this video by you.  To answer the question 'what are you', i¬¥d need to go deeper and I don¬¥t consider it to be apropiate on the comment section of youtube, Though I would venture and say that the question is badly phrased. You are thinking of yourself as an object, you are not a 'What', but a 'Who'. 'What' is the domain of biology; 'Who' is the domain of Gender. Perhaps such objectification is the source of your misconceptions.   Ultimately, the point still stands. There are many more social theories that explain on detail different perspectives on why most feminist models on psychology are particularly wrong. Most of it has to do with the fact that feminism was first a political movement and then became a formal ideology.  Though there is middle ground, since there are a lot of psychoanalist that consider themselves feminist (though most would not agree with your conception of gender), I¬¥d recomend Julia Kristeva but only if you are familiar with the 3 essays.   Is not that the 'general public' is right. Is that acording to many other experts on the subject you are wrong."
"so when other youtubers say they work hard on their videos, what do they do exactly? This is quality production."
"My take on this is that, if what you say in the video is correct, we need less genders, not more. One human gender, and enforce the view that we are all the same. Unfortunately no one seems interested in this solution because it doesn't benefit them personally."

"Hey I live near the sculpture of a chair that nobody sits on!!! I really liked this video, it gave such a good insight into the matter. But I have questions!   I am of the view that a person's personality and character should have nothing to do with whether they are man or a woman (aka gender roles are bad). Therefore I fail to understand what 'gender identity' actually means - I say I am a woman because I have a vagina and not because I identify with society's idea of what a woman should be. Me being a woman has no bearing on who I am as a person.   However this seems to go against current thinking; that people have an innate gender identity which allows them to call themselves a man or a woman or neither as they wish. Is this not reinforcing the view that men and woman are a certain way (so if you dont act that way you're either trans or genderqueer, instead of just a woman who likes football for example)? I feel like I'm missing something important here in my understanding of gender so I would love if you could make a follow-up video on what 'gender identity' and 'gender expression' actually are."
"Man I love this guys videos, she always makes salient points and her jokes and surreal cutaways always hits the spot!  Keep up the good work dude!"
"I think gender is a spectrum, defined by social constructs that are rooted in biological traits. It would make sense for most cultures to view men as the dominant, given our evolutionary roots. Men generally have stronger bodies and it's really important to take advantage of those differences in a hunter gatherer context where survival is paramount on having every advantage you can against nature. It also seems to explain the relative expendability of men in society, as reproductively there's way less eggs than sperm, and pregnant women needed protection from predators in order to propagate the species. A big problem is that these days these biological factors are far less important, but they still play a disproportionately large role in society determining gender. I don't think that the archetypal biological man and woman will ever be categorically identical, but we've definitely got a ways to go in terms of adjusting how important biological factors are in determining gender to be more proportional to how relevant it actually is in this day and age."

"I really disagree with you about the nature of gender, I am one of those transgender fucks who think that gender is an innate part of the human psych. Yes a spectrum exists, and you have different definitions, but at the end of the day, gender is a real thing which exists. Just because there is a spectrum between, as you noted, ancestor bunnies and current bunnies, that doesn't mean that bunnies don't exist as a distinct category with their own characteristics.   That said, I appreciate your perspective. :)"

"Great video, once again!  I‚Äôve been guilty myself of falling into the trap of thinking of sex and gender as being binary, but I‚Äôve been trying to become more aware of my own bias lately.  In fact, there is scientific research showing that people who identify as non-binary or gender fluid actually have brain structures somewhere in between that of a typical biological female and a typical biological male.  That would explain why they don‚Äôt have any preference to any one particular gender identity.  Any ways, as a future doctor and ally, I want to continue to learn how to best serve the LGBTQ+ community and videos like this are immensely informative.

As you said *I T S  2 0 1 7* and I think no fucking behaviour, toy, sexuality, clothes item or frickin emotion should be seen as either female or male. Like what ever you want to like and be what ever you wanna be, I don't frickin care.

"Obviously this is a giant topic that many academic careers are devoted to, and you can hardly solve the puzzle in a twelve-minute video, but I try to make a couple good points, which is the most you can expect from a YouTube thing.  One thing I didn't talk about much is the relationship between gender and biology. Gender is a social construct, but it does have some relationship to biology (as does everything human, since we are organisms). By relationship, I do not mean, 'male hunters on the savannah provided for their families therefore it's natrul for men to have the white collar jobs.' I mean that gender as we know it is the culturally evolved form of a system designed to deal with our dual roles in sexual reproduction. But of course in typical human style it's now a whole baroque thing that has little direct relation to reproduction. It can, and I'd argue should, be altered. But that's a topic for another video."
