"Interesting,  a bit diffent. I'll ponder pon it."
"Thank you for making me laugh!! very well done!"
"The Taylor Swift cover by Bob Dylan is one of my favorite things in this world."
"Natalie‚Äôs description of the meaning of life actually made me cry ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Where's the love, honey? Thinking that almost everything in our lives is trash is kinda like the opposite to making ourselves to love others, to understand their love for stuff we don't like, to put ourselves in their shoes. As one of your latest videos said, we need to be more empathetic and try to stop thinking that almost everything is trash and shit."
"Italo Calvino wrote '... seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.'    Contrapoints does this so well. These videos are among my favorite pieces of not-inferno right now."
"I fucking love you so much."
"looking for things that are beautiful or strange? or laugh about it all? what about the obvious answer: drop all thoughts and CONSUME"
"I‚Äôm very happy to see that I‚Äôm not the only feminist who thinks a lot of so-called feminism is shit"
"Natalie: The Earth itself is mostly shit. Me: ...marry me..."
"Hilarious üëèüèª making men more like women fucking got meüëèüèª"
"Your yoga poses!! üòç‚ù§"
"‚ÄúThe earth itself is mostly shit‚Äù"
"I like the progress she‚Äôs made along the years. Go you girl!"
"Love love love"
"At 4:02 did you say Bj√∂rk?"
"0:37 CONTRA! How you so goddamn good at your job?! Fucking epic hahahhaha"
"You're the 1% of youtube that is not shit. Thank you for that."
"deserts are pretty damn cool though"
"Tori Kelly's face"
"I agree with the idea of turning men into women :D I'm a very feminine bisexual feminist and I simply love the natural beauty of being a woman exudes. That's one big reason why when it comes to sexuality, I'd rather be with a transgender woman than a transgender man."
"Shut the fuck up shut the fuck up shut the fuck up like nobody cares"
"'what we should be doing is trying to turn men... into women' some great foreshadowing there"
"I feel like there is less gender bending and general now that you have transitioned to a large part. I love Natalie, but I love this ‚Äòunblossomed‚Äô Natalie just as much."
"How did @exurb1a infiltrate that video?"
"the bob dylan impersonation is gold"
"I love seeing all the books we have in common"
"this video got by me! im so happy for new content :)"
"The taylor swift song, bob dylan style.... brilliant and so much fun :)"
"damn I want old contrapoints to come back..was so much funnier"
"The fact that earth is 95% shit is so extremely depressing. Its not inaccurate at all. most of Earth is molten lava, and then a small percentage of matter that exists on our planet actually exists in the livable parts, but then, of those livable parts there's another small percentage of space the we humans can actually live on! But then, its an even smaller percentage of living space that we as individuals can actually relate to and be a part of a small community. Oh well, i guess i can always go make youtube videos if I get depressed enough."
"Natalie you goofy fuck. I love your work and I wish you all the happiness in life."
"So who else paused to inspect the bookshelf? I can only approve having a whole shelf dedicated to German Idealism (bottom left hand corner)"
"OMG. LMFAO!"
"You'd actually make a good boxer. You have a very long arm span."
"I've never felt insulted by being called bossy."
"That is literally the best Bob Dylan impersonation I've heard since Frank Zappa. Kudos to you Contra!"
"Cvs music is the devil. Try hearing it everyday. Lol"
"i think there's bad feminism cos its an easily manipulated ideology. Also, if you did videos critiquing crazy feminists, only the crazy feminists will try to misrepresent you."
"i kinda like these more natural sounding rants don't get me wrong, the new ones are great, fun theatre, and got me hooked enough to go back, but these feel more conversational"
"hmmm not this one"
"Sorry to tell you, but contrapoints is just better when (s)he is a gay man!"
"The cucumber....Ha!"
"Whoa, Tchaikovsky's 1812 and La Pieta on the ending? What is this, a red-pilled Eurocentric nationalist fest?"
"I'm watching in 2019 cause I was curious where you came from"
"In other words, sturgeon's law always applies."
"Yoooo...sooo... i was here getting down with my shit... you know my intellectual freak on and i was like climaxing to this video... then you did something... something i may not be able to forgive. Well to put it straight i believe you just shat on Caligvla and well how might i phrase this politely... coughcoughienvokethewrathofthemotherupontheemayAnitarestherblessedlefteyeballuponyourcursedsoulcough... cough sorry eeeer throat just keeps... oh well,i'll be on my way cherio ^-^"
"If God had a wife and a daughter then real females would get better treatment.¬† We should all pray that God gets some conversion therapy."
"U deserve all the amout of likes in the world"
"I really want a compilation of Natalie's musical skits. She's very talented."
"No no, please don't consume the always panty liners that way. You might get an upset stomach, lol."
"3:39 Tfw when you, a man, think you've finally goten all that toxic masculinity poison out of you and then contra reminds you about your difficulty apologising"
"0:32 well played, TayTay, well played ."
"Stupid sexy boy sunburn."
"I now need Bob Dylan covering Taylor Swift in my life."
"Each new pledge is a triumph against the shitlords of interpocolypse (that's ancient greek for 'self consuming mediocrity'. direct translation, for real. I found it carved into a rock in the wreckage of an old, old wooden ship in Crete)."
"another good one"
"<3 u r da best xo"
"that electra heart album is still a bop"
"It's mad how much the lyrics to Trouble lend themselves to a Bob Dylan parody when done with his voice. They could genuinely be Dylan's. It's a bit in the vein of It Ain't Me Babe..."
"‚ÄúI love women! We should be trying to turn men into women!‚Äù Such eggy words, Nat"
"I need full length version of this Taylor Swift cover"
"Y‚Äôknow, people have whined to me about ‚Äú third wave feminism ‚Äú and my eyes glass over, because I don‚Äôt know a single feminist who has the exact same beliefs and concerns as another, let alone a whole group of us agreeing about a group agenda. You say ‚Äú junk food feminism ‚Äú and right away I know just what you‚Äôre talking about. Great turn of phrase."
"95% of feminism is bullshit. Okay, accepted."
"whaaaaow, You're wonderful....."
"Honestly that Bob Dylan cover was spot on"
"the fucking lolita bit i died"
"oh my god you are so fucking hilarious i love you my queen"
"I think you criticising bad feminism would be good. It would be a chance for people to see that not all feminists sing the same tune and will mean less disgruntled liberals will be lead to the right. It would be like societies ignoring bad science communication. By not speaking out against the bad communication it kind of gives the message that they agree with it, or at least don't agree with it. Though a feminist criticising bad feminism would always have to finish with what they view a good version of the feminism they were critiquing would be. Much of how a scientist would discredit the flat earth and then affirm the globe model."
"Don't spray chemicals on insects"
"I still come back for the Bob Dylan impersonation."
"Big shout out to Tintern Abbey (6:48)"
"i think that feminisms are so expansive and diverse(?) that in it's nicest terms, it's a field of study rather than a perspective. well versed feminists could argue other feminists better than creepy dipshits on youtube ever could and i don't like the freedom to label it as any little group that supposedly represents it. so reductive and the easiest way to avoid accepting any part of it. is it not good to just join the conversation rather than just reject the entirety of it? especially with the domination of intersectional feminism that basically studies every human identity ever, it isn't so much an opinion as a field of study, a goal for social justice and really only 'against' people who truly think that little markings of identity make people superior and inferior by the declaration of god or smth. not sure if i want to open the 'conversation' to everyone's opinion, though."
"The point about women not conforming to masculine ideals in pursuit of succes, is strangely close to something ive once heard jordan peterson say"
"3:00 hahahahaha hahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha hahahahaha!!!"
"1812 overture üëå"
"holy fucking shit i‚Äôve never loved anyone more than u"
"Damn, you should release this cover song from Taylor"
"I agree with most of these except turning guys feminine and girls stay feminine, no just no, I disagree bcs being 'women' or feminine at my place includes being a isolated housewife, obedient, passive, weak. Cant live in a world full of housewives :/ A middle ground is favourable, guys and girls at least can be independent, the rest... havent think about it..."
"OMG. I throw up. You are man. Not a woman."
"I ‚ù§Ô∏è U"
"do you work for starbucks?"
"That last part about the world being shitty and the meaning of it akin to looking for the small moments of joy and extasy was so apt that Imma send it to my suicidal friend because at this point this seems like the best advice he could get"
"omg the bob dylan cover. im dying"
"Yaaaaaas!"
"'what we should be doing is trying to turn men into women'  üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ"
"Hbomberguy and that Sean skull guy make fun of people for mispronouncing and misspelling words ALL. THE. TIME.  Do you make fun of them too?"
"That bob dylan cover sounded like that 'i am the glibglabglobgalab'"
"That bob dylan cover sounded like that 'i am the glibglabglobgalab'"
"She went full exurb1a in this video"
"A lot of the psycho advice you mention is actually just teaching normal, assertive, and boundary setting behavior. The point is that women are seen as angry or crazy whenever they stand up for themselves, get mildly emotional, and say no. It's actually kind of ignorant  to say you like women they way they are when we generally act the way we do to avoid facing, in a lot if cases violent, misogyny. While 'take what you want when you want' is actually creepy ass advice, the majority of enabling that your average feminists do are behaviors that everyone should be practicing to live healthy, happy, and safe lives. Like not apologizing for your existence nor letting people harass you just to save their face. If we normalize women doing those things then they'll seem a lot less crazy to antifeminists eventually."
"‚ÄúI want men to turn into women‚Äù hmmmmmm maybe you‚Äôre projecting a little bit there? Lol"
"I‚Äôm ugly lazy and I can never get my eyeliner right lol"
"Interesting how much like William Moulton Marston (30's proto-feminist who created Wonder Woman and also the systolic blood pressure test with his two wives...  it was a thing) in this, especially as recards feminizing men (seeing traditionally 'feminine' virtues as universal virtues that men could do with a little more of).  The more things change..."
"I laughed the whole time. Just. The entire video is hilarious."
"I would love to have coffee with you one day."
"Loved the 'always consume' punü¶Ñ"
"Could you please sell albums of Bob Dylan-ified T-Swift covers, or...?  Please? If it's, like, the #1 thing I want out of life would that make a difference...?"
"Lmao this is so good"
"ur so hot"
"what about considering both that a woman is nurturing AND agressive. Marieanne Williamson talks about how we should be like moma bears in how we care for the earth. And I like that idea in that you don't have to choose one end of the spectrum either way."
"It's weird when you love both ContraPoints and shoe0nhead equally"
"tea sweeter than the forbidden sarcophagus juice"
"Bob Dylan covering Taylor Swift sounds like late Lou Reed."
"Who is here from 1998?"
"That idea you had at the end is exactly the idea I‚Äôve had for years. ‚ÄúLife sucks, can we do something fun now? While nothing bad is happening? Oops, too late. So, what are you doing tomorrow?‚Äù"
"https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/madonna and taylor was second."
"omgggg i love the bob dylan cover so much"
"I used to call myself an equalicist until I learned that feminism is supposed to be exactly that."
"3:50 with new context"
"I know you probably wanted to appeal to the men watching in saying this, and are certainly capable of critiquing problematic waves of feminism, but to say '95% of feminism is shit' is really, really, really concerning.  I understand that your'e talking bout the white, middle class, corporatized feminism that essentially equates feminism with being a mouthpiece for patriarchy, therefore bullshit, but we know that that sits on white male ears as a valid dismissal for it."
"Mad Props for Anita in the BG <3"
"6:28 BIG ASS FIN MOOD"
"That Bob Dylan bit blew my mind"
"That part where you said you were gonna turn all the men into women freaked me out cause I'm stoned and trans and that clip made me panic about shaving me. Well done."
"I feel undying resentment towards Bob Dylan‚Äôs music and that little ditty at the beginning almost made me mute the video :0 Very accurate parody, I must admit!  (nothing personal, but we have two of his cds on heavy rotation in the car and that‚Äôs too much dol byban for me)"
"First to woman to win the Grammy TWICE?! what next? first to win twice while wearing one shoe?  pat on the back, pat on the back, pat on the back."
"Loved the bob Dylan intro haha. Your music taste is fantastic"
"I've noticed most men I argue with on the internet about feminism only skimmed the surface of what it is. They learned about it through red pill blogs and shit. So, obviously they got the worst of it. Now they refuse to dig deeper into feminism, so they never learn."
"You represent my inner voice so accurately that I'm in this trance on lethe that makes me forget how to speak. Dammit!"
"I wish 2:50 was a regular character"
"Best ending ever. Thank you"
"6:33 I get the reference lol"
"4:35 TJ has recommended Contra's channel on his channel. :-D"
"You my friend are an intelligent legend."
"so brave of you to keep your sam harris on the shelf"
"'In the current year - 1998' Why did I laugh so much at that?"
"Damn, how can you be so reasonable, being a human?"
"I met a guy through Grindr and after fucking we started debating about feminism (yeah I can't avoid doing that sort of thing). Let it be said that I'm kind of an extremist feminist myself and the guy said that feminists were crazy assholes.  Trying not to rip his head off, I politely asked what took him there and he started criticizing TERFs. When I explained what TERFs are, and why I criticize them while still considering myself a feminist, he said 'Well, then all feminists should choose a representative each, sit on a table and debate until they all think the same. They can't continue like this'. Despite the fact that this individual is an ultimate airhead, I wish I had seen this video to be able to show it to him, instead of staring silently while wanting to kill myself."
"You remember that thing about Bob Dylan/Taylor Swift https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGUPF-uMuJE"
"Where were you all my life? And I'm scared how much I agree with everything you say... that's disturbing."
"Hey in my family my mom would give my father half of the whole dinner and the rest of us( 5 females) got the rest. When I won arguments with my dad in my youth he often would wrestle me to the ground and put me in a half Nelson. .. I needed feminism!"
"Rekt feminist  d e s t r o y e d"
"I love the riff at the end about Sturgeon's Law; 95% of _everything_ is shit. A prime whine!"
"I fucking love this!!"
"this isn't a good video to watch when you're going through a depressive episode"
"Hairless....?  üíáü§î"
"5:37 and onward"
"Natalie has done the impossible with this one single video: she's perfectly encapsulated why I still call myself a feminist, even though I really, REALLY hate what pop-culture feminism has become.  May your days be many and well, you wonderful lobster goddess."
"the fucking delaware turnpike"
"Hope you shifted on feminism now cause  saying that 95% of it is shit seems more than an exageration"
"SPOLIER ALERT:  I'm just here for the pad eating"
"bless. you. BLESS. i love u"
"the fact that this was ever suggested to me means the corporate owners are now afraid their zauberlehrlings can¬¥t handle the water anymore"
"you're an autogynaephiliac"
"These videos give me a small shred of hope. Also that bob dylan song was fricken hilarious"
"love the 'they live' reference lmao"
"I have that necklace I love that necklace it's so pretty! Also as a bunch lesbian you're just so pretty that's like 99% of the reason I want h yoiur stuff well not 99% more like 50% sorry I'm on a happiness kick rn and I 100% agree"
"Very humanist of u"
"You know, you're too clever for your own good. As much as I enjoy that, I can't bring myself to read the comments on your videos. Just sayin."
"Watching these two year old videos is like a movie where Natalie's twin brother tries to fill in for her without anyone noticing."
"5:10 e.g. I like riding motorbikes, but most of motorbike 'culture' is shit,  _especially_ Harleys:  why drive a tractor, why do they think making it louder makes it better, and why do the Harley boys think that nobody sees them as just overcompensating?"
"THANK YOU!!"
"I know, I know, this video is super serious and so are all the comments but...  at 4:11 any other Parker Wright fans?"
"I never thought about it like this before lol like, there is no reason that feminism should be perfect. Idk why I thought it should be now.... I believe in freedom, but the concept of freedom is in no way all good. Doesn't mean I should reject it though. Why do we do hold certain concepts like feminism and other civilising movements to a standard all other things cannot even meet?"
"Finally someone that sees my point of view. I agree 100%!!! Yes. Feminism has gone from believing in equality of the sexes and that understand equality doesn't mean the exact same, and went to this misogynist attitude that u must be exactly like a man to be equal instead of appreciating the beauty in femininity, and that masculinity is sometimes a weakness (like violence or unwarranted aggression), not a strength that women need to emulate, and ofc not all masculinity is toxic masculinity, and not all men are bad. Also accepting Islam ideology which often oppresses the LGBT, and women, is quite contradictory to feminism. (Not to say all muslims are bad, as not all take their religion seriously, view it in the same way, or practice it, but rather to say the ideology is bad, Muslim countries are oppressive, and to pretend it's not like many 'feminist' do is anti-feminist as well as anti LGBT.) I notice all movements seem to go this way, like many businesses, and many subcultures, and many other things. They start out w/ a pure cause, where they really stand for something, then once they're popular become corrupted, the very tribalism they were fighting against often envelopes them, and their ideas become mixed up and convoluted. Real feminism is good, and necessary but pop feminism is phoney, contradictory, and in alot of ways, both misogynist, and misandrist at the same time."
"You're just so funny!!!!!! XD"
"some exurb1a vibes starting from 5:40 or is it just me?"
"Your early videos are very Ze Frank vibe"
"5:16. SJW-s do the same to non-sjws so I guess 1:1 on that, baby."
"Bob Dylan covering Taylor Swift is great"
"I am glad that ugly girls are acknowledged. They seem to be invisible. I don't think we should be turning anyone into anything."
"If 95% of anything is bad, then it's bad."
"5:36-6:52 oh hi exurb1a, didn't expect to see you here"
"I vibe with this vid. :D boiiii get out of mah brain"
"Big red is the poster bitch for bad feminism."
"Could you imagine if women in their thirties complained about the music teenage boys listen to. That just sounds bizarre."
"That was an amazing cover btw"
"Turn woman into men? So ambition is a masculine trait? Why are we gendering inspirational quotes? 'Never take no for an answer' is obviously meant to be understood in an appropriate context."
"That final montage was genuinely beautiful. Well said."
"That was the Lou Reediest Bob Dylan impression I've ever heard."
"What's with you and Caligula?  I am new here and all the videos I  watched so far have the reference üòÇ"
"'We shouldn't be trying to turn women into men, what we should be doing is trying to turn men into women'"
"I think We should judge by dna"
"you are so fucking brilliant    i hope you move away from a limited circle of subject matter and branch out into perhaps theater or screenwriting ? xoxoxo"
"üëç"
"I am so fucking happy you exist üíû I love how you were a teacher stuck in a college professor box and now you still educate the masses but in your own way üî•"
"‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è I simply love you"
"I don't think that we should be telling men to be women or women to be men. We should just stop categorizing certain emotions and behaviors as female or male. Everyone has the same emotions. Men and women are encouraged by society to behave in different ways and display different emotions. Women can be aggressive and domineering and men can cry and be nurturing. This doesn't mean that the domineering woman is acting like a man or that the nurturing man is acting like a woman. They are acting like human beings."
"I love the choose of 1812 Overture as the background music. This is fabulous!"
"Ryan Adams https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcJ_ECyEK4I&list=OLAK5uy_np8VAtPqLCrI160usbo30Z3N4094ISS7E"
"This is an excellent point: at least 95% of anything is shit. That's why you should argue only with the best version of an argument. And if you can show that the best version is shit, you have shown that it is 100% shit. Then if someone says 'well 5% and 0% is not such a big difference', you should send him back to math class where you learn that 5% is infinitely greater then 0%'."
"Wow you were early on the Matt Lauer thing, nice."
"I don't think 90% of feminism is shit because most feminists aren't out there being asshole they're busy. I think the assholes get more attention as usual. You're average student female for instance, probably believes that rape should be taken more seriously and is probably pro choice and all that, but doesn't go out of her way to yell at people for no reason."
"That's amazing, you should tell people that, If only you ahd a platform. hahahahaha"
"This part of 99.999% of Youtube is kinda funny:-D You have a lot of shitty opinions(in other videos), but you know what? At least you seem like you are genuinely trying to be an objective middle ground and you actually have humor:-D"
"5:30-6:50 How I know you read that copy of Infinite Jest behind you"
"You are the voice of a non-impressed subset of a generation, of which I feel I am a part."
"I'm sorry but you lost me when you said Caligula is a shit movie"
"It's like you can say you're left wing (or even communist) and still think what happened in the USSR is terrible"
"1:28 'And it's hard, because it's not easy'. Fucking sold. That's a kind of reasoning even I can follow! <3 <3 <¬≥ <‚ÇÉ"
"As a Pennsylvanian who works in Wilmington, thank you for calling the Delaware turnpike out."
"holy shit is that an MF DOOM beat in the background at 4:14?"
"Thank you for this video. Entertaining and highly educational, as always. I feel like a better feminist. <3"
"there is good, bad and (a lot of) mediocre feminism because there are a lot of people identifying with it for all kinds of reasons, and people are fallible. (Other?) people should just accept that as humanity, not lump it all together and equalize the deeds and words of some as the deeds and words of all. Because that's just stupid."
"where can i download 1989 by bob dylan pls"
"i'm glad you've grown from hating the ocean to loving it in your incel video.i love the ocean, it hurts to see people hate it"
"how did you summarise all my existential dread into a bit at the end of a video about feminism... i love you"
"Buddhism!"
"So good! I think the main point here is that ridiculous displays of feminism distract people from verifiable feminist research models and important activism."
"That‚Äôs a good song!"
"this is the best vid on yt"
"I love you very much"
"5:37 exurb1a reference?"
"This was the best thing I've seen today."
"Clickbait feminism & anti-feminism are in codependence, something something Zizek *sniff*"
"My favorite part of this video is the artfulness"
"Lol @ Anita Sarkisian's framed picture."
"One ugly man"
"Are you as disappointed as I am about the reality of Pok√©mon Let's Go P(&E)? It seemed like what we always wanted. The original Pok√©mon game that we loved finally in proper 3D and with an actual Pok√©ball you can use to catch pok√©mon??? FUCK the 8 year old that has veto power over my brain was losing her shit. Should have looked at the title more closely. UNNNGH *headdesk* ... especially since I haven't enjoyed a new game since Gold & Silver, why do I need to mega-evolve anything and who decided to plan the shopping city like a massive Pok√©ball? WHY DO YOU KEEP GETTING THAT PART WRONG?!?! Sorry, I hate that one. Whichever one it was. Jesus, when are we getting an original grey brick GameBoy rerelease, I want to use my old cartridges. /baked90skidramble"
"I'm fucking dead at the Bob Dylan impression. You're a genius."
"I had a full blown panic attack when you started talking about how everything is shit. But I still fucking love you."
"This was a VERY exurb1a-esque video"
"This is very reminiscent of the book 'we were feminists once' by Andi Zeisler. I encourage anyone interested in the topic of 'pop feminism' (or how feminism has been commodified) to read it."
"thank God, I'm not the only non sexist who can't stand Taylor Swift. I don't mind feminism being a forefront for a music career. Pink and Janelle Monae do it fine.  Something about Taylor just irks the shit out of me. idk what it is. Hell, I even like Katy Perry an Rhianna though they cant sing;their hella chill. On pop feminism, I totally agree. How have  MRA been THAT RETARDED to think that feminists aren't aware that capatalism and coporations has high jacked feminism to use for marketing skemes?"
"I love you. It's okay to have to take a shit."
"Teach me your eyeliner wizardry"
"Did she delete her streams where she watched her old videos?"
"2:49 oh okay"
"God. I can't believe I watched so many of your videos and didn't realise you'd weirdly anti-feminist and complaining about women becoming 'masculine' with no regard to the power imbalances which require direct and assertive behavior. If women stayed 'feminine' they wouldn't be voting right now. Instead just wanting men to be more 'feminine' is ridiculous because they LITERALLY HAVE SOCIAL POWER OVER WOMEN NO MATTER HOW THEY BEHAVE. Saying that the assertiveness that feminists encourage women to have is 'rapey' is an extreme, laughable, and painful reach."
"Feminism is the advocacy of womens rights on the grounds of social, political, and economic equality. I do not partake in advocacy or activism of any sort, so I am not a feminist, but I believe in and support equality for everyone."
"My idea is to cry myself to sleep while reading Schopenhauer and Cioran after laughing at memes about Schopenhauer and Cioran."
"wonderful content, thank u  üíï ü§òüèº"
"3.50 'what we should be doing is turning men into women.'   I'll be honest, before I watched a video where you said you came out as trans relatively recently, well after you started this channel, I had no idea you needed to come out."
"Wow I just started following you, your props and lighting has come so far but you've always been great!"
"Except TJ Kirk/The Amazing Atheist doesn't sit there and talk about feminism 24/7. He talks about a lot of subjects and has criticized both the left and right on plenty occasions. Also, who the fuck cares how old he is? Comparing him to people attacking Justin Bieber, who is popular among young girls, implies that feminism is something primarily for young girls when it isn't. 'Those' people like TJ aren't attacking 19 year old girls, contrary to what you want to tell yourself."
"its 2am cool it with the scary shit"
"Hello from india.  I wish that there was a 'Love' button instead of just 'like'. Love your channel. My boyfriend introduced me  to it."
"You are fucking brilliant!"
"Empty space doesn't really exist."
"Best Bob Dylan impression ever"
"this is so grade A content. Congrats, you're not part of the 99% of shit"
"That Dylanesque Tay cover was amazing"
"Thank you for the Dylan bit.  :)"
"i love how you used an image of the caligula poster when you said 95% of movies are shit XD. also, can we get a full length bob dylan cover of 'trouble when you walked in?' that was hilarious and sounded very dylan-y. it's stuck in my head now haha"
"Loved the sequence with the black and white films, that was hilarious but I'm also interesting in watching them, anyone know the sources?"
"Ok but the part where you said longing for childhood and showed Pok√©mon I actually cried I hate growing up"
"more bob dylan impersonations!"
"They say pop feminism and I say poop feminism"
"i find those dove ads so insulting and patronizing."
"......i dunno if I agree completely. I generally pretty much LOVE your videos, but the idea that most feminism these days would somehow be complete trash....no. not really. I mean sure, pop feminism has absolutely flooded a lot of pop culture repackaging the idea of female and male equality into something someone can sell.  Like Dove who pretend to be all for that confidence in the countries where that sells while all in for the skin bleaching in the countries where that sells.  Still, I wouldn't deem all new age feminism to be bullshit shit out by twisted companies. I think now we are making progress within intersectionality for example, and also the MeeToo movement uncovering sexual harassment everywhere. And of course, I know I know , globally we have along way to go. And the constant focus on white rich womens issues is not really bringing help where it is most needed. STILL tho, I gotta say, to just bash third wave feminism alltogether probably just helps the wrong agenda. At least in my experience. Love, My name."
"1:13 lol <3"
"OMG FINALLY SOMEONE ELSE AGREES The 'No True Scotsman Fallacy' is not a valid fallacy!!!!"

"Five minutes in before I noticed the framed picture. WLL PLAYED."
"Feminism broke the first law of any cultural movement: never become popular.  Once it became popular, all the normies and power-hungry sociopaths wanted in on it. The normies wanted an instant 'feel good about yourself' button they could pin on their jacket, and the sociopaths love nothing more than to point at people they want to eliminate and shout words which make them go away. Words like 'traitor' 'heretic' 'jew' 'communist' 'misogynist'  Thankfully, it seems to have ground to a halt before calling someone a woman hater got you insta-banned from everywhere or executed in some gulag or concentration camp."
"Our society doesn't reward you for being feminine, in the same way that striving to act 'masculine' (like being a CEO etc) does. The goal up to now has been to get women a seat at the success table, and that has meant having 'masculine' aims. It would be good to start discussing what successful femininity looks like. I'd prefer a society that isn't driven by 'getting to the top' type aims."
"3:30 I've heard it called the 'Cinderella Fallacy'- that we hate Disney princesses as weak because their strength comes from feminine traits like compassion, which is inherently misogynistic"
"I think that Bob Dylan shudders every time this video plays, and he's not sure why"
"If our paths cross someday, I'd love to share a drink with you. Keep up the Great Work."
"Like sex, even bad feminism is better than no feminism."
"AHHHH YESSSS contrapoints you have amazing taste, at 6:48 that was a clip of Dreams by Akira Kurosawa!! That is my personal favorite of his"
"that comment about people who did videos about justin beiber all the time  Oh I used to watch so many cringe worthy ranters who were like that thankfully I've changed my youtube subscription palette in recent years"
"Do you honestly believe that continue acting ‚Äúlike women‚Äù will make men act the same? They‚Äôll keep doing what they‚Äôve been doing forever if they don‚Äôt feel pressure. Girls, eat the world."
"Omg there needs to be entire albums of various parody current pop songs in the voices of classic rock stars... that is the best... I'm crying laughing and I need more..."
"This was an amazing video!!!!"
"Bob Dylan T-Swift killed me. Love it!"
"Agreed that it's almost seems as if modern feminism hates the idea of feminity. I don't want feminism to be completely eradicated from the earth, but I also wanna be able to wear cute pastel and frilly things!"
"Adding this one to my favorites. Oof that second half. <3"
"The tail end of this video was one of the best I've seen, great use of Tchaikovsky"
"Contrapoints what is feminism? I honestly don‚Äôt know"
"0:55 Best poster ever."
"That beginning transported me to a Chris Fleming video. Now that I think of it contra is kind of the love child of political and social analysis and Chris Fleming"
"that bob dylan thing was SO on point!"
"There is NO such thing as joyless intoxication. Stop spreading lies you hairy legged feminist!"
"'trying to turn men into women' I am onboard, creepy ambient music included."
"Huh... a contrapoints vid that I actually don't agree with (at least not fully), I think that women should be able to challenge feminine stereotypes even if they are being perceived as being more 'masculine'. Because only then will people be able to see that gender stereotypes begin to lose their power, however women can be perceived as acting more 'masculine' without being complacent to a culture that is founded on toxic masculinity. As for Taylor Swift, look getting mad at a pop star's Grammy speech is to me stupid and trite, we shouldn't be asking why is Taylor congratulating herself for being the first woman to win album of the year, what we should be asking is why it take so long for woman to win Grammy for album of the year. When it comes to celebrities congratulating themselves for their success, it will always be perceived as a self-serving lecture whether it's a white woman being first female artist to win Grammy or a person of color being the first African-American actor/actress to win an Oscar. It's important to remember that their success doesn't exist in vacuum and it can pave the way for more representation of women and people of color."
"Singing songs in the style of Bob Dylan is one of my favorite things to do in the world."
"YES!! I found myself making exactly the same point! Sturgeon's law (90% of everything is shit) explains why we see so much bad feminism... I love you!"
"I've been waiting death for quite some time. I can't seem to waste away fast enough so i spend my time observing. To process existence and derive my own fantasies from them...that is what gives meaning. It isn't in just the special, it is in everything. I seek knowledge of as much of as many ideas as possible. Meaning of life, as i see it, is to experience the black and white of the world"
"I've watched only three of your videos, but I'm pretty sure I looooove youuuuu"
"Crocodiles aren't dinosaurs, birds are."
"you are way to nihilistic - meaning is not found by created, and you seem to found in being miserable on youtube - possibly in real life if this is not an act   if you keep on saying nonsene you will start to believe it"
"That Dylan impersonation was impressive"
"The last few minutes are so much like Exubr1a"
"'But that's rapist advice!' 10/10 would self hate myself into being a better person again."
"Mommy, can you please marry me when I grow up big and strong like you? Why do you always have to be right?"
"that 'misogynistic strain' line is soooo true. I'm suprised this video is so old tho whoops... like when some women say that women had to stay home with the kids and trying to make it seem like women had no place in history is total nonsense... they don't believe a woman is powerful unless shes a 'king' or a 'CEO.' Women have taken at times, roles more in the background but that doesn't mean they weren't absolutely essential. They also overlook the queens that have ruled with an iron fist throughout history."
"I fucking love that you have a framed picture of Anita Sarkeesian"

Do not remove the Aeon counter code.Content       Light pollution is often characterised as a soft issue in  environmentalism. This perception needs to change. Light at night  constitutes a massive assault on the ecology of the planet, including us. It also has indirect impacts because, while 20 per cent of electricity is used for lighting worldwide, at least 30 per cent  of that light is wasted. Wasted light serves no purpose at all, and  excessive lighting is too often used beyond what is needed for driving,  or shopping, or Friday-night football.¬†The electric light bulb is  touted as one of the most significant technological advancements of  human beings. It ranks right up there with the wheel, control of fire,  antibiotics and dynamite. But as with any new and spectacular  technology, there are invariably unintended consequences. With electric  light has come an obliteration of night in much of the modern world;  both outside in the city, and indoors during what was once ‚Äònight‚Äô  according to the natural position of the Sun.Life has evolved for  several billion years with a reliable cycle of bright light from the  Sun during the day, and darkness at night. This has led to the  development of an innate circadian rhythm in our physiology; that  circadian rhythm depends on the solar cycle of night and day to maintain  its precision. During the night, beginning at about sunset, body  temperature drops, metabolism slows, hunger abates, sleepiness  increases, and the hormone melatonin rises dramatically in the blood.  This natural physiological transition to night is of ancient origin, and  melatonin is crucial for the transition to proceed as it should.We  now know that bright, short-wavelength light ‚Äì blue light ‚Äì is the most  efficient for suppressing melatonin and delaying transition to  night-time physiology; meanwhile, dimmer, longer-wavelength light ‚Äì  yellow, orange, and red, from a campfire or a candle, for example ‚Äì has  very little effect. Bright light from the Sun contains blue light, which  is a benefit in the morning when we need to be alert and awake; but  whether we are outdoors or indoors, when bright, blue light comes after  sunset, it fools the body into thinking it‚Äôs daytime.I expressed  the first serious concern about the potential health consequences of  electric light at night 30 years ago, when I asked whether over-lighting  might increase the risk of breast cancer.  It was during the 1980s, just as researchers were finding that a fatty  Western diet might not much alter the breast-cancer risk in individuals,  that a friend from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in  Seattle pointed me to research on the impact of melatonin. Lowered  levels of melatonin (an effect of over-lighting) had been traced to  heightened levels of oestrogen (at least in rodents), a clear  breast-cancer risk factor when fatty diets were not. Later evidence has shown that women who work the night shift are at higher breast-cancer risk. Evidence suggests  that circadian disruption from over-lighting the night could be related  to risk of obesity and depression as well. In fact, it might be that  virtually all aspects of health and wellbeing are dependent to one  extent or another on a synchronised circadian rhythmicity, with a  natural cycle of bright days and dark nights.Putting a finer point on the risk is ‚ÄòThe New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness‚Äô, published  in 2016. The atlas uses data from NASA‚Äôs Suomi National Polar-orbiting  Partnership satellite to estimate skyglow across the globe. The images  in the atlas are either dazzling or horrifying, depending on how you  look at it. In its coloured maps of cities and countries, using brighter  colours to show greater skyglow, Europe and North America appear  ablaze. According to the atlas, the Milky Way cannot be seen at night by  one-third of humans. In Europe, it‚Äôs not visible to 60 per cent of  people, and in North America, it‚Äôs a whopping 80 per cent."

"3:50 Pfft, I like masculine women, hairy women who burp, fart, and play D&D. And they should have dicks too goddamnit! We need MOAR hyenas!"
"Holy shit... I almost _always_  dig you and your content. When the Bob Dylan doing Taylor Swift came on I died!!!üëª I actually do that... Sing random songs in Bob Dylan voice.  Thank you for keeping your channel educational yet super funny and honest.   I adore you! Would love to make you dinner one night and have a conversation as well as do one another's makeup til the wee hours of the morning!"
"Fuckin thank you!!!!"
"I'm getting some Mira Sorvino vibes from you. I love your channel."
"I just don't understand how you don't have more attention, your channel is just absolute golden political/philosophical commentary sprinkled liberally with horror and sex, it's AWESOME."
"i love you so much! I know Im a bit late to the ContraPoints party but your videos are thoughtful, incisive and entertaining.  Thank you!"
"Lol I like ur version of the song way more than the original"
"This is the third time I've watched this video and every time I get to about the 4 minute mark I think of this meme: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442356998957432862/464196805564039189/DGpXM3wXsAUJWyw.jpg"
"Tried to learn how to play harmonica once till the dogs in my house wanted sing along..."
"I think i disagree with your turning women into men thing.  Its more about how women can have traits associated with men,  and that certain attitudes who are seen as positive in men should also be seen as positive in women.  For example many women are uncompromising but are told this is a negative in a woman but a positive in a man.  And there are certain circles of feminism that ask why?  Why should it be a negative trait for women to take initiative, while its a positive for men.  I feel like its the equivalent of getting the idea that women can work in all the jobs men work socialy accepted.  Its trying to get the idea that men can be leaders uncompromising ruthless etc socially accepted.  In my mind its just people trying to destroy gender roles"
"god this is getting ridiculous but fuck it, shame is cool here but not in the fatty context? you are a great intellect but you are running the risk of just playing an ambiguous game of connect the dots... but shit you need to eat more big macs."
"I just really agree with this video"
"I think I'm in love with you. Thank you for exploring these subjects in such a smart and funny way. Also, I love the way you expose your self-loathing and there are a lot of other things I wanna say but my native language is Spanish so I feel kinda of restricted by English when it comes to telling you how fucking awesome I think this is :)"

"Feminism expoooooosed"
"I love this channel. We need more content like this!"
"I think feminism just needs to have some of the good apples denounce the bad apples cough Anita Sarkeesian cough so feminists can focus on actually problems people are facing in 3rd world countries."
"The last minute and a half reminded me an exurb1a video."
"Omg the Bob Dylan was perfect"
"The Bob Dylan bit had me rolling"
"How is 'No true feminist' not a real fucking fallacy???"
"I want your babies, Natalie."
"Feminism is Sexism .Period"
"Yes and what is the 5% thats not shitty feminism. And what of female  privilege do we ever get to talk of that shadow that also causes so much destruction and ugly in this world. Opps too taboo!!! That's why feminism sucks, it cares not at all about the feminine shadow just only to blame MEN as the only shadow in this world. Just ideological stupefying BS"
"Do you know Exurb1a? Do you like it? Was there a reference to his video style in your video? If so, was it ironicaly or was it a good kind of reference? It felt like an ester egg to me.... If you don¬¥t know his chanel, please visit Exurb1a and tell me what you think!  By the way... excelent work you!! Congrats!"
"That was brilliant. Especially the ending 1-2 minutes"
"I don't live in the USA but I do go there sometimes.  I've only been to a Walgreens, but I keep hearing about this CVS as well!  A place where they play weird music and print out long ass receipts.  It makes me want to check it out sometime!"
"This video is garbage. The Delaware Turnpike is only like 10 miles long, stop complaining. Sheesh."
"A world where it's okay to apologize and care about other people...  that's Canada."
"Ah yes, good old Sturgeon's Law: 90% of everything is crud."
"could someone tell me what the background music at 1:14 - 2:12 please?  heard it in a few of contra's videos and in something else but i must know what it is!!!"
"That took a weirdly intense turn."
"That was pretty vague. You say that feminism is '95% shit' and yet other than suggesting man hatred is part of it, you don't give any solid examples. Yeah I know you also said you don't want to get into it and risk being like 'them' but that's a bit of a cop-out. What exactly is it that you think is shit?"
"Im really grateful Contra hasn't deleted these old, pre transition vids <3 they are so good and seeing someone transition can be such good inspiration for others."

"Yeah, feminism did some good stuff but it has done and is doing some bad stuff that isn't just harmless stupid posts. Some of the crazies actually have real institutional power which goes mostly unchecked. Most of the stats they sight are complete fabrications or gross misrepresentations. When you compare fem stats to actual stats it is kinda funny until you realise the fem stats are the ones being taken seriously."
"Ooooh, a 'They Live!' reference! You are my favourite degenerate!"
"Interesting how the words at the end are secular but the visual apex is all religious imagery. Christian much, contra?"
"as always, I am scaroused."
"Oh shit that last minute"
"3:47 , I couldnt agree more Contra! Some feminist really do seem to resent femininity. I dont want to become more manly, I like being feminine. Which has been my biggest reason to not call myself a feminist over the years, and even at times resenting feminism. If you want to have children and stay at home with them, care for your husband, be in a traditionally female job, you are seen as some feminist as weak and part of the patriarchy etc. You have internalized misogyny they will say. I constantly get asked why I (who had good grades in school) became 'just a nurse'. Like that is not something to be valued, like taking care of and nurturing people isn't as valuable as making lots of money or something (like engineers, doctors, lawyers etc do, granted a lot more women have become doctors now it was to begin with only males who did it).   I still don't call myself a feminist for that very reason, although I do realize there are many feminists out there that do not think this way."

"People probably won't read this, and it will probably sound like I am whining, but I will post it anyways, because I am hoping to get some advice and I need to get it off my chest. I was commenting on this person's post about their generalization and pointed out that their statement was counterproductive to what they wanted to achieve. They responded to my post by ridiculing me and saying that I did not understand.  This resulted in a few back and forth posts until this person blocked me and then made a post calling me a false ally to Feminism and said that I was trying to make Feminism about me. I feel that she is being extremely childish about the whole thing, but I cannot get it out of my mind. This person feels like they are the stereotype of what people think Feminism is, but I don't want to leave the situation as is, but I feel that if I do continue it, it just gives this person more power.  Basically, I want to ask people what they think I should do. Yes this is a bad place to ask about it, and I probably sound like I am a special snowflake who got my feelings hurt, but I am genuinely confused as to what to do. I want to stop thinking about it, but my mind is fixating on this and it won't let go. Again I know I sound pathetic, but am just hoping for some way to find some closure. Sorry if you hate me for this post, but I understand. No one wants to deal with another person's problems.  Contra on the very off chance you see this post, sorry for using your video to get some therapy I just thought your viewers would be smart enough to give me some advice. You are awesome and I hope you keep up the good work!"

"I mean, in a way isn't having an extremely successful female musician show how far feminism has brought the western world? It doesn't mean there is no need for any kind of feminism anywhere for the end of time but it could just be said in part T-Swizzle is admitting that the previous feminist movements allowed her to receive the kind of respect she garners today."

"Not trolling, seriously, but if genders are social constructs, and I believe so, then what's the point of even talking about femininity or feminine traits? The most we could say is 'traits that, in our culture, have been traditionally asociated with females'. Don't you think? I mean, is not that there are trates that are innherently feminine, or that women are predetermined to have certain traits. Other wise we are falling in the realm of biologistic ideas."

"Taylor Swift does get a disproportionate amount of  passionate hate tho.  I don't like her music particularly but I feel sympathy towards her because I think that a lot of what pisses people off about her is the fact that she is 'girly' and that she has a teen girl- type of fandom."
"Ah, the joy of discovering a good youtube channel!"

"Dear Contra  Every. Single. Video of yours is a frickin masterpiece.  Thank you!  P"
"Ryan Adams of Whiskeytown did a whole album cover of Taylor Swift's 1989 and I think that's the closest we'll get to Dylan singing about Jake Gyllenhaal being a vinyl hipster, other than your version, obviously. Sidenote: Taylor is a cold blooded, calculated, filthy capitalist born to a 4th generation banking family worth hundreds of millions who makes even more millions by ruthless control and maintenance of her ginned up image as some Tennessee girl next door.   This article about the whole charade is pretty fascinating: https://medium.com/@DevinR127/we-need-to-talk-about-taylor-swift-for-a-moment-349905905110  Also, does anyone remember the series on Current TV (around 2008ish?) where Sarah Haskins satirized commercials featuring women and products for women and the stereotypes of women that they present? I believe it was called 'Target Women'. Her style is similar to your snark and humor, but, IMO your production value, creativity, and talent actually surpass hers and she had a whole team of people and that Al Gore/Current TV money. I say all that to say you are a goddamnit treasure. Stay golden, girly!"

"The Bob Dylan-segment is simply fantastic."
"corporate 'feminist' messaging is co-optation...we recognize this play elsewhere....we do not blame male activists (good ones) for corporations selling rebellion back....we SEE that without blaming victims.....not so with feminism....which like every other arena has a right wing tendency and a deep co_optation process happening."

"Funny enough, more and more men are starting to come to the conclusion that those man-hating trans-exclusionary radical feminists (who are somehow almost all white) aren't actually so bad because at least they hate trans people, especially trans women, with a burning passion too. And the radfems find that their new unlikely allies, woman-hating men, are kind of peachy. Because at least they're not trans women, who are literally worse than cis men. The new opponent for both are those trans-accepting and trans-enabling (trans- and sex-positive) SJW 'fun feminists', who are now somehow overly hedonist and not political enough, while yesterday, when Obama was still our overlord, they were still 'stop having fun guys' and too political, and they kind of still are. Because fuck logic lol.  There's nothing like feminists who are actually somehow really into reactionary patriarchal thinking about gender and other things. That's what White Feminism is like, I guess. I mean, there are TERFs who LITERALLY defend Stormfront.  And I just realised that this video was published exactly a year ago. Yay!"
"Damn, I didn't get the Starbucks joke until know."

"They are already trying to turn men into women (no, not literally). In academia the numbers of women keep rising, if girl fall behind in a subject the subject need to be reformed because it obviously something wrong about how it's being taught, but if boys fall behind that's just because boys typically are dumb, and if they got a problem with that you state will issue you a certificate to drug the personality, joy and life out of our children till they behave like girls."

"Great video, thank you ! :D I really like the point you made on feminism pushing on embracing values associatied with males. I got here from the1janitor, very glad he recommended your video !"
"why the fuck is he so cute?"
"Although I definitely disagree with many of the antifems who assert that nobody should be feminist, I don't know if I necessarily agree with countering the point by saying everybody should be feminist. Ultimately, does any ideology have a monopoly on basic human rights? Is there anything lost by not subscribing to some type of feminism save the fact that it perpetuates a negative (and sometimes deserved) caricature of the movement? I'd genuinely be interested to hear others' responses to shed some light on the matter.   edit: I also loved the points made about pop feminism and the Bob Dylan bit. This channel is among YouTube's best kept secrets:)"
"Oh wow, your content is great."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there. I agree that 95% of everything is shit, but you used Caligula as an example of one of innumerable shitty movies. As a decent film critic and slightly below-average director of shitty little short films that I never want anyone to see, I take offense to that. Caligula is a really great movie. Yes, it's extremely uncomfortable to watch, but then again so is Salo: the 120 Days of Sodom. Actually, Salo is like a million times worse! I actually vomited during it and I'm the type of person who watches Eraserhead and enjoys the experience (it's an amazing movie, but it's also intentionally abrasive, diseased, strange, off-putting, terrifying and uses ludonarrative synchronization masterfully; but due to our protagonist's life the sound design makes me want to dig out my eardrums in the best possible way). I assume you think it's shit due to the way it reflected the eponymous character's moral degradation and lack of compassion as he learns to just let sex (both consensual and non-consensual) and violence rule his city. Yes it's deeply disturbing, but it also really makes you feel like one of his advisors watching helplessly as the city is enveloped in Caligula's anarchic, depraved and aggressive rule. If you think it's shit for some other reason, I'd love to talk about it. I try to never miss a conversation about film with someone with a mind who can understand the art behind it. Who knows, maybe you'll even spread your philistinism to me (facetious of course, I really respect your opinion and enjoy your content)."

"Some younger feminists go too far but I'd rather these young people go too far in the right direction than too far in the wrong one."
"Zomg it's almost like there's Capitalistic Feminism, and Socialistic Feminism. I think the idea that laziness is inherently bad should be unpacked. Most people I know when they're being 'lazy', they're really just exhausted and need a rest, or less hours at work, or a vacation, and once they've rested they're itching to go again. Or someone's job might be unfulfilling and repetitive (soon to be replaced by robots), and their brain is just not engaged. And the cornerstone of the 8 hour work week is being overturned and reversed by tech companies and law firms that much their employees to work 50, 60, or 70 hour weeks. The distinction is similar to that of self-respect and arrogance, where is the line? There isn't any, or depends where you're standing. I think laziness should be celebrated, even mandatory. Take that goddamn vacation, Dave!"

I'm a feminist. I'm so different. I'm a martyr. I'm special. No one is like me' or 'I'm an antifeminist. I'm being attacked for existing. I'm a republican. I'm so different. I'm a martyr. I'm special. No one is like me' THEY ACT SO DIFFERENT. AND HATE EACHOTHER. Deep down. They're all the same."

"The last minute of the video. *thumbs up*"
"Hmm. Well put. I think. I do get pissed off by the whole identity political ideology shite that passes for social commentary these days, but you keep making me realise that I am being too black and white about it. Stop it at once, I like being full of critical hate for things and you're just ruing it. Although anything that stop  me becoming a fedora wearing 'nice guy' is probably a good thing. So don't stop it."
"I don't think the feminist  messages such as 'girls be lazy' don't literally cherish girls who are lazy.And other similar messages don't actually tell women to be psycho-paths. Besides society being more generous towards lazy, ugly, psychotic men than women with similar traits,  Korea  or other countries does seem to go even further. Korean tv programs portray lazy, ugly and stupid men as innocent, safe(since he's so unpopular he wont exploit you like so-called relatively attractive 'bad guys'.Which is very far from true.)and as someone who has this ‚úåfree‚úåsoul that  any societal obligation cannot bridle this wild, unworldly creature.(But then why would these guys become extremly conservative when it comes to issues like sharing household chores?),thereby enforcing the message that a 'well-adjusted'girls would find even these guys somewhat cute and attractive.Not only  that, men who constantly look down on minorities and abuse animals say that women should love animals/children. In this context I would proudly shout out 'Good girls go to heaven and bad girls everywhere'. But I do agree that this 'feminism  matters' account's use of word like'ugly' is indeed problematic."

"Ps, I'm actually associates with Big Red. I'd highly advise against anyone, especially people trying to defend feminism, using her image as a visual shorthand for bad feminism. She's not a radfem, and if you listen to her side of the story about the infamous video from the MRA protest, she wasn't even really all that in the wrong. I get that it's expedient to distance yourself from a shrill woman with dyed hair, but it's giving credence to a completely bullshit antifem narrative. Not to mention it further dehumanizes someone who is already getting death threats on the regular, when her greatest crime was losing her patience with a bunch of sealioning assholes several years ago. Maybe use someone like Valarie Solanas?"
"Your Bob Dylan is a lot like the irl Tom Petty"

"Your channel SERIOUSLY deserves more subscribers. This is one of the best videos Ive seen on YT, the production value alone deserves viewers. The fact some ranting, overcompensating assholes in fedoras have over 5 times the traffic is a sad state of affairs. Maybe people in the sane left know better than to waste time on YouTube worrying about what teenage girls on tumblr and the sexually frustrated, bile spewing guys who feel threatened by them think about the world but someone had to stand up and say this. Thank you for bringing a much needed, sane, witty, eloquent, non-reactionary response to this ridiculousness and reminding us that we're all mostly assholes."

"I fucking love your Sarkeesian portrait."
"At 2:54 you say  'should we really be celebrating laziness and incompetence, if we support people who can't get their eyeliner right, how are they supposed to learn and improve we need shame. Shame!'. Doesn't this point contradict your points in your fat acceptance video? I'm a little confused and trying to stay consistent. If you could please explain how these are different issues that would be great! thank you."
"I don't consider myself a feminist because of Pop feminism and the majority's reaction towards it, however I do share so many feminist and liberal views I probably should. I think I prefer to just be me though and not associate myself with any group or organisation because like you said 95% of it will be total shit and that's what people will think of when they see it."
"god that framed photo of anita on ur bookshelf made me lose my shit. ur amazing thank u so much"
"ayyyyyy talking about nuanced issues like this - normally called whitewashed feminism or white feminism for shorthand (no it is not specifically targeting white people who are feminists - it's just a fucking short hand)"
"Oh the 'They Live' reference, brilliant."
"Hilarious video and very well made points. I'm not a feminist but your video really resonates with me and my views on feminism."
"I don't know. There's a lot I disagree with in this video, CP. Isn't there a difference between shaming and constructive criticism? I wouldn't think shaming is productive over trivial matters like getting your makeup applied in standard fashion. And isn't it too essentialist to ascribe commanding and dominating attitudes to masculine? Additionally, isn't it just a difference of opinion as to whether promoting those traits in people is useful? Anecdotally, from my perspective there does seem to be some correlation between being aggressive and being successful. I don't know whether such behavior is typically ethical, though. However, that likely depends on what ethical system you subscribe to and what is really meant by being aggressive.   Which brings me to my next question: although you may have been joking, but assuming you weren't, does the idea of 'not taking no for an answer' (among other things you mentioned in that segment) mean to those giving that advice what you take it to mean here? I just don't think that's what is meant. Your interpretation seems uncharitable.   Lastly, although I don't know if Taylor Swift is breaking glass ceilings in the music industry considering the fact that there are many successful award-winning female artists in the music industry, how does pointing out the oppressed status of anyone else take away from that achievement if she was? How does the status of people who have it worse demand that more privileged women not boast about their achievements or point out problems that concern them? Isn't that a fallacy of relative privation? I was under the impression that the intersectionality of feminism meant giving consideration to those of various backgrounds including the typical, privileged, middle-class white woman, not to the disparagement and exclusion of white women who have it better.  I don't know. Maybe I'm one of those feminist you would strongly disagree with, or maybe I misunderstand you. Nonetheless, although I acknowledge problems in any basic belief or, what's more, any complicated ideology adopted by 'casuals' like myself (because after all, most people either aren't that smart or aren't going to research too far into the ideology like an academic such as yourself will), I want to say that I'm not sure if it's worth bemoaning. After all, as I said, it's inevitable. As an idea spreads, 'stupid people' and the half-hearted are bound to make up the demographics of those promoting it at some point. Look at the bulk of atheists and theists, both of whom make terrible arguments supporting their beliefs, and many of whom aren't trained to appreciate, explain, or understand the science they sometimes cite. Liberals and conservatives too, as well as anarchists and libertarians, all have the 'casual base' that will have a limited understanding of what they propose. Yes, criticize them should they go overboard in ways like leaving shit posts on someone's Twitter or YouTube video, but other than that, what else is there to do?"
"fuck i hate dove"
"What's the clip at 4:51 from?"
"Noob question: How is 'no true feminist fallacy,' 'not a fallacy'? What definition of fallacy are we working with here?"
"Actually, only some men are fucking assholes, we call them gays..."
"The reason why feminism is eating in on itself is because a lot of the people who want in on it don't fully understand it. There are multiple kinds of feminism but the one that is portrayed in particular in mainstream discourse is the kind that seeksnout 'superior' traits in 'femininity'. I think the more healthy kind of feminism is to attack and dismantle the idea of gender norms and to suggest women have systematically been oppressed as a result of these fictions. 'Masculinity' and 'femininity' should both not be promoted and the mainstream kind of feminism that we hear a lot creates the basis that makes it easy for reactionarries to sink their claws into 'feminism', and thus making it seem like feminism has been dismantled as a whole."
"I am 9 seconds into the video and have seen taylor swift, this is probably just going to be about white feminism isn't it?"
"I think the problem is that the lesson taught by feminism has always been about changing women to be like men.  And there's something to this: for a long time, the person sorting traits into 'masculine' and 'feminism' was a guy.  Like, 'has to spends years of their life looking perfect' er.... woman! 'Gets compliments for doing his job adequately?' men!   So yeah 'pop' feminism is not perfect today and I COMPLETELY agree with your points about the commercialization about feminism.  Yeah even among the things that you said you thought were garbage have some positivist.  Taylor Swift may be a hacktivist taking advantage of the movement, but if some girls listen to her 'girl power' anthems and genuinely believes that women are good, instead of like me growing up hearing 90% of popular music about how all women are awful people, then, there's some good to that."

"I would just like to say that the majority of feminists who voted for Hillary because she was a woman weren't sprouted from the millennials.   Feminism as cancer pervades ALL demographics."
"I might watch all the videos on this channel. Damn good channel. However, I think that you don't always have to 'turn men into women'. Masculinity is an adaptation. Likewise, I often wonder in An essentialist vs  construction is manner if masculinity can be inherently bad. Maybe we just ascribe morality to it, and it's just inherently meaningless."

"ps criticism is okay, but shaming is not helpful, ya know like for example fat-shaming that is actually causing fat people to get even fatter even though many fat-shaming people insist that they do it to help fat people lose weight  just sayin"
"Y'know, I'm pretty sure your ideas are garbage. But you seem open minded and your production value is really high, and I like to expose myself to ideas I don't agree with. So I'll sub. Now, what about establishment feminism? That is to say, NOW, Women's Studies departments, the Duluth Model, etc. In gaining systemic power, doesn't feminism have to abandon the luxury of being an amorphous blob with no real definition? It no longer needs a definition, because now it has a description. Instead of looking at feminism as a pile of discrete people, it is a set of systems, and we can examine those systems in much the same way that feminism examines other systems. And when we do, we find them wanting."

"EXACTLY! I am a feminist because I support the equality of the sexes. It's as simple as that. I don't care what other people do. Judging feminists because you saw a sexist person identifying as feminist is like judging a vegan because you saw a vegan eat a steak."

"'There's a misogynistic strain in some feminism that hates femininity and wants women to be more like me.'   Sounds kind of like Rhonda Rousey to me."
"i seriously love you"
"I think criticisms of wealthy feminist culture are for sure a good thing, but ultimately Pop Feminism gets people on board with thinking about the more complicated ideas that they never would've been open to because they're afraid of deviating from the 'status quo.' It drives me nuts that the parts of feminism many of these YouTubers like to complain about is just rando trivial nonsense like a tumblr post made by someone who's probably fifteen. At least you're interested in critiquing the classism that sadly plagues all movements, gay rights movements, trans rights movements, feminism, movements for racial equality. It's refreshing that there's a channel out there that's not afraid to address nuance and at the same time stand up against hateful youtubers that make a career out of spreading misinformation."

"know what trope is really played out?  The 'ugh, this topic is so droll, I need alcohol to make this video!' gag."
"I dunno if you were joking or not about the 'Making men more like women' comment. I assume you were because of your sense of humor, but regardless...  My stance is that we have no business trying to make people go against their nature. Some people are inclined to be more feminine others more masculine, and some people ride a line somewhere in the middle...we should let people be people provided of course that they don't then go on to try and force others to change their nature."

"Have you looked at any of Christina Hoff Summers videos from The Factual Feminist?"
"+ContraPoints I am not sure if this question is improper, but... is your gender-bending political/philosophical in nature, or a fun thing to play around with, or a representation of dismay that you were not born female balanced by a feeling of inability to properly emulate womanhood and a recognition of an unfulfillable desire for a girlhood you'll never have, or part of an early transition, or a way to weed out people who have difficulty accepting non-rigid gendered behavior, or...? I've been curious for a while. As always, loved the video, even as someone who appreciates the existence of the man-babies who press back stupidly against the other side of the stupidity (and sometimes miss)."

"ShoeonHead sent me here."
"Why's is this... dude, trying to dress like a chick? It just isn't working."
"Did you talk about your transition on Youtube? I haven't seen your face in years!"
"So in one of your last videos you gave an example of checking out some woman, which is normal. You said things in 5 ways of seeing made sense, which is fair. But why  does that make you a feminist and just not someone who agrees that staring is rude, and that media could stand to be more inclusive....why the fuck do you need a movement in todays world to push along that point or to have that conversation?   I don't usually use labels that associate me with a movement I consider 95% absolute shit so it confuses me that you adopt it. And feminism was always supposed to be a movement that represents Egalitarian ideology specific to women as an oppressed class  - not the ideology itself. Women are no longer oppressed, so all of these little social nuances should be separated from this oppressed victim narrative which is ironically distracting from the issues by creating a sort of gender/race war.   The word feminism at this point is a linguistic rape victim. Rape culture iz reel."
"I think you should reconsider the premise of criticizing your own side of the fence.  Criticism within a feminist framework could really help start actually defining what the True Scottish Feminist actually is. It's one thing to swing away at 'the patriarchy', but even the TERF & SWERF overtly bigoted political lesbians do that. The anti-fem side of the fence tends to categorize into fairly self-explanatory groups that all tend to have independent motivations for their general opposition towards feminism as a whole (eg: MRAs vs MGTOWs vs PUAs). Where as feminism seems comfortable in being this nebulous apparent monolith where no individual component seems to feel any need to brand themselves as anything more specific than 'feminist'. So... to criticize it, we have to either invent a new word to try and describe it, or attack the monolith.  I'm kinda intrigued to know where the limit is. At what point 'reverse' sexism is 'harmless' or 'understandable' and at what point it becomes worth fighting just like any other feminist cause."
"You need to do a booktube episode! I want to hear your take on IJ!"
"It might help if some liberal feminist apologists actually pointed out the good feminists who people should actually be supporting. As far as I can see, there's utterly vacuous Buzzfeed 3rd wave feminism on the one hand, and authoritarian pro-censorship feminism campaigning for restrictions on personal freedom on the other, without much sign of a sane and reasonable feminism in the middle.   To me it looks like the reasonable feminists are a tiny fringe, not much more than a few random individuals who happen to use the feminist label, rather than an actual movement. While actual organised mainstream feminism, from big 3rd wave blogs, to organisations like the European Women's Lobby or Equality Now, are busy pushing hate and bullshit."
"We need more of this kind of thing on the YouTube site."
"yr eyebrows are üëå"
"I pretty much agree with every part of this video except the qualifiers one would need to present an acceptable critique of a certain demographic's ideology. Even if the assumption that a group's viewpoints will mature and gain nuance with age is historically valid, that doesn't necessarily mean that a '49 year old man's' assessment of the situation is invalid. Regardless of the creep factor, much of their criticisms are also aimed at older, mass-marketed people and organizations that hold equally 'youthful' or 'marketable' stances on certain issues. In the end, I think this push-back (which, as someone who watches a handful of the folks that you're taking shots at, is admittedly guilty of blowing some trends or scandals out of proportion) is a necessary element in refining the newest ideological developments into rounded adult mindsets for the future. In any case, I still enjoyed this. Here from shoeonhead. Looking forward to the next one."
"Okay wait, hold up a second here. So you're saying Nick is a queer? When the fuck did this happen?"
"This video is gold."
"Another great video.   Just on the point regarding misogyny in feminist circles, a woman made a video not too long ago about lena dun am and her bullshit white liberal feminism and said something along the lines of  '' These women aren't interested in actually dismantling any sort of exiting toxic patriarchy, they just want to become the new pigs. They want to become the men that they say oppress them and hate them. You want to bully men and be the top dog and have the ability to treat men like scumbags because that makes you feel good. ''   This was in regards to '' feminists '' like Amy Schemer, Lena Dunam etc etc and it ties into what you were saying about misogynistic traits you see in feminism and the comment about '' wanting to turn women into men ''   her video. she's awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnPFHo-CWcU"
"Loved the video. Though I will say that, even though I don't identify as a feminist, it's hard to disagree with it's foundation. I remember when we read Simone de Beauvoir in university, I didn't find it very difficult to agree with her philosophical statements, such as the fact that a naturalistic argument can't be used to justify oppression of one group by another(such as women being on average physically weaker than men, meaning then that they are inferior by definition, and shouldn't be able to do what they want for example), which is absolutely true that it can't.  While I somewhat agree with you that there's more people speaking out against the retarded parts of the ideology on the internet, I still feel like it's socially unacceptable in the more public arenas of life to have reservations against modern feminism. I can't tell you how many times I've personally experienced people conflating my criticism of feminism with actual hatred of women, and this is true of literally any ideology frankly, it happens when I criticize Islam as well for being theocratic and imperialistic; people assume I am talking about Habib working an Uber, and that I hate his brown skin(Even though this is a complete non-sequitur, as Islam is a religion that is multi-ethnic).  I mean, everyone has some ideological narrative in their head in some way or another, but it seems to me that some people are vastly more emotionally invested than others, and it really stifles honest debate."
"Whoa, Delaware has a turnpike?"
"Problematics - grrr. :)Good points."
"So you admit that 95% of feminism is shit? You're not making a very good case for feminism, are you?"
"1. You called me old - fuck you. 2. I know it was a joke, but I get the feeling you actually hate men. 3. You make valid arguments and are funny - upvoted as usual. 4. I hope you keep your videos coming.  There aren't many people with your talent who are both skeptical and lean to the feminist side of these arguments. 5. As a middle aged skeptic, I shame bad ideas (especially those of college students) because an echo chamber doesn't help anyone.  There's nothing wrong with the exchange of ideas - even if it devolves into a flame war.  I think the best way to develop a strong foundation of thought is to argue with a willingness to accept new information."

"I think I made the mistake of criticizing feminism and other things a bit too muchc and a bunch of people thought I was 'one of those' and a lot of them have been really disappointed lately. Oh well."
"Great video, mate :)"
"Nihilism and Hedonism in happy union. The only truly view that is actually reconcilable with the facts. Cheers"
"Regarding Taylor Swift; isn't the whole point of feminism (the good parts anyway), and other anti-prejudice movements, that gender, or race or nationality or whatever, are stupid criteria for judging the appropriate level of esteem and respect to give someone, _not_ that there aren't any legitimate criteria by which to do that? So wouldn't the women and minorities who are especially talented, hard working, or conscientious* rising to the top, and useless lazy twats of both genders and all backgrounds sinking to the bottom be exactly what these movements are hoping to see?  *Whether Taylor Swift represents an actual example of this, will be left as an exercise for the reader."
"I'm more interested in seeing whether or not you have any criticism to offer to big feminist movements/groups like NOW."
"I never really got that 'Bossy' video.  It was a bunch of successful powerful high achieving women who said they got called 'Bossy' with an implication that it somehow hindered them.  Sort of like MJ saying in a video saying he was bullied early while playing basketball and it held him back from breaking the glass ceiling it set for him in the sport.  Surely its an argument to call more women bossy not less......"
"Excellent assessment of this situation. I don't think we necessarily need to convert everybody to feminism, but we can at least try and make them not angry about it."
"Why do you have Anita framed?"
"fuckin june"
"It might be there ironically or it might be an inside joke on this channel that I don't get, but i would take your differentiation of 'junk food' feminism and important feminism more seriously if you did not have a framed portrait of someone in the top 1% of the 90% of shit feminism right there behind you."
"Nick, can you please do a make up tutorial? :)"
"I was recently brought toward your video and I have to say they are greats"
"Evan Williams!"
"I was glad to see the title 'Pop Feminism' because that's exactly the phrase I used in one of my videos: it does seem to be a very useful label. However, I would say that this type of feminism is not so much a distraction as it is mainstream: it's these types of claims and complaints that currently have the most clout in politics, colleges, and daily interactions."
"dude, i never leave a comment on anything. But I Have love the video."
"Another interesting video, Contra! I'm a little iffy on your interpretations of ban bossy and stuff like that because I think at least the idea behind it is to go against the aspects of our society that close out and/or unfairly limit women. It's not saying that women should be more like men but instead that if women want to be in the competitive business world that we should stop with the internally sexist thinking that keeps them out of it. The operative word being want. Not every woman wants to be a CEO but for those who do, it's imperative that sexist thinking be eliminated so that they can be taken seriously and judged on their merits as a businessperson.  The way you read the ban bossy campaign I feel was a bit shallow and you only touched on aspects like the corporatization of feminism that I think are much more damaging to the movement and ironically even though I just spent the last paragraph defending ban bossy, it's emblematic of that corporatization."
"You managed to encompass the entire meaning of life in the last two minutes of this video. *That's* philosophy that's worth paying attention to.  ...except for the part about Caligula being shit.   It's a wonderful film about love, loyalty and family.   It also stars Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, *Sir* John Gielgud and Peter Fuckin' O'Toole.  How can anyone not love Peter Fuckin' O'Toole?  Plus it was written by Gore Vidal! How could a movie with that kind of talent be anything but great?"
"I respectfully disagree. A lot of this video gives off the vibe of desperately needing to read over one of my favorite feminist comics; http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/09/doesnt-affect-you-oppression/ I'm always wary of the IAFB statements that feminism is good but certain feminist causes are just juvenile bullshit (usually a degradation of Tumblr is invoked) because it's a very non-intersectional way to approach a feminist cause. We all have our privilege blind spots; we all lack lived experiences others have had with a certain problems; who is anyone to arbitrate which feminist causes are 'the important ones'? This is especially true with your reference to Ban Bossy. In a perfect world, bossy would exclusively mean someone who is inflexible and inconsiderate of anyone else's needs or opinions and this trait would be universally and equally maligned amongst anyone of any demographic. But I constantly hear from women in management positions that they are criticized for being 'bossy' even when displaying less dominance than their white male counterparts, essentially just because their subordinates are uncomfortable being told what to do by someone they hold privilege over. I agree part of feminism is making the workplace more accommodating to femininity, but advocating ONLY doing this ignores women that chose to be more masculine in the workplace of their own volition. Or women like me who have stereotypically male attributes like assertiveness but consider those traits incidental or even a facet of their genders. I intend to be a boss; wouldn't it be a problem if the people who are supposed to listen to me undermine my authority by using language that implies me doing my job is a bad thing? How my gender impacts my effectiveness at a specific position seems like a pretty important feminist issue to me."
"This reminded me that Ryan Adams did an entire cover album of 1989.  The whole album... Evan Williams is a nice choice.  Heaven Hill Distillery makes some great bourbons.  Elijah Craig is a favorite."
"Dude, your makeup game is getting better!"
"its not random feminists.. its feminist leaders saying and doing bigoted things. Men sure as hell didnt pass a man spreading law that resulted in thousands of arrests. You know most of those are probably not gross cases. Feminism does nothing about the legal bias against men in custody battles or divorce cases or the sentencing discount women receive. It concentrates on non issues like mythical pay gaps and fabricated rape epidemics."
"*Fab.* The only thing I have a minor scuffle is the bossy thing.  From my own experience at least, I would argue they've got a point - assertive women are often branded as being rude/bitchy/bossy when they speak up for themselves.  The comments about women in leadership roles often relate back to some flaw in their personality, and sometimes therefore they are often taken less seriously, possibly having damaging consequences career-prospects wise.  However, we should be advertising the fight against gender stereotypes as 'don't consider  women bossy if you would't consider it the same for a man', rather than reclaiming it as if a dislikeable personality is something we should aspire to.  But that's just me out in the sun with my pseudo-intellectual magnifying glass frying up minor and irrelevant points like ants.  *Great video.  Keep up the good work.*"
"I like this video, but here's the thing:  your argument that everything is shit is a bit weak. The movements that I associate with have leaders that make active efforts to improve, listen to opposing arguments, and generally not be terrible. More importantly, as much as people might rag on the highest-grossing movies, I actually like a lot of them, and the same goes for most of the stuff you mentioned, including highly-subscribed youtubers.  The key here is that your leaders - not 95% of your movement, but your leaders - are shit. The tweet you quote comes from an account with 644K followers, and as I scrolled down the timeline to see user engagement I saw more likes on every single tweet than views on your video (and minimum retweets X3 your upvotes). Let's not even get into 644k versus 5452 subs...  Face it, the leaders of your movement in the media, in the press, and in government, as well as celebrity leaders, are all what you would describe as shit. Moreover, they're using the movement to push all kinds of bad laws, bad policy, and anti-male sentiment all over the place. So why stay in the movement, continue to legitimize it, and defend it? Sure, not all feminists are fat man-haters, but the ones that are are extremely powerful in the movement and get a lot of media play, while also pushing all kinds of ideas about 'fat-shaming' and 'body-shaming' directly into the national consciousness.   So what is your response to that? If I thought that my leaders were terrible, I'd leave my movement even though I agreed with a lot of the principles. And while I don't fully agree with everything they do or think they're 100% non-shady, I do think they're pretty solid and more importantly, as my goal in this movement is to push back against SJW regressivism, I think that they do a great job of that. The quoted goal of feminism is -equality- (though maybe you've got your own personal definition?) and yet your leaders work directly against that by attacking men and men's rights. So do you not want equality or some type of equivalent system? Do you just want women to gain more rights, despite them arguably having advantages over men in a ton of ways in our modern society? What's the point of sticking with such an incredibly toxic and unwilling to listen or change type of movement?   (p.s.: I actually really do enjoy it though. You've got a good style. I don't think the jokes land 100% but I don't think they're meant to either, a lot more fun than funny)"
"Ok, why are you dressed like a chick? Is that an inside joke?"
"Came here because Shoe0nHead tweeted about and glad I watched. There's a few feminists I follow that aren't perpetually outraged and want the world to be a better place. Sometimes I wonder if I should say to them 'I think we need to take back the term feminist'. It's gotten a bad rap and I think it can still do some good in the world."
"This is an awesome video.  I definitely agree that lots of 'pop feminism' has stolen the spotlight away from real discussions about the genuine political goals of feminist activists and academics, and I totally think that most antifeminist youtubers deliberately pick on the easiest targets within feminism (such as celebrity feminists saying stupid shit and tumblr feminists being sexist) in order to make legitimizing their worldviews easier.  As usual, excellent points all around."
"I'm a straight man, but you make me question my sexuality. I feel like coating my shoulders in mayonnaise."
"I love your videos, you became an artsy Zinnia Jones haha (meant to be a compliment)"
"Goddamnit, Nyk. Makeup's on point."
"i love caligula"
"I think the theme of this video could be summed up as 'Of course feminism sucks, it went mainstream.' But that's the point of those us on the anti-SJW side of things, isn't it? If feminism IS the dominant culture (as it would appear to be if the corporations support it) and not the counter-culture then it has to take responsibility for that whether individual feminists want it to or not."
"Whoa holy shit a They Live reference! I love They Live! Everyone should love They Live!"
"Would love to have you on the show ^_^"
"No, ContraPoints (I know you're joking, btw) we should make women into men in mindset, especially. I'm a Dane and I love my Danish women, because they are not¬†littered with¬†American victim¬†feminism as opposed to our¬†brother/sister nation Sweden <--- They eat everything up that comes from America, even social issues that has nothing to do with them. They have a BLM movement For fu....Anyway, look up Roosh V and his book about Denmark women. I'm proud of that.. and I'm an anti-feminist. Also, look up the 'Denmark Sweden feminism' debate on youtube."
"So I just finished watching all your videos and having learned about your academic history - specifically your history with philosophy - I have to point out something. I was recently asked by an anti-SJW to point to a single 'non crazy third wave feminist.'   It made me think....why don't we see these shitlords on YT going after someone like Judith Butler? She's a prominent feminist of the modern era, isn't she? I wonder if her language would just be too complicated for them. It is for me. I find it all interesting but understanding it? Fitting of someone influenced by Lacan, I suppose.  But as a feminist and ex-philosopher, do you read Ms. Butler?"
"Holy crap, that Bob Dylan bit was hilarious AND spot-on! Do more Bob Dylan covers  And yeah, feminism shouldn't be trying to turn women into men with vaginas, it should be trying to balance out this stupid world with feminine traits like caring and not looking at softness as weakness"
"Pretty entertaining video.  I'll subscribe and keep watching."
"Muahahahahha i understand your strategy Contra...  1. First you lure le rationals in with feminist critique. They will think your kewl¬†and rational.  2.Then when you have a sizeable audience, you go back to your gender studies (need to be suspended) videos and start hypnotyzing/brainwashing, everyone.  3. You now have your own army of totally not free thinkers.  4. profit"
"I go out of my way to read bad feminism from the past as it makes me feel better about bad feminism today. If the second wave was able to accomplish a lot despite all the weird psycho-analysis, political lesbianism, vulgur marxism, trans-phobia etc then we should be fine."
"3:58 Was that the Red Spectre, like from goddamn 1907?  ... Right on."
"Glad I'm not the only one who feels like this. As a cis-white-hetero-upper class male who enjoys 4chan humor and YouTube, but also considers himself to be a feminist, I generally tend to feel a little lost. For now I've found the best result involves not getting to invested in the petty internet stuff and sticking to the more rigorous academic stuff, but maybe that's just it's own form of junkfood escapism. Idk. Good video though. Really liked this one."
"I wonder who the new Justin Bieber is. Who do these middle aged men castigate the kids these days for listening to? I would say Carly Rae Jepsen but she's cool now.   Also you don't fool me, posing like that during the patron credits. You sly downward dog."
"Rekt feminist videos seems to be creating more people that legitimately think that all feminists are fat ugly man haters.  It's sad."
"3:11 looks like all i need to totally rekt you, GG fellow human but it seems you have failed."
"You're best video within the rebirth of the ContraPoints channel imo  it is silly how 'BIG' YouTuber's , for the most part, live under the illusion that they've got something different and important to say, when in reality , it's all one big domino effect , spastic monkey circle jerk. Oooh, Michael Keaton said multiculturalism is a burden on humanity, but he's Batman , HE CAN'T SAY THAT!!! You wake up the next day and everyone's jumped on the CLICK bandwagon with your subscription box filled with the same garbage that everyone's pretending to care about, full knowing that a week from now no one's going to fucking care. No longer creating content one desires, but lost in the process of searching for that desire that's forever lost. I suppose it gets lost because everyone is so caught up in what everyone else is doing, saying, and thinking, (and what's getting views) that they can no longer think for themselves.They'll just submit and see that said person got 2.1 M views , this person got 3.5 M views, so they're inclined to talk about it too whether they want to or not. I'm slowly, very slowly , warming up to the idea that YouTube is a job for some people, as absurd as it is in my prehistoric train of thought, I suppose at this point it's a reality."

"Anarcha-Feminism FTW"
"Good job on the new profile pic."
"Something I heard a more thoughtful anti-feminist say is that anyone can call themselves a feminist. I think this is a very valid point. It's an ideology, but one that covers such a broad range of ideas. The dictionary definition of feminism is 'the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.' In theory nearly everyone agrees with this idea, but there are such differing opinions about what equality entails. It just so happens that the feminism that is most visible is the pop-culture oriented, liberal bourgeois kind that appeals to the 1st world middle class millennial demographic."
"ahahahhahahah, that Bob Dylan"
"Fuck, this was one of your most entertainingly brilliant takes on feminism yet! Being a feminist myself it's often hard to self-criticize without giving power to all the idiots who have taken a rather strident stand against practically anything that has to do with feminism.  And I mean _idiots_ in the most endearing way, because sometimes I can see their point, but it's often weighed down with some very faux unnecessary hatred attached to it.  But yeah, all and all the bigger an idea the more hampered it can be due to its own success, which is just the natural state of things, to be honest. Lastly, it's a topic that is potentially a never ending well of conflict, because no matter what you do, they'll always be a contention worth fighting for or opposing.  Anyways, great video and all that jazz."
"I am kind of glad this wasn't some diatribe about how pop music misrepresents women or something. That's kinda what I was afraid it would be based on the title."

"The creepiness that comes from seeing an older guy criticize a younger girl fades away for me when the most vocal of the younger folks tend to avoid acknowledging that what they're championing ('safe' spaces, draconian anti-bullying measures) often crossesthe line between free speech and policed speech.  I think that principle overtakes creepiness in this situation.  Also, I'm anxiously awaiting a response text from you.  :("

"No, I am pretty much positive that the whole of feminism is shit and we should not play 'true feminist' games like you just did in the video."
"The teen feminists and early twentysomethings on tumblr and Twitter are still young and figuring themselves out politically and culturally. In time, they'll mature and realise that a lot of the feminism they espoused at the time was rubbish, eventually gravitating towards feminism that's constructive and intelligent in its aims, means, and analysis.  But the thirtysomething men who devote endless hours to attacking youth/pop feminism? Maturation seems to be beyond their capabilities. They're like the real-life version of Comic Book Guy talking down to little kids, only even more creepy."

"4:50 That¬¥s when a trans dresser calls creepy the fixation some men have on women¬¥s interest.  What you do in this video is a bit like a christian saying 'yes, there are a lot of stupid things about christianity, but have you looked at all the good work the catholic church does? the stupid things just obscure that'; without adressing none of the ideological points of feminist theory.  The good work some feminist do, do not validate the ideological framework."
"Everyone is the hero of their own story, so it disturbs people when others do not live their lives in the same way they live theirs. If only everyone could think and be like me the world would be a perfect place."
"Why do you call yourself a feminist then? why do you think is important? really curious, not judging. I've read a lot of feminism from different branches and sources and concluded that is so diverse and so shitty so often, that it no longer means anything and it would be pointless for me to identify with it. Isn't it the point of identifying yourself with a label to summarize your views to people in a way? I feel that is easier for me to explain what I believe on each feminist issue than to claim i'm a feminist. I also would like to know which is your definition of feminism, since the definition feminists have these days is so vague that almost anyone could identify with it, despite holding misogynist views: 'If you believe in equal rights for men and woman then ur a feminist!!'. They make it look like it's so easy, so un-radical, just to have more people on their side. But then you read their articles about cultural appropiation, intersectionalism, mainsplaining, ageism... and it's clear that they are not welcoming of all the people that only think men and women should have equal rights, they are far more picky."
"If feminism is growing so big that everyone wants to get in on it, why are the numbers of women in the US and UK that identify as feminist at such low numbers? In this case, I think you are mistaking being feminist with being gynocentric."
